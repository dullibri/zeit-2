HEADLINE: East St. Louis Levees Fail Test

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The five levees that protect the metropolitan area of East St. Louis, Ill., from the Mississippi River do not meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency's standards for flood protection and will be removed from maps that the agency publishes to record flood vulnerability, government officials said yesterday. 
 The risk of the levees' failure is low, said Col. Lewis F. Setliff II, commander of the St. Louis District of the Army Corps of Engineers. But their inability to meet the standards means that the flood maps will no longer show their presence. Instead, the area will be judged as if it is in an unprotected flood plain, officials said, and that in turn can have a powerful effect on housing costs, economic development and insurance rates.
 The assessment of those five levees is part of a nationwide effort to update flood maps, incorporating lessons learned from the flooding brought by Hurricane Katrina, said Terry Reuss Fell, regional chief of FEMA's floodplain management and insurance branch. 
 ''We really want to make sure that our maps properly identify risk,'' Ms. Fell said. ''The fact is there are public safety concerns that people need to be aware of.''
 She said the process of creating the new maps would take ''about a year, maybe more,'' and noted that people who bought flood insurance in the meantime would be able to lock in lower rates that go with presumed levee protection.
 The 70-year-old East St. Louis levees are high enough to meet the standard of holding back a one-in-100 flood, Colonel Setliff said. But, he said, they fail the tests that the corps has been using since Hurricane Katrina that measure seepage of water underneath the earthwork. Such seepage can undermine stability.
 The levees need repair and upgraded features like relief wells, which intercept the seepage, before they can meet the FEMA standards. The money for that work would have to come from Congress, Colonel Setliff said. 
 Robert Betts, the city manager of East St. Louis, said it was disturbing to learn ''that our entire city could end up in a flood zone.'' His city, Mr. Betts said, is struggling with a faltering economy and is working on economic development projects, and so ''this is a very, very serious concern to the people of East St. Louis.''

HEADLINE: Ranch House Made Over: From Modest to Modernist

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
SIX years ago, Greg Lemke, a scientist in La Jolla, Calif., took a close look at his modest 40-year-old house and realized, he said, ''that the basic structure -- plumbing, drains, wiring, roof, furnace -- was starting to fall apart.'' Mr. Lemke, an architecture buff, figured that while fixing all those things, he should try to turn the ordinary ranch house into something more distinguished.
 Mr. Lemke's job at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies exposes him to great architecture every day. Salk's campus was designed by Louis Kahn, with a layout intended to facilitate discussions between peers. According to Mr. Lemke, a developmental neurobiologist, after the institute's design proved ''hugely successful'' at fostering professional interaction, ''the open plan became the model for pretty much all working biology labs around the world.''
 Scientists like proof, and Salk proves that a building's design can change the way individuals and organizations function. 
 But Mr. Lemke's house did not seem to have the potential to become an architectural masterpiece. Built in 1961 with stucco walls, a tarpaper-and-gravel roof and wood-framed windows, it was an ordinary box amid hundreds of ordinary boxes.
 Puzzled about what to do, Mr. Lemke attended a show at New York's Museum of Modern Art about the German-American architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, famous for the dictum ''Less is more.'' The last house in the exhibition was a modest suburban dwelling that Mies designed before he was forced to leave Germany in 1937. Mr. Lemke zeroed in on the name of the building: the Lemke House. The coincidence of their names -- or was it a sign? -- inspired him to try for something that could someday be part of an architecture exhibition.
 Mies died in 1969, but Mr. Lemke found his intellectual heir in Jennifer Luce, a San Diego architect known for her spare designs. But Ms. Luce's brand of minimalism, about as cerebral as Mr. Lemke's scientific research, is not easily achieved.
 After their first meeting, Ms. Luce asked Mr. Lemke to create a work, in any medium, that would reveal his sensibility. ''The idea was to really get to know how he thinks,'' said Ms. Luce. As Mr. Lemke recalls it, ''Jennifer auditioned me as a client.''
 Mr. Lemke, a lover of classical music (and an amateur composer), made a tape of several of his favorite fugues, including one by Shostakovich. 
 The fugue, Ms. Luce realized, is about variation on a theme. With a basic structure in place, the composer can go off in unexpected, sometimes even whimsical, directions.
 With that realization, Ms. Luce came up with the idea of building a spine down the middle of the house, as a kind of structure from which she could explore architectural variations. The spine contains storage for everything from clothes to music to Mr. Lemke's research notes. Its doors are a mosaic of weathered zinc, hot rolled steel and lacquered wood. 
 The kitchen is another gray and white composition, its surfaces giving no hint of what is behind them. ''When you open a drawer, it might be spoons, it might be the refrigerator, it might be the dishwasher,'' said Mr. Lemke, a 51-year-old bachelor. ''There's a feeling of discovery, which, as a scientist, I like.'' Mr. Lemke, who keeps his head shaved, also enjoys the building's clean, spare design. ''My mind is going off in a million directions, and I need a place that's calm,'' he said.
 Mr. Lemke was born in Ohio; his father was a railroad lineman who built the family's house, instilling in him ''an appreciation for things done right.'' The future professor trained at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena before moving to La Jolla. He bought his house in 1997, for a fraction of its current value. And while the building itself was ordinary, its setting was not: Because it is at the very top of Mount Soledad, La Jolla's highest peak, it has views not only to the west, over the ocean, but to the east and north as well.
 Before she could install her minimalist interior, Ms. Luce had to supervise reconstruction of the roof and drain pipes, among other unglamorous tasks. Given all that necessary but invisible work, it was a struggle to complete the project for $450,000, she said. 
 Explaining the price tag, Ms. Luce said she essentially built a new house for a fraction of the price of other new houses in La Jolla.
 To keep the renovation on budget, Ms. Luce, born in Montreal and educated in Ottawa and Boston, avoided nonessentials. The separate kitchen, dining and living rooms became one flowing space (with the kitchen cabinets on a single wall), and the original three bedrooms were reduced to two. She kept the two bathrooms where they were -- even installing new fixtures where the old ones had been, meaning pipes did not have to be moved -- ''a way to really save on plumbing costs,'' she said.
 She explored inexpensive finishes. The floor is the original concrete slab, ground down and covered with epoxy. Where an interior beam was required in place of walls she had removed, Ms. Luce used wood covered in aluminum rather than steel. Countertops are honeycomb polycarbonate, an inexpensive material that is both luminous and soft to the touch. The resulting surface, Ms. Luce said admiringly, ''is almost not there.'' 
 Ms. Luce, who calls her firm Luce et Studio, was also able to economize by ordering windows and doors from Fleetwood, a company in Corona, Calif., that creates custom-size metal frames at what she called ''a very reasonable cost.'' Her Fleetwood order included a pair of windows 8 feet wide by 7 feet tall, which she modified with pivot hardware. 
 When the two doors, one in front and one in back, are open, the house feels like a breezeway. And even when they are closed, the large openings allow light to splash against the grays and whites of the interior. Light, said Ms. Luce, ''is really the best tool for creating architecture here in California.'' 
 When the house won an award from the San Diego chapter of the American Institute of Architects earlier this year, jurors lauded Mr. Lemke -- and Ms. Luce -- for keeping the building, rather than tearing it down and starting over. They ''created a wonderful modern living environment without sacrificing or destroying a vintage California ranch home,'' said James Richard, a Phoenix architect and one of the jurors.
 Mr. Lemke said that some people find the house unusual, ''but the overwhelming response is, 'This is so cool.' '' The personalized design, he added, does not mean he assumes he will always be single. ''I think it's a house a couple could live in,'' he said.
 Of course, he may eventually sell the house, though not to shut the door on modern architecture. ''If I ever have more money,'' he said, ''I might do a house with Jennifer that's even more dramatic.''

HEADLINE: Bidders Wanted. Preservationists Preferred.

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

 BODY:
FOX ISLAND, N.Y.
 How much would you pay for an island of your own?
 The island is not set in a tropical locale with sandy beaches and endless blue sky. No cabana boy will fetch a frothy drink decorated with a little umbrella. Rather, this island is in northern Lake Ontario near the St. Lawrence River, where real umbrellas -- and snow gear -- are essential for cold months.
 It is undeveloped except for a rustic eight-bedroom lodge and a few outbuildings, 263 acres of trails, hunting grounds and wildlife habitats. Tomorrow it goes on the auction block, with bidding expected to start at $1 million. 
 The property, named Fox Island, is part of the Thousand Islands region, and a short boat trip from the quaint town of Cape Vincent. Though the area has some luxury homes, many modest cottages and trailers dot the lakeshore, serving as weekend getaways for the middle class from Syracuse, Watertown and Canadian outposts across the nearby border.
 A group of developers bought Fox Island in 2003 for $900,000 with the intention of building a few upscale homes. But one of the owners, Jerome J. LaLonde, said the island's serenity persuaded them to drop the plans. ''There's a mystique about it,'' he said. ''We didn't want to be the ones to break it up.''
 Mr. LaLonde, 62, and his two partners instead kept the island as a hunting and fishing retreat. But they used it so seldom -- only a few weeks out of the year, he said -- that they decided to sell, hoping the buyer will leave it as they have: undisturbed.
 Fox Island is steeped in state history. Horace White bought the island in 1905, about five years before he served as governor of New York. He helped turn Fox Island into a duck-hunting retreat by persuading the state to turn over to him a large duck marsh just offshore.
 The island became a favorite haunt of politicians and state leaders. Elon R. Brown, a former State Senate leader who was a co-owner of the island, died there in 1922 of an apparent heart attack.
 There have been four owners in the last century, including Mr. LaLonde's group. ''I grew up fishing around the island as a kid,'' said Mr. LaLonde, who is from the nearby town of Clayton, but now lives primarily in Virginia. ''The hunting and fishing there is renowned.''
 The auction, by Woltz and Associates, a Virginia-based company, will take place at the island's lodge tomorrow. Once the land is sold, a 40-piece collection of antique furnishings bought from the furniture maker Gustav Stickley will be on the block. 
 Since news of the sale broke, Timothy D. Maloney, the island's longtime caretaker, has been helping to ready the property and keeping track of the scuttlebutt about who might buy it.
 Mr. Maloney, 48, who also works as an engineer and is the mayor of Cape Vincent, said that he had spotted many small planes and helicopters flying over the land with prospective buyers, and that on weekends boats had been full of potential bidders. 
 ''I'm apprehensive,'' Mr. Maloney said. ''I wonder what is going to happen. I've seen other islands develop around here, and this is just a really special place.''
 Jim Woltz, the auctioneer, said that a California-based business manager for a celebrity was among the 100 registered bidders, but that he did not know who the celebrity was. ''Some of the strongest bidders are willing to keep the island as a whole,'' Mr. Woltz said. ''I really, really hope that happens.''
 The charm of Fox Island is not in its vast acreage or economic potential, Mr. Maloney said, but in the way a person can sit on the front porch of the lodge, feel a breeze from the west and know a storm is coming. Or the way the lights on the second floor are bright enough against the darkened sky to mark the way home for boaters returning from a late fishing trip. The herons like to call out in the morning, and a herd of white-tailed deer has become brazen enough to graze near the main house.
 Foxes are on the island, too -- hence the name -- and, of course, ducks. Many of them are stuffed and mounted in the lodge. Lately, glossy brochures and posters touting the property's amenities have been scattered about too.
 Mr. Maloney keeps his eye on two scrapbooks filled with old correspondence and photographs that document the island's wildlife and flora. 
 ''For someone to really appreciate it, they have to spend some time here,'' he said, adding, ''It's just like any relationship.''

HEADLINE: Keeping Appearances Up, and Costs Down

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
To give the house the look of ''serious'' architecture, Jennifer Luce covered the exterior walls in a stucco that resembles concrete: Santa Barbara Finish from Expo Industries, www.expoindustries.com. But the outside, as redesigned by Ms. Luce, is more window than wall. She ordered metal-framed windows from Fleetwood, a California company that she says is ''very flexible as to size and configuration.'' A window almost as big as a garage door -- 7 by 8 feet -- costs about $5,000. She added pivot hardware from Rixson, www.rixson.com, to create front and back doors that turn 90 degrees without side hinges. 
 Inside, translucence was central to creating flowing spaces. For kitchen countertops, Ms. Luce turned to Bencore (www.bencore.it) for sheets of honeycomb polycarbonate called Lightben, spending about $2,000 altogether. Where she needed translucent glass, she specified that it be etched, rather than sandblasted. (Of the two, she said, etching produces a smoother surface that ''is much more luminous and easier to clean.'') To create a seamless floor surface, she removed wood flooring from the concrete slab, then had the slab ground down and coated in a quarter-inch-thick layer of epoxy. 
 Ms. Luce economized wherever she could. Bathroom walls are covered in inexpensive ''subway'' tiles from Dal-Tile, www.daltile.com. She bought most of the fixtures from LaCava, www.lacava.com. They are, she said, high style and medium priced. Most of the lights are from Modular Lighting Instruments, www.supermodular.com; the ones hanging from the living room ceiling, chosen for ease of movement, are called Nomads. FRED A. BERNSTEIN

HEADLINE: New Orleans Flood Plan Upgrade Urged

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Federal officials outlined plans yesterday for a significant improvement to the New Orleans flood-protection system by 2011, but said the total cost would be more than double the $7.1 billion that Congress has already appropriated for repairs and upgrades.
 By spending an additional $7.6 billion, the Army Corps of Engineers could build higher, tougher floodwalls and gates to seal off waterways like the city's enormous Inner Harbor Navigation Canal from storm surges, officials said. Permanent pumping stations at the mouths of the city's drainage canals would block surging water from Lake Pontchartrain and effectively pump water out of the city during storms as well. 
 The officials said the upgraded system would result in a widespread reduction in water levels should the city be hit by the kind of flood that might have a 1 percent chance of occurring in any year. It would not eliminate flooding, however -- rainwater could still accumulate to two or four feet in some sections of the city -- and very intense storms could still do major damage.
 Karen Durham Aguilera, the corps official in charge of long-term projects for the New Orleans area, called the improvement over the pre-Hurricane Katrina level of protection a ''phenomenal'' advance. 
 ''We were surprised,'' Ms. Aguilera said, ''what a difference it does make when you get the system in place.'' The flooding that would occur, she said, would come from rainwater and not from the catastrophic levee breaches that sent Lake Pontchartrain coursing into the heart of the city after Hurricane Katrina.
 Donald Powell, the head of Gulf Coast reconstruction for the Bush administration, said at a news conference in New Orleans yesterday that ''I don't know of anything more significant'' than the new flood system ''for the long-term viability of the city of New Orleans.'' 
 The remainder of the original $7.1 billion will see the corps through 2008, Mr. Powell said, and President Bush will request the additional $7.6 billion from Congress next year as part of the 2009 budget. ''The corps should not miss a beat'' in the construction process, he said. 
 Maj. Gen. Don T. Riley, the head of civil works for the corps, said the costs rose because the earlier estimates were made in haste and under emergency conditions. Since then, the corps has done extensive research to determine the kinds of storms that could be expected to hit the city and the level of protection necessary to meet the weather challenge, General Riley said, and to more accurately estimate construction costs as well.
 The corps plan includes $1.3 billion in pumping and drainage improvements for the city to further reduce flooding and to ensure that any water that did collect during a hurricane could be pumped out of the city in a matter of hours.
 In a show of progress this week, the corps fired up all of the pumps at the new gates at the mouth of the 17th Street Canal and showed that the full pumping capacity of more than 9,000 cubic feet per second of water had been achieved. The gates project, which would seal off the weak floodwalls of the city's three major drainage canals against a storm surge, has been criticized as a potential source of flooding itself if the pumps cannot push rainwater around the gates and into the lake. 
 Early on, the new pumps were troubled, but Col. Jeffrey A. Bedey, the head of the corps' hurricane protection office in New Orleans, said the pumps were ''rockin'.''
 Building the improved system will require local government to follow the current guidelines for such projects by contributing 35 percent of the costs, Mr. Powell said. But, he added, with an understanding that the crippled local economy might not be able to sustain that kind of payment, ''I think we would be open to options.''
 General Riley said that by letting people and businesses know what to expect from future storms and the barriers in place to protect them, ''They can make their own decisions now about where they live, and how they live.'' 
 Robert G. Bea, a critic of the corps and an author of a 2006 report on the levee failures that was financed by the National Science Foundation, said in an interview that he was skeptical about the ability of the corps to deliver a system that performs as promised, since there are so many uncertainties, like sinking land and rising sea levels, and because so much depends on quality control and maintenance. 
 ''We're getting an overly optimistic picture,'' Mr. Bea said.
 But David Berczek, the corps' program manager for risk and reliability, said that the new risk assessment did include the possibility of failure of some components of the systems. ''I think it kind of shows the realm of the possible,'' Mr. Berczek said.

HEADLINE: Passion for Film Spurs New Festivals, but Grueling Work Keeps Them Going

BYLINE: By S. T. VANAIRSDALE

 BODY:
Lunch hours were the first casualty of Tom O'Malley's ambition. He sacrificed his afternoon breaks sometime last November as he pushed ahead with plans for the inaugural American Cinematic Experience Film Festival. His living room went next, overtaken by piles of paperwork and plastic tubs stuffed with DVD submissions for the event. Then his bank account took a hit. 
 Such is the price of starting a film festival in New York. While hundreds of new independent festivals commence every year around the United States -- some as economic boons for their communities, others as the equivalent of art-house substitutes in small markets -- New York is saturated, with niche events often carved inside other niches. 
 ''We knew we were the new kid in town,'' Mr. O'Malley, 23, said of his festival, which begins its first run tomorrow in Lower Manhattan. ''We were expecting to take our beating in our first year and get respect as time went on.''
 ''But,'' he added, ''we're confident enough in the festival that we think, 'We're going to show them.' '' 
 If the American Cinematic Experience survives, the rewards for aspiring festival curators like Mr. O'Malley and his festival partner, Luke Szczygielski, will likely be years of debt and many more months of 18-hour days. But that doesn't stop a procession of cinephiles, driven by a desire to cultivate the unknown. 
 ''For us, we never wanted to be boosters just for the sake of boosterism,'' said Prerana Reddy, curator of the New York Arab and South Asian Film Festival. ''It's about creating something unique. It's almost an artwork in and of itself -- a social sculpture, as it were, that you're creating. An assemblage of people and ideas and media that are never going to be together again.''
 Mr. O'Malley, a Web designer and an aspiring filmmaker, and Mr. Szczygielski, his film school colleague, conceived the event in part as a response to the ambivalence their own work faced in the festival establishment. New York, they decided, needed a home for modest American independents overlooked by mainstream monoliths like Tribeca and smaller festivals with more thematic or international interests. They envisioned a national, grass-roots call for entries confirming their event's spunky appeal; they would round out the program with short videos solicited from YouTube and MySpace. 
 That was a year ago. Today, Mr. O'Malley estimates, the three-day, 28-film showcase will set them back $15,000. That's after the donation of its setting, the Broad Street Ballroom (staff not included) for a generally slow August weekend, and after factoring in submission fees of $20 to $50 collected from about 200 entries. He had planned on at least three times that many. Tickets are $40 for a one-day pass, $100 for a three-day pass. (Information: acefest.com.)
 For first-time organizers, reality can be dispiriting. The experience demands more than being a film buff, said Jon Fitzgerald, a consultant. ''It starts with understanding your audience,'' said Mr. Fitzgerald, a co-founder of the Slamdance Film Festival who advises as many as 10 start-ups a year through his company, Right Angle Studios. ''I've talked to a number of people who've decided they want to start a festival because they're film aficionados. But it takes more than just a novel idea. I think you really have to be sure that you've got an audience to support the type of programming.'' 
 Determining an audience is especially difficult in New York, a market teeming with options from the art house to the multiplex. Not to mention other festivals; an exact number is difficult to pinpoint, though there are more than 100. But the film marketing site Withoutabox.com functions as filmmakers' entry point for 40 local fests, a 50 percent increase since 2002, according to David Straus, its chief executive. Their success depends as much on timing, geography and singularity as their programs. The Queens International Film Festival, for example, began as a nod to the borough's diversity, featuring sidebars of foreign cinema and food and music from the films' native cultures. 
 For low-budget filmmakers New York festivals allow them to get their passion projects in front of committed moviegoers, all at an average cost of $40 per submission. Genre directors once banished to larger fests' midnight-movie ghettos have flourishing outlets like the NYC Horror Film Festival or the sexually themed CineKink. Foreign-language works reach viewers at Polish, Cuban, Korean, Brazilian and other specialized series. 
 ''Film festivals have replaced the art house as distribution for independent filmmakers,'' said Chris Gore, author of ''The Ultimate Film Festival Survival Guide.'' ''If your movie can work in New York, that's huge.''
 Fledgling festivals must lure filmgoers with the prospect of important premieres and director appearances while promising filmmakers a sophisticated New York audience. The balance became too much for Josh Koury, who this year dissolved his own five-year old Brooklyn Underground Film Festival to concentrate on documentary making and programming at the Hamptons Film Festival. 
 ''If I knew then what I know now, maybe I would have done things differently of course,'' Mr. Koury said, noting the competitive conflict in mid-spring with the larger Brooklyn International Film Festival. ''But I think that's the beauty of film festivals like that. Real, underground, experimental cinema is an idea of do-it-yourself culture and having enough energy and gumption to just jump into something.'' 
 But even the most publicized and best-financed festivals lose money. The Tribeca Film Festival, despite sponsors like American Express and $18 tickets, claims a $1 million operating deficit per year. Festival rookies meanwhile regularly underestimate the costs of insurance, rentals and travel. And the Queens International Film Festival, even with sponsors like Starbucks and JetBlue, and the growth from one location in 2003 to eight in 2006, requires the founder, Marie Castaldo, to cover many expenses out of her own pocket. 
 Those sobering facts do little to dampen Mr. O'Malley's optimism about his festival's chances. ''We want to show people how dedicated we are to this event, and I think that comes through,'' he said, adding, ''People don't even question we're going to be around five years from now.''

HEADLINE: How Can We Best Help Afghanistan?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Good War, Still to Be Won'' (editorial, Aug. 20):
 Afghanistan is the good war. It has an achievable, measurable, sustainable and honorable objective clearly in the interest of the United States: defeat a proven dangerous global enemy, Al Qaeda. 
 As you point out, President Bush failed to put in place the strategies necessary to support the objective: secure early NATO support; focus American resources on the battlefield; interdict opium, a financial asset for the enemy; empower an effective governance and reconstruction plan; and commit the essential regional partners -- Pakistan and Iran -- to the military and ideological standards for the mission. 
 As long as the objective is clear, strategies may be corrected and the war may still be won.
 Iraq is the bad war. It has no objective and too many aimless strategies. The objectives of Operation Iraqi Freedom need to be redefined before rational supporting strategies -- surges or exits -- are adopted.

 To the Editor:
 Your editorial describes the troubles in Afghanistan and the danger of the country falling back into the hands of the Taliban. But after six years of this administration's disastrous detour in Iraq, it seems too late to now properly fight ''the good war.'' 
 If our politicians ever find the courage to get our troops out of Iraq, there will be no will to send them to Afghanistan. Sadly, Afghanistan will simply be one more disaster that President Bush and his company of incompetents can add to their long list of blunders. 
 Theodore S. Voelker 
 Copake, N.Y., Aug. 20, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 I'm concerned that your Aug. 20 editorial about American mistakes in Afghanistan tends to blur the definition of winning. You say that ''the battle against Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies is still winnable,'' and I agree. That battle had better be winnable, and we had better figure out how to win it.
 But I am doubtful that the broader battle under the heading of nation building -- that is, development aid in support of an effective central government -- is winnable in the usual sense of the term. 
 It isn't our battle to win. Our leaders aren't wise enough to know what policies are required, and our institutions aren't efficient and disciplined enough to carry out gargantuan operational policies effectively in a culture so different from our own. 
 Thinking that we have the answers and the means to carry out the answers may be the ultimate form of arrogance. 
 It isn't just a matter of improving Washington's performance. We have to have realistic objectives and a realistic assessment of the resources available for meeting those objectives.

 The writer, as a member of an interagency team from the offices of the inspectors general of the State and Defense Departments, was an author of a 2006 report on the training and readiness of the Afghan national police.
 To the Editor:
 You are correct -- we cannot let Afghanistan slide. We need to refocus and determine realistic goals regarding Afghanistan. 
 To invade a contained Iraq -- not a supporter of Al Qaeda -- was a strategic misstep. The war unleashed new terrorists, exposes service members and others to unneeded danger, and may make it harder to prevent an even larger conflict.
 We must develop solid withdrawal and post-withdrawal plans, then withdraw from Iraq. Our presence inflames. We can intercede from bases outside, if warranted. This would show the world we are not occupiers. 
 We bear responsibility for the Iraq mess and cannot just walk away. But we want our valuable and dedicated service members to be employed properly and with due care. Rick Loeffler 
 Waukesha, Wis., Aug. 20, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 The Taliban in Afghanistan will not be defeated militarily -- not with punishing air power and its too frequent errant attacks, nor with more occupying troops and counterinsurgency units.
 We need a Marshall Plan, without ideological strings, that addresses the desperate need for repaired and new infrastructure, decent jobs as a clear alternative to growing poppies, education and health care for all the people, with armed security limited to protecting this aid package, and a mutually closed border with Pakistan. 
 Only such a plan could possibly counter the Taliban in the hearts and minds of the long-suffering Afghan people. (Rev.) Martin Deppe

 'ERNST LUDWIG KIRCHNER: BERLIN STREET SCENE' There are many reasons to visit this small if delightful collection exhibition at the Neue Galerie on the Upper East Side, not least of which is a chance to acquaint yourself with a new acquisition: Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's ''Berlin Street Scene'' (1913-14), above, bought at auction last November for $38 million. It also happens to be a terrific painting and a high point of early German Expressionism. And the subject matter? It depicts a pair of ladies soliciting customers along a busy Berlin avenue. Their illicit occupation is beyond doubt: their calcium-white faces, rouge lips, feathered hats and fitted gowns are telltale signs, though it is interesting to note that the models for the women in the painting were Erna and Gerda Schilling, sisters and dancers at a Berlin nightclub. 
But what gives the painting its charged and anxious atmosphere is the effect that the two women are having on the men around them. One of them, at far right, turns his head away in disdain, while another, at left, glances longingly out of one eye. Then there is the central figure with his back to us, who is determined to appear unmoved by their presence. Meanwhile, in the background, a No. 15 bus pauses to make a stop at the edge of the crowd. The number is significant, for according to the exhibition catalog the No. 15 streetcar serviced the red-light district in Berlin. (Through Sept. 17, Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, 212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO 
 Museums
 ? AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention. and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RICHARD POUSETTE-DART,' through Sept. 25. The youngest member of the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart (1916-1992) helped break the ice for the movement, only to be omitted from its histories. This show, while too small to make sense of his enormous output, confirms his originality, but also that he did his best work after 1960, when he extended his Ab-Ex origins into an eccentric hybrid of Minimal and Op Art that is alternately hallucinatory and kitschy. His late paintings don't so much hang on the wall as float in front of it, looking like either like planes of granular light or slabs of jeweled stucco. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 ? GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE SHAPES OF SPACE,' through Sept. 5. The Guggenheim takes time off from thematic blockbusters to bring the public up to date on recent acquisitions, provocatively installed by three younger curators among an astute selection of older works from the collection. The theme is space, one of modern art's central concerns. The results are mixed, but cause for optimism. It is not every day you can look at a Mondrian while listening to disco and rap emanating from another kind of grid: the flashing patterns of a digitized dance floor by Piotr Uklanski. The atmosphere can get a bit mall-like at times, but this is what every New York museum needs to do more: play with the collection and find new ways to bring it to life. (See above.) (Smith)
 ? INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did comprises most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman)
 ? INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN-AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, a little too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)
 THE MET: 'HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum's collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: ''The question is not what you look at but what you see.'' Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans's late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore's landscapes and Rachel Harrison's photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show -- only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms -- it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Martha Schwendener)
 * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (See above.) (Smith)
 ? THE MET: 'NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,' through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; John Cederquist's elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) 
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,' through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father (an architect) and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master's from the Maryland Institute College of Art, which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled ''Ripa'' (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine's work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France's difficulties we feel echoes of our own. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,' through Jan. 13. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with ''sacred'' sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole's epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, ''The Course of Empire,'' is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher B. Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro- slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there was another in which slavery was defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historical objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. (See above.) (Edward Rothstein)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'THE DONNER PARTY,' through Sept. 16. Jim Shaw's ''Donner Party'' merges the saga of the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party, westbound settlers trapped in the High Sierras in the winter of 1846 to 1847, with Judy Chicago's benchmark feminist installation ''The Dinner Party.'' The central element is a ring of miniature covered wagons that mimics the dining table in Ms. Chicago's work, with 27 sculptures assembled from items purchased in thrift stores. It may seem like a work based on sick, twisted, juvenile humor (O.K., it is -- but that's Mr. Shaw's allure), yet ''The Donner Party'' also contemplates how myths -- national or, in the case of Ms. Chicago, individual -- are forged and perpetuated, and it serves as a cautionary tale for taking them too seriously. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Schwendener)
 ? P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS,' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject of ''organizing chaos'' is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitiello. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'PETER YOUNG: 1963-1977,' through Sept. 24. This ebullient show retraces the rapid rise of a maverick abstract painter who made it big and then took a pass, leaving town to settle eventually in Bisbee, Ariz. With the dot as his main staple, he worked in an array of styles, mixing Color Field, Minimalism and Process Art as he pleased. There are near-Photo-Realist images of streaming galaxies; luscious motifs derived from folding bare canvas onto painted canvas; chunky necklaces made of acrylic paint; and quirky, geometric line paintings stretched on tree branches. The show is a blast from the past that singes the present. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'MIDNIGHT'S DAYDREAM,' through Oct. 28. The three artists in this show were artists in residence at the Studio Museum of Harlem in the last year, but their work represents very different approaches. Titus Kaphar is the classicist, taking European and American portrait paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries and reconfiguring them into strategic compositions. Wardell Milan II is the archetypal collagist, photographing arrangements of art reproductions, family photos and images cut from magazines. Demetrius Oliver is the Conceptualist, working in the trickster vein of David Hammons and Duchamp. All three, however, actively confront race and (art) history, which often seems a mandate for young black artists. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Schwendener)
 WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbaran's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the piece de resistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RESISTANCE IS ... ,' through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it's smart, engaging and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn't look or feel more apposite. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. (See above.) (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 Galleries: Uptown
 'EMANCIPATORY ACTION: PAULA TROPE AND THE MENINOS' Paula Trope's work with the meninos, children who live in the favelas, or shantytowns, in Rio de Janeiro, is similar to Zana Briski's ''Kids With Cameras'' project, chronicled in the film ''Born Into Brothels.'' Like Ms. Briski, Ms. Trope distributes cameras among the children, but the cameras are rudimentary pinhole devices; and the grainy, blurry photographs, which look as if they were taken with a fisheye lens, are less photojournalism than elements in a larger conceptual project. Influenced by Brazilian art from 1960s and 1970s figures central to Neo-Concretism, Tropicalia and Cinema Novo, Ms. Trope cites ''otherness'' and issues of authorship as central to her project. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, (212) 249-8950, through Sept 1. (Schwendener)
 'OLD SCHOOL' The contemporary painters in ''Old School'' are interested in what might be called the proto-Surrealist sensibility of art made centuries before Freud. Anj Smith, Jakub Julian Ziolkowski and Hilary Harkness work well alongside Brueghel. A painting attributed to the School of Caravaggio serves as a reasonable springboard for grotesque still-life reinterpretations by Glenn Brown and John Currin, and portraits by Elizabeth Peyton and Jan van Noordt, among others. ''Old School'' skips the heavy art history explaining how paintings functioned as religious tracts, sermons on morality and proof of social status. But if you want art history, the Frick is only a block away. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through Aug. 31. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'KOREAN FUNERARY FIGURES: COMPANIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE OTHER WORLD' What makes this somewhat unusual for a show of mortuary art is that the kkoktu, or figures adorning funeral biers, were created for ordinary citizens rather than aristocrats or the wealthy. They're also rather fun and friendly. Brightly painted clowns, acrobats and animals were meant to accompany the dead into the next world, to ease the journey and provide consolation for the mourners. Among the 74 kkoktu are versions of ''The Guide,'' riding an animal, ''The Guard'' who protects the soul from evil spirits, ''The Caregiver'' (generally women) and the ''The Entertainer,'' as well as a replica of a funeral bier modeled on a late 18th-century original from Tongyoung, South Kyongsang Province. The Korea Society, 950 Third Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 759-7525, koreasociety.org, through Nov. 20. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'DOUBLE X-RATED: WHERE THE GIRLS ARE' The ''Double X'' in the title of this all-woman group show, organized by Amelia Abdullahsani, refers to female chromosomes, which clearly do not determine any one art style. Despite a shared realism, goth-subculture portraits by the Stockholm-based Ulrika Minami Warmling are very different from Noel Grunwaldt's beautiful watercolors of dead birds. Katrin Sigurdardottir hides landscapes in boxes; Francesca Gabbiani conjures them up in collages; Joy Garnett continues her project of painting the contemporary political landscape, in this case in images derived from news reports of burning Paris immigrant neighborhoods. Stellan Holm Gallery, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, stellanholm.com, through Sept. 8. (Cotter)
 'SUBSTANCE & SURFACE' This impressively consistent but slyly varied group exhibition takes the modernist monochrome as its not-so-subtle subtext. Nearly everything on view has corners, a single dominating color and adheres to the wall one way or another. The theme is ostensible purity achieved by impure means, including sliced towel, unfurled cassette tape, homemade sandpaper, carpet, painted pebbles and pegboard. This 20th-century staple just keeps keeping on. Bortolami, 510 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Aug. 31. (Smith)
 Galleries: Other
 MARTIN CREED: 'FEELINGS' Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of beanbag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an antigravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)
 SOL LEWITT: 'DRAWING SERIES ...' If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)
 Public Art
 MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct,'' and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Genocchio)

 ? THE MET: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART' Every six months or so the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge of the department, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710; metmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
 ? 'NEOINTEGRITY' Everybody knows that artists make the best exhibition curators. They have great eyes, highly personal interests, enthusiasms, opinions and social circles packed with a surprising variety of other artists, including many not on the establishment radar. There are lots of surprises in this summer extravaganza organized by the painter Keith Mayerson, beginning with its size: 190 artists displayed in a space approximately the size of a small one-bedroom apartment. Some of the names are well known (Ross Bleckner, Jane Freilicher, Dana Schutz), others may be new (Chris Bogia, Matt Boruso, Andrew Madrid); all are integral to Mr. Mayerson's vision of a Muchness Sublime. Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com, closes on Friday. (Cotter)
 1950S-1960S KINETIC ABSTRACTION Like many things invented in the 1950s and 1960s, the work in ''Kinetic Abstraction,'' organized by the German collector Erika Hoffmann, probably seemed like the wave of the future when it was made. You can detect this, to some extent, in Heinz Mack's and Julio Le Parc's panels with shifting layers of glass, plastic and metal, Gerhard von Graevenitz's slowly revolving disc with aluminum pieces that shift like tiny wind vanes, Jean Tinguely's plywood ''painting'' with rectangles that move like clock hands. The works are literally restless, shifting, rejecting stasis. Several look like game boards and call to mind Marcel Duchamp's ''Rotoreliefs.'' But where Duchamp miraculously avoided becoming dated, there's something poignantly anachronistic about these works. Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com, closes on Friday. (Schwendener)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'SURVEY OF PARIS ABSTRACTIONS' Early in his career, Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) received a Guggenheim Fellowship and went to Paris, where he was introduced to Brancusi a few days after arriving. For five weeks in 1927, Noguchi served as Brancusi's apprentice. Afterward, he set up his own studio in Gentilly, outside of Paris, where he created the 30 gouaches, or opaque watercolors, and six of the sculptures on view here. Brancusi's influence on Noguchi is obvious in works like ''Globular,'' from 1928, an abstract brass sculpture that looks so much like a Brancusi that out of this context it would probably be mistaken for one. But a selection of works from the 1920s to the 1980s shows how the lessons from this period continued to inform Noguchi throughout his career. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org, closes on Sunday. 
 (Schwendener)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE' Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org, closes on Sunday. (Martha Schwendener)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN' In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein's brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, closes on Monday. (Kimmelman)
 PETER YOUNG: FOLDED MANDALA & OAXACAN PAINTINGS Complementing the larger survey of the artist's work at P.S. 1, this exhibition presents 10 brightly colored works from two additional series dating from 1972 to 1980: one of densely dotted mandalas, the other of spatially intricate grids. In both cases Mr. Young's debt to non-Western art is evident, and honored. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, closes on Saturday. (Smith)

HEADLINE: A 'Mini-Boston' on a Small Slice of Coast

BYLINE: By JEFF SCHLEGEL

 BODY:
NEW Hampshire's sliver of coastline is often overlooked when it comes to seaside New England. It doesn't have the cachet of Cape Cod or the craggy mystique of Maine's rocky roar. And in a state known for its mountains (and residents as taciturn as those mountains), the thought of frolicking along its 18 miles of coast doesn't quite square with popular perceptions.
 ''When I told people I'm moving to New Hampshire, they think I'm going to Dartmouth,'' said Michael Megliola, a former bond trader turned software engineer, joking about his recent move from Bedford Village, N.Y., to Portsmouth. Before that, his family had spent weekends the previous three summers at their second home in nearby Rye, N.H. ''The seacoast doesn't fit the mental picture of a seasonal resort area.''
 The seacoast real estate market stretches from Seabrook in the south up to the town of York, Me. In between are the Hamptons, Rye and New Castle, as well as the regional hub, Portsmouth. The terrain includes a mix of sheltered coves, salt marshes and beaches, and the atmosphere ranges from the cultured urban flavor of Portsmouth to the sunburned honky-tonk of Hampton Beach. 
 The allure of oceanfront property with a salty New England feel and nearness to fall leaf peeping in the interior hills make the region appealing for second-home buyers -- along with Portsmouth itself, and its stew of arty cool, Colonial architecture and good restaurants, ranging from hearty basics at the Rusty Hammer to Asian and Southwestern fusion at the Green Monkey. 
 Mr. Megliola and his wife, Danielle, liked their getaway condo in Rye but felt the pull to move to the area full time. ''I have three boys, ages 3 to 8, and we couldn't get them to go home after long weekends,'' Mr. Megliola said. ''They'd say, 'Why don't we live here?' ''
 The Megliolas paid $1 million for a 3,200-square-foot modern Cape-style house in Portsmouth. It sits on a sheltered inlet with direct access to the ocean, and they launch their kayaks from a shared dock. ''Portsmouth is a little city with a dense downtown, where there are a lot of arts and things to do,'' Mr. Megliola said.
 The Scene
 Residents describe Portsmouth as a mini-Boston. The city's historical section is loaded with Cape- and Colonial-style buildings from the 18th century, and the commercial focal point is Market Square, where the tall white steeple atop the North Church is the town landmark. The streets radiating from the square bustle with shops, galleries, cafes and restaurants like the Portsmouth Brewery, which bills itself as New Hampshire's original brewpub. 
 Portsmouth has traditionally been a working port with a strong military presence. Pease Air Force Base closed in 1991 but was redeveloped into a commercial zone that is home to high-tech companies that have helped boost the local economy and real estate prices. And the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which actually sits across the harbor in Maine, remains an economic anchor.
 Nearby, at the mouth of the Piscataqua River, separating New Hampshire from Maine, is New Castle, which calls itself New Hampshire's tiniest town, at 0.8 square miles. Spread across one large island and several smaller ones, it is home to Wentworth by the Sea, a hotel and spa that was restored to its turn-of-the-last-century elegance by Marriott. 
 Farther south, in Hampton Beach, the main strip is packed on summer weekends. On one side is the wide, sandy beach; on the other are restaurants, arcades and T-shirt shops, and the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom, where recent acts included Chris Isaak, Deep Purple and the Indigo Girls. ''Hampton has a different feel from Cape Cod because it's a younger crowd,'' said Nancy Moncada, who lives near the Cape in Plymouth, Mass. ''But the atmosphere is changing because a lot more professionals are coming up here.''
 Ms. Moncada, 40, vacationed in Hampton Beach for two weeks every summer while growing up. Her parents eventually bought a place there, and in May she and her partner, Lois Moncada, an insurance broker, bought an 1,800-square-foot, three-bedroom condo for $320,000. The condo is one street over from her parents' place.
 Their home has marsh views and sits on a dead-end street near a dock where they can watch the boats come and go. It offers a peaceful alternative to the frenetic Hampton Beach strip. 
 Life is quieter in Rye, which tends to attract wealthier second-homers. ''I have a stone wall on my property, but I'm close to the ocean,'' said Tom Prophet, a real estate appraiser from Nashua, N.H. ''It's a perfect blend of rural charm and seaside ambience.''
 Mr. Prophet, 48, and his wife, Pamela, bought their 1950s three-bedroom, gambrel-roofed house last summer for $445,000, and they plan to make it their primary residence one day. The outdoor life on the coast appeals to Mr. Prophet, as does Rye's closeness to Boston; Portland, Me.; and the White Mountains.
 Mr. Prophet also appreciates the open space in and around Rye. ''There are enough people around with a Yankee sensibility,'' he said, ''where it's likely to stay that way for a while.''
 Pros
 Boston is an hour away, and the White Mountains a 90-minute drive. Portsmouth's restaurant scene is diverse and growing, as is the region's cultural scene. ''There's a push to enhance the arts and cultural events in the city,'' said Cori McGrath, an agent with Marple & James Real Estate in Portsmouth. And there is no shortage of fresh lobster rolls and fried clams.
 Cons
 Traffic is heavy in summer. ''It takes awhile to get in and out on Friday evenings and Sunday nights,'' Nancy Moncada said. And the ocean is always turn-your-lips-blue cold.
 The Real Estate Market
 The second-home market in Portsmouth is geared toward condos, with one-bedroom units starting in the $300,000 range downtown and rising to as much as $900,000 on the river. ''The new condos blend into the downtown historic section because the Historic District Commission has a tight rein on what can be built,'' Ms. McGrath said. 
 But Portsmouth has its share of detached single-family houses that run from Colonials and Victorians to ranches and Capes from the 1950s and 60s. The market along the rest of the seacoast tilts more toward detached single-family homes, with a lot of contemporary beach-style architecture. Some waterfront properties are priced in the seven figures.
 Taxes on the coast are a mixed bag: New Hampshire's property taxes are higher than Maine's, but New Hampshire doesn't have income or sales taxes. ''For some people, it's a wash whether they live in Maine or New Hampshire,'' said Ann Cummings, an agent with ReMax Coast to Coast Properties in Portsmouth. ''For others, it makes a big difference, so they choose New Hampshire because there is no income tax on their retirement income.''
 LAY OF THE LAND
 POPULATION The seacoast region has approximately 87,600 people, according to 2006 estimates by the Census Bureau. Portsmouth, the largest town, has 20,618.
 SIZENew Hampshire's coast is 18 miles long. The part of southern Maine's coast included in the seacoast real estate market is another 15 miles. Portsmouth itself is 16.8 square miles.
 WHO'S BUYING Buyers range from young families to boomers to retirees, the latter attracted by New Hampshire's lack of sales and income taxes. New buyers come mainly from New England, New Jersey and New York.
 GETTING THERE The region is reached from Interstate 95; several exits give access to the coast. 
 WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING The Sise Inn (40 Court Street, Portsmouth; 877-747-3466; www.siseinn.com) has 34 rooms in a 19th-century Queen Anne home. Rates range from $119 to $279 a night.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention. and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. 
 (Roberta Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RICHARD POUSETTE-DART,' through Sept. 25. The youngest member of the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart (1916-1992) helped break the ice for the movement, only to be omitted from its histories. This show, while too small to make sense of his enormous output, confirms his originality, but also that he did his best work after 1960, when he extended his Ab-Ex origins into an eccentric hybrid of Minimal and Op Art that is alternately hallucinatory and kitschy. His late paintings don't so much hang on the wall as float in front of it, looking like either like planes of granular light or slabs of jeweled stucco. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum's collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: ''The question is not what you look at but what you see.'' Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans's late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore's landscapes and Rachel Harrison's photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. 
 (Martha Schwendener) THE MET: 'NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,' through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,' through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father (an architect) and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master's from the Maryland Institute College of Art, which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled ''Ripa'' (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine's work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France's difficulties we feel echoes of our own. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. 
 (Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Michael Kimmelman)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro- slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there was another in which slavery was defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Edward Rothstein)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS,' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject of ''organizing chaos'' is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitiello. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'PETER YOUNG: 1963-1977,' through Sept. 24. This ebullient show retraces the rapid rise of a maverick abstract painter who made it big and then took a pass, leaving town to settle eventually in Bisbee, Ariz. With the dot as his main staple, he worked in an array of styles, mixing Color Field, Minimalism and Process Art as he pleased. There are near-Photo-Realist images of streaming galaxies; luscious motifs derived from folding bare canvas onto painted canvas; chunky necklaces made of acrylic paint; and quirky line paintings stretched on tree branches. The show is a blast from the past that singes the present. (See above.) (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
 Galleries: Uptown
 'EMANCIPATORY ACTION: PAULA TROPE AND THE MENINOS' Paula Trope's work with the meninos, children who live in the favelas, or shantytowns, in Rio de Janeiro, is similar to Zana Briski's ''Kids With Cameras'' project, chronicled in the film ''Born Into Brothels.'' Like Ms. Briski, Ms. Trope distributes cameras among the children, but the cameras are rudimentary pinhole devices; and the grainy, blurry photographs, which look as if they were taken with a fisheye lens, are less photojournalism than elements in a larger conceptual project. Influenced by Brazilian art from 1960s and 1970s figures central to Neo-Concretism, Tropicalia and Cinema Novo, Ms. Trope cites ''otherness'' and issues of authorship as central to her project. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, (212) 249-8950, through Sept 1. (Schwendener)
 'OLD SCHOOL' The contemporary painters in ''Old School'' are interested in what might be called the proto-Surrealist sensibility of art made centuries before Freud. Anj Smith, Jakub Julian Ziolkowski and Hilary Harkness work well alongside Brueghel. A painting attributed to the School of Caravaggio serves as a reasonable springboard for grotesque still-life reinterpretations by Glenn Brown and John Currin, and portraits by Elizabeth Peyton and Jan van Noordt, among others. ''Old School'' skips the heavy art history explaining how paintings functioned as religious tracts, sermons on morality and proof of social status. But if you want art history, the Frick is only a block away. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through Aug. 31. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'KOREAN FUNERARY FIGURES: COMPANIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE OTHER WORLD' What makes this somewhat unusual for a show of mortuary art is that the kkoktu, or figures adorning funeral biers, were created for ordinary citizens rather than aristocrats or the wealthy. They're also rather fun and friendly. Brightly painted clowns, acrobats and animals were meant to accompany the dead into the next world, to ease the journey and provide consolation for the mourners. Among the 74 kkoktu are versions of ''The Guide,'' riding an animal, ''The Guard'' who protects the soul from evil spirits, ''The Caregiver'' (generally women) and the ''The Entertainer,'' as well as a replica of a funeral bier modeled on a late 18th-century original from Tongyoung, South Kyongsang Province. The Korea Society, 950 Third Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 759-7525, koreasociety.org, through Nov. 20.

 Galleries: Chelsea
 'DOUBLE X-RATED: WHERE THE GIRLS ARE' The ''Double X'' in the title of this all-woman group show, organized by Amelia Abdullahsani, refers to female chromosomes, which clearly do not determine any one art style. Despite a shared realism, goth-subculture portraits by the Stockholm-based Ulrika Minami Warmling are very different from Noel Grunwaldt's beautiful watercolors of dead birds. Katrin Sigurdardottir hides landscapes in boxes; Francesca Gabbiani conjures them up in collages; Joy Garnett continues her project of painting the contemporary political landscape, in this case in images derived from news reports of burning Paris immigrant neighborhoods. Stellan Holm Gallery, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, stellanholm.com, through Sept. 8. (Cotter)
 'SUBSTANCE & SURFACE' This impressively consistent but slyly varied group exhibition takes the modernist monochrome as its not-so-subtle subtext. Nearly everything on view has corners, a single dominating color and adheres to the wall one way or another. The theme is ostensible purity achieved by impure means, including sliced towel, unfurled cassette tape, homemade sandpaper, carpet, painted pebbles and pegboard. This 20th-century staple just keeps keeping on. Bortolami, 510 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Aug. 31. (Smith)
 Galleries: Other
 MARTIN CREED: 'FEELINGS' Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of beanbag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an antigravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)
 SOL LEWITT: 'DRAWING SERIES ...' If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)
 Last Chance
 THE MET: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART' Every six months or so the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge of the department, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710; metmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
 'NEOINTEGRITY' Everybody knows that artists make the best exhibition curators. They have great eyes, highly personal interests, enthusiasms, opinions and social circles packed with a surprising variety of other artists, including many not on the establishment radar. There are lots of surprises in this summer extravaganza organized by the painter Keith Mayerson, beginning with its size: 190 artists displayed in a space approximately the size of a small one-bedroom apartment. Some of the names are well known (Ross Bleckner, Jane Freilicher, Dana Schutz), others may be new (Chris Bogia, Matt Boruso, Andrew Madrid); all are integral to Mr. Mayerson's vision of a Muchness Sublime. Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com, closes today. (Cotter)
 1950S-1960S KINETIC ABSTRACTION Like many things invented in the 1950s and 1960s, the work in ''Kinetic Abstraction,'' organized by the German collector Erika Hoffmann, probably seemed like the wave of the future when it was made. You can detect this, to some extent, in Heinz Mack's and Julio Le Parc's panels with shifting layers of glass, plastic and metal, Gerhard von Graevenitz's slowly revolving disc with aluminum pieces that shift like tiny wind vanes, Jean Tinguely's plywood ''painting'' with rectangles that move like clock hands. The works are literally restless, shifting, rejecting stasis. Several look like game boards and call to mind Marcel Duchamp's ''Rotoreliefs.'' But where Duchamp miraculously avoided becoming dated, there's something poignantly anachronistic about these works. Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com, closes today. (Schwendener)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'SURVEY OF PARIS ABSTRACTIONS' Early in his career, Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) received a Guggenheim Fellowship and went to Paris, where he was introduced to Brancusi a few days after arriving. For five weeks in 1927, Noguchi served as Brancusi's apprentice. Afterward, he set up his own studio in Gentilly, outside of Paris, where he created the 30 gouaches, or opaque watercolors, and six of the sculptures on view here. Brancusi's influence on Noguchi is obvious in works like ''Globular,'' from 1928, an abstract brass sculpture that looks so much like a Brancusi that out of this context it would probably be mistaken for one. But a selection of works from the 1920s to the 1980s shows how the lessons from this period continued to inform Noguchi throughout his career. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org, closes on Sunday. (Schwendener)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE' Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org, closes on Sunday. (Schwendener)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN' In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein's brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, closes on Monday. (Kimmelman)
 PETER YOUNG: FOLDED MANDALA & OAXACAN PAINTINGS Complementing the larger survey of the artist's work at P.S. 1, this exhibition presents 10 brightly colored works from two additional series dating from 1972 to 1980: one of densely dotted mandalas, the other of spatially intricate grids. In both cases Mr. Young's debt to non-Western art is evident, and honored. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, closes tomorrow. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Analysts Cut Expectations For Growth

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
The financial turmoil that began with the seemingly narrow meltdown in subprime mortgages is now forcing both policy makers and Wall Street analysts to scale back their expectations for growth in the overall economy.
 Most economists still predict continued economic growth for the rest of the year and into 2008, but many are trimming their forecasts and warning that even their somewhat darker views could be too rosy.
 Global Insight, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass., on Thursday predicted that growth would be markedly slower for the third quarter of this year, and it reduced its forecast for all of 2007 to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent. 
 ''The economic outlook has dimmed,'' wrote Nigel Gault, group managing director of North American economic research at Global Insight. Citing tightening credit and a ''continuing drumbeat of bad news on housing'' as well as high oil prices and slower growth in productivity, he also scaled back his forecast for growth in 2008.
 In Washington, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued a comparatively optimistic forecast on Thursday, cautiously predicting that the turmoil in markets would not derail economic growth. Even so, the Congressional agency trimmed its previous forecast for growth this year to 2.1 percent, from 2.3 percent, and it warned the uncertainties were higher than normal.
 ''I wouldn't say we're sanguine,'' Peter R. Orszag, director of the agency, said in an interview. ''The situation is very cloudy and uncertain. But the most likely economic scenario is continued solid growth.'' 
 As for the federal budget, the agency predicted the deficit would decline this year to $158 billion, its lowest level since 2002. But it reiterated past warnings that the long-term budget path is ''unsustainable.'' 
 If President Bush's tax cuts are extended indefinitely beyond their planned expiration in 2010, and Congress continues to protect most taxpayers against increases in the alternative minimum tax, the budget office estimated, over the next 10 years government revenue would fall $3.4 trillion short of the baseline forecast and deficits would return to more than $200 billion a year.
 The White House put out a statement after the budget office released its new estimates celebrating the decline in the budget deficit. ''It shows that our government is on a path to meeting the goal I set forth of putting the budget into surplus by 2012,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Balancing the budget requires keeping the economy strong, keeping tax rates low, and keeping spending in check.''
 The Congressional Budget Office forecast was notably sunnier than those elsewhere.
 ''This is one of the greatest panics I've seen in 55 years in financial services,'' Angelo R. Mozilo, chief executive of Countrywide Financial, the nation's biggest mortgage lender, said in an interview on CNBC. 
 He predicted that the housing crisis would lead to a recession. ''I just don't see a light here at the moment,'' he told CNBC. ''I can't believe when you're having this level of delinquencies -- equity is gone, the tide has gone out -- that this doesn't have material effect on the psyche of the American people and eventually on their wallets.''
 Most Wall Street forecasters are not anywhere near being that gloomy, cautioning against panic. But they are less optimistic than the Congressional forecasters.
 On Wednesday, Citigroup issued a new forecast suggesting growth would fall short of its earlier estimates. And economists at Goldman Sachs, who had already reduced their forecast to 1.9 percent two weeks ago, warned on Thursday that the housing market was probably overpriced by more than 15 percent. 
 Where the budget office predicted on Thursday that the economy would pick up speed early next year and expand by 2.9 percent during 2008, many private sector analysts said they see growth of less than 2.5 percent next year, with some going lower.
 ''I would trim back my forecast to 2 percent at best for next year, maybe 1.9 percent,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. ''I'd still call this a soft landing, but we're barely above the treetops.'' 
 Before the financial downturn, the Federal Reserve had been carefully trying to engineer a so-called soft landing for the economy, in which growth would slow enough to reduce inflationary pressures without greatly increasing joblessness.
 Economic growth has in fact slowed this year, with unemployment still low at 4.6 percent.
 Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told Congress in July that the economy seemed poised for ''moderate'' growth of about 2.5 percent this year and a slightly faster expansion in 2008. Despite the steep downturn in residential home construction, Mr. Bernanke predicted, rising employment and wages would lead to continued growth in consumer spending and rising exports would stoke more business investment.
 Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Citigroup, cautioned against ''going overboard'' about the fallout from the housing market, noting that corporations were still fairly flush with cash and have strong balance sheets that should enable them to keep investing.
 But in trimming back its growth forecast for the United States as well as Europe and Japan, Citigroup warned that the turmoil in credit markets had greatly increased the uncertainty of any predictions. ''Ongoing dislocation in money markets has the potential to impair economic activity and any forecast of solid expansion is dependent upon a timely restoration of normal money market conditions,'' Citigroup's economists said.
 And even after markets stabilize, they said, investors will demand greater premiums for taking on the added risks of commercial loans and mortgages.

HEADLINE: A Bit of Paradise on Island No. 999

BYLINE: By LOUISE TUTELIAN

 BODY:
CINDY LOZO walked through her new stone and cedar-shake house and onto a sun porch filled with white wicker, blue paisley cushions and floor-to-ceiling windows. ''This is the view that made me agree to live on an island,'' she said. Outside, antique mahogany Lyman boats cruised along the sparkling deep-blue expanse of the St. Lawrence River. Upstream, a stone structure resembling the biggest drip sand castle ever constructed stood against the horizon. And rising from the water in several directions were chunks of land sprouting beech, pine or poplar trees -- a half-dozen of the famous Thousand Islands.
 Mrs. Lozo, 52, a school employee in Rochester, didn't even know how to pilot a boat when her husband, Bob, 50, who works for an information services company, convinced her that their summer home should be on an island. Now they spend every weekend with their three daughters at their newly built 4,400-square-foot, five-bedroom house on Wauwinet Island, a one-acre member of the Thousand Islands chain. The house offers every amenity a landlubber could want, including an oversize television set and Internet access. Their 28-foot Sea Ray and 19-foot Chaparral boats are tied up at their dock. And Mrs. Lozo can now operate them. 
 In the Gilded Age, ''the River'' -- the part of the St. Lawrence between northern New York and Canada that is dotted with about 1,800 closely spaced islands of all shapes and sizes, was a summer destination to enormously rich families, many of whom came by train from New York City. The homeowners included George Boldt, a hotelier; Frederick Bourne, president of the Singer Sewing Machine Company; Andrew McNally of Rand McNally maps; George Pullman, creator of Pullman railroad cars; and Nathan and Isidor Straus, owners of Macy's. Singer and Boldt built castles, complete with turrets and underground passageways. Boldt's (the one that resembles a sand castle) even has a drawbridge. 
 Some wealthy vacationers also spent time aboard their houseboats, floating mansions that could reach 100 feet long. La Duchesse, built for George Boldt in 1904, had a formal dining room, a piano and three fireplaces aboard. 
 Large hotels and guesthouses also catered to well-off visitors. Promotional literature for one advised, ''Just bring your trunks and servants.'' Thousand Island dressing was created at a local hotel, some say. It was Boldt who introduced it to the wider world by instructing his maitre d'hotel at the Waldorf to put it on the hotel menu.
 Some mansions still exist along a stretch of the river dubbed Millionaire's Row. But by 1940, the wealthy families were gone. The area remained a vacationland for families of lesser means, mostly from upstate New York, but economic activity declined. 
 Now the direction is upward again. Word has gotten out about the majestic scenery and still affordable second homes in the Thousand Islands, bringing buyers from around the country, local real estate agents say, who pay $250,000 to more than $1 million for a piece of real estate along the river -- or in it, on the islands themselves. 
 The Thousand Islands region, about 340 miles northwest of New York City, begins at Kingston, Ontario, where the St. Lawrence arises from Lake Ontario, and extends about 40 miles downstream. Its honky-tonk heart is Alexandria Bay, N.Y. (''A-Bay'' to the locals), which has seven bars on a two-block stretch. Other towns are more sedate. Clayton, N.Y., has a restored opera house and an Antique Boat Museum where visitors can tour La Duchesse. 
 The international boundary runs down the middle of the river, and often the only way to tell if an island house is American or Canadian is to look at the flag flying outside. Gary DeYoung, director of tourism for the Thousand Islands International Tourism Council, estimated the year-round population along both sides of the river and on its islands at 175,000, with about 15,000 additional summer residents. 
 Housing varies widely. ''You can have a dumpy trailer next to a home with granite countertops and a custom library,'' said Melanie Curley of Thousand Islands Realty in Clayton. ''It takes some getting used to.'' Summer homes may be tiny cottages, small Victorian houses, rustic ranches, splendid 100-year-old stone manses with original woodwork or large shingled homes on bluffs overlooking the river. Two condominium developments are in the works. 
 The Lozos' house cost ''under a million dollars,'' Mr. Lozo said, including the extra 10 to 25 percent of construction costs that builders typically charge to build on an island. ''I would do it again in a minute,'' he added. The Lozos snorkel in the river, explore the local towns and wave at the tour boats and motorboats. Cargo-carrying behemoths bearing Liberian, Greek and Panamanian registry also ply the river, an international trade route. ''I love to watch the tankers,'' Mrs. Lozo said.
 In some places, the river's glorious past lives right alongside its present. In 2006 Tracy Gensler and her husband, Howard, bought a two-bedroom, two-bath condominium in the remodeled Swiss Chalet, originally a guesthouse built on Wellesley Island by George Boldt in 1895. The Genslers, whose main home is in Chevy Chase, Md., had been looking in Bethany Beach, Del., but ''everything was two and three million, or a teardown and a rebuild, and there was no view,'' Mrs. Gensler said. They paid $285,000 for their 1,300-square-foot unit right on the St. Lawrence. A string of fishing-lure party lights now adorns their kitchen cabinets, and framed vintage sepia-toned photographs of the Chalet hang on the walls. 
 Mrs. Gensler, 44, a freelance health writer, arrives on Wellesley Island with the couple's daughters, Harper, 11, and Libby, 10, just after school ends in June and stays until the day before school starts again in the fall. Mr. Gensler, 42, a software consultant, joins them on weekends and for three vacation weeks. Wired for work, Mrs. Gensler often totes her laptop and cellphone to the water's edge while the girls swim or go tubing and waterskiing with friends. 
 Summertime temperatures routinely reach the mid-70s to 80. The river is cool -- the water reaches 72 degrees by mid-August -- but the girls never miss a dip. ''So far,'' their mother said, ''I haven't had an entire day when we didn't go in the water.'' Libby has 7 swimsuits; Harper has 12. 
 Bradlee and Chad Roffers of Sarasota, Fla., bought a house last year on 17-acre Summerland Island. Mrs. Roffers vacationed in the area as a child and wanted her two daughters, Stella, 21 months, and Eloise, 6 months, to have the same experience. Their five-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath home, built in 1912, cost them less than a million dollars and came with a three-slip boathouse and antique furnishings. A pair of vintage wooden water skis is mounted on one wall. 
 ''This property in the Hamptons, Rhode Island or the Vineyard would be $2 million,'' said Mr. Roffers, 35, president of SKY Sotheby's International Realty in Sarasota. For substantially less, he said, ''you get this, and much less pretense as well.'' 
 Those who dream of an island all to themselves can still make that wish come true, provided they also have deep pockets. At noon today, 263-acre Fox Island, near Cape Vincent, goes up for auction. The island has six miles of shoreline, an eight-bedroom lodge filled with Stickley furniture, a private harbor, a dock and a runway. The suggested starting bid is $1 million. 
 Not everyone wants to haul the garbage off-island in a boat or put off errands because the river is choppy. Most second-home seekers want a mainland waterfront property with deep dockage and a view of the main channel, said Cathy Fiacco-Garlock of Garlock Realty in Alexandria Bay. Houses with those features begin at $500,000, so some developers are offering less-expensive alternatives. 
 Rick Merola, a local speedboat dealer, developed the Harbor Villas in Alexandria Bay and has so far sold 26 two-bedroom condominiums, each built over its own boathouse. Prices begin at $300,000 to $350,000. Linda and Frank Inserra of Copper Mountain, Colo., who have family ties in the Thousand Islands, bought one of the units and plan to use it six weeks in season and rent it out the rest of the summer. Mrs. Inserra, who runs a produce brokerage business, said she believed the project is going to ''kick-start'' Alexandria Bay. 
 About 20 minutes upriver, in sleepy Morristown, N.Y., Jarrett Newby has constructed Dockside Resorts, a development of waterfront condominiums directly across the river from Brockville, Ontario. The river is far narrower at this point, and there are none of those picturesque islands, but the view is completely unobstructed and the tankers still pass by. Each 1,100-square-foot unit comes with two bedrooms, one bath, a fireplace, a marina slip and a carport large enough to fit a boat. The units are on the market for $285,000, and 30 of 36 have been sold. 
 Property values in the Thousand Islands have risen 25 to 30 percent in the past 10 years, according to Ted Weisberg of Garlock Realty. Property taxes are high, at least in the estimation of some longtime homeowners. ''Taxes on a $400,000 home could be $10,000 to $15,000 and up,'' said Mrs. Curley of Thousand Islands Realty.
 The costs have led some owners to sell their homes to a new generation, who seem only too happy to carry on the centuries-old traditions of summer on the River.

HEADLINE: In Britain and U.S., Urgent Steps to Change Mortgage Systems

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER. 
The High & Low Finance column by Floyd Norris, which normally appears on this page, will return next week.

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Susan Whittaker was desperate. Four years ago, she purchased her first apartment in the town of Rochester, less than two hours east of London. But then interest rates started to rise, and the income from the small shop she ran with her partner no longer covered their adjustable-rate mortgage. 
 Facing foreclosure, and determined to avoid moving in with her mother, Ms. Whittaker found a way out in an increasingly popular arrangement here known as a ''sale and rent back.'' 
 A private company bought her home, allowing her to avoid foreclosure; then the company rented the house back to Ms. Whittaker and her partner and they did not even have to move. 
 The catch is that the company paid the couple less than the value of their apartment. 
 Such deals are uncommon in the United States, and mortgage brokers say they discourage them because of the possibility of unscrupulous and dishonest lenders exploiting distressed homeowners. 
 But desperate times call for desperate measures. While Americans fear an epidemic of foreclosures, brought on by the subprime mortgage meltdown, Britain is already suffering one. 
 Foreclosures here are at an eight-year high; lenders have repossessed a record 14,000 properties in 2007, 30 percent more than at the same time last year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. An additional 125,100 households are behind in their mortgage payments. 
 And personal bankruptcies are at an all-time record, caused largely by a crushing increase in mortgage debt. The situation has grown so dire -- as has the threat of desperate homeowners being exploited -- that the newly installed government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown is trying to change the fundamentals of the mortgage system. 
 Whether they can is an open question, especially given Britons' attachment to home ownership, adjustable-rate mortgages and personal debt. British consumers are the most indebted citizens of any Group of 7 nation, and television shows devoted to real estate and debt advice are among the most popular programs in the country.
 ''We live in a society where we encourage people to take on debt, and there is lots of pressure to get your foot on the housing ladder, which has proven quite a fruitful investment for some,'' said Frances Walker of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a debt adviser, in London. 
 Currently, only 5 percent of British home buyers take out fixed-rate mortgages. The norm here is a mortgage with a fixed rate for the first two years, and then a floating rate for the duration of the mortgage.
 But the rate on adjustable mortgages has skyrocketed as the Bank of England ratcheted up interest rates -- five times over the last 12 months to 5.75 percent, their highest level since 2001. 
 Add the rising costs of necessities, like food and utilities, and British homeowners find themselves increasingly squeezed. Real estate experts here say that is why more and more homeowners are turning to the practice of sale and rent back. 
 The mushrooming of the unregulated market has worried regulators and lawmakers concerned that homeowners were giving up their houses for as little as 75 percent of market value, with no guarantee they would be allowed to stay in their former property after six months, the minimum lease period here. 
 Lawmakers are now trying to figure out how to encourage more homeowners to take fixed-rate loans, but that will not help those already facing foreclosure, or prevent the threat of predatory lending. 
 If there is a silver lining in Britain, it is that, unlike in the United States, home prices are still rising, for now, after more than tripling since 1997. Recent interest rate increases have yet to reverse the trend. In fact, the National Housing Federation recently predicted prices would rise 40 percent in the next five years, elevating the average price of a home, which already costs about 11 times the average British salary, to $:302,400, or $618,000. 
 As long as home prices rise, distressed property owners can still sell their home and receive enough money to repay their mortgage debt -- in theory. In reality, selling a property here can take several months, and by the time many owners are facing foreclosure, they often do not have that kind of time. 
 Higher prices may push some prospective buyers out of the market, but others will simply take out larger mortgages. Owning a home is so entrenched in the British psyche that most consumers would rather take on additional debt than rent, even if they can't afford it, say real estate experts. 
 Some debt advisers have warned that higher demand for borrowing could result in an increase in lax lending practices and plunge more people into personal bankruptcy, which in turn could hurt consumer spending and slow economic growth. 
 Recognizing that, Mr. Brown's new government has come up with two initiatives intended to make sure Britain's housing boom does not turn into a bust. The measures aim to build 240,000 homes a year by 2016 to provide more affordable housing, and to encourage lenders to sell more 25-year fixed-rate mortgages.
 Mortgage experts estimate that about two million mortgages will adjust to a higher rate in the next 18 months as their short-term fixed rates expire. 
 Longer-term fixed-rate mortgages would limit the risk of such interest rate increases, but short-term thinking among British borrowers and the lack of an established covered-bond market in Britain has kept fixed-rate mortgages from ever taking off here. 
 The United States mortgage market is financed through capital markets -- hence some of the problems currently buffeting the markets -- but Britain has always been a retail-led mortgage market, financed through bank savings deposits.
 Now Alistair Darling, chancellor of the Exchequer, is studying plans to create a legal framework to allow banks and other lenders to issue covered bonds, and to make them attractive to investors, in order to help lenders create capital pools that would finance longer fixed mortgages. 
 Yet that task could become markedly more difficult now given the current problems with the United States mortgage market. The liberalization of the British mortgage market in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government removed some credit controls, admitting new lenders who offered mortgages with ever more competitive short-term fixed rates. Longer-term fixed-rate mortgages became even more unpopular in the 1990s when interest rates peaked at 15 percent.
 In March, Nationwide, Britain's third-largest mortgage lender after HBOS and Abbey, became the first large lender to offer a 25-year fixed-rate mortgage after government lobbying and a positive development of the yield curve. ''If this deal is ever going to be attractive, now is the time,'' Stuart Bernau, Nationwide's chief executive, said at the time. 
 Some analysts remain skeptical. ''People don't feel comfortable tying themselves in for that long, and they get turned off by the penalties'' of paying off early, said James Cotton, a mortgage adviser at London & Country Mortgages. Early payment fees can reach as much as $:300,000 in Britain.
 But if the government cannot persuade Britons to change their borrowing habits, experts warn that the country may face its own subprime mortgage crisis, as consumers with tarnished credit find that only subprime lenders are willing to work with them. 
 ''That's where the real problems will start, and we could easily see what happened in the U.S. repeated over here, '' said Steve Grail, managing director at Grosvenor Trust & Savings, an independent financial adviser in London. 
 None of this matters to Susan Whittaker. The experience of having to sell her home and rent it back has made any type of loan out of the question. ''We won't get a mortgage again,'' said Ms. Whittaker, speaking on the phone from her Rochester home. ''The whole episode has put us off.''

HEADLINE: Martin Van Buren Slept Here

BYLINE: By KATHRYN MATTHEWS

 BODY:
IN the waning days of summer, the drive through the verdant rolling hills of Columbia County is reason enough for a trip to Kinderhook, one of the oldest Dutch settlements in New York. Through a textured terrain of slate and granite outcroppings, open meadows, trees and wetland, the Taconic Parkway morphs from expressway to country road as it heads north. Take the Spencertown exit and follow Route 203 past cornfields, orchards, grazing cows and a golf course and through the villages of Chatham and Valatie, and Kinderhook awaits -- some 130 miles from Manhattan. 
 In the village center, parts of which are on the National Register of Historic Places, wide streets are lined by stately trees and a mix of grand and modest Colonial, Federal and Victorian houses. Two cannons on the village green commemorate Henry Knox's passing through in the winter of 1775-76, hauling artillery captured at Fort Ticonderoga that would be used to force the British out of Boston. 
 Hudson Street, south of the green, leads past a pretty one-story brick library, and nearby a home in a former store still bears the words ''Flour, Feed, Grain & Seed.'' It's not difficult to imagine Washington Irving walking these streets as a young man; he wrote ''Rip Van Winkle'' while employed by a well-to-do local family as a tutor.
 ''Not much has changed in the village since I grew up here,'' said Jim Dunham, 65, a former mayor of Kinderhook. ''It's still a quiet and quaint place with lots of well-preserved older homes and relatively little commercial development.'' 
 Just the place for a day in the country. 
 The green is transformed on Saturday mornings into a bustling farmers' market with baked goods, jam, milk from the Gumaer Farms nearby, cut flowers and a bounty of late summer produce like tomatoes, corn and turnips. But even on market days, there is plenty of space to park and take a self-guided tour using a brochure available on the Internet.
 Several houses lay claim to places in history. On Broad Street, for example, John Burgoyne, the British general defeated at Saratoga, stayed in the Georgian mansion at No. 24 as a prisoner of war in 1777. Benedict Arnold recovered at No. 28 from wounds received in the same battle. The James Vanderpoel House at No. 16, dating from 1820 and owned by the Columbia County Historical Society, is open to the public in the summer and contains period furniture and art. 
 But Kinderhook's main claim to fame is Martin Van Buren, the eighth president, who talked up his hometown so relentlessly that political colleagues in Albany and Washington called him Old Kinderhook. Van Buren's star has faded, but Kinderhook remembers him, and so does the National Park Service, which operates Lindenwald, his house two miles outside town, as a National Historic Site, carefully restored and open to the public for a surprisingly interesting tour. 
 The catchiest story about Van Buren (though you may not hear it on the house tour) links Old Kinderhook to the all-American expression ''O.K.'' Van Buren cheerfully embraced his nickname, and at some point took to signing letters ''O.K.'' In the 1840 presidential campaign, Van Buren's supporters formed O.K. Clubs and used O.K. as their campaign slogan. Since it was just about at this time that O.K. slipped into the language as an affirmative, it's tempting to connect the two, and many do. The Oxford English Dictionary, however, cites evidence that O.K. was a product of casual early 19th-century spelling and stood for ''oll korrect.''
 Either way, O.K. had staying power as an expression, but the William Henry Harrison campaign's song, ''Tippecanoe and Tyler Too,'' spoiled Van Buren's bid for re-election.
 At Lindenwald, a three-story Federal house with Italianate modifications, rangers describe Van Buren the master politician -- instrumental in developing American party politics and the Democratic Party and in the rise of Andrew Jackson, whom he served as vice president; Van Buren the unlucky president slammed by a national economic collapse almost as soon as he took office; and Van Buren the self-made man and elder statesman who entertained so many dignitaries that the front door of Lindenwald opened directly into a dining room with a table for 20. 
 On the tour, Van Buren emerges as human and likable. He grew up over his father's tavern in Kinderhook, worked hard serving wealthy law clients and eventually was able to buy Lindenwald (coincidentally, the same house where Washington Irving was employed years earlier). He was a family man whose four sons and their assorted wives and children all moved into Lindenwald at various times. When one son was ill with tuberculosis, Van Buren had him moved to an adjoining bedroom so he could care for him. 
 After Van Buren died in 1862, his son John ran into financial troubles and had to sell the house. At one point, Lindenwald was in the hands of the Jerome family (Jennie Jerome would marry an Englishman and become the mother of Winston Churchill). Later the home had lives as a teahouse, a nursing home and an antiques shop before being acquired by the National Park Service, with 22 acres of the original estate, in 1974. 
 Just 200 yards or so north of Lindenwald is a park where well-marked trails widen and narrow, traversing stands of white pine, maple, elm and birch. It's easy and pleasant to hike all four paths. 
 Connie Nooney, 57, a special education teaching assistant and Kinderhook native, recalled regarding Van Buren as a dubious celebrity while she was growing up. ''Unlike Lincoln or Washington, there was no day off or official holiday celebrating Martin Van Buren,'' she said. But after the Park Service refurbished Lindenwald, Kinderhook's pride in its native son returned, and last month, the Friends of Lindenwald, a volunteer group, donated a statue of Old Kinderhook that now sits next to the bandstand on the village green. The Dutch Reformed church he attended and two houses where he worked as a legal apprentice and lawyer are on the village tour.
 Besides the farmers' market, Kinderhook has several small stores: a frame shop whose artist-owner specializes in renderings of local homes, an antiques store that sells country furniture, a rock shop that specializes in polished stones and fossils, a mother-and-daughter-owned bookstore, a health food store and a wine and spirits shop. 
 Two places in the center of town sell light meals: Bagel Tyme serves sandwiches, and the pi Cafe, open for lunch except Mondays and for dinner Thursday through Saturday, offers sandwiches, wraps and soups and casual American fare, like margarita shrimp. There is a picnic spot, too, tucked under the bridge that crosses Kinderhook Creek. And you'll also find a picnic table at Lindenwald.

HEADLINE: Commercial Paper Market Shrinks the Most in Seven Years

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The size of the commercial paper market, a crucial source of short-term financing for businesses, decreased 4.2 percent last week, the biggest drop in at least seven years, as investors fled asset-backed debt and opted for the safety of Treasuries. 
 Short-term debt maturing in 270 days or less fell $90.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $2.04 trillion in the week that ended yesterday, according to the Federal Reserve. Commercial paper outstanding has fallen by $181.3 billion, or more than 8 percent, in two weeks.
 The retreat may indicate that the Fed's decision to lower the discount rate last week failed to instill enough calm to draw back investors. Commercial paper backed by assets led the fall as buyers fled debt linked to subprime mortgages. Outstanding paper may slump by a total of $300 billion, representing the entire amount of the debt backed by home loans, said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak & Company.
 ''The commercial paper market, in terms of the asset-backed commercial paper market, is basically history,'' said William H. Gross, chief investment officer of the bond management firm Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco. 
 Also yesterday, the Federal Reserve said banks borrowed a daily average of $1.2 billion in the past week, swollen by the four biggest lenders who sought to display support for the Fed's discount-rate cut. 
 The decline in outstanding commercial paper was driven by a 6.8 percent fall in asset-backed commercial paper, which represents about half the commercial paper market and has been used to finance purchases of subprime mortgages.
 Banks worldwide have $891 billion at risk because of credit agreements on asset-backed commercial paper programs, Fitch Ratings said.
 The most recent decline is the biggest by percentage since at least November 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 The Fed lowered the interest rate it charges to lend to banks to encourage buyers of commercial paper after the market seized up last week for Countrywide Financial Corporation and other mortgage lenders. Countrywide borrowed its entire $11.5 billion in available bank credit lines in order to fund its operations, although the Bank of America Corporation has agreed to provide $2 billion of new capital through the purchase of preferred securities.
 ''The shrinkage of the commercial paper market will force companies to obtain money elsewhere,'' Mr. Crescenzi, who is based in New York, said in e-mailed comments. ''Some will be unable to obtain funding and will shut or scale back their operations.''

HEADLINE: Remarks on Housing Reverse Early Rally

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks slipped yesterday as investors worried about the economic outlook after the head of the Countrywide Financial Corporation said the housing downturn could create a recession.
 The remarks from Angelo R. Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide, the biggest United States mortgage company, quickly deflated an early rally after news that Bank of America had taken a $2 billion stake in the beleaguered mortgage provider.
 Financial stocks were among those leading declines. The sector bore the brunt of dwindling investor confidence in recent weeks as fallout from the meltdown in subprime mortgages spread to other corners of the credit market. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of financial shares fell 0.5 percent. Shares of Citigroup inched down 0.2 percent to $48.35. JPMorgan Chase declined 0.7 percent to close at $45.67.
 Mr. Mozilo's comments about a tough housing market underscored the need for the Federal Reserve to do more, said Philip J. Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.
 ''The Fed has cut the discount rate and added liquidity to the markets, but those things aren't enough to turn the fundamental market around,'' Mr. Orlando said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average inched down 0.25 of a point to end at 13,235.88. The S.& P. 500-stock index slipped 1.57 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,462.50. The Nasdaq composite index shed 11.10 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,541.70. The Russell 2000 was down 7.93 points, or 0.99 percent, at 790.63.
 Treasury debt prices were mixed, with strong selling in shorter-dated bills as investors unwound recent flight-to-safety bids on speculation that central banks are dealing with the recent credit turmoil.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was trading 1/32 higher in price, at 100 27/32, for a yield of 4.64 percent, down from 4.65 percent on Wednesday.
 Crude settled up 57 cents, to $69.83 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Mr. Mozilo, speaking on CNBC television, said the housing market was ''certainly not getting better'' and could push the economy into a recession. He also said the commercial paper market was not improving.
 Adding to the negative tone was a report in The Financial Times that a private equity-led buyout of the wholesale supply division of the home improvement retailer Home Depot could be in trouble. Home Depot's shares fell 2.2 percent to finish at $34.02.
 Stocks started the day on a positive note after news late Wednesday of Bank of America's investment of $2 billion in Countrywide. Analysts said it would help shore up the mortgage lender's finances as Countrywide struggles with liquidity.
 Last week, Countrywide tapped into an entire $11.5 billion credit line.
 Shares of Countrywide rose 0.9 percent to end at $22.02, after rising as much as 11.1 percent early in the day on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Bank of America shares rose 0.4 percent, to $51.83.
 Apple Inc., down 1.1 percent at $131.07, led declines on the Nasdaq, giving up some of the gains from earlier in the week.
 During the session, trading was lighter than average on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.38 billion shares changing hands. Advancing stocks barely outnumbered declining stocks. But on the Nasdaq, the breadth was decidedly negative, with three stocks falling for every two that rose.

HEADLINE: The Problem Isn't Mr. Maliki

 BODY:
Blaming the prime minister of Iraq, rather than the president of the United States, for the spectacular failure of American policy, is cynical politics, pure and simple. It is neither fair nor helpful in figuring out how to end America's biggest foreign policy fiasco since Vietnam.
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has been catastrophic for Iraq ever since he took over from the equally disastrous Ibrahim al-Jaafari more than a year ago. America helped engineer Mr. Jaafari's removal, only to get Mr. Maliki. That tells you something important about whether this is more than a matter of personalities. Mr. Jaafari, as it happens, was Iraq's first democratically chosen leader under the American-sponsored constitution. 
 Continuing in the Jaafari tradition, Mr. Maliki's government has fashioned Iraqi security forces into an instrument of Shiite domination and revenge, trying to steer American troops away from Shiite militia strongholds and leaving Sunni Arab civilians unprotected from sectarian terrorism. His government's deep sectarian urges have also been evident in the continuing failure to enact legislation to fairly share oil revenues and the persistence of rules that bar much of the Sunni middle class from professional employment. 
 Sectarian fracturing even extends to the electricity grid, where armed groups have seized control of key switching stations and refused to share power with Baghdad and other provinces. 
 The problem is not Mr. Maliki's narrow-mindedness or incompetence. He is the logical product of the system the United States created, one that deliberately empowered the long-persecuted Shiite majority and deliberately marginalized the long-dominant Sunni Arab minority. It was all but sure to produce someone very like Mr. Maliki, a sectarian Shiite far more interested in settling scores than in reconciling all Iraqis to share power in a unified and peaceful democracy. 
 That distinction is enormously significant, since President Bush's current troop buildup is supposed to buy, at the cost of American lives, a period of relative calm for Iraqi politicians to bring about national reconciliation. How much calm it has brought is the subject of debate. But just about everyone in Washington now agrees that Mr. Maliki has made little effort to advance national unity. 
 The most recent intelligence report on Iraq, released yesterday, concludes that Mr. Maliki's government is unable to govern and will become ''more precarious'' over the next six months to a year.
 That is why there can be no serious argument for buying still more time at the cost of still more American lives and an even greater cost for Iraqis. A report by an Iraqi correspondent for The Times earlier this week described the deadly sectarian hatreds that have torn apart life in his home province, Diyala, which is almost equally divided between Sunnis and Shiites. 
 The same day, an Op-Ed article by seven American soldiers serving in Iraq underscored the extent to which American troops have worn out their welcome among Iraqis as social and economic conditions have deteriorated and rampant lawlessness has destroyed the most basic sense of personal security. 
 When it comes to fighting Al Qaeda in Iraq, Washington and Baghdad are often at cross-purposes. In the western province of Al Anbar, the American military has registered some gains by enlisting local Iraqi Sunnis to fight against foreign-led Al Qaeda formations. That strategy depends on the sense of Iraqi nationhood among local Sunnis. But the Maliki government prefers to concentrate on fortifying Shiite political power and exploiting the immense oil reserves of southeast Iraq. It is hard to imagine any Shiite government acting very differently.
 Washington's failure to face these unpleasant realities opens the door to strange and dangerous fantasies, like Mr. Bush's surreal take on the Vietnam war. 
 The real lesson of Vietnam for Iraq is clear enough. America lost that war because a succession of changes in South Vietnamese leadership, many of them inspired by Washington, never produced an effective government in Saigon. None of those changes, beginning with the American-sponsored coup that led to the murder of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963, changed the underlying reality of a South Vietnamese government and army that never won the loyalty and support of large sections of the Vietnamese population. 
 The short-term sequels of American withdrawal from Indochina were brutal, as the immediate sequels of America's withdrawal from Iraq will surely be. But the American people rightly concluded that with no way to win a military victory, there could be no justification for allowing thousands more United States troops to die in Vietnam. Those deaths would not have changed the sequels to the war, just as more American deaths will not change the sequel to the war in Iraq. Once the war in Southeast Asia was over, America's domestic divisions healed, its battered armed forces were rebuilt and the nation was much better positioned to deal with the relentless challenges of global leadership.
 If Mr. Bush, whose decision to inject Vietnam into the debate over Iraq was bizarre, took the time to study the real lessons of Vietnam, he would not be so eager to lead America still deeper into the 21st century quagmire he has created in Iraq. Following his path will not rectify the mistakes of Vietnam, it will simply repeat them.

HEADLINE: Belatedly, Some States Move to Limit Damage From Subprime Lending

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina signed legislation last week that would limit the ability of mortgage brokers to charge customers above-market rates and prepayment penalties and would protect subprime borrowers from highly risky adjustable-rate mortgages.
 Calling the mortgage meltdown a ''wake-up call,'' Mr. Easley said, ''If Washington isn't going to act, the states are.'' 
 But amid his call for action was regret that if only officials in his and other states had acted a couple of years sooner, some of the mortgage problems that have roiled the financial markets and hurt homeowners might have been avoided.
 ''I should have watched this closer; all of us should have on the state level,'' he said in an interview after the signing ceremony in Raleigh. ''We should have looked at our laws closer and made some changes.'' 
 North Carolina is one of about a dozen states that are beginning to make legislative and regulatory changes to protect people who resort to subprime financing. But economists and housing specialists say the actions come too late to benefit most of those at risk of losing their houses.
 With foreclosures expected to rise as adjustable-rate mortgages are reset and the borrowers face higher monthly payments, economists said the steps that states like North Carolina were taking would do more to protect future borrowers than help people already in trouble. 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association reports that 550,000 homeowners with subprime loans began a foreclosure process over the last year, and specialists say that the number could double in the next couple of years. 
 In North Carolina, the number of foreclosure filings increased 6 percent in 2006 from 2005 and that is expected to climb to 10 percent this year, said Christopher Kukla, director of state legislative affairs at the Center for Responsible Lending in Durham. ''We think the worst of it is still yet to come,'' Mr. Kukla said, ''because there are still thousands of adjustable-rate loans out there that still will reset in the next six months to a year.''
 State governments have ample legal powers over the subprime market, but governors, legislators and regulators have been reluctant to intervene. They have limited staffs and financial resources to regulate the large, fragmented market, and they fear doing more harm than good -- like stamping down home-lending money for working-class people or moving it to other states. 
 In some states, officials were hesitant to help bail out people who had made bad decisions for fear this would only encourage more risky borrowing. ''You know that people are not as financially literate as they ought to be,'' Governor Easley said as he signed the new law.
 State governments are beginning to take modest action in part because the federal response has been slow. 
 In Washington, the Federal Reserve recently began urging lenders to toughen subprime loan standards and last month started a pilot project with state regulators to collaborate on supervision and enforcement with subprime lenders.
 The Senate Banking Committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, and other Congressional Democrats are pressing the Bush administration to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy more home loans and have promised to hold hearings to consider action to prevent predatory lending.
 Lawmakers in a handful of states -- including Maine, Minnesota and Ohio -- have passed measures to tighten restrictions on subprime lending. Illinois, New York and Massachusetts have formed task forces and held meetings involving members of the mortgage industry, lenders and consumer representatives to figure out ways to rework problem loans. Minnesota is acquiring some foreclosed properties to resell to low-income people. 
 Several states are considering laws and regulations to make mortgage brokers accountable for allowing borrowers to take on debts they cannot repay.
 In all, legislators in more than 30 states have introduced close to 100 bills intended to stem deceptive-lending practices and foreclosure, some by stiffening criminal penalties.
 Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania have rolled out mortgage programs intended to refinance loans by homeowners at risk, using the proceeds from state bond issues and money from federal lending agencies. Together, the programs amount to about $500 million but are expected to help a relatively small number of people. 
 A $250 million effort by Massachusetts with Fannie Mae, for example, is expected to benefit about 1,000 delinquent borrowers. New York's $100 million program would help an estimated 500 homeowners. 
 Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, said: ''Some states are looking at bond issues and trying to craft programs that involve no direct out-of-pocket costs for the taxpayers. But that's predicated on the premise that the borrower of new loans'' can repay. 
 Ohio initially planned to sell $100 million in taxable municipal bonds in a mortgage-refinancing program intended to help property owners get fixed-rate mortgages on which they could make the payments. But the state cut the program back to $25 million because so many people were already in foreclosure or not eligible for the loans. 
 Mr. Kukla said Ohio had had a degree of success with a law passed last year requiring lenders in subprime deals to document and verify their borrowers' ability to repay. But Ohio remains a subprime-mortgage disaster zone, with the country's highest foreclosure rates after California and Florida.
 The state's Foreclosure Prevention Task Force recently recommended that officials cajole mortgage lenders to help borrowers refinance or readjust their adjustable-rate loans. It called for $50 million in grants to help cities redevelop neighborhoods hardest hit by foreclosures and blighted by abandoned houses. 
 Regulators from several states agreed to tighten the underwriting standards on adjustable-rate mortgages last month, directing lenders in the subprime market to verify a borrower's income, inform them of prepayment charges and stop underwriting loans at initial teaser rates. 
 Their action, coinciding with guidelines announced by the Federal Reserve, attracted little fanfare before the global financial markets' recent sharp fall in the spreading mortgage crisis. Nine states have adopted the rules, and about 20 more pledge to follow suit quickly. But for some borrowers already in trouble, the new guidelines are coming too late and may even hurt.
 ''Tightening underwriting now while these loans are resettling could expedite some foreclosures,'' said John Ryan, executive vice president of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, a leader in developing the new guidance. ''It helps more future customers.''
 Some state governments reacted to predatory lending practices effectively in the late '90s with new regulations, but the rules spurred lenders to design adjustable-rate mortgage plans that came to dominate the subprime market after 2003.
 Most states were left flat-footed until the spring, when foreclosures began to mount as the interest on adjustable-rate mortgages rose three or more percentage points. 
 Economists and mortgage specialists say they think that states will take more action in the fall when legislators return to work, but they predict that progress will continue to be mixed.
 ''You have 50 state regulators, 50 state agencies, 50 state governors looking at a massive market and deciding to tweak it around the edges to make it more fair,'' said Karl E. Case, a Wellesley College economist specializing in real estate. ''That's a very difficult task, particularly in a fragmented market.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 28, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about actions being taken by state governments on subprime lending misidentified the type of bonds that Ohio plans to sell in a mortgage-refinancing program. The bonds are taxable mortgage revenue bonds, not taxable municipal bonds. Also, the article misstated the amount of bonds to be issued. The Ohio Housing Finance Agency says the sale will be based on market demand; the program has not been reduced to $25 million from $100 million.

HEADLINE: Seeking Willie Horton

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
So now Mitt Romney is trying to Willie Hortonize Rudy Giuliani. And thereby hangs a tale -- the tale, in fact, of American politics past and future, and the ultimate reason Karl Rove's vision of a permanent Republican majority was a foolish fantasy.
 Willie Horton, for those who don't remember the 1988 election, was a convict from Massachusetts who committed armed robbery and rape after being released from prison on a weekend furlough program. He was made famous by an attack ad, featuring a menacing mugshot, that played into racial fears. Many believe that the ad played an important role in George H.W. Bush's victory over Michael Dukakis. 
 Now some Republicans are trying to make similar use of the recent murder of three college students in Newark, a crime in which two of the suspects are Hispanic illegal immigrants. Tom Tancredo flew into Newark to accuse the city's leaders of inviting the crime by failing to enforce immigration laws, while Newt Gingrich declared that the ''war here at home'' against illegal immigrants is ''even more deadly than the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.''
 And Mr. Romney, who pretends to be whatever he thinks the G.O.P. base wants him to be, is running a radio ad denouncing New York as a ''sanctuary city'' for illegal immigrants, an implicit attack on Mr. Giuliani.
 Strangely, nobody seems to be trying to make a national political issue out of other horrifying crimes, like the Connecticut home invasion in which two paroled convicts, both white, are accused of killing a mother and her two daughters. Oh, and by the way: over all, Hispanic immigrants appear to commit relatively few crimes -- in fact, their incarceration rate is actually lower than that of native-born non-Hispanic whites. 
 To appreciate what's going on here you need to understand the difference between the goals of the modern Republican Party and the strategy it uses to win elections.
 The people who run the G.O.P. are concerned, above all, with making America safe for the rich. Their ultimate goal, as Grover Norquist once put it, is to get America back to the way it was ''up until Teddy Roosevelt, when the socialists took over,'' getting rid of ''the income tax, the death tax, regulation, all that.'' 
 But right-wing economic ideology has never been a vote-winner. Instead, the party's electoral strategy has depended largely on exploiting racial fear and animosity.
 Ronald Reagan didn't become governor of California by preaching the wonders of free enterprise; he did it by attacking the state's fair housing law, denouncing welfare cheats and associating liberals with urban riots. Reagan didn't begin his 1980 campaign with a speech on supply-side economics, he began it -- at the urging of a young Trent Lott -- with a speech supporting states' rights delivered just outside Philadelphia, Miss., where three civil rights workers were murdered in 1964. 
 And if you look at the political successes of the G.O.P. since it was taken over by movement conservatives, they had very little to do with public opposition to taxes, moral values, perceived strength on national security, or any of the other explanations usually offered. To an almost embarrassing extent, they all come down to just five words: southern whites starting voting Republican.
 In fact, I suspect that the underlying importance of race to the Republican base is the reason Rudy Giuliani remains the front-runner for the G.O.P. nomination, despite his serial adultery and his past record as a social liberal. Never mind moral values: what really matters to the base is that Mr. Giuliani comes across as an authoritarian, willing in particular to crack down on you-know-who.
 But Republicans have a problem: demographic changes are making their race-based electoral strategy decreasingly effective. Quite simply, America is becoming less white, mainly because of immigration. Hispanic and Asian voters were only 4 percent of the electorate in 1980, but they were 11 percent of voters in 2004 -- and that number will keep rising for the foreseeable future.
 Those numbers are the reason Karl Rove was so eager to reach out to Hispanic voters. But the whites the G.O.P. has counted on to vote their color, not their economic interests, are having none of it. From their point of view, it's us versus them -- and everyone who looks different is one of them. 
 So now we have the spectacle of Republicans competing over who can be most convincingly anti-Hispanic. I know, officially they're not hostile to Hispanics in general, only to illegal immigrants, but that's a distinction neither the G.O.P. base nor Hispanic voters takes seriously. 
 Today's G.O.P., in short, is trapped by its history of cynicism. For decades it has exploited racial animosity to win over white voters -- and now, when Republican politicians need to reach out to an increasingly diverse country, the base won't let them.

HEADLINE: The Art of Control In a Manchu Box

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Life is a chancy deal. Wars happen; economies fail; a shadow turns up on the X-ray. No wonder we spend so much energy trying to control what's around us. 
 Art is part of that control. Nations use art to broadcast political power. We line our lives with beautiful things to create a cushion of stability: the illusion of a cohesive past, the promise of an unclouded future. 
 No culture knew more about art as control and illusion than the Chinese. They exercised it on a tremendous scale. They built vast palace-tombs, fastidiously appointed and treasure-filled, to ensure earthly comfort in the hereafter. They created the world's largest political sculpture: a wall thousands of miles long, to turn China into a gated community, to keep the world out. 
 More often, though, containment took the opposite form: miniaturization, shrinking the cosmos to the size of a peach pit. And the consummate ambition that Chinese artists brought to diminutive scale is a striking feature of ''Excellence and Elegance: Decorative Arts of the 18th-Century Qing Court,'' a small late-summer show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
 The rulers of the Qing (pronounced ching) dynasty, China's last imperial line, had cause to feel unstable. To begin with, they were not technically Chinese. They were nomadic Manchurian tribesmen organized into a confederation only in the 17th century. In 1636 they set their sights on a China splintered by civil war. In 1644 they captured Beijing and claimed the imperial throne.
 To some degree, Qing rule was an elaborate piece of performance art sustained for three centuries. With no strong culture to impose on their new subjects, they adopted and adapted the culture they found: they made themselves, superficially at least, Chinese, a self-invention accomplished in part through art. 
 Art had always carried political weight in China. Ancient jade carvings and cast bronze vessels embodied divine power and ancestral energies; brought up from the earth, they radiated Chineseness. This helps explain why the two major Qing emperors who spanned the 18th century were avid antiquarians. By collecting the art of the past they grafted themselves onto a history, bought themselves authenticity.
 For similar reasons they were lavish patrons of new art, but often of a conservative kind: traditional forms brought to new levels of technical refinement. A carved jade bell in the show can stand for countless examples. Dome-shaped, it is modeled on antique bronze prototypes that were often monumentally large and used in religious and political rituals. The Met's bell, by contrast, is of tabletop-tchotchke dimensions, its function more likely ornamental than ceremonial. It is an elegant evocation of a past rather than an actual souvenir. 
 Virtuosity is itself a form of control. Creatively, it can be as much about contraction as expansion. And purely in terms of expertise, Qing artists were beyond compare. No wonder they doted on jade, that recalcitrant stone. It gave them a chance to show off (discreetly; the Qianlong emperor, who ruled from 1736 to 1795, is known to have loathed ostentatious displays of skill). And someone has clearly risen to the technical challenge in a jade sculpture of a boy with a water buffalo. Its melted-butter smoothness and gleam are the result of untold months of laborious grinding and shaping. 
 Porcelain also had venerable Chinese cultural associations, and the Qing brought it to new heights of formal finesse: the dragons writhing around the tops of a pair of celadon jars in the show are unsurpassed works of three-dimensional sculpture. And as if existing standards of perfection were too limited, Qing artists kept complicating them by raising the difficulty quotient. 
 To achieve the precise bud-pink seen on two tiny, paper-thin cups at the Met not only meant rethinking taste in color -- at what point does eye-catching shade into garish? -- but also required turning the firing process into an acrobatics of split-second timing and temperature control. We can only guess the number of pink cups produced and discarded -- this one too pale, that one too red -- before these two passed muster as fit for a connoisseur's eye, or the experimentation that went into creating the tawny blush on the peaches painted on a splendid white famille rose vase. 
 And we can understand how and why they were trophy items. In 18th-century China, social status was growing ever more fluid with the rise of a rich merchant class. Only a person of significant standing could afford to own rarefied objects like these. And to own them gave you significance, whether you were born to it or not. 
 Finally, Qing artists applied their micromanagerial talents to compressing the panoramic Chinese landscape to gif-file size. The show's major example of a literati-style mountains-and-streams painting is found not in a handscroll but on the exterior of a cylindrical porcelain brush holder. There, rather than playing out horizontally, the vista circles around so that beginning and end meet as a closed system, a perceptual knot. 
 Visual self-containment becomes even more radical when reduced to the surface of snuff bottles, stoppered containers introduced from Europe and usually no more than an inch or two high. They were made in all sorts of materials in China: porcelain, jade, ivory, glass, agate, carved lacquer, copper, bamboo. And the show, organized by Jason Sun, associate curator in the department of Asian art, samples the repertory of themes that appeared on them. One bottle is speckled with the painted faces of ''one hundred beauties''; another has a party scene carved in high relief; on a third a woman and child in Western clothes wave from a garden framed by Rococo curlicues. 
 In a sense, this little image encapsulates a lot of what was big about the Qing dynasty. Never before had China been so rich, so populous and so cosmopolitan in its cultural reach. Throughout the 18th century it sent its art and design westward, and it eagerly welcomed what came back in return, from Europe, India (don't miss a radiant Mughal-style jade dish) and the Islamic Middle East. 
 Working with such multifarious input, Qing artists assembled an alternative decorative style, one that coexisted with classicism but was very different. It was eclectic, proto-postmodern, marked by high-low, Asian-European motifs; vivid ''foreign'' colors; and outsize scale, seen in jumbo porcelains and mural-size screens and scrolls. An enamel painted jar, with fat peonies on a yellow ground and a large trompe l'oeil bandanna tied around its middle, is a sensational example of this international style.
 Yet the passion for smallness never diminished; if anything, it intensified. The imperial workshops turned out painstakingly executed miniversions of archaic forms, along with compartmented boxes to hold them. It was as if the Qing, ever aware of their far-off nomadic roots, kept themselves packed and ready to move should the carefully constructed world they had created give way. And it did in the early years of the 20th century under pressure from Western imperialism, internal uprisings and a devastating series of droughts, floods and epidemics. The last Qing emperor abdicated the throne in 1912.
 Such calamities seem far removed from the Met's pristine display. Installed in a single room of the compact Florence and Herbert Irving Galleries for Chinese Decorative Arts, which are themselves tucked away in the middle of the museum's Chinese painting galleries, it's like a jewel box, inside a strongbox, inside a treasury, filled with exquisite, slight, breakable things. One clumsy moveand the rose-pink cups are done for; a sudden blast and you have a pile of pretty scraps. 
 The reality is that destruction, someday, somehow, will come: the Qing could tell you that. It is our tireless effort to avoid it that makes our most beautiful busywork art.
 ''Excellence and Elegance: Decorative Arts of the 18th-Century Qing Court'' continues through Nov. 25 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street; (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.

HEADLINE: Yes, Build Elegant Bridges, but Make Them Safe

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''One Bridge Doesn't Fit All'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 18):
 Is David P. Billington, the noted structural engineering professor at Princeton, trying to comfort the lay public about the safety of American bridges? He does far from that. 
 He cites the goal of good bridge design as being the integration of ''efficiency, economy and elegance.'' But shouldn't the overarching goal be safety and structural integrity? 
 Yes, we would all love for our bridges to be efficient, attractive and reasonably priced, but shouldn't safety and structural integrity be far and away our greatest concerns? Carl Mattioli 
 Newtonville, Mass., Aug. 18, 2007
 To the Editor:
 David P. Billington's advocacy of aesthetics as an integral part of structural engineering is commendable. But the engineer's most important task by far is to design safe structures. 
 Structural redundancy assuring bridge survival if a single member or connection fails is one means to achieve this task. The ''truss deck'' design used in the Minneapolis Bridge was not redundant, a shortcoming far graver than the bridge's aesthetic mediocrity. 
 The bridge designer Christian Menn has pointed out that while elegant designs can use materials efficiently, the most economical designs are not necessarily the most elegant. The American taxpayers' typical preference is to save money, rather than help create beautiful public buildings or bridges.
 Designing beautiful bridges takes innate artistic intuition and talent. John A. Roebling, the creator of the Brooklyn Bridge, had both. So does Mr. Menn. But teaching aesthetics to engineers is unlikely to produce these qualities. 
 Achieving beautiful bridges requires enlightened support by public officials to allow superior if costlier design. It also requires fully engaging gifted professionals in the process -- the breathtakingly beautiful Viaduct of Millau was designed by the celebrated architect Norman Foster. Emil Simiu 
 Rockville, Md., Aug. 18, 2007

 To the Editor:
 David P. Billington calls for elegance as well as efficiency and economy in bridge design. This concept might well be applied to the design of all structures, including public buildings, private homes, roads, marinas, shopping malls, airports, warehouses and so on. 
 Design of these structures has an enormous impact on the visual environment of millions. The Romans who designed the huge, elegant Pont du Gard, the still-standing aqueduct near Nimes, France, followed that concept, which I hope will be taught to our future engineers and architects. 
 Charles E. Dell 
 Mitchellville, Md., Aug. 19, 2007
 To the Editor:
 America's highway bridges are the safest in the world because the specifications under which they are designed, inspected and built are the strictest, most up to date in the worldwide bridge design community. 
 About 60 percent of bridge collapses are caused by floods, foundation failures, wind and earthquakes. Structural failures, like that of the I-35W bridge in Minnesota, account for about 20 percent of all failures and are mainly caused by lack of maintenance and overload. 
 Since the 1960s, Congress has increased the allowable size and weight of trucks that traverse and damage our bridges, despite the protests of bridge engineers. 
 David P. Billington writes that few bridges built in the last century have been able to ''integrate efficiency, economy and elegance in a single design.'' But America has many efficient and elegant bridges -- the Rainbow and the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge over the Niagara River, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge over Tampa Bay and many others. 
 Our simple highway overpasses outside urban areas can compete with any in the world. Let's not put down American bridges, but let us learn from the event when there is a rare tragic bridge collapse. Bernard Haber

HEADLINE: Aid Groups Urge U.S. to Revise Plan to Screen Their Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
A Bush administration proposal to screen foreign aid workers and recipients for possible ties to terrorists has drawn criticism from private and religious aid groups, but there were indications that it might be revised before being adopted, aid organizations and administration officials said Thursday.
 Under the proposal, promulgated this month by the United States Agency for International Development, groups that receive its foreign aid money for the delivery of services to the poor would have to provide detailed information about their own personnel and possibly about others who benefit from the aid. 
 Aid groups, including a leading organization that represents a cross section of religious charities, charge that the administration proposal would invade their privacy by sharing delicate information with intelligence agencies and would drive away aid beneficiaries, especially in the Middle East and Africa.
 At present, contractors that deliver aid on behalf of the United States government have to certify that recipients do not have terrorist ties, but they do so based on lists of suspicious individuals and organizations supplied by federal authorities.
 The new proposal would give the vetting responsibility to American law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The vetting apparently would apply to senior officials of the American aid groups as well as to subcontractors abroad. 
 The proposal was first published in July in the Federal Register but reported Thursday in The Washington Post, which also reported that several aid groups were demanding that it be rescinded.
 In response, a top official at the Agency for International Development said Thursday that the criticism would be taken into account and that the proposal could be revised before it is adopted formally.
 ''There could be revisions,'' said James Kunder, acting deputy administrator of the agency. ''We are trying to strike a reasonable balance here. We're trying not to make these requirements too onerous. But we have to have reasonable requirements to insure that aid money is not going to assist terrorists or terrorist groups.''
 The criticism of the proposal has been led in part by InterAction, a group representing religious and aid organizations that deliver $4 billion in federal assistance in poor countries along with $5 billion from the American public, many of it provided through local churches and charities.
 ''This came to us out of the blue,'' said Samuel A. Worthington, president of InterAction. ''We're being asked to supply information to go to the United States government. It's saying that the broad charitable community in the United States is a security risk. That's going a step too far.''
 Mr. Kunder said the new proposal was modeled in part on requirements imposed by Congress for aid delivered to groups in the West Bank and Gaza, where there have been cases of aid getting into the hands of groups and individuals with links to Hamas and other militant organizations.
 But Mr. Worthington and others said that in expanding the vetting process beyond Palestinian areas, the agency appeared to be expanding the amount of information required for review by American government authorities. Another concern, he said, is possible arbitrary action by Washington to cut off aid contracts.
 Mr. Worthington said his organization had not had much chance to express its concerns to Washington but hoped to have an opportunity to do so before the proposal is adopted. 
 Mr. Kunder said the proposed rule was an attempt to strike a balance between ensuring that money does not go to violent individuals or groups while making sure that money goes to those areas where these groups operate.
 ''There's a legitimate concern that U.S. taxpayer dollars could fall into terrorist hands,'' Mr. Kunder said. ''But we are also engaged in difficult environments with programs intended to undermine the cause of extremism. We don't want to put an undue burden on our partners in that job. We want them to continue to work with us.''

HEADLINE: Romney to Pitch a State-by-State Health Insurance Plan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, an architect of Massachusetts' universal health coverage plan, is unveiling his proposal for overhauling the nation's health care system, calling for a state-by-state approach that he says will help millions of uninsured in this country gain access to affordable medical coverage.
 The proposal, which Mr. Romney will detail today before the Florida Medical Association, departs significantly from the universal health care measure that he helped forge as governor of Massachusetts, reflecting the conservative audience he must now appeal to in order to win the Republican presidential nomination. It relies on federal incentives for market reforms, tax deductions and other changes to encourage people to buy health insurance and drive down costs. 
 ''He's run away from the Massachusetts plan,'' said Stuart Altman, a health economist at Brandeis University who worked in the Nixon administration and has helped advise many politicians since, including Senator Barack Obama, a Democratic presidential contender.
 The Massachusetts plan, which went into effect this year and is still being watched closely to see how it will fare, was Mr. Romney's signal legislative accomplishment as governor but has elements that trouble many conservatives, most notably a mandate that everyone who can afford it must buy health insurance or face penalties. 
 Mr. Romney often promotes his health care bill in Massachusetts on the campaign trail, holding it up as a private-market-based solution to the problem of the uninsured, as opposed to ''socialized medicine,'' or ''Hillary-care,'' as he often says. But he almost never mentions the requirement that individuals buy coverage. 
 There is no individual mandate in Mr. Romney's plan for the rest of the country. Instead, it concentrates on a ''federalist'' approach, premised on the belief that it is impossible to create a uniform system for the entire country. Along these lines, the federal government would offer incentives to states to take their own necessary steps to bring down the cost of health insurance.
 According to a preview of the presentation provided by Mr. Romney's policy advisers yesterday, Mr. Romney will highlight how the nearly 45 million uninsured in the country can be divided into roughly three groups: about a third are eligible for public programs but are not enrolled; a third are low income but ineligible for public programs and need some help from the government to purchase health insurance; a third are middle income but have chosen not to buy health insurance. 
 In his plan, Mr. Romney proposes taking federal money currently being used to help states cover the cost of medical care for the uninsured and offering that money to states to help low-income people who are not eligible for Medicaid and other public programs to buy their own private health insurance.
 The same pool of money will be wielded as a carrot for states to reform their health insurance regulations to help drive costs down and make plans affordable. That would include reducing the number of requirements for coverage that states impose on health insurance providers or lifting restrictions in some states on health maintenance organizations.
 ''For those people who are middle income or higher, a lot of times they're making a basic calculation that it's too expensive to buy health insurance,'' said Sally Canfield, Mr. Romney's policy director.
 Mr. Romney, who helped found a hugely successful private equity firm, argues that the existing tax system penalizes those who do not acquire their health insurance through their employer, and that has prevented the development of a vigorous, affordable health insurance market. Those who acquire health insurance from their employers pay for their premiums with pre-tax dollars, but those who do not must use post-tax dollars to buy it. So Mr. Romney wants to allow people who buy their own health insurance to be able to deduct premiums, deductibles and co-payments from their income.
 Eventually, Ms. Canfield said, the goal would be for people to be able to opt out of employer plans if they do not like them and go out on the individual market to buy health insurance on their own.
 Other elements of Mr. Romney's plan include altering the federal financing for state Medicaid programs to encourage restructuring by states and even helping low-income people buy private coverage, as well as capping punitive damages on medical liability lawsuits.
 Several experts, however, questioned the viability of aspects of Mr. Romney's plan, including whether the proposed tax incentives will be enough to spur individuals to buy health insurance, without any consequences like they face in Massachusetts if they do not.
 ''Those individuals have free will,'' said Alan B. Cohen, executive director of the Health Policy Institute at Boston University. ''They can go out and spend that money on anything they want. They might not spend it on insurance. If they don't spend it on insurance, the rest of us still end up paying for their care.''

HEADLINE: Even as Industry's Troubles Grow, Mortgage Ads Keep Up the Pitch

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Wall Street may have soured on the mortgage business. But on television, radio and the Internet, the industry is as ebullient as ever.
 For example, Quicken Loans, no longer affiliated with the makers of Quicken software but the nation's 25th-biggest lender, continues to run its signature spot on radio stations. ''This is a rate alert,'' the advertisement starts off, sounding much like a newscast. ''Slower economic growth has caused the Fed to keep interest rates flat, and the market has responded with some of the lowest mortgage rates in years.''
 As more homeowners fall behind on mortgage payments and investors abandon the industry in droves, mortgage companies are facing greater scrutiny over their lending practices and disclosures to borrowers. 
 One area where regulators are paying closer attention is advertising that promises tantalizingly low payments without clearly disclosing the myriad strings that accompany the debts. It is a tactic that has been widely used -- and, critics say, abused -- by lenders trying to lure new customers. 
 Mortgage lenders have spent more than $3 billion since 2000 on advertising on television, on radio and in print, said Nielsen Monitor-Plus, which tracks ad spending. 
 That figure does not include direct mail and Internet advertising, which are increasingly popular vehicles for the industry. Nielsen/NetRatings estimates that mortgage companies spent $378 million in the first six months of this year on Internet display ads, and many companies also buy search advertising.
 LowerMyBills.com, a site owned by the credit agency Experian that funnels borrowers to mortgage lenders, has become a prolific advertiser on the Web with its impossible-to-miss ads that feature dancing cowboys and a video of a woman jumping and screaming with joy, presumably after being approved for a loan.
 The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in states like Ohio and New York are looking into the ads as part of more comprehensive reviews of lending practices during the housing boom. In June, federal banking regulators ranked advertising as one of three areas where mortgage lenders need to be more judicious.
 The Ohio attorney general, Marc Dann, said his staff was investigating direct-mail advertising that appears to be a solicitation from a homeowner's bank or from the federal government. Many ads appear to aim at low-income and minority neighborhoods. Mr. Dann said his office has sent letters asking 30 lenders to substantiate their claims..
 As the mortgage market shrinks and defaults rise, he said, lenders ''are becoming more desperate, and consumers are becoming more desperate.''
 Consumer advocates say many ads are at best misleading and at worst steer consumers into risky loans with promises of low introductory rates that do not make clear that they could pay significantly more in a few months or years.
 ''The advertising was a drumbeat to consumers, saying: 'Don't worry, you can qualify for a loan. We will approve it,' '' said Patricia A. McCoy, a law professor at the University of Connecticut who has studied mortgage advertising. ''It was push marketing to reach out to these people on the sidelines who have doubts about their ability to pay a mortgage and lure them in.''
 Even when consumers do find out about higher rates before closing on a house, by that time they are often ''psychologically committed'' to buying, Ms. McCoy said.
 Quicken Loans was one of the many mortgage companies that benefited during the housing boom. The company, based in Livonia, Mich., near Detroit, wrote $18 billion in loans last year, up from $4.6 billion in 2001. 
 Even during the tough market this year, Quicken Loans expects to make more than $20 billion in loans. Not coincidentally, Quicken Loans also pumped money into its advertising over that period -- increasing it to $51 million last year from about $3.5 million in 2002, according to estimates from Nielsen Monitor-Plus. 
 Through June, Quicken Loans spent $37 million on mortgage ads -- second only to GMAC, which spent $46 million. Quicken Loans would not confirm how much it spends on advertising but executives acknowledged that such spending had significantly increased.
 The chief marketing officer of Quicken Loans, Bryan Stapp, said that the ads were not misleading and that spending had increased as the company had grown.
 ''While the advertising may've caused some to pick up the phone or go online, they still have to go through the process of talking to a banker,'' Mr. Stapp said. ''Anyone who was attracted to whatever advertising we had would then have a better picture of what program they could qualify for.' Quicken Loans has not been identified as being under investigation by the F.T.C. or any regulatory agency. 
 Quicken Loans has found that 40 percent of its business come from referrals or returning customers, Mr. Stapp said. The remaining 60 percent depend on new people picking up the phone or clicking on its Web site. The company also provides free videos and articles about the mortgage and real estate market for use by any Web site and many Realtors, bloggers and others post the information -- along with a link to Quicken Loan's site.
 The company does not plan to cut back on advertising for the rest of the year, Mr. Stapp said. That will be a relief to media companies, which have benefited from the influx of spending.
 But Countrywide Financial, the nation's biggest mortgage company and a leading advertiser, recently said it would cut back on many popular loans because of its financial troubles. Some advertising executives expect mortgage ad revenue at Web sites will drop significantly.
 Housing analysts said the increase in home prices may have been propelled by ads from companies like Quicken Loans, which ran TV spots with pitches like: ''Your payment can be lower than you ever imagined.''
 In its ads, Quicken Loans suggested that consumers could pay off credit card bills, remodel their homes and lower their monthly payment if they got a Secure Advantage mortgage, which allowed homeowners to roll what they would have paid in interest into the amount they owe.
 Many critics consider such mortgages, known as payment-option loans, dangerous for all but the most sophisticated borrowers, because many homeowners do not realize that making just the minimum payment will mean they owe more on their house with each passing month.
 The company says it no longer offers that mortgage. But Quicken Loans posted one of the ads on YouTube and it was up as recently as Aug. 7. The radio version of the ads has run several times this month, according to Competitrack, a company in New York that tracks advertising.
 Quicken Loans says that even when it was advertising Secure Advantage, it did not make many payment-option loans. The company also said it made few loans to subprime borrowers -- homeowners who have weak or blemished credit records. 
 Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Scottsdale, Ariz., said he spends a lot of time counseling clients against taking out loans that promise a deceptively low payment rate. ''These guys say your payment will be $500 a month, but nowhere do they say that your actual payment is $3,000 a month,'' Mr. Walsh said referring to the payments consumers would need to make to pay off their loan on a 30-year schedule. ''It should be criminal. The disclosures are usually complicated, and people don't know what hit them.'' 
 The other thing that surprises consumers is that some mortgage companies do not return the mortgage application fees if the mortgage is not approved, but others, like Quicken Loans, say they return money if the mortgage is not used.
 Some states require lenders to disclose the annual percentage rate on any loans they advertise. But legal specialists say it can be hard to enforce these and other consumer protection statutes. Companies simply withdraw ads when they receive cease-and-desist letters, but the ads often immediately pop up elsewhere.
 ''You do get an immediate positive feedback,'' said James E. Tierney, director of the national state attorneys general program at Columbia Law School in New York and a former attorney general. ''But it's hard to make it a sustainable success since there are so many lenders and ads.''

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Climb, Giving Markets a Break

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
A rise in sales of new homes last month provided an unexpected respite from the steady stream of dismal housing market statistics lately, but economists cautioned that it was unlikely to last.
 As obtaining a mortgage becomes more difficult even for people with solid credit and the supply of homes continues to far exceed demand, any recovery in the real estate market still appears months away.
 For one day anyway, investors were cheered by the news and lifted stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 142.99 points, or 1.1 percent, to 13,378.87. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.87 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,479.37, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 34.99 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,576.69. 
 The Commerce Department said yesterday that new-home sales, measured at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, rose 2.8 percent in July, to 870,000. It was only the second month this year in which sales of new homes increased from the previous month.
 But the upturn was concentrated in the West, where sales surged 22.4 percent. That helped offset a 24.3 percent plunge in the Northeast and relatively flat sales in the Midwest (down 0.9 percent) and the South (up 0.6 percent).
 The strength on the West Coast, which has the highest median home prices in the country, also helped lift the national median price of a new home, to $239,500 from $230,600 in June.
 For the improvement they showed, the July statistics predated the credit market squeeze that has roiled the global financial system this month. Since then, banks have tightened borrowing standards considerably for both individuals and businesses, which is expected to put a further drag on home buying.
 ''In July, people were talking about the subprime problems, but they weren't talking about it being a major credit crunch,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist for Commerce Bank. ''Now they're looking at it and recognizing that maybe it's not a full-blown crisis, but it could become one.''
 The effect of the credit tightening -- both in terms of its real effect on mortgage availability and its psychological effect on consumers -- has yet to unfold.
 ''I think there's a lot of uncertainty,'' said Celia Chen, the director of housing economics at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''I think potential buyers are going to need to see a little firming in prices. And then I think they'll need to be able to access credit easily. Right now, that's getting harder and harder.''
 The statistics showed that builders continued to hold high levels of unsold inventory. The supply of unsold homes last month fell to 7.5 months from 7.7 months, but that is still far more than the five-month supply that is considered normal. At the end of July, the Commerce Department said 533,000 unsold new homes were on the market, down 7 percent from July 2006.
 With so many homes on the market, economists said prices could continue to fall for some time. Despite the increase last month, the median price of a new home in July was still lower than the 2006 median of $246,500.
 The rise in new-home sales last month was out of step with what some of the largest builders have been saying recently about the state of their businesses. 
 Major companies like D. R. Horton and Toll Brothers have reported double-digit drops in sales since last year, sagging profits and soaring cancellations. And the National Association of Home Builders said last week that its index of builder confidence hit the lowest level since January 1991.
 In a survey of more than 300 builders this month, the home builders association found that more and more are cutting prices and adding incentives like upgraded kitchen countertops and fireplaces to sell homes. Fifty-three percent of builders said they had cut prices in the last month, compared with 37 percent a year earlier. Forty-seven percent are paying financing fees and mortgage closing costs for buyers, compared with 38 percent a year earlier. The percentage of builders including upgrades at no additional charge to the buyer rose to 58 percent from 51 percent a year earlier.
 Because the Commerce Department numbers count home sales when the contract is signed between the homeowner and the builder, they do not capture cancellations. And many builders recently have reported high cancellation rates, suggesting that the July numbers may exaggerate how good the month was for builders.
 ''Given the high rate of sales cancellations that home builders have experienced in recent months, it is difficult to get a line of sight to the net sales rates,'' an economist for Global Insight, Brian Bethune, said in a research report.
 Outside the housing market, there were signs that July was a good month for American businesses. The Commerce Department said in a separate report yesterday that orders for durable goods -- heavy-duty items like airplanes, vehicles and computers -- rose 5.9 percent in July, to $12.9 billion.

HEADLINE: After Warning, Contractor Got Bank Tower Job

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The City Department of Investigation strongly cautioned Lower Manhattan development officials against using contractors with ties to a troubled demolition company to tear down the contaminated Deutsche Bank building, a person with knowledge of the events said yesterday. But development officials went ahead and approved such a company anyway.
 In a 10-page letter in January 2006, the investigation agency expressed concerns about any arrangement that included people or companies with ties to Safeway Environmental Corporation working on the project. The concerns stemmed from the criminal convictions and accusations of organized crime connections against a former Safeway owner, the person said. 
 The Department of Investigation also suggested alternative companies that might be used for the complex job, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Questions about the contract arose after two firefighters were killed in a fire at the building last Saturday.
 The Department of Investigation, in fact, did not learn that Lower Manhattan Development Corporation officials had approved a deal that involved former Safeway executives until the agreement had been signed for work at the tower, which stands on the edge of ground zero. The agency further learned that the arrangement approved by the development officials included language that made it appear as if investigation officials had, in fact, been aware of the arrangement.
 The Department of Investigation had no formal authority to bar the choice of contractors by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a state agency. But it had worked with development officials for months, advising them on the fitness of companies that were bidding for work at the Deutsche Bank site.
 The Department of Investigation's efforts to prevent Safeway or people with links to the company from having a hand in the Deutsche Bank demolition emerged in recent days.
 Since the fire, it became apparent that the company that had been doing the demolition work, known as the John Galt Corporation, was something of an arranged marriage between former executives from Safeway and a scaffolding company that had no experience tearing down skyscrapers.
 The John Galt Corporation was effectively fired this week by Bovis Lend Lease, the general contractor overseeing the work at the former bank building. A criminal investigation also has begun, conducted by the Rackets Bureau of the office of Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, and the city's fire marshals to determine who was responsible for the deadly array of problems at the building, including a severed standpipe that denied the doomed firefighters essential water.
 A spokeswoman for the Department of Investigation, Diane Struzzi, would not comment on the position the agency took before or after the John Galt Corporation was engaged by Bovis and the state development agency to tear down the building.
 But the person with knowledge of the exchange between the Department of Investigation and development officials said investigators felt that their warnings had been ignored.
 ''That's the gist of it, that L.M.D.C. went around them and did what they wanted, obviously knowing that D.O.I. would have objected to Galt,'' the person said, referring to a second letter from the Department of Investigation.
 A spokesman for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation refused to comment for this article. A spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also would not comment.
 The city appoints half of the 16 members of the board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. A spokesman for Daniel L. Doctoroff, a deputy mayor who served on the board, indicated this week that adequate safeguards had been put in place to prevent the two former Safeway executives, Mitchel Alvo and Don Adler, from doing anything inappropriate.
 It is unclear whether the Department of Investigation, once it learned of the involvement of Mr. Alvo and Mr. Adler at the bank building, brought its concerns to the mayor or other senior elected officials.
 The Department of Investigation, which vets city contractors and oversees monitors installed in some instances to audit and watch over the work of problematic ones, was helping the development agency in its effort to find a suitable demolition contractor for the Deutsche Bank building.
 The 41-story tower beside ground zero was scarred and left uninhabitable by the Sept. 11 attacks and has stood since that day as both a contaminated menace and an ugly reminder.
 The search for a demolition contractor began in the summer of 2005, after the development agency hired Bovis, one of the world's largest construction management firms, to oversee the job. 
 Bovis executives expressed a strong desire to work with people from Safeway, no matter who the demolition subcontractor was, according to a number of current and former officials involved in rebuilding in Lower Manhattan and knowledgeable about the Deutsche Bank project, at 130 Liberty Street.
 ''They said, 'They were the best around; we want them,' '' recalled one development agency official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the project.
 A spokesman for Bovis said that the company had presented Mr. Alvo and Mr. Adler, who ended up working for Galt, to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. ''They were not under investigation,'' he said of the two men. ''They had expertise in deconstruction and have been on jobs of this complexity.''
 By mid-January 2006, as pressure grew to get the major demolition work under way, Robert F. Roach, then the chief of staff at the Department of Investigations, sent the first of the two letters to Charles Maikish, who at the time was the executive director of the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center. The command center was the construction coordinator and reported to then-Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg.
 A month later, Bovis and the development agency negotiated an unusual arrangement under which the John Galt Corporation was selected to do the asbestos abatement and demolition with Mr. Alvo and Mr. Adler.
 The agreement stated that the two executives were required to cooperate with a Department of Investigation inquiry, although the nature of that investigation remained unclear.
 The inclusion of the provision angered officials at the investigation agency, apparently because it seemed to suggest that they had approved the decision to hire Mr. Alvo and Mr. Adler.
 It is unclear precisely when and how the Department of Investigation learned about the agreement between the development agency and Bovis to hire Galt and its plan to use Mr. Alvo and Mr. Adler.
 But by April, the Department of Investigation had learned of the arrangement and the provision requiring the former Safeway executives' cooperation, and Mr. Roach wrote to Mr. Maikish again, expressing surprise and frustration that the development agency had proceeded against their advice.
 Mr. Maikish wrote back to Mr. Roach, a letter the person with knowledge of the events described as an apology.

HEADLINE: Dollars for Sale

 BODY:
During the worst of the markets' recent volatility, many investors moved their money into supersafe Treasury securities, temporarily boosting the dollar against the euro and the British pound. But of late, the dollar has resumed its downward trend of the past several years. And policy makers and currency traders are once again hypervigilant for signs that Asian central banks might redeploy part of their dollar-based debt holdings into non-American investments. 
 Such diversification -- particularly by China, which is believed to have some $1 trillion -- could further weaken the dollar, presaging higher interest rates and higher prices in the United States. 
 But Asian bankers, it turns out, are not the only ones to watch. According to a new study by Stephen Jen, a currency economist at Morgan Stanley, American investors may be a more powerful force than their foreign counterparts in driving the dollar down.
 Mr. Jen notes that since 2003, American mutual funds have increased their allocation of overseas equities from 15 percent to 22.5 percent, a pace he describes as ''gradual but determined.'' If America's other big institutional investors, such as pensions and insurance companies, have invested elsewhere at the same pace, he calculates that the outflow of dollars would now amount to $1.16 trillion, about the same as China's total foreign reserves. 
 The outflow is not necessarily a thumbs down on the dollar's prospects, says Mr. Jen. Instead, it may reflect an increased willingness to invest overseas in a prudent attempt at broad diversification. 
 But in a recent analysis of Mr. Jen's study, the Economist magazine points out that a negative view about the dollar may underlie the urge to diversify. The Economist cites a Merrill Lynch survey showing that downbeat expectations for the dollar have been common among fund managers for the past five years. The push to diversify out of dollars was strongest three years ago, but persists today. 
 If dollar wariness among American investors were a recent phenomenon, it could be chalked up to temporary forces. But because the unease has been marked for many years, it must emanate from something more entrenched. One probable source is concern about America's huge ongoing foreign indebtedness. 
 Currency markets generally punish heavily indebted nations by pushing down their currency. In the absence of policies to boost domestic savings -- and thereby slow the build up of debt -- a steady decline of the dollar implies a steady decline in American living standards. A sharply accelerating decline would imply severe economic distress. By diversifying out of dollars, American investors seem intent, at least in part, on reducing their exposure to either eventuality. 
 Policy makers should spend less time worrying about what foreign creditors could do to harm the dollar, and more time working to improve savings at home, both public and private. That way, the nation would be less reliant on imported capital and less vulnerable over all, come what may.

HEADLINE: Chinese Seek A U.S. Maker Of Disk Drives

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 

 BODY:
A Chinese technology company has expressed interest in buying a maker of computer disk drives in the United States, raising concerns among American government officials about the risks to national security in transferring high technology to China.
 The overture, which was disclosed by the chief executive of one of the two remaining drive makers in the United States, William D. Watkins of Seagate Technology, has resurrected the issues of economic competitiveness and national security raised three years ago when Lenovo, a Chinese computer maker, bought I.B.M.'s personal computer business. 
 Tensions have been increasing lately between the countries over China's ambitions in developing its military abilities and advanced technologies for industrial and consumer uses.
 Although disk drives do not fall under a list of export-controlled technologies, the attempted purchase of an American disk drive company would require a security review by the federal government, according to several government officials. 
 In recent years, modern disk drives, used to store vast quantities of digital information securely, have become complex computing systems, complete with hundreds of thousands of lines of software that are used to ensure the integrity of data and to offer data encryption.
 That could raise the prospect of secret tampering with hardware or software to make it possible to pilfer information via computer networks, intelligence officials have warned. 
 Seagate has recently begun selling drives with hardware encryption abilities. 
 Mr. Watkins did not identify the Chinese company. But he said that the possibility of an acquisition had sent alarm bells ringing at some government agencies. 
 ''The U.S. government is freaking out,'' Mr. Watkins said during an interview on Thursday. 
 Reached Friday night, Treasury officials declined to comment on possible Chinese overtures for an American maker.
 While Mr. Watkins said that Seagate, which is the largest drive maker in the United States, was not for sale, he also said that if a high enough premium was offered to shareholders it would be difficult to stop.
 Seagate's shares rose 1.05 percent Friday to close at $24.96 and were up about 4 percent for the week after news that it might enter the flash memory market. There does not appear to have been any significant increase in trading of Seagate options.
 With a booming economy and $1.33 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves, Chinese companies are in a position to acquire American companies, as Japanese and West European companies were several decades ago. While those earlier acquisitions were often opposed out of fears that they would damage American economic competitiveness, the acquisition of American companies by Chinese companies is regarded with more suspicion, particularly in the high-tech sector.
 Since the Lenovo sale, the government has become increasingly concerned about technology security, according to members of federal advisory committees.
 ''Seagate would be extremely sensitive,'' said an industry executive who participates in classified government advisory groups. ''I do not think anyone in the U.S. wants the Chinese to have access to the controller chips for a disk drive. One never knows what the Chinese could do to instrument the drive.''
 The transfer of advanced disk drive manufacturing technology would give the Chinese a major leg up in competing in information technologies. China, however, still lags in basic manufacturing skills like semiconductor design and manufacturing.
 ''This is clearly a critical component of a computer system and the purchase by the Chinese or other nations merits a full review to determine what our risks are,'' said Michael R. Wessell, a commissioner of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a group that monitors the national security implications of trade with China for Congress. 
 I.B.M., which invented the disk drive in the 1950s and which dominated the industry through the 1990s, sold its disk drive business to the Japanese computer maker Hitachi in 2002, leaving just two American companies: Seagate, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., and Western Digital, based in Lake Forest, Calif.
 Two other Japanese makers, Fujitsu and Toshiba, and a division of Samsung, a South Korean electronics conglomerate, are also major manufacturers of the storage devices. 
 Western Digital executives declined to comment.
 Kenneth Lieberthal, the senior director for Asia at the National Security Council during the later years of the Clinton administration, expressed strong doubt that the Chinese government would allow a technology company to pursue an acquisition if the transaction were likely to draw criticism from the United States government, even if that criticism did not reach the level of an actual prohibition on a deal.
 ''The Chinese have been very concerned about how to invest in the United States without producing the kind of political firestorm they ran into when they tried to buy Unocal,'' said Mr. Lieberthal, a professor of politics and business administration at the University of Michigan. ''The government really does not want to confront the kind of situation it ran into with Unocal.''
 The China National Offshore Oil Corporation, a state-owned company, abandoned its plan to buy Unocal in 2005 when it touched off opposition in Congress. Mr. Lieberthal said that the Chinese government had only been lukewarm about supporting Cnooc, and was likely to be even more cautious now. ''If' they've really decided to go after a high-end computer equipment manufacturer, they've really decided to test the waters,'' he said.
 If a Chinese company has made an advance to an American company in a technologically sensitive industry without obtaining prior support from the Chinese government, the Chinese company would be in serious trouble with Beijing officials, Mr. Lieberthal said. So it is unlikely that any serious approach would be made by a Chinese company without careful prior consultations in Beijing.
 Yet the Chinese government also faces a quandary: how to improve yields on its foreign exchange reserves, more than two-thirds of it in dollars. Roughly $100 billion is believed to be in American mortgage-backed securities, an investment that has suffered during the recent financial turmoil.
 A Chinese government investment fund spent $3 billion to buy nearly 10 percent of the Blackstone Group this summer, but made a point of taking nonvoting shares to reduce the risk of a political backlash. Stakes in financial services companies also tend to be less controversial than stakes in high-tech enterprises.
 Beijing authorities are also starting to encourage companies and even individuals to invest more overseas, as a way to offset some of the foreign investment pouring into China. The inflow of money from investment and trade surpluses has been putting upward pressure on the value of China's currency, threatening to erode some of the competitiveness of Chinese exports.
 If a Chinese company does make an actual bid for an American high-tech company, a former government official said, and that bid is blocked for political reasons, then Chinese companies may become even warier of investing in American companies and the government in Beijing may begin to suspect that Washington so distrusts China that it is trying to throw roadblocks in the path of its economic development.
 ''If they are blocked, I would suspect this would at a minimum contribute to their being gun-shy of the U.S. government,'' said Mr. Lieberthal, a Chinese speaker who stays in close touch with a range of Chinese government officials and American corporate leaders.

HEADLINE: Who Will Pay for the Next Hurricane?

BYLINE: By HOWARD KUNREUTHER. 
Howard Kunreuther, co-director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center and a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, is a co-editor of ''On Risk and Disaster: Lessons from Hurricane Katrina.''

 BODY:
Philadelphia
 AS the second anniversary of Katrina approaches, residents in hurricane-prone areas are still concerned that they cannot obtain insurance to cover damage to their homes from future disasters. Specifically, the decision by State Farm, Mississippi's largest insurer, to discontinue selling new policies on homes and small businesses there has sent shock waves beyond the state. Banks that normally require homeowner's insurance as a condition for obtaining a mortgage are also not sure what impact this will have on their clients' ability to buy such coverage. 
 The insurer's motivation is economic. Rates are regulated by the states, so insurers are often restricted in the premiums they can charge. In addition, State Farm faced a lawsuit contending it was liable for flood losses from Hurricane Katrina. Homeowners' policies cover only losses caused by wind in such storms; flood coverage is provided by a separate policy as part of the National Flood Insurance Program. The state of Mississippi, however, charged that insurers were responsible for hurricane damage from Katrina because surging floodwaters were caused by the wind. State Farm eventually won the case, but it was a costly process and led to its decision to discontinue selling new policies. 
 State Farm's decision is only the tip of the iceberg of a much broader problem: how this country can reduce future losses from natural disasters and aid victims in their recovery efforts. Because of increasing development in hazard-prone areas and the effects of climate change, we are in a new era of catastrophic losses from natural disasters. Ten of the 20 most costly natural disasters have occurred during the past five years -- all 10 of them hurricanes, typhoons or tropical storms. 
 The four hurricanes in Florida in 2004 (Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne) collectively totaled more than $29 billion in insured losses; Hurricane Katrina is estimated to have cost insurers and reinsurers $45 billion. 
 At the same time, victims have complained about receiving substantially less than the actual costs of rebuilding or repairing the damage. Many have turned to the Small Business Administration for low-interest loans; however, a property owner is eligible for a loan only if he or she can show the ability to repay it. Hence, low-income residents must find other assistance. 
 We need a new approach to financing the costs of natural disasters and to encouraging individuals in hazard-prone areas to undertake mitigation measures. Two principles, which appear to conflict with each other, are guiding a large-scale research study being undertaken by the Wharton Risk Center in conjunction with Georgia State University and the Insurance Information Institute (as well as with firms and organizations from the public and private sectors, some of whom pay for this research).
 Principle 1: Risk-Based Premiums. Insurance premiums should be based on risk to encourage individuals to reduce their vulnerability to catastrophes. 
 Principle 2: Dealing With Equity and Affordability Issues. Any special treatment given to lower-income residents in hazard-prone areas should come from general public funding and not through artificially low rates. 
 Principle 1 is important because it provides a clear signal of relative risk to those living in areas subject to natural disasters, as well as those who are considering moving into these areas. Risk-based premiums also enable insurers to give discounts to homeowners and businesses who invest in cost-effective loss-reduction measures. If the premiums are not risk-based, insurers have no economic incentive to offer discounts. In fact, insurers forced to charge artificially low premiums prefer not to offer coverage because it is a losing proposition in the long run. More generally, those living in hazard-prone areas should have safer structures and buy enough insurance to cover their losses from a future disaster.
 Principle 2 reflects a concern for low-income residents in high-hazard areas who will face large premium increases if Principle 1 is followed. Today, in many Gulf Coast states, premiums in regions subject to hurricane damage are highly subsidized because of rate regulations imposed by state insurance commissioners. If insurers are permitted to charge risk-based premiums, homeowners in hurricane-prone areas will pay considerably more for coverage than they do today. 
 To deal with the affordability issue, the state or federal government could provide some type of insurance vouchers to low-income residents. It could work like the food stamp program, in which families are given vouchers to buy food based on income and size of family. A homeowner in a hazard-prone area would pay an insurance premium that reflects risk, and then get reimbursed by the state for part of the increased cost. The amount of reimbursement would be determined by income and the premium charged. Under such a voucher system, insurance could reward individuals for undertaking risk reduction measures by lowering premiums.
 Principle 1 gives us a better chance of making our hazard-prone areas safer and affordable. Principle 2 implies that we as a society need to recognize that all taxpayers will have to bear a share of this cost. Rather than waiting for the next catastrophe, we can take constructive steps now to protect those in harm's way. In the process we will reduce the likelihood of having to deal with another Katrina-like disaster.

HEADLINE: Chinese Bank's Shares Drop on Ties to U.S. Mortgages

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
After appearing immune to the turmoil engulfing the mortgage market in the United States, China suffered its first serious setback Friday from exposure to subprime loans.
 Investors punished China's flagship lender, Bank of China, after it disclosed the biggest exposure so far of any bank in Asia. Shares in the bank, the second largest in China, fell 5.4 percent in Hong Kong a day after it reported holding almost $9.7 billion in securities backed by subprime mortgages. That is about 3.5 percent of its total securities portfolio. 
 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the biggest Chinese lender, also suffered at the hands of investors after it disclosed that it was holding $1.23 billion in securities backed by such mortgages. Its shares fell 2.4 percent before ending up 0.2 percent. 
 The potential for losses on these investments is a blow to the two state-controlled lenders, which have been at the forefront of China's efforts to clean up its vast, inefficient banking system and halt the accumulation of bad loans.
 China has spent more than $280 billion since 1998 to clear bad loans from the books of its state-controlled banks and prepare them for competition from foreign banks, which are beginning to expand their operations in mainland cities.
 Banking experts remain confident that any losses arising from subprime loans suffered by Bank of China, the Chinese bank with the biggest exposure to foreign markets, were unlikely to seriously jeopardize its financial performance.
 ''We expect the losses are not going to be unbearable,'' said Charlene Chu, a banking analyst with Fitch Ratings in Beijing. ''They should be able to absorb them pretty easily.''
 But the unexpectedly high combined exposure the two Hong Kong-listed banks have to these loans has clearly rattled investors.
 The value of Bank of China's holdings of securities backed by the American mortgages is roughly equal to its 2006 operating profit, analysts said.
 A third state-controlled Chinese bank, China Construction Bank, which has also floated a minority of its shares in Hong Kong in recent years, is expected to come under close scrutiny Monday when it reports its first-half results.
 Before Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank reported their exposure Thursday, tight Chinese capital controls, restrictions on investing overseas and a strictly controlled media had left many with the impression that the world's fastest-growing major economy was insulated from the subprime crisis.
 As foreign markets have plunged on fears of a credit squeeze, the Chinese stock market has continued to power ahead, rising almost 90 percent this year on top of a 130 percent increase in 2006.
 Analysts noted that despite slumping in Hong Kong, shares in both banks gained ground Friday in Shanghai, possibly because the state-controlled media highlighted both banks' strong profit growth rather than their subprime exposure.
 And as central banks around the world have pumped liquidity into the financial system and eased interest rates to calm markets, China has continued to soak up cash in the economy and increase the cost of borrowing.
 China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, raised interest rates this week for the fourth time this year in an effort to slow growth and contain soaring consumer prices.
 For Chinese banks, an extended period of economic growth has allowed them to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their lending practices, according to most banking experts.
 According to official statistics, nonperforming loans account for about 7 percent of all lending on the books of commercial banks in China, a sharp decline from the early years of this decade when the ratio was estimated to be as high as 25 percent.
 Some critics of Chinese banking changes point out, however, that one reason for this apparent improvement is that lending has increased rapidly in recent years. With more new loans on the books, bad loans have shrunk as a proportion of overall lending.
 The danger for China is that in the event of an economic slowdown, a new wave of nonperforming loans could wash through the banking system.
 In announcing a 52 percent increase in profit for the first half, which stood at $3.9 billion, Bank of China said $150 million had been set aside to cover any losses on its subprime investment. So far, no losses have been booked.
 ''In the future, we will closely monitor changes and prudently manage our asset portfolio to effectively control market risk,'' the bank said.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Boasts of Big Surplus; Reality Is More Complicated

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani has been broadcasting radio advertisements in Iowa and other states far from the city he once led stating that as mayor of New York, he ''turned a $2.3 billion deficit into a multibillion dollar surplus.''
 The assertion, which Mr. Giuliani has repeated on the trail as he has promoted his fiscal conservatism, is somewhat misleading, independent fiscal monitors said. In fact, Mr. Giuliani left his successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, with a bigger deficit than the one Mr. Giuliani had to deal with when he arrived in 1994. And that deficit would have been large even if the city had not been attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. 
 ''He inherited a gap, and he left a gap for his successor,'' Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the city's Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that monitors the city budget, said of Mr. Giuliani. ''The city was budgeting as though the good times were not going to end, but sooner or later they always do.''
 The Giuliani campaign defended the advertisement, noting that it merely states that Mr. Giuliani created a multibillion-dollar surplus, not that he passed one on to his successor. 
 Mr. Giuliani's eight years of fiscal stewardship of the city was initially marked by a new brand of conservative budgeting principles in which he cut spending, cut taxes and cut the payroll. Later, when the booming stock market of the late 1990s pumped revenues into the city's coffers, Mr. Giuliani was able to cut taxes, increase spending above the rate of inflation, and still post big surpluses. 
 But the economy cooled near the end of Mr. Giuliani's second term, and he spent most of the roughly $3 billion surplus he had accumulated to balance his final budget, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002. Even before the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Giuliani projected that his successor would face a $2.8 billion gap the next year. After the attacks, that gap climbed to $4.8 billion in a $42.3 billion budget.
 Faced with such a huge deficit, which continued to grow as the economic aftershocks of the attacks continued and the costs of some of the Giuliani administration's policies came due, the next mayor, Mr. Bloomberg, was forced to take the extraordinary steps of borrowing to pay for operating expenses, cutting programs, and raising property taxes by 18.5 percent to balance the budget.
 Joseph J. Lhota, a former budget director and deputy mayor to Mr. Giuliani, said that Mr. Giuliani kept the rate of spending growth during his eight years in office below that of the state and federal governments, and most other states. Mr. Lhota credited Mr. Giuliani with making tax cuts a priority for the city -- Mr. Giuliani often speaks of having cut taxes 23 times -- and of using the budget to push his priorities, like beefing up public safety. 
 ''Prior to Mayor Giuliani, there never was a discussion of lowering taxes in New York,'' Mr. Lhota said. ''By the end the debate became, 'Which taxes should we cut?' ''
 Mr. Lhota said that the Giuliani administration cut the budget shortly before leaving office to leave the city in a better position. He noted that the fiscal year in which Mr. Bloomberg took over from Mr. Giuliani ended with a surplus of $677 million. But that surplus was fed in part by nearly $500 million in borrowing by the Bloomberg administration. And it made only a small dent in the huge gap Mr. Bloomberg had to close that June in his first budget -- a gap inherited from the Giuliani administration, much of which was expected even before Sept. 11.
 Mr. Giuliani often promotes his fiscal conservatism on the campaign trail to try to appeal to Republican voters who might be wary of his support of abortion rights, gun control and gay rights. But an examination of his fiscal record as mayor of New York City shows that his legacy defies easy ideological labeling.
 Mr. Giuliani took office in 1994 and immediately administered a strong dose of fiscally conservative policies on a city known for generous social services programs and union contracts. The city was near the end of a long economic downturn, and Mr. Giuliani cut taxes while slashing the work force and curbing spending to close the $2.3 billion budget gap he inherited.
 Mr. Lhota said the administration faced a severe cash crunch when it took office. Abraham M. Lackman, Mr. Giuliani's first budget director, said that in addition to having to close a $2.3 billion deficit in its first budget, the administration took office worrying that it might not have enough cash on hand to meet payroll because some of the revenues that were counted on in the inherited budget were not likely to materialize.
 Mr. Giuliani pushed through an austere budget that year. He went on to push mergers of city agencies, incorporating the old transit and housing police forces into the New York Police Department. He sold the city's television station. And he cut taxes.
 But Mr. Giuliani eased up on the reins of spending during his second term, as the stock market boom pumped tax revenues into the city coffers. An analysis by the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed fiscal watchdog group, found that spending rose an average of 6.3 percent a year during Mr. Giuliani's second term -- well above the rate of inflation. And Mr. Giuliani went on a hiring spree, in the end leaving the city work force slightly bigger than he found it, but changing its composition by adding more teachers and police officers while shedding jobs in social services agencies.
 In 2000, near the height of the stock market boom, Mr. Giuliani supported a measure to put less money in the pension funds for the city's retirees. By recognizing the funds' investment gains at once -- instead of phasing them in over years to smooth out sharp gains and losses -- he was able to spend $800 million over two years that the city otherwise would have had to invest in its pension funds. Fiscal monitors, including the city comptroller's office, warned that the practice was irresponsible, because the money could be needed to cushion the blow of a market downturn. 
 To win the support of the city's unions, which needed to sign off on the pension change, Mr. Giuliani agreed to sweeten the pensions of city workers, eliminating the payments that some were required to contribute to the pension system and giving others up to two years of credit toward their retirements. 
 ''I've never had a negotiation that went so smoothly or so effectively,'' recalled Randi Weingarten, who had a seat at the table as the chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, an umbrella group of city unions. 
 But when Mr. Bloomberg took office amid a deteriorating economy, the value of the pension funds dropped significantly, forcing the new mayor to pump more money into them when the city could least afford to. 
 Long before Sept. 11, fiscal monitors warned that Mr. Giuliani's last budget would leave his successor facing a big gap. In the spring of 2001, the state comptroller's office said that the city was projecting the largest out-year gaps in a generation.
 E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization that has often been supportive of Mr. Giuliani, wrote an article that July warning that ''Seven years after Mayor Giuliani led New York out of its last fiscal crisis, the city's budget has now come almost full circle.''

HEADLINE: An Economist's Task: Building a Model for His People

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
Ramallah, West Bank
 THE first time Salam Fayyad was in the Oval Office, he did not know where he was. He got a hint when President Bush walked in with an upraised arm, giving the ''Hook 'em Horns'' sign.
 Mr. Bush may not have been fortunate enough to go to the University of Texas, having been exiled to Yale. But Mr. Fayyad earned a Ph.D. in economics in Austin. He follows the Texas football team, and his eldest son, Khaled, just started college there.
 Mr. Fayyad, 55, the non-Hamas prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, considers his real alma mater American University of Beirut, where he graduated in 1975. Its motto, he says, is, ''That they may have life and have it more abundantly.'' 
 That is his hope for the Palestinian people, and his own difficult, ambitious and dicey task. 
 Although he is appointed, and though the Palestinian legislature is not functioning and there is no democratic oversight, Mr. Fayyad has decided to press ahead, as he says, ''to undo, as best and fast as we can, the damage sustained over the last two years,'' both financially and institutionally. ''This is about putting things right, about doing things right.''
 The Palestinians, he said, have work to do. ''The Palestinians have to show up,'' he said. ''You can sit there and say how unfair the world is. Or you try to do something about it.''
 The world wants improvements in security and governance. ''But these things are important from our point of view, that matter to our own people,'' he said. ''They are things we have to do anyway to be worthy of anything in the eyes of our own people.''
 He has moved with mixed success to pull armed men from Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades of Fatah off the streets in return for a promise by Israel that they will no longer be hunted. He wants to bar anyone from carrying arms who is not part of the already numerous official security services. 
 ''So long as militias exist outside the Palestinian Authority, we are open to sliding back into the abyss,'' he said.
 And he has taken some 31,000 people off the payroll -- most of them appointed by Fatah, trying to buy votes before the January 2006 election -- who were hired after December 2005.
 SPEAKING in an interview of nearly two hours in his office, Mr. Fayyad was congenial and detailed. He speaks a rapid English, often punctuated with the phrase, ''quite frankly,'' and can go happily off on tangents about Texas, his children or how the International Monetary Fund, where he spent much of his professional life, is so badly misunderstood.
 In an emergency government -- now a caretaker government, after the firing of the one led by Hamas -- Mr. Fayyad is both chef and bottle washer: prime minister, finance minister and foreign minister. While leaving peace negotiations to the elected Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, Mr. Fayyad is a one-stop shop for the West, which is eager to restore the flow of aid it cut off when Hamas took power. 
 ''There's a strong sense that Fayyad wants to do the right thing and is trying to do the right thing,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader, after a meeting in Ramallah. ''We trust that Fayyad won't steal or misappropriate money. Not to say some won't be, but everyone wants to strengthen Abbas and Fayyad, those who are positive and helpful, instead of those, like Hamas, who are negative and dangerous.''
 Mr. Fayyad may be a fragile reed for all these hopes, however. He is not a natural politician and lacks charisma. His circle of loyal supporters is small and elite. He is likely to be too much of a technocrat for Palestinian politics. And his conviction that armed resistance is counterproductive is not widely shared, certainly not by Hamas, or even by the many gunmen of Fatah.
 To be the favorite Palestinian of Israel and Washington is not a recipe for popularity either, and it may actually be dangerous.
 Mr. Fayyad is nervous about being seen as the Palestinians' last or best hope, but he is not shy about his talents -- or about how large a job he faces.
 ''The peace process is important, of course,'' he said. ''But I'm trying to make sure that everything happens that needs to happen to make it work.'' He has an economist's criticism of the peace effort. ''There was no productivity to speak of,'' he said. ''Look at the time and energy that went into meetings -- it was pathetic, quite frankly, how little was agreed and how little of that was implemented, if ever.''
 Peace should be pursued, he said, but differently, simultaneously with his effort to build the basics of Palestinian statehood. Peace talks, he said, should ''run parallel with the issues of the here and now'' -- job creation, training, security reform and a loosening of Israeli security restrictions that help prevent terrorism but also stifle the Palestinian economy.
 Small improvements on access or checkpoints or prisoner releases should not hide the real issue, he said: ''We need to get our freedom. That's what this is about. And the economy won't get it done. The issue is political.'' The debate is too often only about security, he said. ''Security is as much a Palestinian need as an Israeli need, even more so, quite frankly. Look at the lawlessness and what happened in Gaza.''
 There are 542 checkpoints, including temporary ones, in the West Bank now, he said. ''Is it possible to justify each and every measure on security grounds? Is the humiliation our people feel at these checkpoints, is it all justified by security?''
 About Hamas, Mr. Fayyad is scornful. ''It's my full intention to disappoint Hamas,'' he said. ''I want to disappoint them -- to hell with it -- that's not who we are!''
 He continued: ''Who says we should submit to a message of hate from the mosques? I'm a Muslim, too. I don't accept that this is our face to the world!'' Practical problems, he said, cannot be solved by ideology.
 Mr. Abbas and Mr. Fayyad hope to create a West Bank model to inspire Palestinians and defeat the challenge of Hamas and the strategy of armed resistance. ''We do have an alternative,'' Mr. Fayyad said. ''We offer a fully integrated vision, and I'm confident that Gaza will be reintegrated into the West Bank.'' 
 Others are less confident, and there are many in Israel who expect Mr. Fayyad and this latest peace effort to fail, done in by anarchy, terrorism and fierce politics. 
 MR. FAYYAD grew up near Tulkarm in the West Bank and met his wife, Bashaer, a Jerusalemite, in Beirut in 1986. They have three children, all born in America, and live in east Jerusalem.
 Mr. Fayyad lived in the United States until 1995, before the International Monetary Fund sent him to the West Bank and Gaza from 1996 to 2001. By June 2002, a desperate Yasir Arafat, pressed to clean up Palestinian finances, named Mr. Fayyad finance minister. He stuck it out until December 2005, when he quit, disgusted with an ill-advised raise granted to a bloated civil service. 
 He decided to run in the January 2006 legislative elections as the leader of a new party, The Third Way, with Hanan Ashrawi, a Christian. The third way proved narrow and short, winning only 2.4 percent of the vote and electing only the two leaders.
 When Mr. Abbas decided to form a unity government with Hamas, Mr. Fayyad became finance minister and urged the West to renew aid and Israel to release taxes it was withholding. In June, Gaza collapsed into civil war; Mr. Abbas fired the government and named Mr. Fayyad prime minister. When he was sworn in, he did not trust himself to speak about Gaza to the Gazans without breaking down. ''So I prerecorded it,'' he said.
 It is obvious that Israelis and Palestinians need to live together, he said. ''There should be no question in anybody's mind in Israel that this is what this is about, in a way that leads to us living like them, as free people, in a country of our own, right next door to them. It's not that we have to; we want to. So let's skip the preliminaries and the polemics, and let's get on with it.''

HEADLINE: WITH TROOP RISE, IRAQI DETAINEES SOAR IN NUMBER

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
The number of detainees held by the American-led military forces in Iraq has swelled by 50 percent under the troop increase ordered by President Bush, with the inmate population growing to 24,500 today from 16,000 in February, according to American military officers in Iraq.
 The detainee increase comes, they said, because American forces are operating in areas where they had not been present for some time, and because more units are able to maintain a round-the-clock presence in some areas. They also said more Iraqis were cooperating with military forces. 
 Nearly 85 percent of the detainees in custody are Sunni Arabs, the minority faction in Iraq that ruled the country under the government of Saddam Hussein; the other detainees are Shiites, the officers say.
 Military officers said that of the Sunni detainees, about 1,800 claim allegiance to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown extremist group that American intelligence agencies have concluded is foreign-led. About 6,000 more identify themselves as takfiris, or Muslims who believe some other Muslims are not true believers. Such believers view Shiite Muslims as heretics.
 Those statistics would seem to indicate that the main inspiration of the hard-core Sunni insurgency is no longer a desire to restore the old order -- a movement that drew from former Baath Party members and security officials who had served under Mr. Hussein -- and has become religious and ideological.
 But the officers say an equally large number of Iraqi detainees say money is a significant reason they planted roadside bombs or shot at Iraqi and American-led forces.
 ''Interestingly, we've found that the vast majority are not inspired by jihad or hate for the coalition or Iraqi government -- the vast majority are inspired by money,'' said Capt. John Fleming of the Navy, a spokesman for the multinational forces' detainee operations. The men are paid by insurgent leaders. ''The primary motivator is economic -- they're angry men because they don't have jobs,'' he said. ''The detainee population is overwhelmingly illiterate and unemployed. Extremists have been very successful at spreading their ideology to economically strapped Iraqis with little to no formal education.''
 But the detention system itself often serves as a breeding ground for the insurgency and a training opportunity for those who, after they are released, may attack Iraqi or American-led forces, military officers say. 
 According to statistics supplied by the headquarters of Task Force 134, the American military unit in charge of detention operations in Iraq, there are about 280 detainees from countries other than Iraq. Of those, 55 are identified as Egyptian, 53 as Syrian, 37 as Saudi, 28 as Jordanian and 24 as Sudanese.
 Some foreign fighters are difficult to identify with certainty, the officers said, because they tried to conceal their identities with forged documents and aliases.
 About 800 juveniles are held in the American internment facilities. The officers said insurgent groups had used them to plant roadside bombs and to serve as lookouts, assuming that American and Iraqi forces and their allies would not see them as suspicious. Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, returned this week from a seven-day visit to Iraq that included tours of the detention facilities, and he said Friday that a six-room schoolhouse is operating for the education of the juveniles.
 For the adults in detention, he said, the goal was to separate ''the worst of the worst'' from the other detainees, so hard-core insurgents and suspects have less chance to influence other detainees. A current goal is to set up a brick factory and a textile mill where adult detainees would work, he said.
 Over all, the average length of detention is about a year, the officers said. So far this year, 3,334 detainees have been released, they said. Military officers in Iraq said the growing detainee population had not strained the internment system, nor had it hindered combat operations.
 In preparation for the troop increase ordered by President Bush in January, plans were made to increase the number of detention officers and to build extra space for detainees. The task force is expanding the internment facilities at Camp Bucca, in southern Iraq, and Camp Cropper, near Baghdad, with the help of the Army Corps of Engineers.
 The most notorious of the detention centers, at Abu Ghraib prison, is no longer used by American-led forces to hold captured insurgents. Images of American jailers abusing their detainees at Abu Ghraib stained the reputation of American fighting forces in Iraq.
 Few reliable numbers exist for those detained by the Iraqi government, according to John Sifton, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, an advocacy organization. The American military in Iraq will not provide numbers for detainees held by the government of Iraq.
 ''The allegations of abuse are far worse for Iraqi facilities than for those detainees in U.S. custody,'' he said. ''It is difficult to know the Iraqi detainee population. There are both official and unofficial Iraqi detention systems.''
 Over all, he said, human rights organizations ''have concerns about a 50 percent increase in detainees because it is 50 percent more people at risk of having been arbitrarily detained or, worse, of being handed over to Iraqi officers who might subject them to torture.''

HEADLINE: New York's Toxic Tower

 BODY:
With each day's news about the dismantling of the old Deutsche Bank building at the World Trade Center site, blame for the deaths and injuries of New York firefighters spreads. Contractors, workers, inspectors, city and state officials -- the list of the accused is growing extremely long. Enough. It is a time to find out what went wrong, fix it and devise a workable way to deconstruct this dangerous structure safely and soon. 
 Because this is a state-owned site, Gov. Eliot Spitzer will have to deal with failures of contractors at this building even if they were hired on his predecessor's watch. And Mayor Michael Bloomberg will have to deal with faulty or missing inspections by the city's building and fire departments. The two leaders or their representatives should sit down with all the various agencies and inspectors and demolition experts to figure out how to undo this tower safely. 
 Ever since it was damaged on Sept. 11, 2001, this shrouded building has stood as concrete evidence of all the ways rebuilding downtown could be delayed. There were battles over insurance, politics, possible toxic dust and concerns of victims' families that the building still contained DNA from the twin towers. And with all the government agencies and community concerns over how to demolish this building, it was apparently extremely difficult to find anyone to do the work.
 One subcontractor with no real experience in demolition and a few shady connections in the building trades has been dismissed. Apparently even with inspectors from city, state and federal agencies, their work created problems. After two firefighters were killed on Aug. 18, investigators found that the standpipe, a kind of vertical hydrant for skyscrapers, was damaged and even missing in part. The fire department had not inspected that pipe for months, but a city inspector had apparently found at least parts of it O.K. days before the fire. 
 One view is that the focus on environmental and community concerns meant that the skyscraper had to be plucked apart, beam by beam. Fear of escaping asbestos dust led workers to seal the floors and the stairways in heavy plastic with no real plan for what would happen if firefighters had to break through to fight a fire.
 Rather than use too much energy on finger-pointing, Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Bloomberg should gather all involved to correct mistakes and move forward. This time, planners will have to focus not just on toxic dust or possible DNA, but on bringing this specter down safely for the community, the workers and first responders.

HEADLINE: Wachovia Sues Mortgage Specialist Firm in Dispute Over Collateral

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Wachovia Corporation, the bank based in Charlotte, N.C., has sued the jumbo-mortgage specialist Thornburg Mortgage for failing to return collateral used in a derivatives transaction.
 Wachovia, in a complaint filed Thursday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, said that Thornburg had not returned $5.12 million that it owed since Aug. 13 after the companies agreed to unwind a series of interest rate swaps, the bank said in a complaint filed Thursday and made public yesterday. 
 The complaint states that Thornburg is ''willfully'' breaching an agreement to return the money and that the company had said it intended to ''pay other, unrelated counterparties with which it has established business relationships before it pays Wachovia.''
 Thornburg, which stopped taking loan applications this month because of a cash shortage, sold $20.5 billion worth of securities at a discount last week to pay down debt it could not refinance. The company said it would record a $930 million loss in the third quarter on the sale, resulting in a probable net loss for the year.
 ''We are surprised by Wachovia's complaint,'' a Thornburg spokeswoman, Suzanne Lopez, said in a telephone interview. ''As previously agreed to by both parties, Thornburg Mortgage will fulfill its obligation to Wachovia'' on Monday.
 Also yesterday, the rating agency, Fitch Ratings, cut its mortgage servicer assessments of the Countrywide Financial Corporation and GMAC because of challenges to their ''liquidity position and financial flexibility.''
 And the Bank of America Corporation said yesterday that it had received an exemption that allowed it to borrow up to $25 billion from the Federal Reserve for providing credit through its affiliates to clients like hard-pressed mortgage lenders.
 The bank, which disclosed the exemption in a regulatory filing, has not yet made such transfers. It was granted the right by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors on Sunday, a Bank of America spokesman, Robert Strickland, said.
 On Monday, Citigroup was granted a similar exemption for $25 billion, the Fed secretary, Robert de V. Frierson, told Carl Howard, the Citigroup general counsel, in a letter. 
 Transfers to securities affiliates make it easier for banks that have large Wall Street operations to finance the mortgage lenders. Lenders have found it difficult to raise cash as investors shun mortgage-backed securities because of rising defaults by borrowers.

HEADLINE: A Treaty Whose Time Has Come

 BODY:
A solemn international treaty known as the Law of the Sea Convention will celebrate its 25th anniversary this December, and for 25 years the mere mention of its name has been enough to induce deep slumber. Yet for all kinds of reasons -- not least growing fears about the availability of energy resources -- people are finally paying attention. That includes the Senate, where right-wing scare tactics and official inertia have long blocked the treaty's ratification, leaving America as the only major power standing on the sidelines. 
 That could change this fall, when the treaty will again be presented for Senate approval. One reason for optimism is that President Bush has added his voice to a diverse pro-treaty coalition that includes the environmental community, fishing interests, the oil and gas industry, the shipping industry, the State Department and the Navy.
But the main reason is this: unless the United States joins up, it could very well lose out in what is shaping up as a mad scramble to lay claim to what are believed to be immense deposits of oil, gas and other resources under the Arctic ice -- deposits that are becoming more and more accessible as the earth warms and the ice melts.
 The Law of the Sea will provide the forum for determining who gets what. The law gives each nation control over its own coastal waters -- an ''exclusive economic zone'' extending 200 miles offshore. The rest is regarded as international waters, subject to agreed-upon rules governing fishing, protection of the marine environment, navigation and mining on the ocean floor. A country can claim territory and mineral deposits beyond the 200-mile limit, but only if it can prove that the seabed is a physical extension of its continental shelf. Claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration panels established by the treaty.
 The Russians, the Canadians and the Danes are all busily staking claims to thousands of square miles of the Arctic seabed beyond their 200-mile zones; the Russians have already planted a flag 15,000 feet under the North Pole. And two weeks ago, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, Healy, embarked on the third in a series of polar mapping expeditions to help strengthen the United States' territorial claims to the seabed off Alaska. 
 But the United States will have a hard time pressing those claims unless it ratifies the treaty and gets a seat at the negotiating table. One of the main right-wing arguments over the years is that the treaty would threaten American sovereignty by impeding unfettered exploitation of the ocean's resources -- a ''giant giveaway of American wealth,'' in the words of one critic. The facts suggest just the reverse. By not signing, we could easily find ourselves out of the hunt altogether.

HEADLINE: Praising Private Equity

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
THE conventional wisdom is that private equity firms are focused strictly on the short term.
 The conventional wisdom is wrong, argues Walter Kiechel III, the former editorial director of Harvard Business School Publishing.
 True, he concedes, private equity firms often load debt onto the public companies they acquire, sell off assets and then dispose of the acquired business in a relatively short time.
 But what is really going on, he contends in The Harvard Business Review, is that private equity firms are simply applying, albeit very quickly, the best of classic strategic thinking, and their actions can actually improve the acquired company's long-term performance. The fact that a private equity firm sells the company within a relatively short period is irrelevant. 
 Mr. Kiechel says the important thing is to look at the actions of the private equity firms. By using leverage efficiently, relentlessly cutting costs and determining the company's major competitive advantage -- and disposing of all assets that do not support it -- they are actually positioning the companies they are acquiring to succeed for the long haul. 
 ''The difference between the conventional and the P.E. approach to strategy is that the private equity buckoes put their acquisitions through the formulate-a-strategy-and-start-implementing-it process in months rather than years,'' he says. MORE GOVERNMENT BENEFICIARIES The opening sure does get your attention.
 ''More than half of all Americans -- 53 percent -- now depend on government for their income,'' Katherine Mangu-Ward writes in Reason.
 The research comes from the economist A. Gary Shilling, who totaled ''federal, state, and local government workers, plus private-sector workers who owe their jobs to the government, plus recipients of Social Security, other transfer payments and benefits such as food stamps.'' As startling as that 53 percent figure is, it is not a record high. In 1980, 55 percent of Americans were receiving money from the government in one form or another.
 CUTTING DEBT ''Two-thirds of all college graduates in America leave school with student loan debt -- to the tune of $20,000 on average,'' Lynnette Khalfani writes in BeE Woman, a relatively new magazine.
 Depressing though that can be, Ms. Khalfani outlines the following five strategies to reduce or eliminate that indebtedness:
 Negotiate. The interest rate on federal student loans is not an absolute. While Congress sets a maximum rate, lenders are free to charge less. ''Ask for a lower rate in exchange for having payments automatically deducted from your checking and/or because you have a history of paying on time,'' she suggests.
 Make the boss pay. Many employers will do so, Ms. Khalfani says, if you agree to stay with the company for a certain amount of time.
 Work for the federal government. Under the Federal Student Loan Repayment Program, a federal agency can pay off up to $10,000 of your student loan annually, up to a maximum of $60,000.
 Cite hardships. Sallie Mae, the nation's biggest student lender, offers deferments for ''nearly 20 different scenarios,'' she says. Stay-at-home mothers with babies, new mothers re-entering the work force, the unemployed and military enlistees all qualify, she says.
 Do good. Police officers, lawyers, teachers, nurses and doctors can have their loans forgiven, under certain conditions. 
 FINAL TAKE This comes courtesy of Money magazine, citing research done by Capital One: ''More Americans use a piggy bank (42 percent) or change jar (65 percent) than a money market account (35 percent.)''

HEADLINE: 'Kid Nation' Lesson: Be Careful What You Pitch

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
''Forty kids. One town. No adults.''
 That is the pitch CBS has been using for the last three months to promote its new reality show, ''Kid Nation,'' which took 40 children to the New Mexico desert for 40 days and asked them to try to build a working community.
 But in the last week, as the show came under scrutiny, CBS has been taking pains to assert that ''Kid Nation'' was, in fact, crawling with adults: child psychologists, pediatricians and paramedics, all of them closely watching over the children. 
 That is but one example in which CBS seems to be trying to have it both ways. The network also promotes ''Kid Nation,'' scheduled to have its premiere on Sept. 19, as portraying ''a working kid economy'' in which the children, ages 8 to 15, take part in team contests as dictated by the producers ''to determine their paycheck and role'' in the town's socioeconomic structure.
 The network, on the other hand, maintains that the children were not ''employed,'' and therefore were not subject to New Mexico's child-labor laws, because they were not performing specific tasks for specific wages.
 And while CBS has insisted that the children benefited from having medical personnel on call at all times, the network required the children and their parents -- who were not allowed to contact the children during the 40-day production -- to sign a waiver agreeing that CBS was not responsible for any harm coming from medical care given to their children. 
 That waiver also included a statement saying that CBS and the producers were not responsible for ensuring the medical credentials of someone who might treat, or perform emergency surgery on, the children.
 The circumstances surrounding ''Kid Nation'' have now prompted the New Mexico attorney general to reopen an investigation into whether the network violated state law with the production. 
 Chris Ender, a spokesman for CBS, said on Friday that the ''no adults'' line promoting ''Kid Nation'' referred ''to what viewers will see on camera'' and not to the idea that no adults were present. He also repeated a previous CBS statement that the program was ''a voluntary television experience'' for the children that was ''filmed responsibly and within all applicable laws in the state of New Mexico.''
 Since their beginning, reality shows, known in the trade as unscripted programming, have danced around the idea that any of the action they present is predetermined. Reality-show producers have long employed writers to invent scenarios, suggest story lines and even feed dialogue to participants. At the same time, the producers and the networks have maintained that the participants are not actors and the people working on the show are not writers, and that therefore they are not subject to union rules dictating work conditions on television productions.
 On Friday, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the union that represents performers but not contestants on reality shows, said it was investigating whether the children on ''Kid Nation'' should have been covered by the union's work rules.
 With ''Kid Nation,'' CBS confronted several new situations created by the fact that it was working with children rather than adults.
 If ''Kid Nation'' had been set in California, New York or several other states, it would have been subject to laws that limit the amount of time a child could spend on the set of the program each day. It chose instead to shoot the program in New Mexico, where until this summer there was no law addressing children's work on television or film productions.
 That is not to say that New Mexico had not contemplated such limits. Before CBS took the 40 children to the state, its Legislature had already passed a bill that would have outlawed much of what CBS had planned. 
 On April 3, two days after CBS started shooting the 13-episode reality series, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico signed the bill into law. It limits children ages 8 to 15 to eight to nine hours' work a day on television and film productions. 
 On the set of ''Kid Nation,'' the children regularly worked more than 12 hours a day, and their contract required that they be available to the show's producers to be videotaped 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
 But because the new law was not scheduled to go into effect until June 15, roughly one month after ''Kid Nation'' finished production, lawyers for CBS have contended that everything they did was in compliance with the law ''in effect at the time of production.''
 But it is not clear whether CBS was in compliance. New Mexico child-labor statutes limit children under the age of 14 to 44 hours of work in one week and eight hours in any day, unless a special permit has been granted. CBS neither applied for nor received work permits for the children.
 While CBS asserted that the children were not employed, the New Mexico law also states that the frequent presence during school hours of a child under 16 ''at a place where workers are at work more or less habitually shall be prima facie evidence'' that the child is ''unlawfully engaged in labor.''
 CBS has said that many adults were present at the show's production site, but it has never argued that those adults were not working or that the site was not a work site for them.
 CBS also characterized ''Kid Nation'' to the parents of the children as a camp, but New Mexico state officials have countered that the production did not comply with New Mexico laws regarding the licensing of camps or group housing for children.
 Camp or not, work or not, adults or not, legal or not -- those are questions that would seem to have just one answer. Determining the answers is no longer simply up to CBS, but to the New Mexico attorney general as well.

HEADLINE: A Line Of Dolls Enters The '70s

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Nine-year-old Julie Albright likes to wear her long blond hair loose, with a single thin braid in the front. With her parents divorcing, and with her move from a big house in San Francisco to a smaller apartment across town, she is trying to adapt to a bewildering web of changes, just like a lot of other children growing up in the 1970s.
 Except she is 18 inches tall. 
 Julie and her Chinese-American friend, Ivy, are the latest additions to American Girl's fabulously popular line of historical dolls and books. Scheduled to be introduced on Sept. 10 in the company's stores in New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles, these West Coast girls are the first new characters in the series in five years and the first to be situated in an era so close to the present. Girls who grew up playing with Dawn and Chatty Cathy can now watch their own daughters play with a doll version of themselves.
 ''We have high expectations and hopes for this character, because it's striking such a powerful connection between girls and their moms,'' said Julia Prohaska, the company's senior director of marketing. ''It will become the new gold standard.''
 But don't expect Julie to be dragged to a peace rally or to Haight-Ashbury for a Summer of Love flashback. Or to talk about Watergate, the hostages in Iran, the fall of Saigon, the recession, the oil crisis, the Jonestown suicides, gay rights, affirmative action, President Richard M. Nixon's pardon, Love Canal, Roe v. Wade or the radioactive leak at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. 
 ''We don't take a political stand,'' Ms. Prohaska is quick to say. ''It isn't our job to tell them what is right or wrong.'' She adds that ''we tackled some of the tricky stuff of the '70s in an age-appropriate way.'' 
 Until now, the most recent period that the company has touched has been the Second World War. Other dolls reach further back into the past: Felicity is growing up in colonial Williamsburg, Va., Kirsten is a pioneer on the prairie, and Addy is a slave trying to escape to the North during the Civil War. These historical periods are not without political passion, but they are much more distant than the '70s, when today's culture wars took root. 
 So the seven books that accompany the dolls focus on social changes like mothers in the workplace, divorce, immigration and greater opportunities for girls in sports and education. Ms. Prohaska said the dolls took about three years to develop, with a team of historians, researchers, editors and others working together. 
 The Julie figure is important to the brand. American Girl has sold more than 117 million books and 13 million dolls since 1986, but sales slowed last year. Julie and Ivy dolls will each cost $92 and come with a hardcover book ($87 with the paperback). 
 Ms. Prohaska said the company, when choosing the next character, considered various time periods, but the '70s quickly rose to the top.
 ''One of the first things that came to mind was the bicentennial in the mid-'70s,'' said Megan McDonald, who wrote the six Julie books and is also the author of another children's book series, ''Judy Moody,'' for Candlewick Press. ''The '70s really was trying to return to optimism after the Vietnam War and Watergate. The bicentennial was a good way to show that the country was trying to heal and celebrate.'' 
 As for the country's divisions, Ms. McDonald said, the divorce of Julie's parents reflects that theme. 
 She said that American Girl sent a historian, Mark Speltz, to help with her research, and that they would take walking tours through San Francisco. ''I could call him and say, 'Could you find any Christmas ornaments that were handmade in the '70s?' and he would go back and look at old magazines and send me clips.'' 
 Controlling the characters' image is clearly important to the company. Could Mr. Speltz comment? No, said Stephanie Spanos, a public relations manager, sounding as if she had been asked to hand over the secrets from the Manhattan Project. Only designated American Girl spokespeople can speak to the press. 
 Ms. McDonald, fortunately, was one of the chosen few. ''I was able to draw on my experiences,'' she said. ''I had four teenage sisters, so, for example, where Julie's older sister rolled her hair with orange juice cans, those were things that came from my own childhood.
 ''Moms flipping through the book will say, 'Oh, we did that.' ''

 BODY:
THE GREAT DELUGE: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast, by Douglas Brinkley. (Harper Perennial, $17.95.) Interviewing hundreds of Katrina survivors, disaster responders and public officials, Brinkley, a professor of history at Tulane University in New Orleans, weaves their stories into a narrative of the hurricane's first week. ''The Great Deluge'' harshly criticizes the inept response of the White House; FEMA; the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin; and the city's police department, while crediting those who filled the breach. Our reviewer, David Oshinsky, said Brinkley provides ''a ground-level view of human behavior far richer than the breathless news reports that stunned and shamed the nation in the summer of 2005.'' 
 MOONLIGHT HOTEL, by Scott Anderson. (Anchor, $14.95.) Anderson, a veteran war correspondent, sets his incisive satire of American imperialism in a fictional Middle Eastern kingdom of the 1980s, called Kutar. When a tribal conflict escalates -- provoked by an American military adviser -- an idealistic diplomat holes up in a ramshackle hotel, hoping to negotiate a truce. THE SAND CAFA, by Neil MacFarquhar. (PublicAffairs, $14.95.) Set in Saudi Arabia after Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, MacFarquhar's first novel captures the life and work, the pettiness, jealousies and corrosive frustration of the wartime press corps. (MacFarquhar was the Cairo bureau chief for The New York Times from 2001 to 2006.)
 THE PRODUCER: John Hammond and the Soul of American Music, by Dunstan Prial. (Picador, $16.) This is a fascinating biography of John Hammond, the Vanderbilt heir and Columbia Records A & R executive who was a musical force for some 50 years, helping to steer artists from Billie Holiday to Bruce Springsteen.
 WIZARD OF THE CROW, by Ngugi wa Thiong'o. Translated by the author. (Anchor, $16.95.) Ngugi, an exiled Kenyan novelist, playwright and critic, blends satire and polemic in his depiction of an African nation at a crossroads. In the imagined Free Republic of Aburiria, a despot schemes to commemorate his reign by constructing a modern-day Tower of Babel. While businessmen jockey for construction contracts and the unemployed converge in search of work, Kamiti, a beggar with an M.B.A., sets up shop as a sorcerer, counseling citizens who find witchcraft less absurd than everyday life. Complete with tricksters, magic and daring escapes, ''Wizard of the Crow'' is ''steeped in oral traditions,'' Jeff Turrentine wrote here.
 FIVE GERMANYS I HAVE KNOWN, by Fritz Stern. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) Stern, an emeritus professor of European history at Columbia University, looks back over the ''five Germanys'' his generation has seen -- the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, postwar West and East Germany, and the unified country after 1990 -- lending personal power to his scholarship on Germans, Jews and the roots of Nazism.
 HALF LIFE, by Shelley Jackson. (Harper Perennial, $14.95.) Jackson is the author of, among other things, ''Patchwork Girl,'' an acclaimed hypertext novel that reimagines ''Frankenstein.'' In ''Half Life,'' a whirligig of mad science and black comedy, Nora Olney despises her conjoined twin, Blanche, and wants nothing so much as to cut off her pretty but annoying head.
 $40 MILLION SLAVES: The Rise, Fall, and Redemption of the Black Athlete, by William C. Rhoden. (Three Rivers, $13.95.) This provocative book builds a historical framework that both accounts for the varieties of African-American athletic experience in the past and continues to explain them today. Rhoden, a sports columnist for The New York Times, makes the case that the plantation lives on in American sports, in the form of white ownership of black skill and sweat. He recounts the struggles of Jack Johnson, Curt Flood and others, insisting on the importance of black athletes and entrepreneurs gaining organizational and business power in college and professional sports.
 HOLLOW EARTH: The Long and Curious History of Imagining Strange Lands, Fantastical Creatures, and Marvelous Machines Below the Earth's Surface, by David Standish. (Da Capo, $16.95.) Where did the outlandish notion that the earth is hollow come from, and why did it capture imaginations in the 19th century? Standish traces the modern history of the belief to several scientists, including the English astronomer Edmond Halley (remembered widely for his eponymous comet). Ihsan Taylor

HEADLINE: In Nature's Casino

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS. 
Michael Lewis is a contributing writer. The paperback edition of his book ''The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game'' will be published next month.

 BODY:
It was Aug. 24, 2005, and New Orleans was still charming. Tropical Depression 12 was spinning from the Bahamas toward Florida, but the chances of an American city's being destroyed by nature were remote, even for one below sea level. An entire industry of weather bookies -- scientists who calculate the likelihood of various natural disasters -- had in effect set the odds: a storm that destroys $70 billion of insured property should strike the United States only once every 100 years. New Orleanians had made an art form of ignoring threats far more likely than this; indeed, their carelessness was a big reason they were supposedly more charming than other Americans. And it was true: New Orleanians found pleasure even in oblivion. But in their blindness to certain threats, they could not have been more typically American. From Miami to San Francisco, the nation's priciest real estate now faced beaches and straddled fault lines; its most vibrant cities occupied its most hazardous land. If, after World War II, you had set out to redistribute wealth to maximize the sums that might be lost to nature, you couldn't have done much better than Americans had done. And virtually no one -- not even the weather bookies -- fully understood the true odds. 
 But there was an exception: an American so improbably prepared for the havoc Tropical Depression 12 was about to wreak that he might as well have planned it. His name was John Seo, he was 39 years old and he ran a hedge fund in Westport, Conn., whose chief purpose was to persuade investors to think about catastrophe in the same peculiar way that he did. He had invested nearly a billion dollars of other people's money in buying what are known as ''cat bonds.'' The buyer of a catastrophe bond is effectively selling catastrophe insurance. He puts down his money and will lose it all if some specified bad thing happens within a predetermined number of years: a big hurricane hitting Miami, say, or some insurance company losing more than $1 billion on any single natural disaster. In exchange, the cat-bond seller -- an insurance company looking to insure itself against extreme losses -- pays the buyer a high rate of interest. 
 Whatever image pops to mind when you hear the phrase ''hedge fund manager,'' Seo (pronounced so) undermines it. On one hand, he's the embodiment of what Wall Street has become: quantitative. But he's quirky. Less interested in money and more interested in ideas than a Wall Street person is meant to be. He inherited not money but math. At the age of 14, in 1950, his mother fled North Korea on foot, walked through live combat, reached the United States and proceeded to become, reportedly, the first Korean woman ever to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics. His father, a South Korean, also came to the United States for his Ph.D. in math and became a professor of economic theory. Two of his three brothers received Ph.D.'s -- one in biology, the other in electrical engineering. John took a physics degree from M.I.T. and applied to Harvard to study for his Ph.D. As a boy, he says, he conceived the idea that he would be a biophysicist, even though he didn't really know what that meant, because, as he puts it, ''I wanted to solve a big problem about life.'' He earned his doctorate in biophysics from Harvard in three years, a department record. 
 His parents had raised him to think, but his thoughts were interrupted once he left Harvard. His wife was pregnant with their second child, and the health plan at Brandeis University, where he had accepted a job, declared her pregnancy a pre-existing condition. He had no money, his parents had no money, and so to cover the costs of childbirth, he accepted a temp job with a Chicago trading firm called O'Connor and Associates. O'Connor had turned a small army of M.I.T. scientists into options traders and made them rich. Seo didn't want to be rich; he just wanted health insurance. To get it, he agreed to spend eight weeks helping O'Connor price esoteric financial options. When he was done, O'Connor offered him 40 grand and asked him to stay, at a starting salary of $250,000, 27 times his post-doc teaching salary. ''Biophysics was starved for resources,'' Seo says. ''Finance was hurling resources at problems. It was almost as if I was taking it as a price signal. It was society's way of saying, Please, will you start solving problems over here?'' 
 His parents, he suspected, would be appalled. They had sacrificed a lot for his academic career. In the late 1980s, if you walked into the Daylight Donuts shop in Dallas, you would have found a sweet-natured Korean woman in her early 50s cheerfully serving up honey-glazed crullers: John's mom. She had abandoned math for motherhood, and then motherhood for doughnuts, after her most promising son insisted on attending M.I.T. instead of S.M.U., where his tuition would have been free. She needed money, and she got it by buying this doughnut shop and changing the recipe so the glaze didn't turn soggy. (Revenues tripled.) Whatever frustration she may have felt, she hid, as she did most of her emotions. But when John told her that he was leaving the university for Wall Street, she wept. His father, a hard man to annoy, said, ''The devil has come to you as a prostitute and has asked you to lie down with her.''
 A willingness to upset one's mother is usually a promising first step to a conventional Wall Street career. But Seo soon turned Wall Street into his own private science lab, and his continued interest in deep questions mollified even his father. ''Before he got into it, I strongly objected,'' Tae Kun Seo says. ''But now I think he's not just grabbing money.'' He has watched his son quit one firm to go to work for another, but never for a simple promotion; instead, John has moved to learn something new. Still, everywhere he goes, he has been drawn to a similar thorny problem: the right price to charge to insure against potential losses from extremely unlikely financial events. ''Tail risk,'' as it is known to quantitative traders, for where it falls in a bell-shaped probability curve. Tail risk, broadly speaking, is whatever financial cataclysm is believed by markets to have a 1 percent chance or less of happening. In the foreign-exchange market, the tail event might be the dollar falling by one-third in a year; in the bond market, it might be interest rates moving 3 percent in six months; in the stock market, it might be a 30 percent crash. ''If there's been a theme to John's life,'' says his brother Nelson, ''it's pricing tail.''
 And if there has been a theme of modern Wall Street, it's that young men with Ph.D.'s who approach money as science can cause more trouble than a hurricane. John Seo is oddly sympathetic to the complaint. He thinks that much of the academic literature about finance is nonsense, for instance. ''These academics couldn't understand the fact that they couldn't beat the markets,'' he says. ''So they just said it was efficient. And, 'Oh, by the way, here's a ton of math you don't understand.' '' He notes that smart risk-takers with no gift for theory often end up with smart solutions to taking extreme financial risk -- answers that often violate the academic theories. (''The markets are usually way ahead of the math.'') He prides himself on his ability to square book smarts with horse sense. As one of his former bosses puts it, ''John was known as the man who could price anything, and his pricing felt right to people who didn't understand his math.'' 
 In the mid-1990s, when Wall Street first noticed money to be made covering the financial risks associated with hurricanes and earthquakes, it was inevitable that someone would call John Seo to ask him if he could figure out how to make sense of it. Until then, he had specialized in financial, not natural, disasters. But there was a connection between financial catastrophe and natural catastrophe. Both were extreme, both were improbable and both needed to be insured against. The firm that called him was Lehman Brothers, whose offer enticed Seo to quit his job and spend his first year at Lehman learning all he could about the old-fashioned insurance industry. 
 Right away, he could see the problem with natural catastrophe. An insurance company could function only if it was able to control its exposure to loss. Geico sells auto insurance to more than seven million Americans. No individual car accident can be foreseen, obviously, but the total number of accidents over a large population is amazingly predictable. The company knows from past experience what percentage of the drivers it insures will file claims and how much those claims will cost. The logic of catastrophe is very different: either no one is affected or vast numbers of people are. After an earthquake flattens Tokyo, a Japanese earthquake insurer is in deep trouble: millions of customers file claims. If there were a great number of rich cities scattered across the planet that might plausibly be destroyed by an earthquake, the insurer could spread its exposure to the losses by selling earthquake insurance to all of them. The losses it suffered in Tokyo would be offset by the gains it made from the cities not destroyed by an earthquake. But the financial risk from earthquakes -- and hurricanes -- is highly concentrated in a few places.
 There were insurance problems that were beyond the insurance industry's means. Yet insurers continued to cover them, sometimes unenthusiastically, sometimes recklessly. Why didn't insurance companies see this? Seo wondered, and then found the answer: They hadn't listened closely enough to Karen Clark. 
 Thirteen years before what would become Tropical Storm Katrina churned toward Florida -- on Monday, Aug. 24, 1992 -- Karen Clark walked from her Boston office to a nearby Au Bon Pain. Several hours earlier, Hurricane Andrew had struck Florida, and she knew immediately that the event could define her career. Back in 1985, while working for an insurance company, Clark wrote a paper with the unpromising title ''A Formal Approach to Catastrophe Risk Assessment in Management.'' In it, she made the simple point that insurance companies had no idea how much money they might lose in a single storm. For decades Americans had been lurching toward catastrophe. The 1970s and '80s were unusually free of major storms. At the same time, Americans were cramming themselves and their wealth onto the beach. The insurance industry had been oblivious to the trends and continued to price catastrophic risk just as it always had, by the seat of its pants. The big insurance companies ran up and down the Gulf Coast selling as many policies as they could. No one -- not even the supposed experts at Lloyd's of London -- had any idea of the scope of new development and the exposure that the insurance industry now had. 
 To better judge the potential cost of catastrophe, Clark gathered very long-term historical data on hurricanes. ''There was all this data that wasn't being used,'' she says. ''You could take it, and take all the science that also wasn't being used, and you could package it in a model that could spit out numbers companies could use to make decisions. It just seemed like such an obvious thing to do.'' She combined the long-term hurricane record with new data on property exposure -- building-replacement costs by ZIP code, engineering reports, local building codes, etc. -- and wound up with a crude but powerful tool, both for judging the probability of a catastrophe striking any one area and for predicting the losses it might inflict. Then she wrote her paper about it.
 The attention Clark's paper attracted was mostly polite. Two years later, she visited Lloyd's -- pregnant with her first child, hauling a Stone Age laptop -- and gave a speech to actual risk-takers. In nature's casino, they had set themselves up as the house, and yet they didn't know the odds. They assumed that even the worst catastrophe could generate no more than a few billion dollars in losses, but her model was generating insured losses of more than $30 billion for a single storm -- and these losses were far more likely to occur than they had been in the previous few decades. She projected catastrophic storms from the distant past onto the present-day population and storms from the more recent past onto richer and more populated areas than they had actually hit. (If you reran today the hurricane that struck Miami in 1926, for instance, it would take out not the few hundred million dollars of property it destroyed at the time but $60 billion to $100 billion.) ''But,'' she says, ''from their point of view, all of this was just in this computer.'' 
 She spoke for 45 minutes but had no sense that she had been heard. ''The room was very quiet,'' she says. ''No one got up and left. But no one asked questions either. People thought they had already figured it out. They were comfortable with their own subjective judgment.'' Of course they were; they had made pots of money the past 20 years insuring against catastrophic storms. But -- and this was her real point -- there hadn't been any catastrophic storms! The insurers hadn't been smart. They had been lucky. 
 Clark soon found herself in a role for which she was, on the surface at least, ill suited: fanatic. ''I became obsessed with it,'' she says. One big player in the insurance industry took closer notice of her work and paid her enough to start a business. Applied Insurance Research, she called it, or A.I.R. Clark hired a few scientists and engineers, and she set to work acquiring more and better data and building better models. But what she really was doing -- without quite realizing it -- was waiting, waiting for a storm. 
 Hurricane Andrew made landfall at 5 on a Monday morning. By 9 she knew only the path of the storm and its intensity, but the information enabled her to estimate the losses: $13 billion, give or take. If builders in South Florida had ignored the building codes and built houses to lower standards, the losses might come in even higher. She faxed the numbers to insurers, then walked to Au Bon Pain. Everything was suddenly more vivid and memorable. She ordered a smoked-turkey and Boursin cheese sandwich on French bread, with lettuce and tomato, and a large Diet Coke. It was a nice sunny day in Boston. She sat outside at a small black table, alone. ''It was too stressful to be with other people,'' she says. ''I didn't want to even risk a conversation.'' She ate in what she describes as ''a catatonic state.'' The scuttlebutt from Lloyd's already had it that losses couldn't possibly exceed $6 billion, and some thought they were looking at a loss of just a few hundred million. ''No one believed it,'' she says of her estimate. ''No one thought it was right. No one said, 'Yeah, $13 billion sounds like a reasonable number.' '' As she ate, she wondered what $13 billion in losses looked like. 
 When she returned to the office, her phones were ringing. ''People were outraged,'' she says. ''They thought I was crazy.'' One insurance guy called her, chortling. ''A few mobile homes and an Air Force base -- how much could it be?'' he said. 
 It took months for the insurers to tote up their losses: $15.5 billion. (Building codes in South Florida had not been strictly enforced.) Fifteen and a half billion dollars exceeded all of the insurance premiums ever collected in Dade County. Eleven insurance companies went bust. And this wasn't anything like the perfect storm. If it had gone into Miami, it could have bankrupted the whole industry. Clark had been right: the potential financial losses from various catastrophes were too great, and too complicated, to be judged by human intuition. ''No one ever called to congratulate me,'' Clark says, laughing. ''But I had a lot of people call and ask to buy the model.'' 
 After Hurricane Andrew came a shift in the culture of catastrophe. ''This one woman really created the method for valuing this risk,'' says John Seo. Clark's firm, A.I.R., soon had more than 25 Ph.D.'s on staff and two competitors, Eqecat and Risk Management Solutions. In its Bay Area offices, R.M.S. now houses more than 100 meteorologists, seismologists, oceanographers, physicists, engineers and statisticians, and they didn't stop at hurricanes and earthquakes but moved on to flash floods, wildfires, extreme winter storms, tornadoes, tsunamis and an unpleasant phenomenon delicately known as ''extreme mortality,'' which, more roughly speaking, is the possibility that huge numbers of insured human beings will be killed off by something like a global pandemic. 
 The models these companies created differed from peril to peril, but they all had one thing in common: they accepted that the past was an imperfect guide to the future. No hurricane has hit the coast of Georgia, for instance, since detailed records have been kept. And so if you relied solely on the past, you would predict that no hurricane ever will hit the Georgia coast. But that makes no sense: the coastline above, in South Carolina, and below, in Florida, has been ravaged by storms. ''You are dealing with a physical process,'' says Robert Muir-Wood, the chief scientist for R.M.S. ''There is no physical reason why Georgia has not been hit. Georgia's just been lucky.'' To evaluate the threat to a Georgia beach house, you need to see through Georgia's luck. To do this, the R.M.S. modeler creates a history that never happened: he uses what he knows about actual hurricanes, plus what he knows about the forces that create and fuel hurricanes, to invent a 100,000-year history of hurricanes. Real history serves as a guide -- it enables him to see, for instance, that the odds of big hurricanes making landfall north of Cape Hatteras are far below the odds of them striking south of Cape Hatteras. It allows him to assign different odds to different stretches of coastline without making the random distinctions that actual hurricanes have made in the last 100 years. Generate a few hundred thousand hurricanes, and you generate not only dozens of massive hurricanes that hit Georgia but also a few that hit, say, Rhode Island. 
 The companies' models disagreed here and there, but on one point they spoke with a single voice: four natural perils had outgrown the insurers' ability to insure them -- U.S. hurricane, California earthquake, European winter storm and Japanese earthquake. The insurance industry was prepared to lose $30 billion in a single event, once every 10 years. The models showed that a sole hurricane in Florida wouldn't have to work too hard to create $100 billion in losses. There were concentrations of wealth in the world that defied the logic of insurance. And most of them were in America. 
 The more John Seo looked into the insurance industry, the more it seemed to be teetering at the edge of ruin. This had happened once before, in 1842, when the city of Hamburg burned to the ground and bankrupted the entire German insurance industry many times over. Out of the ashes was born a new industry, called reinsurance. The point of reinsurance was to take on the risk that the insurance industry couldn't dilute through diversification -- say, the risk of an entire city burning to the ground or being wiped off the map by a storm. The old insurance companies would still sell policies to the individual residents of Hamburg. But they would turn around and hand some of the premiums they collected to Cologne Re (short for reinsurance) in exchange for taking on losses over a certain amount. Cologne Re would protect itself by diversifying at a higher level -- by selling catastrophic fire insurance to lots of other towns. 
 But by their very nature, the big catastrophic risks of the early 21st century couldn't be diversified away. Wealth had become far too concentrated in a handful of extraordinarily treacherous places. The only way to handle them was to spread them widely, and the only way to do that was to get them out of the insurance industry and onto Wall Street. Today, the global stock markets are estimated at $59 trillion. A 1 percent drop in the markets -- not an unusual event -- causes $590 billion in losses. The losses caused by even the biggest natural disaster would be a drop in the bucket to the broader capital markets. ''If you could take a Magnitude 8 earthquake and distribute its shock across the planet, no one would feel it,'' Seo says. ''The same principle applies here.'' That's where catastrophe bonds came in: they were the ideal mechanism for dissipating the potential losses to State Farm, Allstate and the other insurers by extending them to the broader markets. 
 Karen Clark's model was, for Seo, the starting point. When he first stumbled upon it and the other companies' models, he found them ''guilty until proven innocent,'' as he puts it. ''I could see the uncertainty in them,'' he says, ''just by looking at the different numbers they generated for the same storm.'' When they run numbers to see what would happen if the 1926 Miami hurricane hit the city today, A.I.R. puts the losses at $80 billion, R.M.S. at $106 billion and Eqecat at $63 billion. They can't all be right. But they didn't need to be exactly right, just sort of right, and the more he poked around inside them, the more he felt they were better than good enough to underpin financial decisions. They enabled you to get a handle on the risk as best you could while acknowledging that you would never know it exactly. And after all, how accurate were the models that forecast the likelihood that Enron would collapse? Next to what Wall Street investors tried to predict every day, natural disasters seemed almost stable. ''In the financial markets, you have to care what other people think, even if what they think is screwed up,'' Seo says. ''Crowd dynamics build on each other. But these things -- hurricanes, earthquakes -- don't exhibit crowd behavior. There's a real underlying risk you have to understand. You have to be a value investor.'' 
 The models were necessary but insufficient. True, they gave you a rough sense of the expected financial losses, but they said nothing about the rewards. Financial markets exist only as long as investors feel the odds are stacked in their favor. Investors -- unlike roulette players -- can honestly expect to make a gain (their share in the profits of productive enterprise). But how big a gain? How should the payout vary, from government bonds to blue-chip stocks to subprime mortgages? The rewards in each market tended to vary with investors' moods, but those in catastrophe insurance were just incredibly volatile. Hurricane insurance rates would skyrocket after a big storm, then settle back down. This wouldn't do: if big investors were going to be persuaded to take billions of dollars in catastrophic risk, they would need to feel there was some reason in the pricing of that risk. ''The market,'' as Seo puts it, ''needs an acceptable mode of failure.''
 In the spring of 2001, to the surprise of his colleagues, Seo left his big Wall Street firm and opened a hedge fund -- which, he announced, wouldn't charge its investors the standard 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of returns but a lower, flat fee. ''It was quixotic,'' says Paul Puleo, a former executive at Lehman who worked with Seo. ''He quits this high-paying job to basically open a business in his garage in a market that doesn't exist.'' Seo opened his new shop with his younger brother Nelson and then brought in their older brother, Michael. (His third brother, Scott, had studied astrophysics but decided that ''there was no future in astrophysics'' and eventually turned himself into an ophthalmologist.) Seo named his firm Fermat Capital Management, after one of his intellectual heroes. ''I had once read the letters between Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal,'' he wrote in a recent e-mail message. ''From my father I had learned that most great mathematicians were nasty guys and total jerks (check out Isaac Newton . . . extra nasty guy), but when I read the Fermat-Pascal letters, you could see that Fermat was an exception to the stereotype . . . truly a noble person. I loved his character and found that his way of analyzing profitless games of chance (probability theory) was the key to understanding how to analyze profitable games of chance (investment theory).'' 
 Four years later, Seo's hedge fund still faced two problems. The smaller one was that investors were occasionally slow to see the appeal of an investment whose first name was catastrophe. As one investor put it, ''My boss won't let me buy bonds that I have to watch the Weather Channel to follow.'' That objection doesn't worry Seo much. ''Investors who object to cat-bond investing usually say that it's just gambling,'' he says. ''But the more mature guys say: 'That's what investing is. But it's gambling with the odds in your favor.' '' 
 His bigger problem was that insurance companies still didn't fully understand their predicament: they had $500 billion in exposure to catastrophe but had sold only about $5 billion of cat bonds -- a fifth of them to him. Still, he could see their unease in their prices: hurricane- and earthquake-insurance premiums bounced around madly from year to year. Right after Andrew, the entire industry quintupled its prices; a few tranquil years later, prices were back down nearly to where they had been before the storm. Financial markets bounced around wildly too, of course, but in the financial markets, the underlying risks (corporate earnings, people's moods) were volatile. The risk in natural-disaster insurance was real, physical and, in principle, quantifiable, and from year to year it did not change much, if at all. In effect, the insurers weren't insuring against disaster; they were only pretending to take the risk, without actually doing so, and billing their customers retroactively for whatever losses they incurred. At the same time, they were quietly sneaking away from catastrophe. Before the 1994 Northridge earthquake, more than a third of California homeowners had quake insurance; right after, the insurers fled the market, so that fewer than 15 percent of California homeowners have earthquakes in their policies today. 
 The market was broken: people on fault lines and beachfronts were stuck either paying far too much for their insurance or with no real coverage except the vague and corrupting hope that, in a crisis, the government would bail them out. A potentially huge, socially beneficial market was moments from birth. All it needed was a push from nature. And so on Aug. 24, 2005, John Seo was waiting, waiting for a storm. And here it came.
 Wall Street is a machine for turning information nobody cares about into information people can get rich from. Back when banks lent people money to buy homes and then sat around waiting for interest payments, no one thought to explore how quickly homeowners would refinance their mortgages if interest rates fell. But then Wall Street created a market in mortgage bonds, and the trader with better information about how and when people refinance made a killing. There's now a giant subindustry to analyze the inner financial life of the American homeowner. 
 Catastrophe bonds do something even odder: they financialize storms. Once there's a market for cat bonds, there's money to be made, even as a storm strikes, in marginally better weathermen. For instance, before the 2005 hurricane season, a Bermuda cat-bond hedge fund called Nephila found a team of oceanographers in Rhode Island called Accurate Environmental Forecasting, whose forecasts of hurricane seasons had been surprisingly good. Nephila rented the company's services and traded bonds on the back of its reports. ''They kind of chuckle at what we do,'' says a Nephila founder, Frank Majors. ''The fact that we're making $10 million bets on whether Charley is going to hit Tampa or not. It made them a little nervous at first. We told them not to worry about what we're going to do with the information. Just give it to us.'' 
 As Katrina bore down on New Orleans, a cat bond named Kamp Re, issued by the insurance company Zurich, was suddenly at risk. If Zurich lost more than $1.2 billion on a single hurricane in about a two-year period, investors would lose all their money. If Zurich represented about 3 percent of the U.S. insurance market -- that is, it was on the hook for about 3 percent of the losses -- a hurricane would need to inflict about $40 billion in damage to trigger the default. Since no event as big as this had ever happened, it was hard to say just how likely it was to happen. According to R.M.S., there was a 1.08 percent chance that Kamp Re bond holders would lose all their money -- assuming the scientists really understood the odds. The deal had been a success. One of its biggest buyers was John Seo. 
 As Katrina spun, the players in nature's casino gathered around the table. When the storm jogged east and struck not New Orleans directly but the less populated, and less wealthy, coastline between Louisiana and Mississippi, they all had the same reaction -- relief -- but Hemant Shah felt a special relief. Shah is one of the founders of R.M.S., and he was at that moment driving to catch a flight from San Francisco to New York, where he hoped to speak at a conference devoted to predicting terrorism. When he saw Katrina miss New Orleans, he said to himself, O.K., it's big, but it's not catastrophic, and he boarded his plane. 
 As he flew across the country, R.M.S. and its competitors replicated Katrina inside their computers in much the same way that Karen Clark had once replicated Hurricane Andrew. Just hours after landfall, all three firms sent clients in the insurance industry their best estimates of financial losses: R.M.S. put them at $10 billion to $25 billion; Eqecat called for a range between $9 billion and $16 billion; Clark's A.I.R. had a range of $12.7 billion to $26.5 billion. Big, as Shah said, but not catastrophic. Traders who had underwritten Kamp Re took calls from an investor at a Japanese bank in London. Cheered by Katrina's path, the fellow was looking to buy some Kamp Re bonds. The traders found another investor eager to unload his Kamp Re holdings. The London investor bought $10 million of Kamp Re at a price of $94. 
 John Seo just watched. For the past four years, he and his brothers had made money at such moments as this: ''live'' cat trading, it's called. A few investors would inevitably become jittery and sell their cat bonds at big discounts, what with the Weather Channel all hysteria all the time. (''The worst place to go if you're taking risks,'' says one cat-bond investor, ''is the Weather Channel. They're just screaming all the time.'') But entering the 2005 hurricane season, the Seo brothers had reconsidered their habit of buying in a storm. ''The word had gotten out that buying in the storm was the smart thing to do,'' Seo says. ''And we were afraid our past successes would give us an irrational interest in buying. Everything's all fuzzy in these events. And when things are fuzzy, your brain gives you an excuse to push the envelope. So we adopted a policy, before the season, of staying out of the market.'' 
 A few hours later, Hemant Shah's plane landed in New York. Shah turned on his BlackBerry and discovered that the New Orleans levees had broken: much of the city would soon be underwater. ''My first reaction,'' Shah says, ''was, Uh-oh, we have a problem.'' In the imaginary 100,000-year history of hurricanes that R.M.S. had in its computers, no hypothetical storm that struck so far from New Orleans had ever caused the levees to fail. The models, like the intuition they replaced, had a blind spot. 
 The Kamp Re bonds collapsed, the price dropping from the mid-90s to the low 20s. A few weeks later, an announcement from Zurich American made it clear that the investors in Kamp Re wouldn't be getting any money back, and Kamp Re's price fell from $20 to 10 cents. But then the real trouble started: R.M.S., the modeling company, declared that it was rethinking the whole subject of hurricane risk. Since 1995, scientists had noted a distinct uptick in hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Basin. The uptick had been ignorable because the storms had not been making landfall. But between July 2004 and the end of 2005, seven of history's most expensive hurricanes had struck the American coast, leaving behind 5.5 million insurance claims and $81 billion in insured losses. The rise in hurricane size and frequency was no longer ignorable. R.M.S. convened a panel of scientists. The scientists agreed that unusually warm sea-surface temperatures were causing unusually ferocious and frequent storms. The root cause might be global warming or merely the routine ups and downs of temperatures in the North Atlantic Basin. On cause they failed to agree. On consequence they were united. At the beginning of August 2005, R.M.S. had judged a Katrina-size catastrophe to be a once-in-40-years event. Seven months later, the company pegged it as a once-in-20-years event. The risk had doubled. 
 It had been just 13 years since Karen Clark's model swept the industry, but the entire catastrophe risk-taking industry now lived at the mercy of these modelers. The scientists were, in effect, the new odds-makers. It was as if the casino owner had walked up to his roulette table, seen a pile of chips on 00 and announced that 00 would no longer pay 36:1 but would henceforth pay only 18:1. The agencies that rated the insurance companies -- S & P, Moodys, etc. -- relied on the scientists to evaluate their exposure. When the scientists increased the likelihood of catastrophic storms, S & P and Moodys demanded that the insurance companies raise more capital to cover their suddenly more probable losses. And so in addition to the more than $40 billion they had lost in Katrina, the insurance companies, by edict of the ratings agencies, needed to raise $82 billion from their shareholders just to keep their investment-grade rating. And suddenly they weren't so eager to expose themselves to losses from hurricanes. 
 John Seo felt differently. Katrina had cost him millions. But at the same time, in a funny way, it had vindicated his ideas about catastrophe. He had lost only what he had expected to lose. He had found an acceptable mode of failure. 
 As a boy, John Seo learned everything he could about the Titanic. ''It was considered unsinkable because it had a hull of 16 chambers,'' he says. The chambers were stacked back to front. If the ship hit something head on, the object might puncture the front chamber, but it would likely have to puncture at least three more to sink the ship. ''They probably said, What are the odds of four chambers going?'' he says. ''There might have been a one-in-a-hundred chance of puncturing a single chamber, but the odds of puncturing four chambers, they probably thought of as one in a million. That's because they thought of them as independent chambers. And the chambers might have been independent if the first officer hadn't gambled at the last minute and swerved. By swerving, the iceberg went down the side of the ship. If the officer had taken it head on, he might have killed a passenger or two, but the ship might not have sunk. The mistake was to turn. Often people associate action with lowering risk or controlling risk, but experience shows more often than not that by taking action you only make the risk worse.'' 
 The Titanic offered another lesson for the investor in catastrophe: the threats that seem to us the most remote are those we know the least about. Catastrophe risk is fundamentally different from normal risk. It deals with events so rare that experience doesn't help you much to predict them. How do you use history to judge the likelihood of a pandemic killing off 1 in every 200 Americans? You can't. It has happened only once. (The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918.) You lack information. You don't know what you don't know. The further out into the tail you go -- the less probable the event -- the greater the uncertainty. The greater the uncertainty, the more an investor should be paid to live with it. 
 The financial markets, or, at any rate, the arcane corner of Wall Street that dealt exclusively with highly unlikely financial events, had figured this out. The traders who sold insurance against extreme market collapses -- the tail risks -- all tended to charge exactly the same price, between four and five times their expected losses. Expected loss could be defined like this: Say an investor wanted to buy $1 billion of insurance for a year against a once-in-100-years stock-market crash. The expected loss would be 1 in 100, 1 percent of $1 billion: $10 million. The insurance would thus cost $40 million to $50 million. The pattern held across Wall Street. The trader at Lehman Brothers who priced stock-market-crash insurance didn't know the trader at Harvard Management who priced the insurance against drastic interest-rate changes, and he didn't know the trader at O'Connor and Associates who priced the insurance against the dollar's losing a third of its value. But their idea of a fair premium for insurance against financial disaster suggested they were reading the same books on the subject -- only there were no books. ''The reigning theory is that the taste for risk is as arbitrary as the value of a painting,'' Seo says. ''But if this is so, why are these preferences so consistent across markets?'' 
 Seo thought, Maybe risk is not like art. Maybe there is some deep rule that governs it. And maybe the market is groping its way to that rule all by itself. 
 Intuitively what the market was doing made sense. Highly improbable events were especially unsettling. The person who insured others against an unlikely event faced not only the problem of judging its likelihood; even if he knew how often it would occur, he didn't know when it would occur. Even if you had complete certainty that a U.S. stock-market crash happened just once every 25 years, you still didn't know which year. If you had set up a business to sell crash insurance in January 1987, you would have been bankrupted by the crash in October; on the other hand, if you had gone into the business in 1988, you would have gotten rich. There was no justice in it. The catastrophic risk-taker was a bit like a card counter at the blackjack table allowed to play only a few hands: yes, the odds are in his favor, but he doesn't always get to play long enough for the odds to determine the outcome. 
 The uncertainty in these extreme, remote market risks meant that the person who took them should be paid more to do so. But how much more? Extreme events were treated on Wall Street as freak outliers that bore no relation to other, more normal events. There was a striking consistency in the pricing of these risks across Wall Street, but there was no hard logic under them: it was all being done by feel. 
 The logic is what Seo stumbled upon back in 2000 at Lehman Brothers after someone handed him a weird option to price. An industrial company had called Lehman with a problem. It operated factories in Japan and California, both near fault lines. It could handle one of the two being shut down by an earthquake, but not both at the same time. Could Lehman Brothers quote a price for an option that would pay the company $10 million if both Japan and California suffered earthquakes in the same year? Lehman turned to its employee with a reputation for being able to price anything. And Seo thought it over. The earthquakes that the industrial company was worried about were not all that improbable: roughly once-a-decade events. A sloppy solution would be simply to call an insurance company and buy $10 million in coverage for the Japanese quake and then another $10 million in coverage for the California quake; the going rate was $2 million for each policy. ''If I had been lazy, I could have just quoted $4 million for the premium,'' he says. ''It would have been obnoxious to do so, but traders have been known to do it.'' If either quake happened, but not both, he would have a windfall gain of $10 million. (One of his policies would pay him $10 million, but he would not be required to pay anything to the quake-fearing corporation, since it would get paid only if both earthquakes occurred.) 
 But there was a better solution. He needed to buy the California quake insurance for $2 million, its market price, but only if the Japanese quake happened in the same year. All Seo had to do, then, was buy enough Japanese quake insurance so that if the Japanese quake occurred, he could afford to pay the insurance company for his $10 million California insurance policy: $2 million. In other words, he didn't need $10 million of Japanese quake insurance; he needed only $2 million. The cost of that was a mere $400,000. For that sum, he could insure the manufacturing company against its strange risk at little risk to himself. Anything he charged above $400,000 was pure profit for Lehman Brothers. 
 And that was that, except it wasn't. He saw something. Each risk by itself was not unusual: the quakes being insured against were once-a-decade events. But since each earthquake had a 1-in-10 chance of happening in a year, the chances that both of them would occur were far more remote: 1 in 100 (10 percent of 10 percent). When you combined these more ordinary risks, you simulated extremely unlikely ones. ''What I noticed, after the fact, is that this exotic option's price was special,'' he says. ''It was related to tail pricing.'' The risk of catastrophe wasn't some freak outlier with no connection to more mainstream risks. It bore a fixed relationship to those risks. Indeed, one way of thinking about natural catastrophes was as a combination of more likely events. 
 Thus the hunches of Wall Street professionals found vindication in Seo's arithmetic. The expected loss of the more ordinary risk of a single earthquake was $1 million (a 10 percent chance of a $10 million loss). The insurance cost $2 million, or twice the expected loss. The expected loss of the remote combined risk was $100,000 (a 1 percent chance of a $10 million loss). But the insurance cost $400,000: four times the expected loss. All those practical traders who were pricing tail risk at roughly four times the expected losses had been on to something. ''Here I saw the beginnings of a market mechanism that directly links 1-in-10-year risk pricing to 1-in-100-year risk pricing,'' Seo says. The intuitive reason that extreme, remote risk should be more highly priced than normal everyday risk was ''a happy agreement between human psychological perception and hard mathematical logic.'' 
 Seo's math -- which soon left middle school for graduate school -- served two purposes: to describe this universal rule about the pricing of risk and to persuade investors that there was a deeper, hidden logic to investing in catastrophe. They could have some sense of what the price of the risk should be. It was an extraordinary idea: that catastrophe might be fair. 
 Then came Katrina. The reaction to the storm has put a fine point on Americans' risk disorientation. The single biggest issue in Florida's 2006 governor's race, for instance, was the price of insurance. The Republican, Charlie Crist, got himself elected on the strength of his promise to reduce Floridians' home-insurance rates by creating a state-subsidized pool of $28 billion in catastrophe insurance coverage. ''Florida took this notion of spreading this risk and turned it on its head,'' says one former state insurance commissioner. ''They said, 'We're going to take all this risk ourselves.' '' The state sold its citizens catastrophe insurance at roughly one-sixth the market rates, thus encouraging them to live in riskier places than they would if they had to pay what the market charged (and in the bargain, the state subsidized the well-to-do who live near the beach at the expense of the less-well-to-do who don't). But if all the models are correct, $28 billion might not cover even one serious storm. The disaster waiting to happen in Florida grows bigger by the day, but for a man running for governor of Florida, ignoring it is a political no-brainer. If he's lucky -- if no big storms hit in his term -- he looks like the genius who saved Floridians billions in catastrophic-risk premiums. If he's unlucky, he bankrupts Florida and all hell breaks loose, but he can shake down the federal government to cover some of the losses. 
 Louisiana's politicians are usually quicker than most to seize upon shrewd politics that generate terrible social policy, but in this case they could not afford to. Louisiana cannot generate and preserve wealth without insurance, and it cannot obtain insurance except at the market price. But that price remains a mystery. Billions of dollars in insurance settlements -- received by local businesses and homeowners as payouts on their pre-Katrina policies -- bloat New Orleans banks and brokerage houses. The money isn't moving because the people are paralyzed. It's as if they have been forced to shoot craps without knowing the odds. Businesses are finding it harder than ever to buy insurance, and homeowners are getting letters from Allstate, State Farm and the others telling them that their long relationship must now come to an end. ''I've been in the business 45 years,'' says a New Orleans insurance broker named Happy Crusel, ''and I've never seen anything remotely like this.'' An entire city is now being reshaped by an invisible force: the price of catastrophic risk. But it's the wrong price. 
 Insurance companies, John Seo says, are charging customers too much -- or avoiding their customers altogether -- instead of sharing their risk with others, like himself, who would be glad to take it. New Orleans, as a result, is slower than it otherwise would be to rebuild. ''The insurance companies are basically running away from society,'' he says. ''What they need to do is take the risk and kick it up to us.'' They need to spread it as widely as possible across the investment world and, in the process, minimize the cost of insuring potential losses from catastrophes. 
 But this, too, is happening. The people on Wall Street who specialize in cat bonds now view Katrina as the single most important thing that ever happened to their business: overnight it went from a tiny backwater to a $14 billion market, and it is now stretching and straining to grow. In March of this year, a single insurer, Allstate, announced its intention to sell $4 billion in catastrophe bonds. A $14 billion market is a trivial sum next to the half-trillion or so dollars that the insurance industry stands to lose from megacatastrophes and next to the additional trillions of dollars worth of property that has gone uninsured in the places most likely to be destroyed by nature, like California, because the insurance is so expensive. But there are all around John Seo signs of a shift in the culture of catastrophe. ''It has all the features of providential action,'' he says. ''It's like all the actions of man and nature serve to grow the cat-bond market.'' 
 When Katrina struck and his Kamp Re bonds collapsed -- from $100 to 0 -- Seo was able to view his loss with detachment. The models had badly underestimated the risk, but it was in the nature of extreme risk that the prediction of it would sometimes be mistaken. ''The important thing is that the money wasn't lost in an unearned manner,'' he says, by which he means that it wasn't lost dishonestly or even unwisely or in what his community of investors would consider a professionally unacceptable manner. Investors will endure losses as long as they come in the context of a game they perceive as basically fair, which is why they don't abandon the stock market after a crash. ''That's all I need to know,'' Seo says. ''That's all my clients need to know.'' Actually, he goes even further: ''I would be embarrassed if we had a big event and our loss wasn't commensurate with it. It would mean that we didn't serve society. We failed society.'' 
 Seo's returns in 2005 were only slightly positive, compared with the roughly 10 to 12 percent he had been delivering, but the demand for his services boomed. He now controls $2 billion, or more than twice what he had before the most costly natural disaster in history. Big investors weren't scared off by Katrina. Just the reverse. It has led many of them to turn to Seo and others like him to make money from catastrophe. And they probably will. But what interests Seo more is what might happen in the bargain, that the financial consequences of catastrophe will be turned into something they have never been: boringly normal.

HEADLINE: Taliban Raise Poppy Production to a Record Again

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE

DATELINE: LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
Afghanistan produced record levels of opium in 2007 for the second straight year, led by a staggering 45 percent increase in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand Province, according to a new United Nations survey to be released Monday.
 The report is likely to touch off renewed debate about the United States' $600 million counternarcotics program in Afghanistan, which has been hampered by security challenges and endemic corruption within the Afghan government.
''I think it is safe to say that we should be looking for a new strategy,'' said William B. Wood, the American ambassador to Afghanistan, commenting on the report's overall findings. ''And I think that we are finding one.''
 Mr. Wood said the current American programs for eradication, interdiction and alternative livelihoods should be intensified, but he added that ground spraying poppy crops with herbicide remained ''a possibility.'' Afghan and British officials have opposed spraying, saying it would drive farmers into the arms of the Taliban. 
 While the report found that opium production dropped in northern Afghanistan, Western officials familiar with the assessment said, cultivation rose in the south, where Taliban insurgents urge farmers to grow poppies.
 Although common farmers make comparatively little from the trade, opium is a major source of financing for the Taliban, who gain public support by protecting farmers' fields from eradication, according to American officials. They also receive a cut of the trade from traffickers they protect.
 In Taliban-controlled areas, traffickers have opened more labs that process raw opium into heroin, vastly increasing its value. The number of drug labs in Helmand rose to roughly 50 from 30 the year before, and about 16 metric tons of chemicals used in heroin production have been confiscated this year. 
 The Western officials said countrywide production had increased from 2006 to 2007, but they did not know the final United Nations figure. They estimated a countrywide increase of 10 to 30 percent.
 The new survey showed positive signs as well, officials said.
 The sharp drop in poppy production in the north is likely to make this year's countrywide increase smaller than the growth in 2006. Last year, a 160 percent increase in Helmand's opium crop fueled a 50 percent nationwide increase. Afghanistan produced a record 6,100 metric tons of opium poppies last year, 92 percent of the world's supply. 
 Here in Helmand, the breadth of the poppy trade is staggering. A sparsely populated desert province twice the size of Maryland, Helmand produces more narcotics than any country on earth, including Myanmar, Morocco and Colombia. Rampant poverty, corruption among local officials, a Taliban resurgence and spreading lawlessness have turned the province into a narcotics juggernaut.
 Poppy prices that are 10 times higher than those for wheat have so warped the local economy that some farmhands refused to take jobs harvesting legal crops this year, local farmers said. And farmers dismiss the threat of eradication, arguing that so many local officials are involved in the poppy trade that a significant clearing of crops will never be done.
 American and British officials say they have a long-term strategy to curb poppy production. About 7,000 British troops and Afghan security forces are gradually extending the government's authority in some areas, they said. The British government is spending $60 million to promote legal crops in the province, and the United States Agency for International Development is mounting a $160 million alternative livelihoods program across southern Afghanistan, most of it in Helmand.
 Loren Stoddard, director of the aid agency's agriculture program in Afghanistan, cited American-financed agricultural fairs, the introduction of high-paying legal crops and the planned construction of a new industrial park and airport as evidence that alternatives were being created.
 Mr. Stoddard, who helped Wal-Mart move into Central America in his previous posting, predicted that poppy production had become so prolific that the opium market was flooded and prices were starting to drop. ''It seems likely they'll have a rough year this year,'' he said, referring to the poppy farmers. ''Labor prices are up and poppy prices are down. I think they're going to be looking for new things.''
 On Wednesday, Mr. Stoddard and Rory Donohoe, the director of the American development agency's Alternative Livelihoods program in southern Afghanistan, attended the first ''Helmand Agricultural Festival.'' The $300,000 American-financed gathering in Lashkar Gah was an odd cross between a Midwestern county fair and a Central Asian bazaar, devised to show Afghans an alternative to poppies.
 Under a scorching sun, thousands of Afghan men meandered among booths describing fish farms, the dairy business and drip-irrigation systems. A generator, cow and goat were raffled off. Wizened elders sat on carpets and sipped green tea. Some wealthy farmers seemed interested. Others seemed keen to attend what they saw as a picnic.
 When Mr. Stoddard and Mr. Donohoe arrived, they walked through the festival surrounded by a three-man British and Australian security team armed with assault rifles. ''Who won the cow? Who won the cow?'' shouted Mr. Stoddard, 38, a burly former food broker from Provo, Utah. ''Was it a girl or a guy?''
 After Afghans began dancing to traditional drum and flute music, Mr. Donohoe, 29, from San Francisco, briefly joined them.
 Some Afghans praised the fair's alternatives crops. Others said only the rich could afford them. Haji Abdul Gafar, 28, a wealthy landowner, expressed interest in some of the new ideas.
 Saber Gul, a 40-year-old laborer, said he was too poor to take advantage. ''For those who have livestock and land, they can,'' he said. ''For us, the poor people, there is nothing.''
 Local officials said all the development programs would fail without improved security.
 Assadullah Wafa, Helmand's governor, said four of Helmand's 13 districts were under Taliban control. Other officials put the number at six.
 Mr. Wafa, who eradicated far fewer acres than the governor of neighboring Kandahar Province, promised to improve eradication in Helmand next year. He also called for Western countries to decrease the demand for heroin. 
 ''The world is focusing on the production side, not the buying side,'' he said.
 The day after the agricultural fair, Mr. Stoddard and Mr. Donohoe gave a tour of a $3 million American project to clear a former Soviet airbase on the outskirts of town and turn it into an industrial park and civilian airport.
 Standing near rusting Soviet fuel tanks, the two men described how pomegranates, a delicacy in Helmand for centuries, would be flown out to growing markets in India and Dubai. Animal feed would be produced from a local mill, marble cut and polished for construction.
 ''Once we get this air cargo thing going,'' Mr. Stoddard said, ''it will open up the whole south.''
 That afternoon, they showed off a pilot program for growing chili peppers on contract for a company in Dubai. ''These kinds of partnerships with private companies are what we want here,'' said Mr. Donohoe, who has a Master's in Business Administration from Georgetown University. ''We'll let the market drive it.''
 As the Americans toured the farm, they were guarded by eight Afghans and three British and Australian guards. The farm itself had received guards after local villagers began sneaking in at night and stealing produce. Twenty-four hours a day, 24 Afghan men with assault rifles staff six guard posts that ring the farm, safeguarding chili peppers and other produce.
 ''Some people would say that security is so bad that you can't do anything,'' Mr. Donohoe said. ''But we do it.''
 Mr. Wafa, though, called the American reconstruction effort too small and ''low quality.''
 ''There is a proverb in Afghanistan,'' he said. ''By one flower we cannot mark spring.''

HEADLINE: JOAN MACINTOSH

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
AGE: 61 YEARS WORKING: 40 CURRENTLY EARNING: $506 a week CURRENTLY REHEARSING: ''The Misanthrope'' at the New York Theater Workshop
 In the beginning it was a charmed life. Before even leaving graduate school Ms. MacIntosh stepped into acting as an original member of the Performance Group, the experimental theater company started in 1967 by Richard Schechner (whom she married), right in the guts of the vigorous avant-garde movement of late-'60s and early-'70s New York. This was a time when artists toured the world and were treated like revolutionaries, and yet, because of robust government support for the arts, an actor could earn a living doing work that mattered. As she describes it, it was about an ideal a life as a serious actor could lead. 
 But something always comes up. In 1978 the group was in the midst of a shift (it mutated into the Wooster Group in 1980), and Ms. MacIntosh left, had a baby and split with Mr. Schechner. Ms. MacIntosh describes her life as going through different phases. But as with many actors, there are essentially two: when there's enough good work to get by and when there isn't. 
 If Phase 1 is epitomized by those miraculous years in the performance group, Phase 2 kicked in viciously in 1978. ''I was so naive,'' she said. ''I was depressed and poor, and I had this wonderful child that was just coming into the world. I cried pretty much the entire year.'' 
 The stakes are infinitely higher when there's a child, and the frustrations of not making it are compounded with a parent's guilt and anxiety. (Though Ms. MacIntosh received child support payments, sometimes that was about it. She joked that some days she would just hand over her unemployment check to the baby sitter.) 
 ''There was one time I had to go to Manhattan for an audition,'' she said. ''I had nothing. I think I had $10 in my checking account. I had a child at home, had 50 cents in my pocket, and I had to get to Manhattan, and I was really scared.''
 ''But I have to tell you,'' she said, ''I really learned the power of faith and trust. I can't count how many times I felt like I was up against it, and the phone would ring, and it would be a job offer.'' 
 And that's what happened. Three years to the day after giving herself a three-year deadline to make it as an actress, Ms. MacIntosh got a call from the director JoAnne Akalaitis asking her to talk about a play called ''Request Concert,'' which gave her a steady run of work through the 1980s. 
 Since then the phases have vacillated, more lean years, certainly, but also more great years: years running a successful healing practice; years living in California with a pool, a BMW and a steady teaching job; and more recently years in a relationship that allowed her to work without worrying about being able to pay the bills. She has always picked roles she felt passionate about, but for once the financial pressure was off. 
 Without warning that relationship ended early this summer. So she's currently putting out calls, lining up radio spots, auditions and short-term teaching jobs, and looking to move back into the city. She's got jobs lined up through November, which altogether should bring in about $12,000, but after that, who knows? In other words: Phase 2, again. But ''something always just comes up,'' she said. ''It's like a sign from the universe saying: 'Don't worry. It's all going to be just fine.' ''

HEADLINE: Avoid the Craziness and No One Gets Hurt

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOLLOWING are a few highly preliminary observations about the recent turmoil in the financial markets:
 IT'S ABOUT THE FEES Hedge funds are largely a fraud. A hedge fund is supposed to hedge against market movements by unhedged instruments. In a very simple example, they are supposed to go short when the market is falling and thereby make money to hedge against losses in long positions. 
 I am sure that some were doing that recently, but from what I've seen, many were just highly leveraged bets on long positions. When the market turned sharply against them, they not only lost, but also sometimes had to sell under the compulsion of margin calls and thus hastily and for a loss. 
 These are not what I could call hedge funds. This is just gambling. Now we see that, at least for many funds, it's not about investing prowess or sharp insights. It is, as my idol, Warren E. Buffett has said so many times, about ''fees, fees, fees.'' The model hedge fund is not a means to outperform the market. It is a means to outcharge the investor.
 THE RICH AREN'T SO SOPHISTICATED In 2005 and 2006, there was considerable discussion about whether hedge funds needed to be regulated. It was finally decided by the powers that be at the Securities and Exchange Commission that because their investors were often very rich people who were presumably sophisticated investors, the hedge funds needed only the slightest nod toward regulation versus, say, mutual funds.
 For anyone at all familiar with rich people, the idea that to be rich is to be sophisticated is almost laughable. Rich people become rich generally in ways that have zero to do with sophistication in investing. I have seen this in spades this week with all of the shrieking from my rich pals about their investment losses. Maybe we need to rethink the notion that the rich do not need regulatory protection.
 But more to the point, some of the largest investors in hedge funds are pension and welfare funds for unions and for other groups of employees. These people might well have been stunned if they knew the incredibly risky games that their ''2 and 20'' managers -- charging 2 percent of total asset value and 20 percent of profits -- were playing with their money. It is hard to believe a police officer in Los Angeles would really want his pension money tied up in the last slice of subprime, especially with leverage.
 If hedge funds are to continue as an entity of some scale, it is high time they are required to display transparency, full disclosure and the kind of fiduciary duty that more sophisticated players in finance always need to show their investors. In other words, we have just seen that we need serious regulation of hedge funds.
 FEAR CAN TRUMP FACT Today's news media will ''catastrophize'' anything they can. The subprime mess was always much smaller than the media let on. (See my column of two weeks ago.) In a nation of our size, in a world economy on fire with prosperity and liquidity, the losses were not large, but the media endlessly tried to scare us. 
 When fear can easily outrun fact, some basic education is required from our national stewards of finance. The performance by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, was letter perfect. His injections of liquidity and his resolve to invite banks to the discount window to preserve liquidity were just what the doctor ordered. 
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, was a slightly different story. He should have been putting things in perspective, assuring us that the government would maintain orderly markets, and that the real problem was fear itself. He did dramatically improve his performance last week, but my feeling is that he still does not realize that he is the financial steward for all Americans, and not just the powers of Wall Street. 
 INVESTMENTS CAN'T BE ALL THINGS If something seems too good to be true in the world of money, it usually is. The junk bonds that Drexel Burnham Lambert once ginned up were supposed to be loans to less-qualified borrowers that would pay higher rates of interest, but not be subject to default rates that offset those gains. They weren't (except that once the markets had beaten them to a pulp, Leon Black, of Drexel and then Apollo, made a fortune buying them for a song). 
 Internet stocks were supposed to offer universal wealth despite paying no dividends and having no earnings. They were supposed to defy the conventional rules. They didn't. Subprime was supposed to be, in effect, a Milken junk bond, with a low-rated borrower and high interest but defaults low enough to allow a profit to the bond holders. In fact, immense profits were made by the issuers, but when the real default rate appeared, the free lunch vanished. 
 MARKETS ERR IN THE SHORT TERM After all, they are always changing, so their previous prices must have been a mistake. But they tend toward being right. (Martin Luther King Jr. said, ''The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.'' Something similar is true of the stock markets.) But in the short run, some drastic overvaluations and undervaluations can occur. 
 Something like this is happening now with financial stocks, which are at levels that would seem to forecast a second Great Depression. If that does not happen, in 10 years some smart people who bought financial stocks in the late summer of 2007 might be happy they did. It would take staggering mistakes of monetary policy to justify the prices of those stocks now. Unless Mr. Bernanke is replaced by Chuckles the Clown, it won't happen. More to come.

HEADLINE: DAMIAN BALDET

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
AGE: 36 YEARS WORKING: 6 MOST MADE IN A YEAR: $140,000 CURRENT INCOME: $506 a week LAST SEEN IN: ''Gone Missing,'' now playing at the Barrow Street Theater
 During Mr. Baldet's first few years in New York, days went something like this: a shift as a hotel concierge from 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., a walk up to the theater for a quick nap in the basement, rehearsal from 6:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m., a subway ride home, four hours of sleep and all of this all over again.
 ''By the time I got to rehearsal I was so blind exhausted I thought there was no way I could be creative or enjoy it in any way,'' he said. ''My performances were just completely about keeping my mind together.'' He added that he fell asleep onstage during rehearsals more than once. 
 Mr. Baldet, over a burger at Sardi's, talked about that period in the kind of joking way you can talk about something that wasn't funny at the time. 
 But he and his wife of six years, Alison Weller, an actress, promised each other this life, even when they were making roughly nothing for acting off Off Broadway, quitting one paying job after another to make room for rehearsals and begging parents for money month after month. 
 That last part got a little tense, Mr. Baldet said, and led him to question whether this really was something he should be doing. Asked if he'd thought about quitting, he said yes, and then no, and then yes, and then he talked about his fantasy of being the archetypal breadwinner. 
 ''I have said to her,'' Mr. Baldet said, referring to his wife, '' 'If we have children, I'm quitting.' And she said, 'If you do that, you will crush your soul.' The gist of it was: 'If you do that, you wouldn't be you, and then what's the point? Why would you have a family at all?' ''
 So, he concluded, he wouldn't quit.
 He's much better off than he was in those early years, having toured for two years as Timon in ''The Lion King,'' earning $140,000 a year.
 ''It's more than I've made combined since I started working when I was 15 years old,'' he said. 
 He used the money to pay down debt, buy things he had been needing, like a computer, and take his wife on their first real vacation. When those two years were up, Disney offered him a job as an offstage understudy in the Broadway version of ''The Lion King.'' 
 It was good money, but the vast majority of the time it would mean not performing. He declined. Besides, Ms. Weller had gotten a job on Broadway in ''Coram Boy,'' which was sure to bring in good money for the foreseeable future. 
 Mr. Baldet is now off Broadway again in ''Gone Missing,'' taking home around $400 a week after taxes (the minimum salary for an actor in an Off Broadway production in a 199-seat theater). His wife, who had been unemployed since ''Coram Boy'' closed 25 days after opening, joined the cast of ''Gone Missing'' two weeks ago.
 ''It's not enough money even with the two of us,'' he said. ''I probably should get another job. I really probably should.''

HEADLINE: No Free Lunch

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt writes the Economic Scene column for the Business Day section of The Times.

 BODY:
In the 1930s, the Schechter brothers ran a chicken business in Brooklyn. The name Schechter is derived from the Yiddish word for ''butcher,'' and this is what the brothers did: they slaughtered chickens and sold them to shops. The brothers seemed to be typical immigrants, at once struggling and succeeding.
 But in 1934, they became famous thanks to Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States. Only months after Franklin Roosevelt had signed a code regulating the chicken business, the brothers were accused of violating it. Prosecutors said they had sold an unfit chicken, one with an egg lodged inside it, and had also tried to undercut their competitors' prices. It was the latter charge that cut to the core of the new law. With the Great Depression under way and deflation causing economic ruin, the Roosevelt administration had outlawed ''destructive price cutting.'' 
 The brothers were found guilty, given a harsh fine ($7,425) and sentenced to between one and three months in jail. They fought back, however, all the way to the Supreme Court, and they won. In a unanimous ruling the court found the code to be an unconstitutional expansion of federal authority. On the day of the ruling, Justice Louis Brandeis took aside one of Roosevelt's aides and told him, ''This is the end of this business of centralization.'' The National Recovery Administration, the agency that had gone after the Schechters, soon dropped hundreds of similar cases and closed its doors.
 The story of the Schechters remains a powerful one, even if it did not mark the end of centralization. By outlawing chicken discounts, Roosevelt overreached, much as he later did in trying to pack the Supreme Court (motivated by decisions like Schechter). But beyond that, his economic meddling failed to accomplish his larger goal of ending the Depression. The ''sick chicken case'' thus became a useful precis of the argument that the New Deal's reputation deserves to be more complicated than it is.
 No wonder, then, that Amity Shlaes, a former editorial writer at The Wall Street Journal, now at the Council on Foreign Relations, has made the brothers heroic figures in her book ''The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression.'' Her argument is somewhat more subtle than the usual critique from the right. She sees both Roosevelt and his Republican predecessor Herbert Hoover as inveterate economic tinkerers. Hoover, the engineer turned politician, never lost his instinct to fix things and, as a result, signed the disastrous Smoot-Hawley tariff bill. His biggest sin, and Roosevelt's, was a ''lack of faith in the marketplace,'' Shlaes writes. ''From 1929 to 1940, from Hoover to Roosevelt, government intervention helped to make the Depression Great.''
 The book opens in 1937, eight years after the stock market crash, with a story about another Brooklyn resident, a 13-year-old boy named William Troeller, who hanged himself in his bedroom one evening. His father was unemployed, and William, as a New York Times headline reported, ''Was Reluctant About Asking for Food.'' For all the frenzied activity of Roosevelt's first term, the country had yet to emerge from its slump. It wouldn't fully do so until the war spending of the 1940s. 
 The length of the Depression is one of Shlaes's two main criticisms of the New Deal. The victims of Roosevelt's centralization campaign are the second: the Schechters; titans like Andrew Mellon, who were also hounded by prosecutors; shareholders; and corporate managers, including a utilities executive named Wendell Willkie. The book's title is an ironic allusion to these victims. In a 1932 campaign speech, Roosevelt referred to ''the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.'' But the phrase had a very different origin. In the late 19th century, the philosopher William Graham Sumner had used it to describe the average citizen ''coerced,'' as Shlaes writes, ''into funding dubious social projects.'' 
 With 75 years of hindsight, surely we can all agree that Roosevelt's vision was imperfect. Yes, he helped build many pillars of the modern economy -- Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the modern Federal Reserve and more. He also understood the folly of Hoover's protectionism and pursued a more open trade policy. And his public works slowly, if unevenly, provided employment. (As the historian Eric Rauchway has noted in Slate, Shlaes exaggerates joblessness in the 1930s by counting many people who worked in relief programs as unemployed.) 
 But other attempts to fine-tune the economy truly did fail. From today's vantage point, the worst of them may have been farm subsidies, which essentially live on, giving a handout to agribusiness while raising the cost of food for everyone else and hurting poor farmers around the world. Roosevelt did not seem to grasp that the judgment of millions of businesses and consumers -- that is, the market -- was, more often than not, better than the judgment of a single man. Given what had happened in 1929, this blind spot was perhaps understandable, but it's a fair point of criticism.
 The great challenge for his critics has always been to come up with an alternate vision that might plausibly be said to have done more good with fewer downsides. Shlaes likes the model offered by Willkie, the Republicans' 1940 presidential nominee, in which the New Deal would have been scaled back and business would have filled the void. She builds her case mostly by implication, through a series of sketches of self-starters who embodied what the free market could have accomplished. There is Bill Wilson, for example, the stock trader who founded Alcoholics Anonymous and in the process ''taught Americans that the solution to their troubles lay not with a federal program but within a new sort of entity -- the self-help community,'' as Shlaes puts it. Mellon shows the power of charity by donating his unrivaled art collection to the country, thereby creating the National Gallery. Even the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval has a role to play, as an example of how the private sector once took care of quality control. Roosevelt, however, preferred government institutions like the Food and Drug Administration.
 In a way, Shlaes's book has come just a little after its time. In the early years of George W. Bush's presidency, conservative critiques of the New Deal served a larger political purpose, as a rationale for the administration's attempts to remake Social Security. Those plans failed, of course, mostly because they found little support among voters.
 There is a historical parallel here. Roosevelt may be an icon now, but he faced enormous opposition when he was president. Americans at the time heard the arguments that he was insufficiently capitalist. They saw his missteps and, above all, they lived through the long Depression. Yet in four separate elections, when given a choice between his ideas and those of his critics, they overwhelmingly chose his. Based on what followed -- the great economic boom of the postwar years -- it is hard to doubt their decision now. They understood that the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval wasn't quite up to defeating the Great Depression.
 Among Roosevelt's supporters, evidently, were a family of chicken butchers in Brooklyn named the Schechters. ''Their major political concern in the 1930s was anti-Semitism,'' Shlaes's appendix quotes one of their descendants as saying. ''They believed that if Roosevelt had not solved the problems of the Depression, the U.S. could have gone the way of Nazi Germany.'' The Schechters apparently voted for Roosevelt every time he ran.

HEADLINE: What? And Leave Show Business?

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
I consider myself a worker,'' said David Greenspan, who has been an actor, writer and director in New York for nearly 30 years. ''I'm facing the same things that workers are facing throughout the country.'' 
 Mr. Greenspan is right of course. It really doesn't matter whether you write plays or pave highways when you're buying groceries. But there is a notable, and curious, difference. Every night thousands of theatergoers fill seats in Manhattan to watch theater people at work for a couple of hours, without really thinking of it as work. 
 But it is work, work that is supposed to pay rent, buy food and sustain people (and in some cases families) for the long periods of anxious unemployment that are an inevitable part of a performer's life. Given what stage actors make and what New York costs, staying afloat has always required improvisation, shrewdness, discipline, luck and a kind of obstinacy that some people call passion and others call craziness, and is probably a little bit of both. 
 But these days it is harder than ever. Government support for the arts is meager, leaving nonprofit theaters squeezed and scrambling to cut expenses -- and cast sizes -- while the cost of living in New York has skyrocketed. What follows (see links above) are five working New York City theater professionals talking about the part of the show business life that happens offstage.

HEADLINE: With Market Plans Afoot, Resistance Rises to More Fancy Foods

BYLINE: By SAKI KNAFO

 BODY:
WHEN Fiorello La Guardia opened the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side in 1940, his goal was to clear the neighborhood's streets of the shoddy pushcarts that he found so unsightly. 
 He would probably be surprised to learn one of the market's four warehouse-style buildings has now become home to a sandwich stand that goes by the Gallic name of Paradou and sells something called the La Guardia, an $8 concoction of capers, oven-roasted tomatoes and duck rillettes. 
 Local residents are not surprised at the influx of epicurean businesses, nor are they all pleased at the trend. With changes afoot elsewhere in the market, some have opposed devoting yet more space to makers of pricey sandwiches.
 After serving as a busy shopping terminal in Mayor La Guardia's day, Paradou's home, a one-story brick building that sits on Essex Street north of Delancey Street, fell into disrepair by the 1970s. 
 For decades its only occupants were a handful of merchants whose prices were commensurate with the incomes of people who lived in nearby tenements and housing projects. But in recent years, as rents in the neighborhood have climbed, the old-timers have been joined not only by the Paradou creperie but also by cheese makers and other higher-end businesses. 
 Not all the buildings of the Essex Street Market, however, have enjoyed such prosperity. Of the four original structures, which stretch like a chain of subway cars along much of Delancey between Rivington and Broome Streets, one now serves as a health care center and two lie unoccupied, their facades marred by cracked windows and tongues of peeled paint. 
 Representatives of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which administers all four buildings, met last week with a subcommittee of the local community board to discuss plans for Building D, which sits to the south of Delancey. 
 Some members of the board say they'd like to see that building and the other vacant building converted into low-rent housing or leased at a discounted rate to nonprofit community development groups. 
 But according to the development corporation, city law dictates that most of the available space must be reserved for food-related businesses. 
 Still, many people are wary of the possibilities. ''If you've been in our neighborhood,'' said Barden Prisant, chairman of the Housing Committee of Community Board 3, ''you know that the last thing we need is another high-priced restaurant.'' 
 According to Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the development corporation, specific plans will not be made for several months. Whatever the restrictions on the market's uses, those who shop there aren't necessarily in favor of bringing in more grocers or restaurateurs. 
 Hans Fahrmeyer, a resident of Orchard Street who recently stopped into the market to stock up on ingredients for lentil soup, was asked how he thinks the vacant buildings should be used. Mr. Fahrmeyer, a photographer from Germany, raised his eyebrows in mock disbelief, as though the answer couldn't have been more obvious. 
 ''Cheaper housing?'' he asked rhetorically, a bag of potatoes dangling from his hand. Then, using the French word for mushrooms, he added: ''The new high-rises, they're shooting up like champignons.''

HEADLINE: A Truck Tire That Goes the Extra 100,000 Miles

BYLINE: By STUART F. BROWN

 BODY:
STRIKING a balance between conflicting needs is the everyday quest of an automotive engineer. A new engine might be designed for peak horsepower or maximum fuel economy, but not both at the same time; a suspension system can be calibrated for precise cornering or absolute comfort, but sacrifices must be expected in one trait to improve the other.
 Few disciplines are as unforgiving as tire design. Engineer a tire for maximum grip and it may wear too rapidly; specify rubber that will deliver the best fuel economy and you are probably going to end up with a tire reluctant to make quick turns. 
 The forced compromises are especially acute on tractor-trailer trucks, which can cover as many miles in a typical year as a family sedan does in a lifetime. Small changes make big differences; with 18 tires on a long-haul rig, durability, safety and cost become crucial matters.
 The issue of service life -- how many miles the tread will last before the tires wear to perilous smoothness -- is particularly troublesome. Michelin is addressing this issue with a design it calls a self-regenerating tread, expected to go on sale next month as the XDA5 model.
 Tires for big trucks take on specialized roles, performing different jobs depending on their mounting position. The front pair maintain steering control; the trailer tires are devoted to shouldering the payload. The drive-axle tires, those mounted at the rear of the tractor unit, must carry heavy loads while transmitting the torque of a big diesel engine to the asphalt. 
 It's a tough job that uses up the tires in about 300,000 miles. Michelin promises its new drive-axle tire will improve this life span by about 30 percent, a figure sure to get the attention of truck-fleet managers. 
 With about 25 million new truck tires hitting the road in North America every year, extending life by almost a third would represent a substantial conservation of the materials, including natural and synthetic rubber, that go into tires. 
 The XDA5 improves durability by renewing its tread during the final one-quarter of the tire's service life. Michelin's innovation was to mold a secondary channel, called a raindrop groove, into the deepest layer of the tread blocks. The raindrop groove is not visible on a new tire, but as the tread rubber wears away, these lateral grooves are exposed, maintaining the tire's traction in rain or snow for more miles. 
 ''Without a doubt this technology is going to have an important role in tread performance,'' said Kevin Rohlwing, senior vice president for training at the Tire Industry Association, a trade group in Louisville, Ky. Referring to channels called sipes that are designed to direct rain water left and right to prevent a slippery buildup under the tire, he said, ''Finding a way for the sipes to last the life of the tire is going to improve wet performance.''
 Extending tire life is not as simple as adding rubber and making the grooves deeper; if the sipes are too deep, they let the rubber tread blocks squirm, resulting in quirky handling, increased internal friction (and fuel consumption) and uneven wear. 
 About one-third of an 80,000-pound truck's fuel consumption can be attributed to the rolling resistance of the tires Michelin says, so owners are keen to minimize it. Aerodynamic drag and friction in the moving parts account for the rest of the fuel consumption. 
 The raindrop grooves in the XDA5 are positioned at the bottom of deep sipes. Squirming is inhibited by a zigzag pattern molded into the facing walls of the sipes to lock them together. The new lateral grooves start to appear when wear gets down to 10/32nds of an inch. 
 A typical truck tire has a tread almost an inch deep (car tires have treads about 12/32nds of an inch in depth). Even though it is legal to run truck tires down to 2/32nds of an inch, they are commonly sent for retreading when the tread is still 8/32nds or 10/32nds deep because the shallower sipes are gone.
 Retiring rubber early is heartbreaking for truck owners because tires are expensive -- $250 to $400 each, and there are 18 of them. In addition, partly worn tires deliver better fuel economy than new ones do, because the tread blocks of the worn tires are shorter and generate less internal friction. 
 A fleet of 240 tractors owned by the logistics division of La-Z-Boy Inc., a furniture maker based in Monroe, Mich., has served as a test subject for the XDA5 for almost a year. Although the tires' ultimate life will not be known for another 18 months or so, the fleet service manager, Bill Shipley, says the Michelins are wearing at a rate of 1/32nd of an inch per 18,000 miles, with very even wear, which indicates that the tread blocks aren't squirming. Mr. Shipley projects that the tires will have run 400,000 miles or more by the time they reach 4/32nds of an inch tread depth, when it is fleet policy to retread them. 
 Marc Laferriere, vice president for truck-tire marketing at Michelin North America, said the new tires would sell for 6 to 10 percent more than the company's current premium truck tires, which customers should see as a good value given their longer service life. 

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: LONG-LIVED Michelin's truck XDA5. DAIGRAM: ''A Second Wind for Tires on 18-Wheelers'' Among the compromises made in tire designs is the tradeoff between tread depth and tire life. Deeper grooves give the tires more miles, but if they are too deep, the tread blocks move around, generating heat and reducing fuel economy. A new design molds the tires with grooves concealed in the tread blocks, exposing them only when the tires have worn by about two-thirds.
 ''INTERLOCKING BLOCKS'' To prevent the blocks with the buried grooves from squirming while on the road, the cut that allows the tire mold to be released is not straight. Instead, an interlocking pattern in the rubber on the faces of the cut locks the sections together to minimize movement. (Source: Michelin)

HEADLINE: In Nature's Casino

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis. 
Michael Lewis is a contributing writer. The paperback edition of his book ''The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game'' will be published next month.

 BODY:
It was Aug. 24, 2005, and New Orleans was still charming. Tropical Depression 12 was spinning from the Bahamas toward Florida, but the chances of an American city's being destroyed by nature were remote, even for one below sea level. An entire industry of weather bookies -- scientists who calculate the likelihood of various natural disasters -- had in effect set the odds: a storm that destroys $70 billion of insured property should strike the United States only once every 100 years. New Orleanians had made an art form of ignoring threats far more likely than this; indeed, their carelessness was a big reason they were supposedly more charming than other Americans. And it was true: New Orleanians found pleasure even in oblivion. But in their blindness to certain threats, they could not have been more typically American. From Miami to San Francisco, the nation's priciest real estate now faced beaches and straddled fault lines; its most vibrant cities occupied its most hazardous land. If, after World War II, you had set out to redistribute wealth to maximize the sums that might be lost to nature, you couldn't have done much better than Americans had done. And virtually no one -- not even the weather bookies -- fully understood the true odds. 
But there was an exception: an American so improbably prepared for the havoc Tropical Depression 12 was about to wreak that he might as well have planned it. His name was John Seo, he was 39 years old and he ran a hedge fund in Westport, Conn., whose chief purpose was to persuade investors to think about catastrophe in the same peculiar way that he did. He had invested nearly a billion dollars of other people's money in buying what are known as ''cat bonds.'' The buyer of a catastrophe bond is effectively selling catastrophe insurance. He puts down his money and will lose it all if some specified bad thing happens within a predetermined number of years: a big hurricane hitting Miami, say, or some insurance company losing more than $1 billion on any single natural disaster. In exchange, the cat-bond seller -- an insurance company looking to insure itself against extreme losses -- pays the buyer a high rate of interest. 
 Whatever image pops to mind when you hear the phrase ''hedge fund manager,'' Seo (pronounced so) undermines it. On one hand, he's the embodiment of what Wall Street has become: quantitative. But he's quirky. Less interested in money and more interested in ideas than a Wall Street person is meant to be. He inherited not money but math. At the age of 14, in 1950, his mother fled North Korea on foot, walked through live combat, reached the United States and proceeded to become, reportedly, the first Korean woman ever to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics. His father, a South Korean, also came to the United States for his Ph.D. in math and became a professor of economic theory. Two of his three brothers received Ph.D.'s -- one in biology, the other in electrical engineering. John took a physics degree from M.I.T. and applied to Harvard to study for his Ph.D. As a boy, he says, he conceived the idea that he would be a biophysicist, even though he didn't really know what that meant, because, as he puts it, ''I wanted to solve a big problem about life.'' He earned his doctorate in biophysics from Harvard in three years, a department record. 
 His parents had raised him to think, but his thoughts were interrupted once he left Harvard. His wife was pregnant with their second child, and the health plan at Brandeis University, where he had accepted a job, declared her pregnancy a pre-existing condition. He had no money, his parents had no money, and so to cover the costs of childbirth, he accepted a temp job with a Chicago trading firm called O'Connor and Associates. O'Connor had turned a small army of M.I.T. scientists into options traders and made them rich. Seo didn't want to be rich; he just wanted health insurance. To get it, he agreed to spend eight weeks helping O'Connor price esoteric financial options. When he was done, O'Connor offered him 40 grand and asked him to stay, at a starting salary of $250,000, 27 times his post-doc teaching salary. ''Biophysics was starved for resources,'' Seo says. ''Finance was hurling resources at problems. It was almost as if I was taking it as a price signal. It was society's way of saying, Please, will you start solving problems over here?'' 
 His parents, he suspected, would be appalled. They had sacrificed a lot for his academic career. In the late 1980s, if you walked into the Daylight Donuts shop in Dallas, you would have found a sweet-natured Korean woman in her early 50s cheerfully serving up honey-glazed crullers: John's mom. She had abandoned math for motherhood, and then motherhood for doughnuts, after her most promising son insisted on attending M.I.T. instead of S.M.U., where his tuition would have been free. She needed money, and she got it by buying this doughnut shop and changing the recipe so the glaze didn't turn soggy. (Revenues tripled.) Whatever frustration she may have felt, she hid, as she did most of her emotions. But when John told her that he was leaving the university for Wall Street, she wept. His father, a hard man to annoy, said, ''The devil has come to you as a prostitute and has asked you to lie down with her.''
 A willingness to upset one's mother is usually a promising first step to a conventional Wall Street career. But Seo soon turned Wall Street into his own private science lab, and his continued interest in deep questions mollified even his father. ''Before he got into it, I strongly objected,'' Tae Kun Seo says. ''But now I think he's not just grabbing money.'' He has watched his son quit one firm to go to work for another, but never for a simple promotion; instead, John has moved to learn something new. Still, everywhere he goes, he has been drawn to a similar thorny problem: the right price to charge to insure against potential losses from extremely unlikely financial events. ''Tail risk,'' as it is known to quantitative traders, for where it falls in a bell-shaped probability curve. Tail risk, broadly speaking, is whatever financial cataclysm is believed by markets to have a 1 percent chance or less of happening. In the foreign-exchange market, the tail event might be the dollar falling by one-third in a year; in the bond market, it might be interest rates moving 3 percent in six months; in the stock market, it might be a 30 percent crash. ''If there's been a theme to John's life,'' says his brother Nelson, ''it's pricing tail.''
 And if there has been a theme of modern Wall Street, it's that young men with Ph.D.'s who approach money as science can cause more trouble than a hurricane. John Seo is oddly sympathetic to the complaint. He thinks that much of the academic literature about finance is nonsense, for instance. ''These academics couldn't understand the fact that they couldn't beat the markets,'' he says. ''So they just said it was efficient. And, 'Oh, by the way, here's a ton of math you don't understand.' '' He notes that smart risk-takers with no gift for theory often end up with smart solutions to taking extreme financial risk -- answers that often violate the academic theories. (''The markets are usually way ahead of the math.'') He prides himself on his ability to square book smarts with horse sense. As one of his former bosses puts it, ''John was known as the man who could price anything, and his pricing felt right to people who didn't understand his math.'' 
 In the mid-1990s, when Wall Street first noticed money to be made covering the financial risks associated with hurricanes and earthquakes, it was inevitable that someone would call John Seo to ask him if he could figure out how to make sense of it. Until then, he had specialized in financial, not natural, disasters. But there was a connection between financial catastrophe and natural catastrophe. Both were extreme, both were improbable and both needed to be insured against. The firm that called him was Lehman Brothers, whose offer enticed Seo to quit his job and spend his first year at Lehman learning all he could about the old-fashioned insurance industry. 
 Right away, he could see the problem with natural catastrophe. An insurance company could function only if it was able to control its exposure to loss. Geico sells auto insurance to more than seven million Americans. No individual car accident can be foreseen, obviously, but the total number of accidents over a large population is amazingly predictable. The company knows from past experience what percentage of the drivers it insures will file claims and how much those claims will cost. The logic of catastrophe is very different: either no one is affected or vast numbers of people are. After an earthquake flattens Tokyo, a Japanese earthquake insurer is in deep trouble: millions of customers file claims. If there were a great number of rich cities scattered across the planet that might plausibly be destroyed by an earthquake, the insurer could spread its exposure to the losses by selling earthquake insurance to all of them. The losses it suffered in Tokyo would be offset by the gains it made from the cities not destroyed by an earthquake. But the financial risk from earthquakes -- and hurricanes -- is highly concentrated in a few places.
 There were insurance problems that were beyond the insurance industry's means. Yet insurers continued to cover them, sometimes unenthusiastically, sometimes recklessly. Why didn't insurance companies see this? Seo wondered, and then found the answer: They hadn't listened closely enough to Karen Clark. 
 Thirteen years before what would become Tropical Storm Katrina churned toward Florida -- on Monday, Aug. 24, 1992 -- Karen Clark walked from her Boston office to a nearby Au Bon Pain. Several hours earlier, Hurricane Andrew had struck Florida, and she knew immediately that the event could define her career. Back in 1985, while working for an insurance company, Clark wrote a paper with the unpromising title ''A Formal Approach to Catastrophe Risk Assessment in Management.'' In it, she made the simple point that insurance companies had no idea how much money they might lose in a single storm. For decades Americans had been lurching toward catastrophe. The 1970s and '80s were unusually free of major storms. At the same time, Americans were cramming themselves and their wealth onto the beach. The insurance industry had been oblivious to the trends and continued to price catastrophic risk just as it always had, by the seat of its pants. The big insurance companies ran up and down the Gulf Coast selling as many policies as they could. No one -- not even the supposed experts at Lloyd's of London -- had any idea of the scope of new development and the exposure that the insurance industry now had. 
 To better judge the potential cost of catastrophe, Clark gathered very long-term historical data on hurricanes. ''There was all this data that wasn't being used,'' she says. ''You could take it, and take all the science that also wasn't being used, and you could package it in a model that could spit out numbers companies could use to make decisions. It just seemed like such an obvious thing to do.'' She combined the long-term hurricane record with new data on property exposure -- building-replacement costs by ZIP code, engineering reports, local building codes, etc. -- and wound up with a crude but powerful tool, both for judging the probability of a catastrophe striking any one area and for predicting the losses it might inflict. Then she wrote her paper about it.
 The attention Clark's paper attracted was mostly polite. Two years later, she visited Lloyd's -- pregnant with her first child, hauling a Stone Age laptop -- and gave a speech to actual risk-takers. In nature's casino, they had set themselves up as the house, and yet they didn't know the odds. They assumed that even the worst catastrophe could generate no more than a few billion dollars in losses, but her model was generating insured losses of more than $30 billion for a single storm -- and these losses were far more likely to occur than they had been in the previous few decades. She projected catastrophic storms from the distant past onto the present-day population and storms from the more recent past onto richer and more populated areas than they had actually hit. (If you reran today the hurricane that struck Miami in 1926, for instance, it would take out not the few hundred million dollars of property it destroyed at the time but $60 billion to $100 billion.) ''But,'' she says, ''from their point of view, all of this was just in this computer.'' 
 She spoke for 45 minutes but had no sense that she had been heard. ''The room was very quiet,'' she says. ''No one got up and left. But no one asked questions either. People thought they had already figured it out. They were comfortable with their own subjective judgment.'' Of course they were; they had made pots of money the past 20 years insuring against catastrophic storms. But -- and this was her real point -- there hadn't been any catastrophic storms! The insurers hadn't been smart. They had been lucky. 
 Clark soon found herself in a role for which she was, on the surface at least, ill suited: fanatic. ''I became obsessed with it,'' she says. One big player in the insurance industry took closer notice of her work and paid her enough to start a business. Applied Insurance Research, she called it, or A.I.R. Clark hired a few scientists and engineers, and she set to work acquiring more and better data and building better models. But what she really was doing -- without quite realizing it -- was waiting, waiting for a storm. 
 Hurricane Andrew made landfall at 5 on a Monday morning. By 9 she knew only the path of the storm and its intensity, but the information enabled her to estimate the losses: $13 billion, give or take. If builders in South Florida had ignored the building codes and built houses to lower standards, the losses might come in even higher. She faxed the numbers to insurers, then walked to Au Bon Pain. Everything was suddenly more vivid and memorable. She ordered a smoked-turkey and Boursin cheese sandwich on French bread, with lettuce and tomato, and a large Diet Coke. It was a nice sunny day in Boston. She sat outside at a small black table, alone. ''It was too stressful to be with other people,'' she says. ''I didn't want to even risk a conversation.'' She ate in what she describes as ''a catatonic state.'' The scuttlebutt from Lloyd's already had it that losses couldn't possibly exceed $6 billion, and some thought they were looking at a loss of just a few hundred million. ''No one believed it,'' she says of her estimate. ''No one thought it was right. No one said, 'Yeah, $13 billion sounds like a reasonable number.' '' As she ate, she wondered what $13 billion in losses looked like. 
 When she returned to the office, her phones were ringing. ''People were outraged,'' she says. ''They thought I was crazy.'' One insurance guy called her, chortling. ''A few mobile homes and an Air Force base -- how much could it be?'' he said. 
 It took months for the insurers to tote up their losses: $15.5 billion. (Building codes in South Florida had not been strictly enforced.) Fifteen and a half billion dollars exceeded all of the insurance premiums ever collected in Dade County. Eleven insurance companies went bust. And this wasn't anything like the perfect storm. If it had gone into Miami, it could have bankrupted the whole industry. Clark had been right: the potential financial losses from various catastrophes were too great, and too complicated, to be judged by human intuition. ''No one ever called to congratulate me,'' Clark says, laughing. ''But I had a lot of people call and ask to buy the model.'' 
 After Hurricane Andrew came a shift in the culture of catastrophe. ''This one woman really created the method for valuing this risk,'' says John Seo. Clark's firm, A.I.R., soon had more than 25 Ph.D.'s on staff and two competitors, Eqecat and Risk Management Solutions. In its Bay Area offices, R.M.S. now houses more than 100 meteorologists, seismologists, oceanographers, physicists, engineers and statisticians, and they didn't stop at hurricanes and earthquakes but moved on to flash floods, wildfires, extreme winter storms, tornadoes, tsunamis and an unpleasant phenomenon delicately known as ''extreme mortality,'' which, more roughly speaking, is the possibility that huge numbers of insured human beings will be killed off by something like a global pandemic. 
 The models these companies created differed from peril to peril, but they all had one thing in common: they accepted that the past was an imperfect guide to the future. No hurricane has hit the coast of Georgia, for instance, since detailed records have been kept. And so if you relied solely on the past, you would predict that no hurricane ever will hit the Georgia coast. But that makes no sense: the coastline above, in South Carolina, and below, in Florida, has been ravaged by storms. ''You are dealing with a physical process,'' says Robert Muir-Wood, the chief scientist for R.M.S. ''There is no physical reason why Georgia has not been hit. Georgia's just been lucky.'' To evaluate the threat to a Georgia beach house, you need to see through Georgia's luck. To do this, the R.M.S. modeler creates a history that never happened: he uses what he knows about actual hurricanes, plus what he knows about the forces that create and fuel hurricanes, to invent a 100,000-year history of hurricanes. Real history serves as a guide -- it enables him to see, for instance, that the odds of big hurricanes making landfall north of Cape Hatteras are far below the odds of them striking south of Cape Hatteras. It allows him to assign different odds to different stretches of coastline without making the random distinctions that actual hurricanes have made in the last 100 years. Generate a few hundred thousand hurricanes, and you generate not only dozens of massive hurricanes that hit Georgia but also a few that hit, say, Rhode Island. 
 The companies' models disagreed here and there, but on one point they spoke with a single voice: four natural perils had outgrown the insurers' ability to insure them -- U.S. hurricane, California earthquake, European winter storm and Japanese earthquake. The insurance industry was prepared to lose $30 billion in a single event, once every 10 years. The models showed that a sole hurricane in Florida wouldn't have to work too hard to create $100 billion in losses. There were concentrations of wealth in the world that defied the logic of insurance. And most of them were in America. 
 The more John Seo looked into the insurance industry, the more it seemed to be teetering at the edge of ruin. This had happened once before, in 1842, when the city of Hamburg burned to the ground and bankrupted the entire German insurance industry many times over. Out of the ashes was born a new industry, called reinsurance. The point of reinsurance was to take on the risk that the insurance industry couldn't dilute through diversification -- say, the risk of an entire city burning to the ground or being wiped off the map by a storm. The old insurance companies would still sell policies to the individual residents of Hamburg. But they would turn around and hand some of the premiums they collected to Cologne Re (short for reinsurance) in exchange for taking on losses over a certain amount. Cologne Re would protect itself by diversifying at a higher level -- by selling catastrophic fire insurance to lots of other towns. 
 But by their very nature, the big catastrophic risks of the early 21st century couldn't be diversified away. Wealth had become far too concentrated in a handful of extraordinarily treacherous places. The only way to handle them was to spread them widely, and the only way to do that was to get them out of the insurance industry and onto Wall Street. Today, the global stock markets are estimated at $59 trillion. A 1 percent drop in the markets -- not an unusual event -- causes $590 billion in losses. The losses caused by even the biggest natural disaster would be a drop in the bucket to the broader capital markets. ''If you could take a Magnitude 8 earthquake and distribute its shock across the planet, no one would feel it,'' Seo says. ''The same principle applies here.'' That's where catastrophe bonds came in: they were the ideal mechanism for dissipating the potential losses to State Farm, Allstate and the other insurers by extending them to the broader markets. 
 Karen Clark's model was, for Seo, the starting point. When he first stumbled upon it and the other companies' models, he found them ''guilty until proven innocent,'' as he puts it. ''I could see the uncertainty in them,'' he says, ''just by looking at the different numbers they generated for the same storm.'' When they run numbers to see what would happen if the 1926 Miami hurricane hit the city today, A.I.R. puts the losses at $80 billion, R.M.S. at $106 billion and Eqecat at $63 billion. They can't all be right. But they didn't need to be exactly right, just sort of right, and the more he poked around inside them, the more he felt they were better than good enough to underpin financial decisions. They enabled you to get a handle on the risk as best you could while acknowledging that you would never know it exactly. And after all, how accurate were the models that forecast the likelihood that Enron would collapse? Next to what Wall Street investors tried to predict every day, natural disasters seemed almost stable. ''In the financial markets, you have to care what other people think, even if what they think is screwed up,'' Seo says. ''Crowd dynamics build on each other. But these things -- hurricanes, earthquakes -- don't exhibit crowd behavior. There's a real underlying risk you have to understand. You have to be a value investor.'' 
 The models were necessary but insufficient. True, they gave you a rough sense of the expected financial losses, but they said nothing about the rewards. Financial markets exist only as long as investors feel the odds are stacked in their favor. Investors -- unlike roulette players -- can honestly expect to make a gain (their share in the profits of productive enterprise). But how big a gain? How should the payout vary, from government bonds to blue-chip stocks to subprime mortgages? The rewards in each market tended to vary with investors' moods, but those in catastrophe insurance were just incredibly volatile. Hurricane insurance rates would skyrocket after a big storm, then settle back down. This wouldn't do: if big investors were going to be persuaded to take billions of dollars in catastrophic risk, they would need to feel there was some reason in the pricing of that risk. ''The market,'' as Seo puts it, ''needs an acceptable mode of failure.''
 In the spring of 2001, to the surprise of his colleagues, Seo left his big Wall Street firm and opened a hedge fund -- which, he announced, wouldn't charge its investors the standard 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of returns but a lower, flat fee. ''It was quixotic,'' says Paul Puleo, a former executive at Lehman who worked with Seo. ''He quits this high-paying job to basically open a business in his garage in a market that doesn't exist.'' Seo opened his new shop with his younger brother Nelson and then brought in their older brother, Michael. (His third brother, Scott, had studied astrophysics but decided that ''there was no future in astrophysics'' and eventually turned himself into an ophthalmologist.) Seo named his firm Fermat Capital Management, after one of his intellectual heroes. ''I had once read the letters between Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal,'' he wrote in a recent e-mail message. ''From my father I had learned that most great mathematicians were nasty guys and total jerks (check out Isaac Newton . . . extra nasty guy), but when I read the Fermat-Pascal letters, you could see that Fermat was an exception to the stereotype . . . truly a noble person. I loved his character and found that his way of analyzing profitless games of chance (probability theory) was the key to understanding how to analyze profitable games of chance (investment theory).'' 
 Four years later, Seo's hedge fund still faced two problems. The smaller one was that investors were occasionally slow to see the appeal of an investment whose first name was catastrophe. As one investor put it, ''My boss won't let me buy bonds that I have to watch the Weather Channel to follow.'' That objection doesn't worry Seo much. ''Investors who object to cat-bond investing usually say that it's just gambling,'' he says. ''But the more mature guys say: 'That's what investing is. But it's gambling with the odds in your favor.' '' 
 His bigger problem was that insurance companies still didn't fully understand their predicament: they had $500 billion in exposure to catastrophe but had sold only about $5 billion of cat bonds -- a fifth of them to him. Still, he could see their unease in their prices: hurricane- and earthquake-insurance premiums bounced around madly from year to year. Right after Andrew, the entire industry quintupled its prices; a few tranquil years later, prices were back down nearly to where they had been before the storm. Financial markets bounced around wildly too, of course, but in the financial markets, the underlying risks (corporate earnings, people's moods) were volatile. The risk in natural-disaster insurance was real, physical and, in principle, quantifiable, and from year to year it did not change much, if at all. In effect, the insurers weren't insuring against disaster; they were only pretending to take the risk, without actually doing so, and billing their customers retroactively for whatever losses they incurred. At the same time, they were quietly sneaking away from catastrophe. Before the 1994 Northridge earthquake, more than a third of California homeowners had quake insurance; right after, the insurers fled the market, so that fewer than 15 percent of California homeowners have earthquakes in their policies today. 
 The market was broken: people on fault lines and beachfronts were stuck either paying far too much for their insurance or with no real coverage except the vague and corrupting hope that, in a crisis, the government would bail them out. A potentially huge, socially beneficial market was moments from birth. All it needed was a push from nature. And so on Aug. 24, 2005, John Seo was waiting, waiting for a storm. And here it came.
 Wall Street is a machine for turning information nobody cares about into information people can get rich from. Back when banks lent people money to buy homes and then sat around waiting for interest payments, no one thought to explore how quickly homeowners would refinance their mortgages if interest rates fell. But then Wall Street created a market in mortgage bonds, and the trader with better information about how and when people refinance made a killing. There's now a giant subindustry to analyze the inner financial life of the American homeowner. 
 Catastrophe bonds do something even odder: they financialize storms. Once there's a market for cat bonds, there's money to be made, even as a storm strikes, in marginally better weathermen. For instance, before the 2005 hurricane season, a Bermuda cat-bond hedge fund called Nephila found a team of oceanographers in Rhode Island called Accurate Environmental Forecasting, whose forecasts of hurricane seasons had been surprisingly good. Nephila rented the company's services and traded bonds on the back of its reports. ''They kind of chuckle at what we do,'' says a Nephila founder, Frank Majors. ''The fact that we're making $10 million bets on whether Charley is going to hit Tampa or not. It made them a little nervous at first. We told them not to worry about what we're going to do with the information. Just give it to us.'' 
 As Katrina bore down on New Orleans, a cat bond named Kamp Re, issued by the insurance company Zurich, was suddenly at risk. If Zurich lost more than $1.2 billion on a single hurricane in about a two-year period, investors would lose all their money. If Zurich represented about 3 percent of the U.S. insurance market -- that is, it was on the hook for about 3 percent of the losses -- a hurricane would need to inflict about $40 billion in damage to trigger the default. Since no event as big as this had ever happened, it was hard to say just how likely it was to happen. According to R.M.S., there was a 1.08 percent chance that Kamp Re bond holders would lose all their money -- assuming the scientists really understood the odds. The deal had been a success. One of its biggest buyers was John Seo. 
 As Katrina spun, the players in nature's casino gathered around the table. When the storm jogged east and struck not New Orleans directly but the less populated, and less wealthy, coastline between Louisiana and Mississippi, they all had the same reaction -- relief -- but Hemant Shah felt a special relief. Shah is one of the founders of R.M.S., and he was at that moment driving to catch a flight from San Francisco to New York, where he hoped to speak at a conference devoted to predicting terrorism. When he saw Katrina miss New Orleans, he said to himself, O.K., it's big, but it's not catastrophic, and he boarded his plane. 
 As he flew across the country, R.M.S. and its competitors replicated Katrina inside their computers in much the same way that Karen Clark had once replicated Hurricane Andrew. Just hours after landfall, all three firms sent clients in the insurance industry their best estimates of financial losses: R.M.S. put them at $10 billion to $25 billion; Eqecat called for a range between $9 billion and $16 billion; Clark's A.I.R. had a range of $12.7 billion to $26.5 billion. Big, as Shah said, but not catastrophic. Traders who had underwritten Kamp Re took calls from an investor at a Japanese bank in London. Cheered by Katrina's path, the fellow was looking to buy some Kamp Re bonds. The traders found another investor eager to unload his Kamp Re holdings. The London investor bought $10 million of Kamp Re at a price of $94. 
 John Seo just watched. For the past four years, he and his brothers had made money at such moments as this: ''live'' cat trading, it's called. A few investors would inevitably become jittery and sell their cat bonds at big discounts, what with the Weather Channel all hysteria all the time. (''The worst place to go if you're taking risks,'' says one cat-bond investor, ''is the Weather Channel. They're just screaming all the time.'') But entering the 2005 hurricane season, the Seo brothers had reconsidered their habit of buying in a storm. ''The word had gotten out that buying in the storm was the smart thing to do,'' Seo says. ''And we were afraid our past successes would give us an irrational interest in buying. Everything's all fuzzy in these events. And when things are fuzzy, your brain gives you an excuse to push the envelope. So we adopted a policy, before the season, of staying out of the market.'' 
 A few hours later, Hemant Shah's plane landed in New York. Shah turned on his BlackBerry and discovered that the New Orleans levees had broken: much of the city would soon be underwater. ''My first reaction,'' Shah says, ''was, Uh-oh, we have a problem.'' In the imaginary 100,000-year history of hurricanes that R.M.S. had in its computers, no hypothetical storm that struck so far from New Orleans had ever caused the levees to fail. The models, like the intuition they replaced, had a blind spot. 
 The Kamp Re bonds collapsed, the price dropping from the mid-90s to the low 20s. A few weeks later, an announcement from Zurich American made it clear that the investors in Kamp Re wouldn't be getting any money back, and Kamp Re's price fell from $20 to 10 cents. But then the real trouble started: R.M.S., the modeling company, declared that it was rethinking the whole subject of hurricane risk. Since 1995, scientists had noted a distinct uptick in hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Basin. The uptick had been ignorable because the storms had not been making landfall. But between July 2004 and the end of 2005, seven of history's most expensive hurricanes had struck the American coast, leaving behind 5.5 million insurance claims and $81 billion in insured losses. The rise in hurricane size and frequency was no longer ignorable. R.M.S. convened a panel of scientists. The scientists agreed that unusually warm sea-surface temperatures were causing unusually ferocious and frequent storms. The root cause might be global warming or merely the routine ups and downs of temperatures in the North Atlantic Basin. On cause they failed to agree. On consequence they were united. At the beginning of August 2005, R.M.S. had judged a Katrina-size catastrophe to be a once-in-40-years event. Seven months later, the company pegged it as a once-in-20-years event. The risk had doubled. 
 It had been just 13 years since Karen Clark's model swept the industry, but the entire catastrophe risk-taking industry now lived at the mercy of these modelers. The scientists were, in effect, the new odds-makers. It was as if the casino owner had walked up to his roulette table, seen a pile of chips on 00 and announced that 00 would no longer pay 36:1 but would henceforth pay only 18:1. The agencies that rated the insurance companies -- S & P, Moodys, etc. -- relied on the scientists to evaluate their exposure. When the scientists increased the likelihood of catastrophic storms, S & P and Moodys demanded that the insurance companies raise more capital to cover their suddenly more probable losses. And so in addition to the more than $40 billion they had lost in Katrina, the insurance companies, by edict of the ratings agencies, needed to raise $82 billion from their shareholders just to keep their investment-grade rating. And suddenly they weren't so eager to expose themselves to losses from hurricanes. 
 John Seo felt differently. Katrina had cost him millions. But at the same time, in a funny way, it had vindicated his ideas about catastrophe. He had lost only what he had expected to lose. He had found an acceptable mode of failure. 
 As a boy, John Seo learned everything he could about the Titanic. ''It was considered unsinkable because it had a hull of 16 chambers,'' he says. The chambers were stacked back to front. If the ship hit something head on, the object might puncture the front chamber, but it would likely have to puncture at least three more to sink the ship. ''They probably said, What are the odds of four chambers going?'' he says. ''There might have been a one-in-a-hundred chance of puncturing a single chamber, but the odds of puncturing four chambers, they probably thought of as one in a million. That's because they thought of them as independent chambers. And the chambers might have been independent if the first officer hadn't gambled at the last minute and swerved. By swerving, the iceberg went down the side of the ship. If the officer had taken it head on, he might have killed a passenger or two, but the ship might not have sunk. The mistake was to turn. Often people associate action with lowering risk or controlling risk, but experience shows more often than not that by taking action you only make the risk worse.'' 
 The Titanic offered another lesson for the investor in catastrophe: the threats that seem to us the most remote are those we know the least about. Catastrophe risk is fundamentally different from normal risk. It deals with events so rare that experience doesn't help you much to predict them. How do you use history to judge the likelihood of a pandemic killing off 1 in every 200 Americans? You can't. It has happened only once. (The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918.) You lack information. You don't know what you don't know. The further out into the tail you go -- the less probable the event -- the greater the uncertainty. The greater the uncertainty, the more an investor should be paid to live with it. 
 The financial markets, or, at any rate, the arcane corner of Wall Street that dealt exclusively with highly unlikely financial events, had figured this out. The traders who sold insurance against extreme market collapses -- the tail risks -- all tended to charge exactly the same price, between four and five times their expected losses. Expected loss could be defined like this: Say an investor wanted to buy $1 billion of insurance for a year against a once-in-100-years stock-market crash. The expected loss would be 1 in 100, 1 percent of $1 billion: $10 million. The insurance would thus cost $40 million to $50 million. The pattern held across Wall Street. The trader at Lehman Brothers who priced stock-market-crash insurance didn't know the trader at Harvard Management who priced the insurance against drastic interest-rate changes, and he didn't know the trader at O'Connor and Associates who priced the insurance against the dollar's losing a third of its value. But their idea of a fair premium for insurance against financial disaster suggested they were reading the same books on the subject -- only there were no books. ''The reigning theory is that the taste for risk is as arbitrary as the value of a painting,'' Seo says. ''But if this is so, why are these preferences so consistent across markets?'' 
 Seo thought, Maybe risk is not like art. Maybe there is some deep rule that governs it. And maybe the market is groping its way to that rule all by itself. 
 Intuitively what the market was doing made sense. Highly improbable events were especially unsettling. The person who insured others against an unlikely event faced not only the problem of judging its likelihood; even if he knew how often it would occur, he didn't know when it would occur. Even if you had complete certainty that a U.S. stock-market crash happened just once every 25 years, you still didn't know which year. If you had set up a business to sell crash insurance in January 1987, you would have been bankrupted by the crash in October; on the other hand, if you had gone into the business in 1988, you would have gotten rich. There was no justice in it. The catastrophic risk-taker was a bit like a card counter at the blackjack table allowed to play only a few hands: yes, the odds are in his favor, but he doesn't always get to play long enough for the odds to determine the outcome. 
 The uncertainty in these extreme, remote market risks meant that the person who took them should be paid more to do so. But how much more? Extreme events were treated on Wall Street as freak outliers that bore no relation to other, more normal events. There was a striking consistency in the pricing of these risks across Wall Street, but there was no hard logic under them: it was all being done by feel. 
 The logic is what Seo stumbled upon back in 2000 at Lehman Brothers after someone handed him a weird option to price. An industrial company had called Lehman with a problem. It operated factories in Japan and California, both near fault lines. It could handle one of the two being shut down by an earthquake, but not both at the same time. Could Lehman Brothers quote a price for an option that would pay the company $10 million if both Japan and California suffered earthquakes in the same year? Lehman turned to its employee with a reputation for being able to price anything. And Seo thought it over. The earthquakes that the industrial company was worried about were not all that improbable: roughly once-a-decade events. A sloppy solution would be simply to call an insurance company and buy $10 million in coverage for the Japanese quake and then another $10 million in coverage for the California quake; the going rate was $2 million for each policy. ''If I had been lazy, I could have just quoted $4 million for the premium,'' he says. ''It would have been obnoxious to do so, but traders have been known to do it.'' If either quake happened, but not both, he would have a windfall gain of $10 million. (One of his policies would pay him $10 million, but he would not be required to pay anything to the quake-fearing corporation, since it would get paid only if both earthquakes occurred.) 
 But there was a better solution. He needed to buy the California quake insurance for $2 million, its market price, but only if the Japanese quake happened in the same year. All Seo had to do, then, was buy enough Japanese quake insurance so that if the Japanese quake occurred, he could afford to pay the insurance company for his $10 million California insurance policy: $2 million. In other words, he didn't need $10 million of Japanese quake insurance; he needed only $2 million. The cost of that was a mere $400,000. For that sum, he could insure the manufacturing company against its strange risk at little risk to himself. Anything he charged above $400,000 was pure profit for Lehman Brothers. 
 And that was that, except it wasn't. He saw something. Each risk by itself was not unusual: the quakes being insured against were once-a-decade events. But since each earthquake had a 1-in-10 chance of happening in a year, the chances that both of them would occur were far more remote: 1 in 100 (10 percent of 10 percent). When you combined these more ordinary risks, you simulated extremely unlikely ones. ''What I noticed, after the fact, is that this exotic option's price was special,'' he says. ''It was related to tail pricing.'' The risk of catastrophe wasn't some freak outlier with no connection to more mainstream risks. It bore a fixed relationship to those risks. Indeed, one way of thinking about natural catastrophes was as a combination of more likely events. 
 Thus the hunches of Wall Street professionals found vindication in Seo's arithmetic. The expected loss of the more ordinary risk of a single earthquake was $1 million (a 10 percent chance of a $10 million loss). The insurance cost $2 million, or twice the expected loss. The expected loss of the remote combined risk was $100,000 (a 1 percent chance of a $10 million loss). But the insurance cost $400,000: four times the expected loss. All those practical traders who were pricing tail risk at roughly four times the expected losses had been on to something. ''Here I saw the beginnings of a market mechanism that directly links 1-in-10-year risk pricing to 1-in-100-year risk pricing,'' Seo says. The intuitive reason that extreme, remote risk should be more highly priced than normal everyday risk was ''a happy agreement between human psychological perception and hard mathematical logic.'' 
 Seo's math -- which soon left middle school for graduate school -- served two purposes: to describe this universal rule about the pricing of risk and to persuade investors that there was a deeper, hidden logic to investing in catastrophe. They could have some sense of what the price of the risk should be. It was an extraordinary idea: that catastrophe might be fair. 
 Then came Katrina. The reaction to the storm has put a fine point on Americans' risk disorientation. The single biggest issue in Florida's 2006 governor's race, for instance, was the price of insurance. The Republican, Charlie Crist, got himself elected on the strength of his promise to reduce Floridians' home-insurance rates by creating a state-subsidized pool of $28 billion in catastrophe insurance coverage. ''Florida took this notion of spreading this risk and turned it on its head,'' says one former state insurance commissioner. ''They said, 'We're going to take all this risk ourselves.' '' The state sold its citizens catastrophe insurance at roughly one-sixth the market rates, thus encouraging them to live in riskier places than they would if they had to pay what the market charged (and in the bargain, the state subsidized the well-to-do who live near the beach at the expense of the less-well-to-do who don't). But if all the models are correct, $28 billion might not cover even one serious storm. The disaster waiting to happen in Florida grows bigger by the day, but for a man running for governor of Florida, ignoring it is a political no-brainer. If he's lucky -- if no big storms hit in his term -- he looks like the genius who saved Floridians billions in catastrophic-risk premiums. If he's unlucky, he bankrupts Florida and all hell breaks loose, but he can shake down the federal government to cover some of the losses. 
 Louisiana's politicians are usually quicker than most to seize upon shrewd politics that generate terrible social policy, but in this case they could not afford to. Louisiana cannot generate and preserve wealth without insurance, and it cannot obtain insurance except at the market price. But that price remains a mystery. Billions of dollars in insurance settlements -- received by local businesses and homeowners as payouts on their pre-Katrina policies -- bloat New Orleans banks and brokerage houses. The money isn't moving because the people are paralyzed. It's as if they have been forced to shoot craps without knowing the odds. Businesses are finding it harder than ever to buy insurance, and homeowners are getting letters from Allstate, State Farm and the others telling them that their long relationship must now come to an end. ''I've been in the business 45 years,'' says a New Orleans insurance broker named Happy Crusel, ''and I've never seen anything remotely like this.'' An entire city is now being reshaped by an invisible force: the price of catastrophic risk. But it's the wrong price. 
 Insurance companies, John Seo says, are charging customers too much -- or avoiding their customers altogether -- instead of sharing their risk with others, like himself, who would be glad to take it. New Orleans, as a result, is slower than it otherwise would be to rebuild. ''The insurance companies are basically running away from society,'' he says. ''What they need to do is take the risk and kick it up to us.'' They need to spread it as widely as possible across the investment world and, in the process, minimize the cost of insuring potential losses from catastrophes. 
 But this, too, is happening. The people on Wall Street who specialize in cat bonds now view Katrina as the single most important thing that ever happened to their business: overnight it went from a tiny backwater to a $14 billion market, and it is now stretching and straining to grow. In March of this year, a single insurer, Allstate, announced its intention to sell $4 billion in catastrophe bonds. A $14 billion market is a trivial sum next to the half-trillion or so dollars that the insurance industry stands to lose from megacatastrophes and next to the additional trillions of dollars worth of property that has gone uninsured in the places most likely to be destroyed by nature, like California, because the insurance is so expensive. But there are all around John Seo signs of a shift in the culture of catastrophe. ''It has all the features of providential action,'' he says. ''It's like all the actions of man and nature serve to grow the cat-bond market.'' 
 When Katrina struck and his Kamp Re bonds collapsed -- from $100 to 0 -- Seo was able to view his losswith detachment. The models had badly underestimated the risk, but it was in the nature of extreme risk that the prediction of it would sometimes be mistaken. ''The important thing is that the money wasn't lost in an unearned manner,'' he says, by which he means that it wasn't lost dishonestly or even unwisely or in what his community of investors would consider a professionally unacceptable manner. Investors will endure losses as long as they come in the context of a game they perceive as basically fair, which is why they don't abandon the stock market after a crash. ''That's all I need to know,'' Seo says. ''That's all my clients need to know.'' Actually, he goes even further: ''I would be embarrassed if we had a big event and our loss wasn't commensurate with it. It would mean that we didn't serve society. We failed society.'' 
 Seo's returns in 2005 were only slightly positive, compared with the roughly 10 to 12 percent he had been delivering, but the demand for his services boomed. He now controls $2 billion, or more than twice what he had before the most costly natural disaster in history. Big investors weren't scared off by Katrina. Just the reverse. It has led many of them to turn to Seo and others like him to make money from catastrophe. And they probably will. But what interests Seo more is what might happen in the bargain, that the financial consequences of catastrophe will be turned into something they have never been: boringly normal.

HEADLINE: Will the Fed Weigh In Again?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
IT may be hard to muster concern for multimillionaire hedge fund speculators who got burned in the debt markets, but their problems are quickly becoming yours, one investment adviser warns. He sees trouble moving out of the high-rent district and setting up house next door. 
 ''The credit problems may have originated on Wall Street, but they have moved to Main Street,'' said Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at the TCW Group, a fund management firm in Los Angeles. The response to that trend by traders and the Federal Reserve, he said, is likely to determine the immediate course of the stock and bond markets. 
 Mr. Sri-Kumar is hoping that the Fed will arrive at the conclusion that many investors already have reached: that stronger action is needed to contain the damage from the deterioration of debt markets.
 ''The credit crunch and the lack of availability of money for mortgages have become so serious that what the Fed has to do for Wall Street and for homeowners is the same,'' he said.
 In his view, the essential ingredient for recovery is a reduction in the target for the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks make very short-term loans to each other. That would help stabilize the markets and add momentum to the rally in stocks that began nine days ago, when the Fed cut the discount rate, the rate banks pay to borrow directly from the Fed.
 A Fed funds rate cut, at the bank's September meeting or sooner, might help the economy by stimulating bank lending. The drastic fall in yields on Treasury bills in the last couple of weeks is a sign that banks have been parking their money in these ultrasafe government securities instead of lending to businesses and home buyers, Mr. Sri-Kumar said.
 He advocates a half-percentage- point cut rather than the customary quarter-point move, and sooner rather than later. Such a lightning strike would be good for the Fed's credibility, as well as for the health of the economy and markets, he said.
 The best sequence of events, he said, is this: ''A crisis happens, the Fed responds, there's a cure and we move on.''
 ''The Fed is becoming subservient to the financial markets as long as it delays,'' he warned. ''Come what may, they're going to force the Fed to cut rates. You don't want to see the Fed in that position, always getting cowed by the markets.''
 DATA WATCH Evidence of weakness in housing is expected on Monday. Sales of existing homes are estimated in a Bloomberg News poll of economists to have fallen to an annual rate of 5.70 million units in July from 5.75 million in June.
 The effect of the market's problems on consumer confidence should become clearer on Tuesday. The Conference Board's monthly survey is expected to show a sharp fall, to 104 for August from 112.6 for July.

HEADLINE: When Bad News Follows You

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT

 BODY:
A BUSINESS strategy of The New York Times to get its articles to pop up first in Internet searches is creating a perplexing problem: long-buried information about people that is wrong, outdated or incomplete is getting unwelcome new life.
 People are coming forward at the rate of roughly one a day to complain that they are being embarrassed, are worried about losing or not getting jobs, or may be losing customers because of the sudden prominence of old news articles that contain errors or were never followed up. 
 Take the case of Allen Kraus, a former deputy commissioner in the New York City Human Resources Administration. He once led a welfare office praised for its efforts to uncover fraud. Things seemed fine until he got a new boss with whom he tangled over budget and staffing. By mutual agreement, he resigned.
 Six weeks later, an investigation his office initiated led to multiple arrests in a fraud and bribery scheme. His boss announced his resignation in a press release about the arrests. Kraus was furious. Hours later, the boss issued a second press release that said ''there is no evidence of criminal culpability'' on Kraus's part but that she was concerned about ''weaknesses'' in his department. 
 The New York Times reported the next morning that he resigned under pressure as a result of the investigation. There was no mention of Kraus's side of the story. The next day, after he said he contacted The Times, it published a much shorter article quoting his version of events.
 Eventually, he said, his boss signed a letter saying that his resignation was not connected with the fraud investigation.
 All that was 16 years ago. Kraus moved on, forming a health consulting business with clients from New York to California. But today, if you look for him on Google, the first thing that pops up is not the home page of his consulting business. It's an old New York Times article: ''A Welfare Official Denies He Resigned Because of Inquiry.'' Kraus wonders if that is costing him clients.
 Kraus's situation is an unhappy byproduct of something called search engine optimization, which The Times has been using to make money by driving traffic to its Web site. Technically complex, search engine optimization pushes Times content to or near the top of search results, regardless of its importance or accuracy. 
 Kraus is hardly alone in claiming real or potential harm. A person arrested years ago on charges of fondling a child said the accusation was false and the charges were dropped. The Times reported the arrest but not the disposition of the case. A woman said her wedding announcement 20 years ago gave the incorrect university from which she graduated. She is afraid prospective employers who Google her will suspect resume inflation. A woman quoted years ago in an article about weight loss said, tearfully, that she never was a size 16, as the article stated. The husband of a school administrator in the Midwest complained that a news brief reporting her suspension was published after officials had already publicly said she did nothing wrong.
 Most people who complain want the articles removed from the archive.
 Until recently, The Times's response has always been the same: There's nothing we can do. Removing anything from the historical record would be, in the words of Craig Whitney, the assistant managing editor in charge of maintaining Times standards, ''like airbrushing Trotsky out of the Kremlin picture.'' 
 Whitney and other editors say they recognize that because the Internet has opened to the world material once available only from microfilm or musty clippings in the newspaper's library, they have a new obligation to minimize harm.
 But what can they do? The choices all seem fraught with pitfalls. You can't accept someone's word that an old article was wrong. What if that person who was charged with abusing a child really was guilty? Re-report every story challenged by someone? Impossible, said Jonathan Landman, the deputy managing editor in charge of the newsroom's online operation: there'd be time for nothing else. 
 How about trying a technological fix that would push articles with problems lower in search engines? What standards would you use? Would you be burying other important information? What about allowing an aggrieved party to place a comment in the archive? How would you police its accuracy?
 ''It totally stumps me,'' said Greg Brock, The Times's senior editor in charge of corrections. Brock and Whitney have taken a first step, correcting even very old errors when a person can offer proof, like a university diploma in the case of the erroneous wedding announcement. Whitney is starting discussions with other senior editors about what more The Times should do.
 Bob Steele, an ethicist at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla., a training center for journalists, said that he would approach the notion of removing or altering articles from a newspaper's archive with great caution. ''There are consequences to that,'' he said. ''An absence of a piece of information could lead to rumor, falsehood, inaccurate actions down the road by somebody because they can't find the record. The public would have every reason to say: 'What else is missing? What else is altered?' '' 
 Viktor Mayer-Schonberger, an associate professor of public policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, has a different answer to the problem: He thinks newspapers, including The Times, should program their archives to ''forget'' some information, just as humans do. Through the ages, humans have generally remembered the important stuff and forgotten the trivial, he said. The computer age has turned that upside down. Now, everything lasts forever, whether it is insignificant or important, ancient or recent, complete or overtaken by events.
 Following Mayer-Schonberger's logic, The Times could program some items, like news briefs, which generate a surprising number of the complaints, to expire, at least for wide public access, in a relatively short time. Articles of larger significance could be assigned longer lives, or last forever. 
 Mayer-Schonberger said his proposal is no different from what The Times used to do when it culled its clipping files of old items that no longer seemed useful. But what if something was thrown away that later turned out to be important? Meyer Berger, a legendary Times reporter, complained in the 1940s that files of Victorian-era murder cases had been tossed.
 ''That's a risk you run,'' Mayer-Schonberger said. ''But we've dealt with that risk for eons.''
 Kraus would love to see the articles about him disappear. ''You have one thing about you, and that's your reputation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Political War Over Planned Tolls on I-80

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

DATELINE: BROOKVILLE, Pa., Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Anthony Foote spends a lot of time driving his Kenworth T-600 truck on Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania. He prefers it to the state's other east-west highway, the Interstate 76 turnpike, which can cost him $140 in tolls.
 So the news that the state plans to impose tolls on I-80 was as upsetting to Mr. Foote as finding an ugly scratch in the purple paint on his rig. 
 ''I hate paying tolls,'' he said. ''It eats up my profit. If this goes through, you'll have a lot of truckers avoiding Pennsylvania -- including me.''
 Pennsylvania officials plan to build up to 10 toll areas along the 311-mile stretch of Interstate 80 in the next three years to help pay for road, bridge and mass transit projects and subsidies.
 The move has sparked a political war between the bipartisan coalition of state legislators who approved the plan and two Republican congressmen who say it is a ''shell game,'' taking revenue from rural Pennsylvania to bail out the state's urban areas.
 ''It's absolutely horrendous for my district,'' said one of them, Representative John E. Peterson, whose Fifth Congressional District covers about half of I-80 in north central Pennsylvania. ''Every major bill like this should be measured by whether this will make people less likely to come here. And if this stays active, we'll never get another distribution center or similar business again in my district.''
 Paying for new roads with tolls, or adding tolls to sections of older urban roads, is common across the country. But experts say that imposing tolls on an entire interstate highway that had been free may be unprecedented, in part because the federal government typically bans tolls on highways paid for with federal money, as I-80 was.
 ''I haven't heard of another one,'' said Bernard Weinstein, director of the Center for Economic Development and Research at the University of North Texas, which has done a half dozen studies on the impact of toll roads. ''But I think most states will eventually have to move to the user principle. Tolls are going to be the wave of the future.''
 Pennsylvania's plan is to generate about $950 million a year through the sale of bonds backed by tollway revenue and other state sources over the first 10 years, with about $500 million going to road and bridge projects throughout the state, and the remaining $450 million going to subsidize mass transit in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and other cities.
 State officials say that about 70 percent of the 21 million vehicles that travel I-80 annually are from out of state, and 40 percent are commercial trucks.
 After the State Legislature and Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat, included the toll plan in their July budget deal, Mr. Peterson and Representative Phil English surprised state officials on July 24 by quietly slipping an amendment into the House's version of the federal transportation bill to prevent it.
 But hardly anyone outside of Mr. English and Mr. Peterson's offices believe it will still be there after the House-Senate conference committee meets on the transportation bill. Pennsylvania's senators, Bob Casey and Arlen Specter, have both said they do not want to interfere in the state's decision-making and will not help the two congressmen.
 Even so, Mr. English and Mr. Peterson are not giving up, and they believe they have public opinion, and federal law, on their side.
 The plan requires the approval of the Federal Highway Administration, a process that state officials hope will be completed in a year. Under a program called the Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program, states can add tolls to interstates paid for with federal money. 
 ''It will fly only if the Federal Highway Administration decides it will fly,'' said Mr. English, whose Third Congressional District covers about 30 miles of the western edge of I-80. ''And this plan doesn't fit the pilot program as proposed by Congress.''
 Mr. English argues that the pilot program was intended to let states use new toll revenue for road maintenance and improvements, not mass transit.
 But Joseph G. Brimmeier, chief executive for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, said he was confident Pennsylvania's program would pass muster.
 ''We put together a package that helps solve the funding crisis in Pennsylvania for the next 50 years,'' he said. ''It solves the crisis without raising one cent of taxes. And here we are four weeks into this debate, and I don't hear any plans from them to help solve these problems.''
 Both Mr. English and Mr. Peterson said they liked the financing idea that Governor Rendell first proposed: leasing Interstate 76 to a private company to generate revenue. But state officials could not garner support for it, and the tolling plan, which includes raising rates on the rest of the existing tollway system as well, was approved instead.
 Mr. Brimmeier said what upsets him the most about the representative's efforts is that they ''try to pit one part of Pennsylvania against another.''
 When asked about the toll plan, many drivers on I-80 sounded resigned.
 ''I'd have to pay it, and I'd still go on 80, but I wouldn't be happy about it,'' said Dawn Toporcer, a fourth-grade teacher from Lordstown, Ohio, who was shopping with her two daughters for school at the Prime Outlets at Grove City, a regional outlet mall on Interstate 79, about three miles south of I-80. 
 Grove City was specifically chosen as the site for the mall 15 years ago because of its location near the intersection of the two interstates, said Michelle Czerwinski, a mall spokeswoman. The mall attracts millions of customers who get there by traveling I-80, and imposing tolls on the highway would hurt, she said.
 ''It's just going to be a negative,'' Ms. Czerwinski said. ''Any kind of toll plan would slow down the traffic.''

HEADLINE: The Fastest Gavel in the West

BYLINE: By JORI FINKEL

 BODY:
Reno, Nev.
 AT 79 Howard Terpning just may be the most successful living American artist you've never heard of. He's never been included in the Whitney Biennial or a big international art fair. You won't find his work in a Chelsea gallery.
 But the crowd of 850 or so art collectors and dealers who assembled last month at the Coeur d'Alene Art Auction here -- wearing a mix of rugged and fancy cowboy boots and ornate belt buckles -- all knew who he was. For them he is ''the storyteller of the Native American.'' They knew that last year two of his paintings broke the million-dollar mark at this annual auction, which despite its name now takes place in Reno, not Idaho. 
 And they knew enough to raise their paddles when ''The Victors,'' a 1979 canvas showing two Blackfeet warriors on horseback returning home from battle, reached the podium. One warrior carries a bow and arrow. The other holds a spear. Both have intense expressions on their faces, which are smeared with war paint the gray color of the mountains behind them. 
 Bidding quickly exceeded the high estimate of $250,000, and the sound of yipping filled the room. For if Western attire is one hallmark of the auction, another is the spotters, a group of four men who help the auctioneer by pointing out the bidders and calling out with raucous sounds: ''yip'' or ''yep'' or ''hep.'' The phone bank was also busy, and the painting ultimately sold by phone for $582,400, not bad for a painting that cost $7,500 in 1979.
 ''Terpning captures the imagination of collectors,'' said Lynn Friess of Jackson, Wyo., who bought the record-setting painting by this artist at last year's sale. ''He's a master at painting figures and horses, and at creating a sense of excitement in his paintings.'' She also called him ''an incredible colorist.''
 The auctioneer Peter Stremmel concurred in an interview. ''Everyone is after Terpning's work. They see him as the next Russell or Remington,'' he said, dropping the most illustrious names in Western art, Charles Russell and Frederic Remington.
 If Mr. Terpning's popularity is one sign of the growing interest in Western paintings, the Coeur d'Alene auction is another. Over the last two decades it has become the most important annual event for collectors of Western art and a benchmark for this market as a whole. 
 The auction was founded in 1985 by Mr. Stremmel and two partners in Las Vegas, where it was held to coincide with the National Finals Rodeo. That year, there were 132 lots and it brought in $200,000. Last year there were 276 lots fetching $27.4 million, a record that many thought could not be matched. Last month Mr. Stremmel raced through 307 lots in under five hours to bring in $35.4 million, or about $28 million, if you strip away a cache of French Impressionist and Latin American masters that were oddly tucked into this year's sale. 
 For Van Kirke Nelson, a longtime collector from Kalispell, Mont., who once practiced medicine on the Blackfeet reservation, it is the high point of the collecting season: ''For us it's superior to Christie's or Sotheby's.'' 
 Surveying the auction scene at this year's site, a banquet hall at the Grand Sierra Resort and Casino, the Santa Fe dealer Gerald Peters estimated that three-quarters of dealers in the field were in attendance ''and maybe one-quarter of the collectors.'' Most buyers flew in from other Mountain and Western states, where they may collect horses and ranches along with Western art. 
 Or choose between them. ''These days you have to ask yourself whether you want to spend that money on a ranch or a painting,'' said Stephen Carlson of Boseman, Mont., a former securities trader who consigned work to the sale. His preference was ''action shots, where the horses are running and people are shooting, hunting or fishing,'' he said. ''I like the romance of the West: Manifest Destiny; you eat what you stock, hunt, and kill; and the idea of self-reliance.'' 
 Of course not all collectors are so action oriented, nor are all Western paintings so sporting. The 19th-century masters Thomas Moran and Albert Bierstadt were known for majestic landscapes of places like Yellowstone and Yosemite. And the early-20th-century Taos school of painters took landscape a step closer to modernist abstraction. But whatever the emphasis, this romantic view of the West appeals to a growing number of collectors today.
 The buyers tend to enjoy ''the Western lifestyle,'' said Amy Scott, a curator at the Autry National Center's Museum of the American West in Los Angeles. ''Maybe they also collect tack and gear,'' she said. ''Maybe they collect works made by Native Americans. They are self-identified Westerners who like the material culture of Western life.'' 
 American Indians rarely acquire this kind of material, she said, for ''all kinds of reasons.'' Often they would rather collect work by their own tribes. And there are larger social and economic factors. ''The collecting base for Abstract Expressionism or the Ashcan School is also pretty white,'' she said.
 The morning before the sale Ms. Scott was touring the banquet hall, where paintings were propped up on rows of tables, with Jim Parks, a trustee of the Autry Museum. Mr. Parks started off decades ago by collecting antique black-powder period guns and then made his way to Indian beadwork, textiles and paintings, before turning to the Taos painters and other historic Western artists. 
 He walked up to one table to point out a tiny 1848 watercolor of a buffalo hunt by Seth Eastman. 
 ''I like the patina, palette and imagery of some of this older material,'' he said, flipping the painting over to inspect the faded labels on the back. ''I'm not collecting guns anymore. I'm really focused on finding better paintings.'' 
 As a group the historic 19th- and 20th-century artists that interest Mr. Parks, who are referred to in the field as ''the deceased artists,'' did well at the July sale. The Taos painter Joseph H. Sharp had 13 paintings in the sale, and all but two surpassed their high estimates. For his part, Mr. Parks bid up the buffalo-hunt watercolor to $84,000, though he was unsure where to hang it. ''My wife doesn't like violence,'' he said. ''She doesn't like seeing animals get killed.'' 
 A moody painting of two horses by Frank Tenney Johnson brought $1.12 million, toppling the record set for his work last spring at the Scottsdale Art Auction in Arizona. The lot featured on the cover of the auction catalog, a 1905 watercolor by Russell called ''Blackfeet Burning Crow Buffalo Range,'' sold for $2.91 million to the Denver art dealer Steve Good. And a tiny 1918 Russell oil called ''Joshing Moon,'' which shows a cowboy on a moonlit ride around Christmastime with a faint vision of elk -- or are they reindeer? -- in the distance went for $1.68 million to the Colorado collector Thomas Petrie, who made his fortune in the oil and energy business. 
 But these days, as classic Western works become less affordable and available, more and more collectors of ''deceased'' artists are also turning to contemporary material. The Coeur d'Alene organizers do well with this end of the market, too. Not only do they include recent work by artists like Mr. Terpning, but they also invite about 15 artists each year to paint new pictures specifically for the sale. The artists get 70 to 90 percent of the sale price. Their galleries are not involved. 
 While any arrangement that cuts out the dealer would raise eyebrows in the mainstream art world, it is accepted practice out West. ''I don't mind it at all, if it helps to strengthen the market,'' said Bill Burford of the Texas Art Gallery in Dallas, who paid $246,400 at the sale for a brand-new Martin Grelle painting of a river scene for a client. 
 Mr. Stremmel explained that galleries specializing in Western art ''don't operate like they do in New York.'' 
 ''They play a smaller role in the career of these artists, and usually don't sign exclusivity agreements with them,'' he said. ''These artists to some degree manage their own careers. There's no Gagosian-behind-Jeff-Koons situation.''
 One reason that galleries don't wield all of the power is the presence of artist-run associations like the Cowboy Artists of America. Along with publishing catalogs and organizing an annual fall sale at the Phoenix Art Museum, this association's marketing machine gives its members a branding iron so they can stamp their paintings with a ''CA'' mark, for cowboy artist. It is, for some, the stamp of legitimacy. Of all the association's painters, Mr. Terpning, who lives in Tucson and is listed as ''emeritus'' with the group, is surely the mostly highly regarded. He has won dozens of best-in-show awards from the group as well as a lifetime award from the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis for what curators there describe as realistic and thoroughly researched representations of Indians. At that ceremony Mr. Terpning, who is white, received a heartfelt tribute from a Blackfeet elder. 
 His prices also speak to his popularity. Last year a world record for Mr. Terpning's work was set at Coeur d'Alene when his 1981 ''Search for the Renegades,'' an epic five-foot-wide oil painting depicting the Army cavalry's pursuit of Geronimo and his men, sold for $1.46 million. This year the Terpning works and prices were smaller, but bidding remained intense.
 Because of his success he has also become something of a magnet for some of the problems that plague the field as a whole. While violent content is an occasional concern (especially when it comes to painters like Russell and Remington), the more common risk for Western paintings of all kinds is sentimentality: mythologizing or romanticizing Indian life, cowboy culture and the West. Some scholars like J. Gray Sweeney have argued that 21st-century painters revisiting 19th-century themes can be the worst offenders. 
 So, along with all the honorifics, Mr. Terpning is beginning to get some flak. The few art experts outside the Western art field who know his work at all question his relevance to contemporary art. And some insiders question his authenticity, pointing out that he worked as a magazine and movie-poster illustrator for years before turning to Western themes. Russell, by contrast, worked as a wrangler in the 1880s.
 But for every detractor, there are many fans. And in this tightknit world, his critics will speak only on the condition of anonymity. 
 ''If I say anything negative about Terpning,'' one said, ''they will shoot me.''

HEADLINE: As China Roars, Pollution Reaches Deadly Extremes

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN and JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
No country in history has emerged as a major industrial power without creating a legacy of environmental damage that can take decades and big dollops of public wealth to undo.
 But just as the speed and scale of China's rise as an economic power have no clear parallel in history, so its pollution problem has shattered all precedents. Environmental degradation is now so severe, with such stark domestic and international repercussions, that pollution poses not only a major long-term burden on the Chinese public but also an acute political challenge to the ruling Communist Party. And it is not clear that China can rein in its own economic juggernaut.
 Public health is reeling. Pollution has made cancer China's leading cause of death, the Ministry of Health says. Ambient air pollution alone is blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. Nearly 500 million people lack access to safe drinking water. 
 Chinese cities often seem wrapped in a toxic gray shroud. Only 1 percent of the country's 560 million city dwellers breathe air considered safe by the European Union. Beijing is frantically searching for a magic formula, a meteorological deus ex machina, to clear its skies for the 2008 Olympics. 
 Environmental woes that might be considered catastrophic in some countries can seem commonplace in China: industrial cities where people rarely see the sun; children killed or sickened by lead poisoning or other types of local pollution; a coastline so swamped by algal red tides that large sections of the ocean no longer sustain marine life. 
 China is choking on its own success. The economy is on a historic run, posting a succession of double-digit growth rates. But the growth derives, now more than at any time in the recent past, from a staggering expansion of heavy industry and urbanization that requires colossal inputs of energy, almost all from coal, the most readily available, and dirtiest, source.
 ''It is a very awkward situation for the country because our greatest achievement is also our biggest burden,'' says Wang Jinnan, one of China's leading environmental researchers. ''There is pressure for change, but many people refuse to accept that we need a new approach so soon.''
 China's problem has become the world's problem. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides spewed by China's coal-fired power plants fall as acid rain on Seoul, South Korea, and Tokyo. Much of the particulate pollution over Los Angeles originates in China, according to the Journal of Geophysical Research.
 More pressing still, China has entered the most robust stage of its industrial revolution, even as much of the outside world has become preoccupied with global warming.
 Experts once thought China might overtake the United States as the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases by 2010, possibly later. Now, the International Energy Agency has said China could become the emissions leader by the end of this year, and the Netherlands Environment Assessment Agency said China had already passed that level.
 For the Communist Party, the political calculus is daunting. Reining in economic growth to alleviate pollution may seem logical, but the country's authoritarian system is addicted to fast growth. Delivering prosperity placates the public, provides spoils for well-connected officials and forestalls demands for political change. A major slowdown could incite social unrest, alienate business interests and threaten the party's rule.
 But pollution poses its own threat. Officials blame fetid air and water for thousands of episodes of social unrest. Health care costs have climbed sharply. Severe water shortages could turn more farmland into desert. And the unconstrained expansion of energy-intensive industries creates greater dependence on imported oil and dirty coal, meaning that environmental problems get harder and more expensive to address the longer they are unresolved.
 China's leaders recognize that they must change course. They are vowing to overhaul the growth-first philosophy of the Deng Xiaoping era and embrace a new model that allows for steady growth while protecting the environment. In his equivalent of a State of the Union address this year, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao made 48 references to ''environment,'' ''pollution'' or ''environmental protection.''
 The government has numerical targets for reducing emissions and conserving energy. Export subsidies for polluting industries have been phased out. Different campaigns have been started to close illegal coal mines and shutter some heavily polluting factories. Major initiatives are under way to develop clean energy sources like solar and wind power. And environmental regulation in Beijing, Shanghai and other leading cities has been tightened ahead of the 2008 Olympics.
 Yet most of the government's targets for energy efficiency, as well as improving air and water quality, have gone unmet. And there are ample signs that the leadership is either unwilling or unable to make fundamental changes.
 Land, water, electricity, oil and bank loans remain relatively inexpensive, even for heavy polluters. Beijing has declined to use the kind of tax policies and market-oriented incentives for conservation that have worked well in Japan and many European countries.
 Provincial officials, who enjoy substantial autonomy, often ignore environmental edicts, helping to reopen mines or factories closed by central authorities. Over all, enforcement is often tinged with corruption. This spring, officials in Yunnan Province in southern China beautified Laoshou Mountain, which had been used as a quarry, by spraying green paint over acres of rock. 
 President Hu Jintao's most ambitious attempt to change the culture of fast-growth collapsed this year. The project, known as ''Green G.D.P.,'' was an effort to create an environmental yardstick for evaluating the performance of every official in China. It recalculated gross domestic product, or G.D.P., to reflect the cost of pollution. 
 But the early results were so sobering -- in some provinces the pollution-adjusted growth rates were reduced almost to zero -- that the project was banished to China's ivory tower this spring and stripped of official influence.
 Chinese leaders argue that the outside world is a partner in degrading the country's environment. Chinese manufacturers that dump waste into rivers or pump smoke into the sky make the cheap products that fill stores in the United States and Europe. Often, these manufacturers subcontract for foreign companies -- or are owned by them. In fact, foreign investment continues to rise as multinational corporations build more factories in China. Beijing also insists that it will accept no mandatory limits on its carbon dioxide emissions, which would almost certainly reduce its industrial growth. It argues that rich countries caused global warming and should find a way to solve it without impinging on China's development.
 Indeed, Britain, the United States and Japan polluted their way to prosperity and worried about environmental damage only after their economies matured and their urban middle classes demanded blue skies and safe drinking water.
 But China is more like a teenage smoker with emphysema. The costs of pollution have mounted well before it is ready to curtail economic development. But the price of business as usual -- including the predicted effects of global warming on China itself -- strikes many of its own experts and some senior officials as intolerably high.
 ''Typically, industrial countries deal with green problems when they are rich,'' said Ren Yong, a climate expert at the Center for Environment and Economy in Beijing. ''We have to deal with them while we are still poor. There is no model for us to follow.'' 
 In the face of past challenges, the Communist Party has usually responded with sweeping edicts from Beijing. Some environmentalists say they hope the top leadership has now made pollution control such a high priority that lower level officials will have no choice but to go along, just as Deng Xiaoping once forced China's sluggish bureaucracy to fixate on growth.
 But the environment may end up posing a different political challenge. A command-and-control political culture accustomed to issuing thundering directives is now under pressure, even from people in the ruling party, to submit to oversight from the public, for which pollution has become a daily -- and increasingly deadly -- reality. 
 Perpetual Haze
 During the three decades since Deng set China on a course toward market-style growth, rapid industrialization and urbanization have lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty and made the country the world's largest producer of consumer goods. But there is little question that growth came at the expense of the country's air, land and water, much of it already degraded by decades of Stalinist economic planning that emphasized the development of heavy industries in urban areas.
 For air quality, a major culprit is coal, on which China relies for about two-thirds of its energy needs. It has abundant supplies of coal and already burns more of it than the United States, Europe and Japan combined. But even many of its newest coal-fired power plants and industrial furnaces operate inefficiently and use pollution controls considered inadequate in the West.
 Expanding car ownership, heavy traffic and low-grade gasoline have made autos the leading source of air pollution in major Chinese cities. Only 1 percent of China's urban population of 560 million now breathes air considered safe by the European Union, according to a World Bank study of Chinese pollution published this year. One major pollutant contributing to China's bad air is particulate matter, which includes concentrations of fine dust, soot and aerosol particles less than 10 microns in diameter (known as PM 10).
 The level of such particulates is measured in micrograms per cubic meter of air. The European Union stipulates that any reading above 40 micrograms is unsafe. The United States allows 50. In 2006, Beijing's average PM 10 level was 141, according to the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics. Only Cairo, among world capitals, had worse air quality as measured by particulates, according to the World Bank. 
 Emissions of sulfur dioxide from coal and fuel oil, which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as acid rain, are increasing even faster than China's economic growth. In 2005, China became the leading source of sulfur dioxide pollution globally, the State Environmental Protection Administration, or SEPA, reported last year.
 Other major air pollutants, including ozone, an important component of smog, and smaller particulate matter, called PM 2.5, emitted when gasoline is burned, are not widely monitored in China. Medical experts in China and in the West have argued that PM 2.5 causes more chronic diseases of the lung and heart than the more widely watched PM 10.
 Perhaps an even more acute challenge is water. China has only one-fifth as much water per capita as the United States. But while southern China is relatively wet, the north, home to about half of China's population, is an immense, parched region that now threatens to become the world's biggest desert. 
 Farmers in the north once used shovels to dig their wells. Now, many aquifers have been so depleted that some wells in Beijing and Hebei must extend more than half a mile before they reach fresh water. Industry and agriculture use nearly all of the flow of the Yellow River, before it reaches the Bohai Sea.
 In response, Chinese leaders have undertaken one of the most ambitious engineering projects in world history, a $60 billion network of canals, rivers and lakes to transport water from the flood-prone Yangtze River to the silt-choked Yellow River. But that effort, if successful, will still leave the north chronically thirsty.
 This scarcity has not yet created a culture of conservation. Water remains inexpensive by global standards, and Chinese industry uses 4 to 10 times more water per unit of production than the average in industrialized nations, according to the World Bank. 
 In many parts of China, factories and farms dump waste into surface water with few repercussions. China's environmental monitors say that one-third of all river water, and vast sections of China's great lakes, the Tai, Chao and Dianchi, have water rated Grade V, the most degraded level, rendering it unfit for industrial or agricultural use. 
 Grim Statistics
 The toll this pollution has taken on human health remains a delicate topic in China. The leadership has banned publication of data on the subject for fear of inciting social unrest, said scholars involved in the research. But the results of some research provide alarming evidence that the environment has become one of the biggest causes of death.
 An internal, unpublicized report by the Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning in 2003 estimated that 300,000 people die each year from ambient air pollution, mostly of heart disease and lung cancer. An additional 110,000 deaths could be attributed to indoor air pollution caused by poorly ventilated coal and wood stoves or toxic fumes from shoddy construction materials, said a person involved in that study. 
 Another report, prepared in 2005 by Chinese environmental experts, estimated that annual premature deaths attributable to outdoor air pollution were likely to reach 380,000 in 2010 and 550,000 in 2020. 
 This spring, a World Bank study done with SEPA, the national environmental agency, concluded that outdoor air pollution was already causing 350,000 to 400,000 premature deaths a year. Indoor pollution contributed to the deaths of an additional 300,000 people, while 60,000 died from diarrhea, bladder and stomach cancer and other diseases that can be caused by water-borne pollution.
 China's environmental agency insisted that the health statistics be removed from the published version of the report, citing the possible impact on ''social stability,'' World Bank officials said.
 But other international organizations with access to Chinese data have published similar results. For example, the World Health Organization found that China suffered more deaths from water-related pollutants and fewer from bad air, but agreed with the World Bank that the total death toll had reached 750,000 a year. In comparison, 4,700 people died last year in China's notoriously unsafe mines, and 89,000 people were killed in road accidents, the highest number of automobile-related deaths in the world. The Ministry of Health estimates that cigarette smoking takes a million Chinese lives each year. 
 Studies of Chinese environmental health mostly use statistical models developed in the United States and Europe and apply them to China, which has done little long-term research on the matter domestically. The results are more like plausible suppositions than conclusive findings.
 But Chinese experts say that, if anything, the Western models probably understate the problems. 
 ''China's pollution is worse, the density of its population is greater and people do not protect themselves as well,'' said Jin Yinlong, the director general of the Institute for Environmental Health and Related Product Safety in Beijing. ''So the studies are not definitive. My assumption is that they will turn out to be conservative.''
 Growth Run Amok
 As gloomy as China's pollution picture looks today, it is set to get significantly worse, because China has come to rely mainly on energy-intensive heavy industry and urbanization to fuel economic growth. In 2000, a team of economists and energy specialists at the Development Research Center, part of the State Council, set out to gauge how much energy China would need over the ensuing 20 years to achieve the leadership's goal of quadrupling the size of the economy.
 They based their projections on China's experience during the first 20 years of economic reform, from 1980 to 2000. In that period, China relied mainly on light industry and small-scale private enterprise to spur growth. It made big improvements in energy efficiency even as the economy expanded rapidly. Gross domestic product quadrupled, while energy use only doubled.
 The team projected that such efficiency gains would probably continue. But the experts also offered what they called a worst-case situation in which the most energy-hungry parts of the economy grew faster and efficiency gains fell short.
 That worst-case situation now looks wildly optimistic. Last year, China burned the energy equivalent of 2.7 billion tons of coal, three-quarters of what the experts had said would be the maximum required in 2020. To put it another way, China now seems likely to need as much energy in 2010 as it thought it would need in 2020 under the most pessimistic assumptions.
 ''No one really knew what was driving the economy, which is why the predictions were so wrong,'' said Yang Fuqiang, a former Chinese energy planner who is now the chief China representative of the Energy Foundation, an American group that supports energy-related research. ''What I fear is that the trend is now basically irreversible.''
 The ravenous appetite for fossil fuels traces partly to an economic stimulus program in 1997. The leadership, worried that China's economy would fall into a steep recession as its East Asian neighbors had, provided generous state financing and tax incentives to support industrialization on a grand scale. 
 It worked well, possibly too well. In 1996, China and the United States each accounted for 13 percent of global steel production. By 2005, the United States share had dropped to 8 percent, while China's share had risen to 35 percent, according to a study by Daniel H. Rosen and Trevor Houser of China Strategic Advisory, a group that analyzes the Chinese economy.
 Similarly, China now makes half of the world's cement and flat glass, and about a third of its aluminum. In 2006, China overtook Japan as the second-largest producer of cars and trucks after the United States.
 Its energy needs are compounded because even some of its newest heavy industry plants do not operate as efficiently, or control pollution as effectively, as factories in other parts of the world, a recent World Bank report said.
 Chinese steel makers, on average, use one-fifth more energy per ton than the international average. Cement manufacturers need 45 percent more power, and ethylene producers need 70 percent more than producers elsewhere, the World Bank says.
 China's aluminum industry alone consumes as much energy as the country's commercial sector -- all the hotels, restaurants, banks and shopping malls combined, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Houser reported.
 Moreover, the boom is not limited to heavy industry. Each year for the past few years, China has built about 7.5 billion square feet of commercial and residential space, more than the combined floor space of all the malls and strip malls in the United States, according to data collected by the United States Energy Information Administration.
 Chinese buildings rarely have thermal insulation. They require, on average, twice as much energy to heat and cool as those in similar climates in the United States and Europe, according to the World Bank. A vast majority of new buildings -- 95 percent, the bank says -- do not meet China's own codes for energy efficiency.
 All these new buildings require China to build power plants, which it has been doing prodigiously. In 2005 alone, China added 66 gigawatts of electricity to its power grid, about as much power as Britain generates in a year. Last year, it added an additional 102 gigawatts, as much as France.
 That increase has come almost entirely from small- and medium-size coal-fired power plants that were built quickly and inexpensively. Only a few of them use modern, combined-cycle turbines, which increase efficiency, said Noureddine Berrah, an energy expert at the World Bank. He said Beijing had so far declined to use the most advanced type of combined-cycle turbines despite having completed a successful pilot project nearly a decade ago.
 While over the long term, combined-cycle plants save money and reduce pollution, Mr. Berrah said, they cost more and take longer to build. For that reason, he said, central and provincial government officials prefer older technology.
 ''China is making decisions today that will affect its energy use for the next 30 or 40 years,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, in some parts of the government the thinking is much more shortsighted.''
 The Politics of Pollution
 Since Hu Jintao became the Communist Party chief in 2002 and Wen Jiabao became prime minister the next spring, China's leadership has struck consistent themes. The economy must grow at a more sustainable, less bubbly pace. Environmental abuse has reached intolerable levels. Officials who ignore these principles will be called to account.
 Five years later, it seems clear that these senior leaders are either too timid to enforce their orders, or the fast-growth political culture they preside over is too entrenched to heed them.
 In the second quarter of this year, the economy expanded at a neck-snapping pace of 11.9 percent, its fastest in a decade. State-driven investment projects, state-backed heavy industry and a thriving export sector led the way. China burned 18 percent more coal than it did the year before. 
 China's authoritarian system has repeatedly proved its ability to suppress political threats to Communist Party rule. But its failure to realize its avowed goals of balancing economic growth and environmental protection is a sign that the country's environmental problems are at least partly systemic, many experts and some government officials say. China cannot go green, in other words, without political change.
 In their efforts to free China of its socialist shackles in the 1980s and early 90s, Deng and his supporters gave lower-level officials the leeway, and the obligation, to increase economic growth.
 Local party bosses gained broad powers over state bank lending, taxes, regulation and land use. In return, the party leadership graded them, first and foremost, on how much they expanded the economy in their domains.
 To judge by its original goals -- stimulating the economy, creating jobs and keeping the Communist Party in power -- the system Deng put in place has few equals. But his approach eroded Beijing's ability to fine-tune the economy. Today, a culture of collusion between government and business has made all but the most pro-growth government policies hard to enforce.
 ''The main reason behind the continued deterioration of the environment is a mistaken view of what counts as political achievement,'' said Pan Yue, the deputy minister of the State Environmental Protection Administration. ''The crazy expansion of high-polluting, high-energy industries has spawned special interests. Protected by local governments, some businesses treat the natural resources that belong to all the people as their own private property.'' 
 Mr. Hu has tried to change the system. In an internal address in 2004, he endorsed ''comprehensive environmental and economic accounting'' -- otherwise known as ''Green G.D.P.'' He said the ''pioneering endeavor'' would produce a new performance test for government and party officials that better reflected the leadership's environmental priorities.
 The Green G.D.P. team sought to calculate the yearly damage to the environment and human health in each province. Their first report, released last year, estimated that pollution in 2004 cost just over 3 percent of the gross domestic product, meaning that the pollution-adjusted growth rate that year would drop to about 7 percent from 10 percent. Officials said at the time that their formula used low estimates of environmental damage to health and did not assess the impact on China's ecology. They would produce a more decisive formula, they said, the next year.
 That did not happen. Mr. Hu's plan died amid intense squabbling, people involved in the effort said. The Green G.D.P. group's second report, originally scheduled for release in March, never materialized. 
 The official explanation was that the science behind the green index was immature. Wang Jinnan, the leading academic researcher on the Green G.D.P. team, said provincial leaders killed the project. ''Officials do not like to be lined up and told how they are not meeting the leadership's goals,'' he said. ''They found it difficult to accept this.''
 Conflicting Pressures
 Despite the demise of Green G.D.P., party leaders insist that they intend to restrain runaway energy use and emissions. The government last year mandated that the country use 20 percent less energy to achieve the same level of economic activity in 2010 compared with 2005. It also required that total emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxide and other pollutants decline by 10 percent in the same period.
 The program is a domestic imperative. But it has also become China's main response to growing international pressure to combat global warming. Chinese leaders reject mandatory emissions caps, and they say the energy efficiency plan will slow growth in carbon dioxide emissions.
 Even with the heavy pressure, though, the efficiency goals have been hard to achieve. In the first full year since the targets were set, emissions increased. Energy use for every dollar of economic output fell but by much less than the 4 percent interim goal.
 In a public relations sense, the party's commitment to conservation seems steadfast. Mr. Hu shunned his usual coat and tie at a meeting of the Central Committee this summer. State news media said the temperature in the Great Hall of the People was set at a balmy 79 degrees Fahrenheit to save energy, and officials have encouraged others to set thermostats at the same level.
 By other measures, though, the leadership has moved slowly to address environmental and energy concerns.
 The government rarely uses market-oriented incentives to reduce pollution. Officials have rejected proposals to introduce surcharges on electricity and coal to reflect the true cost to the environment. The state still controls the price of fuel oil, including gasoline, subsidizing the cost of driving.
 Energy and environmental officials have little influence in the bureaucracy. The environmental agency still has only about 200 full-time employees, compared with 18,000 at the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States. 
 China has no Energy Ministry. The Energy Bureau of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's central planning agency, has 100 full-time staff members. The Energy Department of the United States has 110,000 employees.
 China does have an army of amateur regulators. Environmentalists expose pollution and press local government officials to enforce environmental laws. But private individuals and nongovernment organizations cannot cross the line between advocacy and political agitation without risking arrest.
 At least two leading environmental organizers have been prosecuted in recent weeks, and several others have received sharp warnings to tone down their criticism of local officials. One reason the authorities have cited: the need for social stability before the 2008 Olympics, once viewed as an opportunity for China to improve the environment.

HEADLINE: Mind Over Matter, With a Machine's Help

BYLINE: By JASON PONTIN. 
Jason Pontin is the editor in chief and publisher of Technology Review, a magazine and Web site owned by M.I.T. E-mail: pontin@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WOULD that thinking made it so, people sometimes wistfully say. But Christopher deCharms, the chief executive of Omneuron, a start-up in Menlo Park, Calif., believes the adage. 
 The company he founded has created technologies that teach sufferers to think away their pain, and plans to similarly treat addiction, depression and other intractable neurological and psychological conditions. 
 Omneuron is one of a number of new companies that are commercializing a brain-scanning technology called real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. Using large scanners to measure blood flow to different parts of the brain, the technology makes the brain's activity visible by revealing which of its parts are busiest when we perform different tasks.
 While fMRI dates back to the early 1990s, hitherto it has been used mainly by doctors in hospitals to make diagnoses. The commercialization of brain scanning is a recent development, spurred by the refinement of the technology. Omneuron, which Dr. deCharms founded in 2001 and whose research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, uses fMRI to teach people how to play with their own heads. Other entrepreneurs are working on ways to deploy fMRI as a lie detector, a tool for conducting marketing research or an instrument to make brain surgeries safer and more precise. 
 Here's how Omneuron uses fMRI to treat chronic pain: A patient slides into the coffin-like scanner and watches a computer-generated flame projected on the screen of virtual-reality goggles; the flame's intensity reflects the neural activity of regions of the brain involved in the perception of pain. Using a variety of mental techniques -- for instance, imagining that a painful area is being flooded with soothing chemicals -- most people can, with a little concentration, make the flame wax or wane. As the flame wanes, the patient feels better. Superficially similar to an older technology, electroencephalogram biofeedback, which measures electrical feedback across multiple areas of the brain, fMRI feedback measures the blood flow in precise areas of the brain.
 ''We believe that people will use real-time fMRI feedback to hone cognitive strategies that will increase activation of brain regions,'' Dr. deCharms said. With practice and repetition, he said, this could lead to ''long-term changes in the brain.'' 
 In time, he hopes, a patient could evoke the effect without the machine.
 In a 2005 study, Dr. deCharms and Sean Mackey, associate director of the pain management division at Stanford, showed that eight patients with recalcitrant pain felt their discomfort reduced by as much as 64 percent by using Omneuron's technology. 
 If fMRI proves effective in treating pain, it could be big business. According to the American Chronic Pain Association, one in three Americans will experience chronic pain at some point in life. At any one time, more than 50 million Americans complain of pain. And Dr. deCharms contends that fully one-third find their pain resistant to traditional treatments like narcotics. Omneuron's technologies could offer such patients some relief, and without side effects.
 The pain-relief industry is huge: the average American spends as much as $900 a year on pain medications, whose effects are generally short-lived.
 But Dr. deCharms says that controlling pain is just one of many possible uses for fMRI feedback. Today, Omneuron is also researching treatments for addiction, depression and other psychological illnesses. In addition, he said. the company has contemplated ''several dozen applications,'' including the treatment of stroke and epilepsy. Brain scanning could even be used to improve athletic performance, he speculated.
 Doctors and drug-abuse experts are particularly excited about the idea of treating addiction using fMRI. While scientists have talked about such an application since the technology was invented, Omneuron is the first to work on a real therapy. ''We might have a tool to help control the inner sensation of craving,'' said Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which helped fund Omneuron's research into addiction.
 A growing number of ventures hope to turn fMRI into a business. The most well-publicized is No Lie MRI, which wants to sell brain scanning to law firms and governmental bodies like police departments or security and intelligence agencies as a replacement for the notoriously unreliable polygraph test. No Lie MRI has already begun selling what it calls its truth verification technology for about $10,000 to individuals keen to prove their innocence. 
 Joel Huizenga, the chief executive of No Lie MRI, said: ''A technology gets known by its first product. For fMRI, that application is going to be truth verification.'' 
 Mr. Huizenga says he would also like to sell fMRI to marketers who wish to determine whether consumers are responding to advertising, a commercial application of an emerging field of research called neuro-economics.
 Other brain-scanning ventures include Cephos, another lie-detection company, and Imagilys, which sells fMRI to surgeons who want to map the brains of patients before operations.
 For its part, Omneuron would make money not by building fMRI centers -- which are expensive and fairly common in larger hospitals -- but by selling clinical skills, software and equipment.
 ''I imagine the business model would be akin to Lasik eye surgery,'' Dr. deCharms says. ''We'd provide the technology to outpatient treatment centers.''
 There are challenges to the commercialization of brain scanning, and the most important may be regulatory. Clinical trials can take many years, and federal approval is famously unpredictable. But until clinical data and federal approval are forthcoming, Dr. deCharms says, Omneuron cannot sell its technology as a clinical treatment.
 Ed Boyden, an assistant professor at the Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a researcher in neuroengineering, distinguishes sharply among different brain-scanning ventures. ''If you want to commercialize this technology,'' he said, ''then the use has to approximate real-world situations.''
 In his view, tests of fMRI truth verification don't meet that criterion. For instance, in studies at the University of Pennsylvania in 2002 and 2005, subjects were told to conceal the identity of a card under questioning. FMRI was able to distinguish falsification 77 percent of the time. 
 Mr. Huizenga was so inspired by this research that he decided to start his company, confident that fMRI would soon identify lies 90 percent of the time.
 But Dr. Boyden says he believes that being asked to tell a falsehood that everyone knows is a falsehood is not the same thing as lying to deceive someone. Thus, whatever brain patterns fMRI detects when a person constructs such a requested fiction may be different from whatever happens when we lie. 
 By contrast, Dr. Boyden says: ''What I like about Omneuron is that it's working with real-world situations. They gave people visualization strategies which they could monitor -- and which produced real, measurable results.'' 
 If Dr. deCharms and Omneuron are successful, and can teach us to train our brains to manage neurological and psychological conditions, they will have given us something that has challenged philosophers, psychologists and yogis alike: gaining some reliable control over our own thoughts.

HEADLINE: The Fed's Subprime Solution

BYLINE: By JAMES GRANT. 
James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, is the author of ''Money of the Mind.''

 BODY:
THE subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 is, in fact, a credit crisis -- a worldwide disruption in lending and borrowing. It is only the latest in a long succession of such disturbances. Who's to blame? The human race, first and foremost. Well-intended public policy, second. And Wall Street, third -- if only for taking what generations of policy makers have so unwisely handed it. 
 Possibly, one lender and one borrower could do business together without harm to themselves or to the economy around them. But masses of lenders and borrowers invariably seem to come to grief, as they have today -- not only in mortgages but also in a variety of other debt instruments. First, they overdo it until the signs of excess become too obvious to ignore. Then, with contrite and fearful hearts, they proceed to underdo it. Such is the ''credit cycle,'' the eternal migration of lenders and borrowers between the extreme points of accommodation and stringency. 
 Significantly, such cycles have occurred in every institutional, monetary and regulatory setting. No need for a central bank, or for newfangled mortgage securities, or for the proliferation of hedge funds to foment a panic -- there have been plenty of dislocations without any of the modern-day improvements. 
 Late in the 1880s, long before the institution of the Federal Reserve, Eastern savers and Western borrowers teamed up to inflate the value of cropland in the Great Plains. Gimmicky mortgages -- pay interest and only interest for the first two years! -- and loose talk of a new era in rainfall beguiled the borrowers. High yields on Western mortgages enticed the lenders. But the climate of Kansas and Nebraska reverted to parched, and the drought-stricken debtors trudged back East or to the West Coast in wagons emblazoned, ''In God we trusted, in Kansas we busted.'' To the creditors went the farms. 
 Every crackup is the same, yet every one is different. Today's troubles are unusual not because the losses have been felt so far from the corner of Broad and Wall, or because our lenders are unprecedentedly reckless. The panics of the second half of the 19th century were trans-Atlantic affairs, while the debt abuses of the 1920s anticipated the most dubious lending practices of 2006. Our crisis will go down in history for different reasons. 
 One is the sheer size of the debt in which people have belatedly lost faith. The issuance of one kind of mortgage-backed structure -- collateralized debt obligations -- alone runs to $1 trillion. The shocking fragility of recently issued debt is another singular feature of the 2007 downturn -- alarming numbers of defaults despite high employment and reasonably strong economic growth. Hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities would, by now, have had to be recalled if Wall Street did business as Detroit does.
 Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, in the 1940 edition of their seminal volume ''Security Analysis,'' held that the acid test of a bond or a mortgage issuer is its ability to discharge its financial obligations ''under conditions of depression rather than prosperity.'' Today's mortgage market can't seem to weather prosperity. 
 A third remarkable aspect of the summer's troubles is the speed with which the world's central banks have felt it necessary to intervene. Bear in mind that when the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate on Aug. 17 -- a move intended to restore confidence and restart the machinery of lending and borrowing -- the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen just 8.25 percent from its record high. The Fed has so far refused to reduce the federal funds rate, the main interest rate it fixes, but it has all but begged the banks to avail themselves of the dollars they need through the slightly unconventional means of borrowing at the discount window -- that is, from the Fed itself. 
 What could account for the weakness of our credit markets? Why does the Fed feel the need to intervene at the drop of a market? The reasons have to do with an idea set firmly in place in the 1930s and expanded at every crisis up to the present. This is the notion that, while the risks inherent in the business of lending and borrowing should be finally borne by the public, the profits of that line of work should mainly accrue to the lenders and borrowers. 
 It has not been lost on our Wall Street titans that the government is the reliable first responder to scenes of financial distress, or that there will always be enough paper dollars to go around to assist the very largest financial institutions. In the aftermath of the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, the genius-directed hedge fund that came a cropper in 1998, the Fed -- under Alan Greenspan -- delivered three quick reductions in the federal funds rate. Thus fortified, lenders and borrowers, speculators and investors, resumed their manic buying of technology stocks. That bubble burst in March 2000. 
 Understandably, it's only the selling kind of panic to which the government dispatches its rescue apparatus. Few object to riots on the upside. But bull markets, too, go to extremes. People get carried away, prices go too high and economic resources go where they shouldn't. Bear markets are nature's way of returning to the rule of reason. 
 But the regulatory history of the past decade is the story of governmental encroachment on the bears' habitat. Under Mr. Greenspan, the Fed set its face against falling prices everywhere. As it intervened to save the financial markets in 1998, so it printed money in 2002 and 2003 to rescue the economy. From what? From the peril of everyday lower prices -- ''deflation,'' the economists styled it. In this mission, at least, the Fed succeeded. Prices, especially housing prices, soared. Knowing that the Fed would do its best to engineer rising prices, people responded rationally. They borrowed lots of money at the Fed's ultralow interest rates. 
 Now comes the bill for that binge and, with it, cries for even greater federal oversight and protection. Ben S. Bernanke, Mr. Greenspan's successor at the Fed (and his loyal supporter during the antideflation hysteria), is said to be resisting the demand for broadly lower interest rates. Maybe he is seeing the light that capitalism without financial failure is not capitalism at all, but a kind of socialism for the rich. 
 In any case, to all of us, rich and poor alike, the Fed owes a pledge that it will do what it can and not do what it can't. High on the list of things that no human agency can, or should, attempt is manipulating prices to achieve a more stable and prosperous economy. Jiggling its interest rate, the Fed can impose the appearance of stability today, but only at the cost of instability tomorrow. By the looks of things, tomorrow is upon us already. 
 A century ago, on the eve of the Panic of 1907, the president of the National City Bank of New York, James Stillman, prepared for the troubles he saw coming. ''If by able and judicious management,'' he briefed his staff, ''we have money to help our dealers when trust companies have [failed], we will have all the business we want for many years.'' The panic came and his bank, today called Citigroup, emerged more profitable than ever. 
 Last month, Stillman's corporate descendant, Chuck Prince, chief executive of Citigroup, dismissed fears about an early end to the postmillennial debt frolics. ''When the music stops,'' he told The Financial Times, ''in terms of liquidity, things will get complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing.'' 
 What a difference a century makes.

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
AGE: 34 YEARS WORKING: 6 MOST LUCRATIVE YEAR: $30,000 LEAST: Under $20,000 LAST SEEN IN: ''Two Trains Running'' at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego
 In the middle of her stint playing Vera in ''Seven Guitars'' at the Signature Theater Company last year, a performance which won her an Obie Award and rapturous raves, and which followed a string of critically acclaimed turns going back to her time at the prestigious post-graduate institute at the American Repertory Theater, Ms. Ruff was called to a meeting.
 ''I went to a meeting for one of the television companies,'' she said. ''And the woman said to me, 'Well, I'm sure you're going on a lot of these.' And I was very frank. I said: 'Well, actually, no, you know. This is my first meeting like this.' '' Nothing has come of it. 
 Less than a year later, after some regional work, Ms. Ruff is unemployed, and looking for work.
 In just about any other profession, a person who has collected Ms. Ruff's kind of praise would have some job security. But Ms. Ruff, a soft-spoken and even-tempered woman, is still going out on auditions and waiting for the phone to ring. She has managed to work fairly steadily off Broadway and regionally, but it barely pays the bills. And what's more, the search begins all over again at the end of every job. After being called ''wondrous,'' ''heartbreaking'' and ''darned near perfect'' in her last few roles, she is back to looking, a hard task which is even harder for black actors, given the available roles. The search only exaggerates the differences between actors and everybody else.
 ''I am joyfully watching childhood friends get married, buy property, things of that nature,'' she said. ''That's just not in the cards for me right now.''
 What else is not in the cards: saving money and living without debt. She tries not to think about it too much.
 ''Being an actor,'' she said, ''you have those dreams of, you know, 'TV and film will eventually pick up and it will all balance out.' '' 
 Ms. Ruff did not come from an acting family; neither her father, a retired process operator at an oil refinery, nor her mother, a social worker, knew much about the professional performer's life. For many actors, explaining their career choice to their parents can be like revealing that they were just found to have a terminal illness. But Ms. Ruff's parents just weren't sure what her decision really meant.
 It took a while, but her father now understands what kind of work goes into acting, she said. After seeing her in a production of ''In the Blood'' in 2002, he understands the intensity of performing and the stamina it demands night after night. 
 He also, over time, has come to understand the significance of her getting into the American Repertory Theater and of getting a good job immediately afterward; he understands the significance of the awards and the raves. But he doesn't understand why all those things don't add up the same way they do for almost everyone else.
 ''The last time I was home, we were just sitting having conversation,'' Ms. Ruff said, beginning to wipe away tears. ''He just says: 'You know? I just really would have thought doing some of the things you have done and being as good as you are, you would have made it by now.' And it just broke my heart. It broke my heart. Because he worries.''

How Long Will It Take for China to Catch Up?
 To the Editor:
 Re ''A Chinese Century? Maybe It's the Next One'' (Economic View, Aug. 19), in which Lester Thurow analyzed expected long-term economic growth in China versus the United States, and concluded that China wouldn't be catching up for a long time: 
 However, any economic analysis to the end of the 21st century should consider the effects of information, biological and nanoscale technologies. They will cause explosive growth in productivity and gross domestic product sometime during this century. This will almost certainly happen in the United States before it does in China, further strengthening Mr. Thurow's argument.

 The Teaching of Economics 101
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Dismal Science, Dismally Taught'' (Economic View, Aug. 12), in which Robert H. Frank lamented the state of introductory economics courses, and what students gain from them:
 The goal of an introductory course is to teach students to be better analytical thinkers. I would rather know how well this goal is being achieved than whether students can recall the definition of opportunity cost six months after the class. 
 Moreover, it is not clear to me that recall of the particulars of introductory economics classes is any worse than it is for other disciplines. As a graduate school classmate observed, high school geometry may be a prerequisite for college but many beginning economics students have only minimal recall of basic X-Y coordinate graphs and slopes.

HEADLINE: Stop Making Sense

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
David Brooks is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
Between 2000 and 2006, a specter haunted the community of fundamentalist Democrats. Members of this community looked around and observed their moral and intellectual superiority. They observed that their policies were better for the middle classes. And yet the middle classes did not support Democrats. They tended to vote, in large numbers, for the morally and intellectually inferior party, the one, moreover, that catered to the interests of the rich.
 How could this be?
 Serious thinkers set to work, and produced a long shelf of books answering this question. Their answers tended to rely on similar themes. First, Democrats lose because they are too intelligent. Their arguments are too complicated for American voters. Second, Democrats lose because they are too tolerant. They refuse to cater to racism and hatred. Finally, Democrats lose because they are not good at the dark art of politics. Republicans, though they are knuckle-dragging simpletons when it comes to policy, are devilishly clever when it comes to electioneering. They have brilliant political consultants like Lee Atwater and Karl Rove, who frame issues so fiendishly, they can fool the American people into voting against their own best interests. 
 This literature was never taken seriously by sophisticated Democrats, but it thrived nonetheless. Still, you'd think it would be pretty much extinct now that Democrats are winning and Republicans are in the midst of a historic meltdown. 
 But Drew Westen, a professor of psychology at Emory University, has come forth with a late entry in the field, and his book, ''The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation,'' is enjoying a vogue. He takes an interesting dollop of neuroscience and uses it to coat the conventional cliches of the Why Democrats Lose genre.
 Westen begins by noting that recent research has shot holes through the theory of the dispassionate rational mind that emerged from the 18th-century Enlightenment. People rely upon emotion to drive the decision-making process and reach conclusions that make them feel good. 
 Reason and rationality, therefore, play a limited role in political decisions. ''The dispassionate mind of the 18th-century philosophers,'' Westen says, ''allows us to predict somewhere between 0.5 and 3 percent of the most important political decisions people will make over the course of their lives.'' 
 He then goes on to assert that Democrats have been losing because they have been appealing to the rational part of the mind. They issue laundry lists of policies and offer arguments with evidence. They don't realize how the images they are presenting set off emotional cues that undermine their own campaigns.
 For example, the right side of John Edwards's mouth tends to curl up. ''Humans innately dislike facial asymmetries,'' Westen observes, ''and this should have caught the eye of his advisers.'' In Connecticut, Ned Lamont ran a commercial showing Joe Lieberman morphing into George Bush, but in the ad Lieberman was smiling. ''Smiling faces innately activate parts of the brain (and facial mimicry on the part of the observer) that reinforce happiness, not distaste.''
 Republicans, Westen continues, are brilliant at using words and images that set off emotional cascades. Ronald Reagan used the word ''confiscation'' in reference to taxation, and was able to persuade people to agree to lower taxes. He called Nicaraguan contras ''freedom fighters'' and was able to secure them funding.
 Westen urges Democratic candidates to go for the gut, and includes a number of speeches that he wishes Democratic candidates had given. He wishes, for example, Al Gore had hit George Bush harder for being a drunk. He wishes Gore had interrupted a presidential debate and barked at Bush, ''If someone is going to restore dignity to the Oval Office, it isn't a man who drank his way through three decades of his life and got investigated by his father's own Securities and Exchange Commission for swindling people out of their retirement savings.'' 
 At another point, he imagines Gore exploding: ''Why don't you tell us how many times you got behind the wheel of a car with a few drinks under your belt, endangering your neighbors' kids? Where I come from, we call that a drunk.'' If Democrats would go for people's primitive passions in this way, Westen argues, they'd win elections.
 This thesis raises some interesting questions. First, why did someone with so little faith in rational inquiry go into academia, and what does he do to those who disagree with him at Emory faculty meetings, especially recovering alcoholics?
 Second, the states of upper New England and the Pacific Coast regularly used to vote Republican in presidential elections but now they generally vote Democratic. Did people in those states become less emotional, and therefore more amenable to the Democrats' rational appeals over the past few decades? If so, has this led to a drop in Valentine's Day purchases, at least compared with people in passionate states like Nebraska?
 Third, how did John Kerry beat Howard Dean in the Democratic primaries? Was it because of his Oprah-esque displays of emotional intensity?
 Fourth, is it possible that substance has something to do with the political fortunes of parties? Could it be that Democrats won in the middle part of the 20th century because they were right about the big issues -- the New Deal and the civil rights movement? Is it possible Republicans won in the latter part of the century because they were right about economic growth and the cold war? Is it possible Democrats are winning now because they were right about whether to go to war in Iraq? And if substantive policies correlate with political fortunes, what does that say about the human mind?
 Finally, if voter decisions are driven by the sort of crude emotional outbursts Westen recommends, and if, as he writes, ''a substantial minority of Americans hold authoritarian, intolerant ideologies driven by fear, hate and prejudice that are fundamentally incompatible with Democratic (and democratic) principles,'' then shouldn't we abandon this whole democracy thing? Shouldn't we have a coup, led perhaps by the Emory psychology department, which could prevent the brutish and hate-filled from ever gaining control?
 It's rare that one comes across a book that raises so many questions. Of course it's rare that one comes across a book that so avidly flatters the prejudices of its partisan readers. 
 The core problem with Westen's book is that he doesn't really make use of what we know about emotion. He builds on the work of Antonio Damasio, without applying Damasio's conception of how emotion emerges from and contributes to reason. 
 In this more sophisticated view, emotions are produced by learning. As we go through life, we learn what cause leads to what effect. When, later on, we face similar situations, the emotions highlight possible outcomes, drawing us toward some actions and steering us away from others.
 In other words, emotions partner with rationality. It's not necessary to dumb things down to appeal to emotions. It's not necessary to understand some secret language that will key certain neuro-emotional firings. The best way to win votes -- and this will be a shocker -- is to offer people an accurate view of the world and a set of policies that seem likely to produce good results.
 This is how you make voters happy.

HEADLINE: A Psychology Lesson From the Markets

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale, author of ''Irrational Exuberance'' and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
IT is no surprise that the Federal Reserve's discount rate cut has not entirely reassured investors. The Fed can stop a run on the banks, but it cannot control the speculative cycle -- a cycle built on psychology and misperceptions that has been sweeping much of the world for the last 10 or 12 years.
 I have worked with Karl E. Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College, with help from the Yale School of Management, in conducting questionnaire surveys of recent home buyers. In Los Angeles and San Francisco in 2005, when actual home prices were rising more than 20 percent a year, we found that respondents anticipated big increases far into the future. At that time, the median expected annual climb for the succeeding 10 years was 9 percent. 
 This expectation would mean that a house valued at an already high level of $650,000 in 2005 would be worth more than $1.5 million in 2015. For most people in 2005, it would also mean that they should buy a house soon, or forever be excluded from owning one -- and that it would be better to stretch and buy the most expensive house they could afford, to capture the huge profits of homeownership. 
 Now, of course, prices have been falling, and our survey over the last few months shows that in Los Angeles and San Francisco, the median 10-year expected price increase among recent home buyers has come down to 5 percent a year -- a number that is likely to decline further if prices continue to drop. As price expectations fall, homeowners lose the incentive to pay off a mortgage on a home they are realizing is beyond their means. They decide to default. We thus have the beginnings of a mortgage crisis. 
 The problem is fundamental, tied to the imbalance caused by irrationally high home prices and declining optimism that the prices will go higher. Cutting interest rates will not change this basic situation. 
 The problem is fundamental because the speculative cycle afflicts much of the world. Housing booms have not occurred everywhere, but they have been commonplace since the late 1990s in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
 We have also seen similar worldwide boom cycles in the stock market over the last 10 or 12 years. Many countries shared in the huge market booms that peaked in 2000, and just about every major stock market around the world has boomed since 2003.
 Classical economics cannot explain this cycle, because underlying these booms is popular reaction to the price increases themselves. Rising prices encourage investors to expect more price increases, and their optimism feeds back into even more increases, again and again in a vicious circle. As the boom continues, there is less fear of borrowing heavily, or of lending heavily. In this situation, lower lending standards seem perfectly appropriate -- and even a fair way to permit everyone to prosper. 
 Booms cannot go on forever. Downward price feedback sets in. That is when balance sheets become impaired and widening credit problems start to show up.
 The puzzle is why this speculative cycle has occurred recently in so much of the world. What do all these countries share that drives them to speculative booms?
 One might think that investor optimism is generated by rapid world economic growth that is using up scarce resources and driving up asset prices. Since 2004, the International Monetary Fund's real per capita growth figures for gross domestic product worldwide have been fairly high: around 4 percent a year. 
 It is noteworthy that from 1995 to 2003, when these booms took root, that growth figure averaged only 2.4 percent a year. A good part of the extra growth since 2004 has probably been the increased spending caused by the speculative booms themselves. 
 The greatest recent economic successes have apparently been in China and India. Because these are the most populous countries, together accounting for 37 percent of the world's population, their success has become an international symbol of spectacular growth. 
 But it is easy to overstate their importance. China's and India's economies are actually a tiny fraction of world G.D.P.-- together only 7 percent. The popular impressions of suddenly rapid growth are thus mostly a perceptual error, like the optical illusions documented by psychologists. 
 The growth of capitalism around the world has caused trust in the social safety net to decline, even in the United States, where 401(k)'s are replacing traditional pensions. 
 People worry that they must increase their wealth to fend for themselves. One might think that this lack of trust would promote much precautionary saving, but world savings rates are not high over all. It has generally fit in better with popular perceptions of the booms to be smart investors, not great savers. 
 As we all try to adjust to a rapidly growing and increasingly capitalist world, we have been trying to discover who we are and how we fit into it. This has meant an enormous change in values. 
 Many people feel that they have discovered their true inner genius as investors and have relished the new self-expression and excitement. Investors across the world have been thinking that they are winners -- not recognizing that much of their success is only a result of a boom. Declines in asset prices endanger this very self-esteem.
 That is why it is so hard to turn around investor attitudes once a downward psychology sets in. The Fed and other central banks do not have lithium or Prozac in their bag of remedies, and so cannot control it.

HEADLINE: Not Just for Empty Nesters

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
JERICHO, N.Y.
 NEW homes in pricey gated communities in eastern Nassau County -- the kinds of places often assumed to be aimed at empty nesters -- are attracting buyers in their early and mid 30s who have little use for an elevator in the house, but might opt for an indoor basketball court with 18-foot-high ceilings.
 Naturally, there are also older buyers interested in these communities, some of which have their entrances on the main commercial and retail strip on the North Shore. 
 A major factor in the developments' appeal for all ages is the top school districts that serve them, the security of gates and walls, and the landscaping and snow-shoveling services. And it turns out that older buyers are not the only ones who like the social intimacy of gated developments, especially where all the homeowners are new to the community, according to some buyers. 
 The significant number of young couples moving to the communities, in Muttontown, Jericho and Woodbury, has surprised brokers.
 ''It's astounding,'' said Linda Buffardi, sales manager for the 29-unit Horizons development in Jericho, commenting on the number of young people who can afford the homes.
 The Mediterranean-style Horizons homes, two stories high on third- to half-acre lots, start at $1.4 million. 
 Marilyn Larsen, the Lane Realty broker who is selling the homes, said she had encouraged the developer to include a home design with a first-floor master bedroom and elevators in the units for older buyers. ''But as it turned out,'' she said, ''we have a plan but no need for it.'' 
 All but two of the buyers for the 10 sold units are under 40, Ms. Buffardi said. Many are doctors from nearby hospitals (Ms. Larsen calls the site ''doctor's row'') and Wall Streeters. 
 Terry Chantemsin, 32, liked the ''modern sensibility'' of the Horizons homes, including clean lines and loftlike double-height ceilings. He and his wife, Katherine, 33, both project managers for Wall Street companies, are in contract to buy one. 
 The Chantemsins now live in a one-bedroom condominium at Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square in Manhattan and plan to close on their Horizons home in February -- around the time their first child is due.
 ''There's definitely a lot of anxiety'' attached to buying a million-plus-dollar home, he said, even after recently selling their Manhattan condo for about $400,000 more than the nearly half-million they paid for it three years ago. But after going through gut renovations of the last two apartments he owned in Manhattan, Mr. Chantemsin said, he is ready to pay more to buy new and ready-to-go this time.
 ''Some of our friends say we should buy a starter home and trade up later,'' he said, ''but I think it's doable as long as interest rates don't go much higher.''
 The high taxes in the area (around $30,000 at Horizons) are comparable to his yearly common charge in Union Square, he said, ''but at least on Long Island, you're contributing to the school district.''
 A short drive northeast to Jericho Turnpike, the main commercial and retail strip on the North Shore, is the stone-walled entrance to Stone Hill at Muttontown, an 80-home development under construction on the hilly 149-acre former Gold Coast estate of Joseph Sampson Stevens. The son of a wealthy New York family, he numbered among Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders. 
 The homes, each with a different facade, of stone and siding in pale earth tones, are priced from $2.4 million up to $7 million (the highest price is for the former Stevens mansion on 2.65 acres). Copper beech trees and an apple orchard obscure the far-off view of Jericho Turnpike along the development's winding roads.
 Nine of the 23 sold homes have been bought by couples under 40, according to John Simms, a spokesman for the developer, Bernard Jankowitz. One of those buyers is adding a below-ground indoor basketball court to his house, according to Stephanie Jankowitz, who works for her father-in-law's firm, Jankowitz Construction.
 Farther east on Jericho Turnpike toward Woodbury, the Preserve at Woodbury, a new enclave of 32 brick town houses with copper entryway awnings, is starting to interest younger buyers. 
 So far, most of the 20 buyers of the houses, which start at $1.25 million, have been older, according to Josephine Stockli, the Coldwell Banker real estate broker who is handling the sales. But the most recent purchase was by a couple from Manhattan in their early 30s who are expecting their first child, she said.
 ''Lately, over the last six months, there's been more interest from younger couples,'' Ms. Stockli said. She ascribed some of that interest to the fact that Coldwell Banker recently placed ads in New York City newspapers. 
 She has suggested that the developer add a lap pool and Jacuzzi to the development, because such elements seem to attract younger buyers. The development also has a clubhouse with a 13-seat movie theater and gym, as well as Internet access in all the homes.
 Pearl S. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, said the younger wealthy buyers flocking to Jericho Turnpike's most expensive communities ''say a lot about the economic stratification of Long Island.'' 
 A widening income gap, she said, is favoring those with the educational opportunities to develop skills needed for the most lucrative jobs.
 Still, she added, wealthy 30-somethings are atypical. ''We need housing for people who are not in the upper-income categories, and the place to do that is in the older downtowns'' with multi-family housing, she said, and on land that can be redeveloped from other uses.

HEADLINE: DROP FORESEEN IN MEDIAN PRICE OF HOMES IN U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The median price of American homes is expected to fall this year for the first time since federal housing agencies began keeping statistics in 1950. 
 Economists say the decline, which could be foreshadowed in a widely followed government price index to be released this week, will probably be modest -- from 1 percent to 2 percent -- but could continue in 2008 and 2009. Rather than being limited to the once-booming Northeast and California, price declines are also occurring in cities like Chicago, Minneapolis and Houston, where the increases of the last decade were modest by comparison.
 The reversal is particularly striking because many government officials and housing-industry executives had said that a nationwide decline would never happen, even though prices had fallen in some coastal areas as recently as the early 1990s.
 While the housing slump has already rattled financial markets, it has so far had only a modest effect on consumer spending and economic growth. But forecasters now believe that its impact will lead to a slowdown over the next year or two. 
 ''For most people, this is not a disaster,'' said Nigel Gault, an economist with Global Insight, a research firm in Waltham, Mass. ''But it's enough to cause them to pull back.''
 In recent years, many families used their homes as a kind of piggy bank, borrowing against their equity and increasing their spending more rapidly than their income was rising. A recent research paper co-written by the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve said that the rise in home prices was the primary reason that consumer borrowing has soared since 2001.
 Now, however, that financial cushion is disappearing for many families. ''We are having to start from scratch and rebuild for a down payment,'' said Kenneth Schauf, who expects to lose money on a condominium in Chicago he and his wife bought in 2004 and have been trying to sell since last summer. ''We figured that a home is the place to build your wealth, and now it's going on three years and we are back to square one.''
 On an inflation-adjusted basis, the national median price -- the level at which half of all homes are more expensive and half are less -- is not likely to return to its 2007 peak for more than a decade, according to Moody'sEconomy.com, a research firm.
 Unless the real estate downturn is much worse than economists are expecting, the declines will not come close to erasing the increases of the last decade. And for many families who do not plan to move, the year-to-year value of their house matters little. The drop is, of course, good news for home buyers.
 It does, however, contradict the widely held notion that there is no such thing as a nationwide housing slump. A 2004 report jointly written by the top economists at five organizations -- the industry groups for real estate agents, home builders and community bankers, as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the large government-sponsored backers of home mortgages -- was typical. It said that ''there is little possibility of a widespread national decline since there is no national housing market.''
 Top government officials were more circumspect but still doubted that the prices would decline nationally. Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, said the housing market was not susceptible to bubbles, in part because every local market is different.
 In 2005, Ben S. Bernanke, then an adviser to President Bush and now the Fed chairman, said ''strong fundamentals'' were the main force behind the rise in prices. ''We've never had a decline in housing prices on a nationwide basis,'' he added. 
 But Global Insight, the research firm, estimates that the home-price index to be released Thursday by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, a regulatory agency, will show a decline of about 1 percent between the first and second quarter of this year. Other forecasters predict that the index will rise slightly in the second quarter before falling later this year. 
 In all, Global Insight expects a decline of 4 percent, or roughly 10 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, between the peak earlier this year and the projected low point in 2009. In California, prices are expected to decline 16 percent -- or about 20 percent after taking inflation into account.
 The government's index, which compares the sales price of individual homes over time, is intended to describe the actual value of a typical house. Since the index began in 1975, it has slipped from one quarter to the next on a few occasions, but it has never fallen over a full year.
 Another index dating back to 1950, calculated by Freddie Mac, has also never shown an annual decline. Price data published by the National Association of Realtors, based on the prices of houses sold in a given year, have also never declined. According to the association, the median home price is now about $220,000.
 Mr. Schauf and his wife, Leslie Suarez, put their condo in the Sheridan Park neighborhood of Chicago up for sale shortly before moving to Texas last year so he could take a new job. They bought the two-bedroom unit in September 2004 for $255,000, with a 5 percent down payment. They redid the floors, installed new window treatments and repainted the walls. 
 They said they expected the condo to sell quickly. Instead, they have cut the price several times and have yet to receive an offer. The current list price is $279,000, though they expect to settle for less.
 Without the money for a new down payment, they are renting an apartment in Austin. They also expect the monthly payment on their adjustable-rate mortgage to go up $200 in October.
 Ms. Suarez, who grew up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, says she is not as surprised because she remembers home prices falling after the oil bust in the late 1980s. ''Growing up in Texas, real estate has never been a windfall,'' she said. ''For me, I always just wanted to break even.''
 Housing prices have previously declined for long stretches in various regions. Most recently, prices fell in California and in the Northeast during the recession of the early 1990s.
 The current slump is different from that one, though, in both depth and breadth. In fact, the national median price rose only slightly faster than inflation from 1950 to the mid-1990s.
 But as interest rates fell and lending standards became looser, prices started rising rapidly in the late 1990s, even in places like Chicago, which had rarely seen a real estate boom. The result was a ''euphoric popular delusion'' that real estate was a can't-miss investment, said Edward W. Gjertsen II, president of the Financial Planners Association of Illinois. ''That's just human nature.''
 Many families are clearly richer because of the boom. In the Old Town neighborhood of Chicago, the town house that Ian R. Perschke, a technology consultant, and Jennifer Worstell, a lawyer, bought in late 2004 has appreciated more than 30 percent, they estimated. The gain was big enough to allow them to take out a larger mortgage and renovate two rental units in the house. But Mr. Perschke said he understood that he was ''not going to see that appreciation over the next three years.'' 
 Prices in Chicago peaked in September 2006 and have since dipped 1.7 percent, according to the Case-Shiller home-price index, which is tabulated by MacroMarkets, a research firm.
 For all the attention that the uninterrupted growth in national house prices received, some economists argue that it was misplaced. The Case-Shiller index, which many experts consider more accurate than the government measure, did show a drop in prices in the early 1990s. (Unlike the government's measure, it includes mortgages of more than $417,000, which are not held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.)
 After adjusting for inflation -- the most meaningful way to look at any price, economists say -- even the government's index fell in the early 1990s.
 Dean Baker, an economist in Washington who has been arguing for the last five years that houses were overvalued, said the idea that house prices could go only up had fed the bubble. 
 ''It was very misleading,'' said Mr. Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal research group. There are a lot of people, he said, who bought ''homes at hugely inflated prices who are going to take a hit. You also have a lot of people who borrowed against those inflated prices.''
 Perhaps the most prominent housing booster was David Lereah, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors until April. In 2005, he published a book titled, ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' In 2006, it was updated and rereleased as ''Why the Real Estate Boom Will Not Bust.'' This year, Mr. Lereah published a new book, ''All Real Estate Is Local.''
 In an interview, Mr. Lereah, now an executive at Move Inc., which operates a real estate Web site, acknowledged he had gotten it wrong, saying he did not fully realize how loose lending standards had become and how quickly they would tighten up again this summer. But he argued that many of his critics have also been proved wrong, because they were bearish as early as 2002.
 ''The bears were bears way too early, and the bulls were bulls too late,'' he said. ''You need to know when you are straying from fundamentals. It's hard, when you are in the middle of the storm, to know.''

HEADLINE: The Market Is Bumpy, But Liquor Is Quicker

BYLINE: By SAKI KNAFO

 BODY:
Just as a storm of change has been rattling the New York Stock Exchange of late, so has there been a change in the weather at the New York Wine Exchange, a well-stocked shop on Broadway near Battery Place, just a few blocks from its namesake. On a chilly evening last week, a marketing analyst named Effie Philippakos seemed to embody these fluctuations after she hurried into the store and headed straight for the spirits. 
 ''I've bought the wine here before,'' said Ms. Philippakos, wrapped in a dress-length sweater, ''but this is the first time I've bought the vodka.'' 
 As it turned out, she purchased the vodka for a party. But it might have been one more example of a recent trend at the store. According to Paul Couto, the owner, sales of hard liquor have risen several percentage points since Aug. 16, the day the major stock indexes plunged to more than 10 percentage points below their July peaks. 
 Are the gods of finance smiling down on Mr. Couto even as they chuck lightning bolts at the financial companies that employ many of his customers? 
 More than a decade's experience selling wine has taught him otherwise. He has found that when finance workers go for the hard stuff, it's not because they want to drown their sorrows, but because liquor is a better bargain than wine. 
 ''You open a bottle of Scotch,'' he lamented, ''it lasts you a week.'' 
 In 1995, when Mr. Couto decided to open a store so near Wall Street, he essentially became a player in the stock market without buying any stock. Over the next several years, as the technology bubble swelled, he reaped the dividends, and his store began to fill with ornately decorated bottles of cashew wine and other souvenirs of the vacations he had begun taking to the Indian state of Goa, his homeland. 
 Then came Sept. 11. In the days after the attacks, Mr. Couto allowed people who had been forced out of their apartments to keep their pets in his shop temporarily. His local fame increased as a result, but business never returned to its previous levels.
 ''I will never see those figures again,'' he said.
 Mr. Couto said that he wouldn't be able to fully gauge the effects of the recent financial turbulence until next month, when many of his regular customers return from vacation. But even if they don't all switch to hard liquor, he worries that some of them may soon exit the neighborhood. 
 ''I have had a couple of brokers who told me that they're in trouble,'' he said. ''If this continues, it will cost them their jobs.''

HEADLINE: CHET CARLIN

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
AGE: 67 YEARS WORKING: 40 AVERAGE INCOME: $20,000 to $25,000 LAST SEEN IN: ''Of Mice and Men'' at the Studio Arena Theater in Buffalo, N.Y., and the Cleveland Play House
 Just about every actor, at one time or another, has said something like this: Five years from now, if I haven't made it, I'm quitting the business. 
 It sounds pretty hardheaded, but almost immediately you get into trouble. Does ''making it'' mean being an understudy for a Broadway play? Or paying the rent, even if that means doing commercials for personal-hygiene products?
 ''I probably spent most of the first 10 years saying, 'You know, if I don't make it in 10 years ... ,' '' Chet Carlin said about the days before he became a professional actor. ''But then what's 'make it'? It's difficult to define unless you become a star. As I got older, I was pushing my 30s, I had no other skills. So in some ways I locked myself into being an actor.''
 Forty years, give or take, after passing the deadline, Mr. Carlin had just finished an audition and was sitting at the Cafe Edison on West 47th Street drinking a beer. The past year had been a good one, as far as it goes: a nice stretch, bringing in a few thousand dollars, coming after a long dry spell.
 ''It's a wonderful, wonderful thing to do,'' Mr. Carlin concluded about a life of acting, ''and it's always exciting.''
 And 'making it,' well, the meaning is still elusive.
 ''I worry about winter,'' he said, after mentioning that his unemployment claim was about to run out. ''That oil bill.''
 After 40 years as an actor in New York, Mr. Carlin has one Broadway credit from several roles he played in ''An Evening With Richard Nixon,'' which ran for two weeks in 1972. Then there were a few national tours (under the listing for ''First Monday in October,'' his resume reads: ''Opposite Henry Fonda'' ); a few Off Broadway shows; a few Off Off Broadway shows; a lot of regional theater; a ''Law & Order'' episode here and there; a TV mini-series; some commercials -- Scope, Maxwell House, Lowenbrau.
 That's a lot of work, but you can't live on it, or you almost can't. When Mr. Carlin's wife, Miriam, worked for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights Aids and Mr. Carlin worked the stage, their combined salary was usually a little over $40,000. 
 And savings? ''Never,'' Mr. Carlin said with a carefree laugh. ''There's no such things as savings.'' 
 So it's a mix of pensions, Social Security checks, unemployment claims, temp work and whatever roles he can get. Mr. Carlin, who maintains an infectiously optimistic demeanor even when discussing severe financial straights, seems to marvel at the life he's led. He cheerfully described his family's situation as near-poor, in an almost constant crunch: a paycheck away from dropping below the poverty line. Somehow, though, he and his wife raised two children, now aged 36 and 34, and Mr. Carlin managed to be home every Christmas (except twice). 
 In show business any talk about paying dues is a little Pollyanish. As if an actor is owed something in return for years of work, tireless hustling and good reviews in meaty roles. No, at the end of each gig he's unemployed, and that uncertainty about the next job is still there. And it doesn't necessarily get easier, dues paid or not.
 ''It's a little harder when you get older, a little more frightening,'' Mr. Carlin said. ''There's no question that there's a fear level when you get older because there's just not as much out there.''
 So far something has always come up: like last year, which began poorly. Despite a few barren months Mr. Carlin decided he would take his wife to Paris. He'd promised he would at some point, and they weren't getting any younger. So they would bite the bullet, he said, take out a loan, stay at a cousin's apartment.
 Then in quick succession, he got a part as Candy in ''Of Mice and Men'' (roughly $800 a week for 12 weeks), one day's work modeling in a print ad for a company selling diabetes testing equipment (almost $3,000) and a day's work on ''Law & Order'' (around $4,000). 
 ''Well, we went to Paris in style,'' Mr. Carlin crowed. ''It was fabulous!''
 The money he made in those acting jobs? 
 ''It's all gone now,'' he said, with an unambiguous smile. And then he couldn't resist: ''But we'll always have Paris.''

HEADLINE: A Turnaround: Stocks Up, Volatility Down

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market bounced back last week, with the three major indexes all posting weekly gains of more than 2 percent. 
 In fact, it was the best performance for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since March. An important measure of stock-market volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, dropped 31 percent during the week, its biggest weekly decline since the index started in 1990, according to Bloomberg News. 
 The stock gains on Wall Street were mirrored in markets around the world, which have been bolstered by the efforts of central banks to stabilize the financial system after the shocks set off by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 299.79 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 13,378.87. The S.& P. 500-stock index climbed 33.43 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 1,479.37. The Nasdaq composite index gained 71.66 points, or 2.9 percent, to close at 2,576.69. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.62 percent from 4.68 percent the previous week.

HEADLINE: Vaccines and Their Promise Are Roaring Back

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE prospect of profit drives innovators, perhaps as much as solving the technical problems that make innovation possible. 
 This truism is gaining new currency among innovators in the once-legendary field of vaccines. In the 1950s, vaccine inventors were the stars of American innovation, celebrated the way Steve Jobs of Apple and the pair who founded Google are today. In 1955, Jonas Salk virtually wiped out polio with a vaccine, becoming the most celebrated scientist in America. In a phenomenal run starting in the late 1950s, Maurice Hilleman created vaccines for flu, measles, mumps, rubella and other illnesses, getting credit for saving more lives than any medical innovator in history. 
 By the mid-1990s, however, innovation in vaccines had virtually come to a halt. Only a handful of companies even tried to develop new ones, compared with 25 in 1955. 
 But in a stunning reversal, innovators today are chasing dozens of vaccines, stimulated by some recent high-profile successes. ''People see vaccines as money makers,'' says Paul A. Offit, chief of the infectious diseases section at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the author of ''Vaccinated,'' a new book on Hilleman's career. 
 As wealthy countries spend much more on health care, and as poorer countries put new emphasis on disease prevention, many companies are jumping into vaccine innovation, including major pharmaceutical makers like Astra Zeneca, Novartis and Pfizer. Two separate teams, one involving Dr. Offit at GlaxoSmithKline, and the other at Merck, created in recent years rotavirus vaccines for childhood diarrhea, a big killer in less developed countries. 
 ''Vaccine makers are tackling major public-health problems again,'' says Adel Mahmoud, a vaccine expert and a professor in the department of molecular biology at Princeton. ''The size of the market is incredible, both in America and around the world.'' Dr. Mahmoud was previously president of Merck's vaccines unit.
 To date, the biggest winner in the revival is Merck, which in the first six months of 2007 posted revenue of nearly $2 billion from vaccines alone, more than the company's vaccine sales for all of 2006. As recently as 2005, Merck's vaccine sales totaled barely $1.1 billion and were essentially flat over the prior three years. But last year, Merck received permission to sell three new vaccines, including a breakthrough preventive treatment for cervical cancer, and another for shingles.
 ''We're realizing in recent years that if you have strong vaccines, customers are willing to pay for the value delivered,'' says Margaret McGlynn, president of Merck's vaccine business. 
 Across the industry, the research pipeline is bulging. Companies are spending billions trying to develop vaccines for various cancers, staph infections and malaria. ''We are entering a new golden era of vaccinology,'' says Gregory A. Poland, a vaccine expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. 
 In addition to traditional one-size-fits-all vaccines, Dr. Poland foresees a new class of personalized vaccines tuned toward the particular genetics and biology of the individual. Personalized vaccines will be more cost-effective; today everyone gets the same series of three hepatitis B shots over six months, for instance, though researchers know that one in five people, on average, could get the same protection with fewer.
 ''Technology will eventually allow us to do immuno-genetic profiles to tell me which viruses pose the most risks to a person,'' says Dr. Poland, who works in this nascent field. 
 Personalized vaccines are likely many years away. So are vaccines for such vexing diseases as AIDS, a big killer whose variety and rapid mutations pose hard problems for vaccine makers.
 Even so, potential markets look strong. Governments are more interested in funding vaccination programs after years of neglect, and public fears that vaccines cause harmful side effects are subsiding. Those fears are now largely discounted by medical experts. The specter of bioterrorism has also heightened interest in new vaccines, spawning new funding sources. 
 ''There are a lot of targets that have not been tackled,'' says Dr. Mahmoud at Princeton.
 The willingness to try makes a big difference. The history of vaccine development is uneven, says Louis Galambos, a historian at Johns Hopkins University who wrote a book on the subject, ''Networks of Innovation,'' with Jane Eliot Sewell. 
 ''There are waves of optimism in medical science that encourage investment,'' Mr. Galambos says, ''We're in one of those waves now.''
 THE story of Merck's Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer -- a $360 series with sales of $723 million in the first half of this year -- shows why optimism is important. The basic engineering on the vaccine occurred in the late 1990s, and extensive field trials consumed years more and hundreds of millions of dollars.
 Merck started Gardasil development when ''the climate was really sour, negative,'' recalls Eliav Barr, one of the leaders of the company's Gardasil program. ''Many people said it's not worth creating vaccines.'' Regulatory approval is not guaranteed, and production is difficult. Vaccines are grown in living organisms, and ''there is an art to making them,'' Dr. Barr says.
 The allure of the silver bullet -- of wiping out an entire class of related diseases with a single injection -- remains a powerful symbol of technological advance. Fifty years ago, vaccine creators captivated the world's imagination. With the return of vaccine-making to the center of the pharmaceutical business, new sources of profits are emerging, and new heroes of innovation.

HEADLINE: Love Us or Hate Us, Ya Can't Ignore Us

BYLINE: By JOHN STRAUSBAUGH

 BODY:
DO Europeans hate America or love it? Lately the answer might seem a no-brainer. But ''The Anti-Americans,'' a one-hour documentary that has its premiere on PBS on Monday night, suggests that the correct response is: ''Both.'' We have, the show declares, ''a hate-love relationship.''
 We see both sides in the program. First the hate: 
 At a fashionable dinner party in London a proper Englishwoman sniffs with supreme condescension, ''Americans are the first nation to come from barbarians, skip the civilized bit and go into decline.''
 In a French country kitchen a woman recalls, with horrified outrage, a trip to Chicago, where she encountered ''the fattest people I ever saw in my life.'' She gasps that she could have ridden on their ''big fat behinds.''
 At a raucous public forum in a Dublin pub the one brave soul who speaks up in America's defense is shouted down with angry obscenities.
 Then the love:
 In Poland a large crowd in cowboy hats and boots waves American flags and cheers a bluegrass performance. If it weren't for the accents and the odd spellings like ''piknik'' and ''hod dog,'' you might think it's Branson, Mo. 
 Shooting in 2005 and '06, Louis Alvarez, Andrew Kolker and Peter Odabashian of the Center for New American Media, a New York documentary-production company, discovered one thing these countries have in common: The omnipresent culture of the United States is like a giant funhouse mirror in which Europeans see their own distorted reflections. 
 ''America is a very, very useful construct for us to ventilate our own inadequacies and frustrations with ourselves,'' one Irishman confesses. 
 The British novelist and journalist Will Self accuses his countrymen of being ''blatantly hypocritical'' and ''extremely shallow'' about the United States. They speak about American culture with great disdain, he says in the documentary, even as they consume it with a bottomless appetite. 
 As a case in point ''The Anti-Americans,'' part of the ''America at a Crossroads'' series, includes segments from a London stage production of ''Jerry Springer: The Opera.''
 ''Jerry Springer is very American,'' Mr. Alvarez said recently, ''but only the British would make an opera about him.''
 Mr. Kolker compared this program to ''The Japanese Version,'' which he and Mr. Alvarez produced in 1991. That show explored how the Japanese fascination with American pop culture may say more about the Japanese as cultural magpies than it does about the global influence of the United States.
 Similarly, when French people complain on camera about everything from American cuisine to American foreign policy to American terms infiltrating their language, they really seem to be lamenting France's own loss of power and influence in the world. 
 Because France declined on the world stage as the United States rose, the cultural anthropologist and marketing guru G. Clotaire Rapaille says in the film, ''Americans are the ideal enemy.'' 
 The French writer Pascal Bruckner agrees. ''The fact that you're hated means that you matter,'' he says.
 Mr. Kolker put it more bluntly: ''They have empire envy.''
 He said the producers chose Britain and France because ''they were low-hanging fruit really. They're the greatest America haters in the world, yet they also love America.''
 They chose Poland, he said, as representative of the New Europe, where they expected to find ''a fundamentally different attitude toward America.'' He added with a smile, ''What we found out was that they're mostly just glad we're not Russian.''
 After decades of domination by the Nazis and then the Soviets, the Poles seem more willing than the British or French to be dominated by American culture. They speak of Uncle Sam as though he were a rich relative, if a distant and rather aloof one. It's love with a distinct tinge of neurotic insecurity.
 ''If Poland were a person, they would be in permanent analysis,'' the British-born historian Tony Judt observes.
 For the legions of country music fans in Poland, idealized images of the American West represent freedom. Michael Lonstar (pronounced like Lonestar) fondly remembers hearing Ernest Tubb on Voice of America radio as a boy growing up behind the Iron Curtain. He performs country music in Polish and English, complete with achy-breaky dancing girls in denim miniskirts and cowboy boots.
 In doing historical research for the program, Mr. Alvarez said, the producers were interested to find that Europeans' stereotypes of the United States and Americans have remained fundamentally unchanged for generations.
 But, Mr. Judt says in the program, in recent years the Bush administration's foreign policy has amplified traditional European dismay and ''switched on something I haven't see in a very long time.'' He says that Europeans now want to tell us: ''Damn it, you're doing stupid things that could screw up my world, in which case I want the right to have some say in who runs your country. If you must have stupid presidents, I want a vote.''
 A sense of humor and a light touch are trademarks of the documentaries Mr. Kolker and Mr. Alvarez have made together for 30 years, the last 10 with Mr. Odabashian. 
 Those have included ''Vote for Me,'' a four-part series on grass-roots politicking that was shown on PBS in 1996; ''People Like Us,'' in which Americans openly discussed the often taboo subject of social class, shown in 2001; and ''Small Ball,'' which had its premiere in 2004, about the 2002 Little League Baseball World Series.
 ''We look at culture with a bit of whimsy and a serious undertone,'' Mr. Alvarez explained. ''We want people chattering when it's over. We're not propagandists, but we do have a message.''
 One message to take away from ''The Anti-Americans'' is that ''Europeans love to criticize us, but they can't take their eyes off us,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''That's because there's no escaping us. Every day they have to deal with America politically, economically and culturally. We're the 800-pound gorilla in their lives.''

HEADLINE: How Congestion Pricing Could Play Out

 BODY:
COMMUTING to Manhattan by car has long meant enduring mind-numbing traffic and paying more and more for tolls, parking and gas. So in April, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed charging cars $8 to enter Manhattan below 86th Street on weekdays, suburban drivers had reason to groan yet again.
 But the plan, which is likely to be revised during negotiations with lawmakers in Albany next year, may turn out to be a net benefit for commuters who drive into Manhattan or take mass transit. That's because the city's plan appears focused on reducing the number of cars that come into the city and on raising billions of dollars to improve mass transit. 
 In fact, drivers who live in the outer boroughs of New York and use the free East River bridges -- the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg and Queensboro -- to commute into Manhattan may be hit with the biggest burden, because congestion pricing fees will amount to a de facto toll.
 ''The impact on people in the suburbs will be very modest,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. ''We don't want to have toll shopping, which produces a surprising amount of congestion,'' he added, referring to drivers who go out of their way to take free bridges and clog local streets in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan.
 By contrast, drivers from the suburbs will be able to deduct tolls from their $8 fee, shrinking it by as much as $6 for those who use the Hudson River crossings -- the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge. Transportation analysts say, however, that even though the additional $2 can certainly add up, it will not be enough to persuade drivers to abandon their cars en masse.
 Transportation officials are also confident that the number of drivers who switch to mass transit will be minimal because most commuters coming into Manhattan from Long Island, Westchester and Connecticut already take public transportation. According to a survey by Metro-North Railroad, 89 percent of Manhattan-bound commuters who live along the Hudson Line north of Croton-Harmon take the train, and for commuters who live along the Harlem Line, 81 percent take the train. On Long Island, close to 90 percent of those who commute into the city use the railroad.
 If the Long Island Rail Road adds a third track between Floral Park and Hicksville, as it plans, there will also be more trains to carry city residents to jobs on Long Island during the morning rush hours, distributing traffic more evenly.
 Even those who continue to drive into Manhattan once the plan is in place will benefit if it does what it is supposed to do -- reduce traffic by 6.3 percent in the zone.
 At the same time, some of the $380 million the city expects to raise in the first year of congestion pricing will go to improving mass transit, including building express bus lanes and paying for new train tunnels under the East and Hudson Rivers that will increase capacity on the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit.
 ''If we assume that congestion pricing works, it tells the rest of the region to look at their development needs,'' said Robert E. Paaswell, the executive director of the University Transportation Research Center at the City College of New York.
 Still, the money generated from congestion pricing will take years to collect and spend. In the meantime, suburban commuters face crippling traffic jams, overcrowded trains and buses and a shortage of parking spaces at stations. So any new riders might be getting on trains and buses already running at capacity.
 ''We have a crowding problem, and we can't expect to handle an increase in ridership because we're not adding more trains until 2009 or 2010,'' said Jim Cameron, the chairman of the Connecticut Metro-North New Haven Rail Commuter Council.
 Mr. Cameron said that 15 percent of Metro-North trains are out of service every day, and Connecticut residents must wait an average of four years to get reserved parking spots at stations on the New Haven Line. There are similarly chronic shortages in New Jersey, Westchester and Long Island. At the Princeton Junction station in West Windsor, N.J., there are 3,560 spots to accommodate 7,080 daily riders. 
 Federal transportation officials this month promised to chip in $354 million to improve mass transit in the New York area if the city meets certain criteria. But most of the money is earmarked for projects within the five boroughs, including $214 million for bus depots in Queens and Staten Island. Far less is dedicated to solving transportation bottlenecks in the suburbs. 
 That means commuters will have to wait for existing projects to be completed. For instance, New Jersey Transit and other agencies are building a second rail tunnel under the Hudson to double the number of trains --New Jersey Transit's own and Amtrak's -- into Penn Station. The $7.5 billion tunnel is not expected to be opened until 2016. 
 Before then, the city's congestion pricing plan -- which, pending approval in Albany, is expected to go into effect on a trial basis by March 2009 -- will add 28,000 trips a day on New Jersey Transit buses, trains and light-rail cars, according to forecasts by the state's Department of Transportation. ''The bus service is already at capacity, so to add 50 or 60 more buses would be difficult,'' said Kris Kolluri, New Jersey's transportation commissioner. ''To accommodate this surge in ridership could be a challenge.''
 New Jersey Transit and the state's Department of Transportation have added nearly 15,000 parking spots at train, bus and light-rail stations since 2002 and expect to build an additional 3,700 in the next three years to keep up with ridership, which has hit records the past several years. 
 Mr. Kolluri and transportation officials elsewhere say that more spaces could be added, but that many towns are unwilling to accept them because they fear an increase in traffic -- the same problem that has led Mr. Bloomberg to pursue congestion pricing so vigorously.

HEADLINE: A Field Trip for the Congestion Panel

 BODY:
The roster of panelists named to the 17-member commission to find ways to relieve traffic congestion in New York City is a mostly thoughtful and impressive one. Given that it includes both outspoken proponents and opponents of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal for congestion pricing, its meetings should be lively. They should also be open to the public, which will have to feel invested in any plan that has a hope of working. In addition, it's vital that commission members be well-informed on the massive problem before them. 
 So we suggest that the commission's first order of business should be to book flights for the whole team to London and Stockholm, two cities that have come to embrace a system of congestion pricing as good for commuters and good for business.
 Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, has been preaching the benefits of London's four years of experience with congestion pricing. Charging cars and trucks a fee to enter the city's business district and use its busiest streets has reduced traffic by 20 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by about 15 percent. In Stockholm, a road use fee was tested for six months in the face of much initial opposition. Then it was put to a voter referendum, and won. The system is back in place and it's working.
 Opponents tend to treat the tales of those two cities like mythology. But perhaps seeing will be believing. Commission members should hop aboard a regular double-decker bus in the heart of London; if Mr. Livingstone is correct, the bus should make schedule without problems, something that was almost unheard of in pre-congestion pricing London.
 Of course, New York will have to tailor a solution to its own particular needs. Mr. Bloomberg's plan would charge cars $8 and trucks $21 dollars to drive south of 86th Street in Manhattan on weekdays, minus any bridge and tunnel tolls. There are many issues and details to be ironed out. Residents in areas bordering the congestion zone are rightly worried about parking; residential permits may help. Just five percent of the people commuting to Manhattan's busiest streets actually drive. But if these drivers are to be coaxed from their cars, planners will need to ensure there is a convenient mass transit alternative.
 Time is limited. The City Council must pass a plan before the end of the year, and then legislators in Albany must reach a consensus before March 31 next year. The federal government has warned that its pledge of $354 million in assistance depends on achieving an approved plan that reduces traffic by 6 percent, as Mr. Bloomberg's proposal would.
 The commission needs to seize this moment to ensure the economic future and vitality of New York, as well as the quality of life for its residents and visitors. And Europe in the fall is wonderful.

HEADLINE: Inside the Countrywide Lending Spree

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ON its way to becoming the nation's largest mortgage lender, the Countrywide Financial Corporation encouraged its sales force to court customers over the telephone with a seductive pitch that seldom varied. ''I want to be sure you are getting the best loan possible,'' the sales representatives would say.
 But providing ''the best loan possible'' to customers wasn't always the bank's main goal, say some former employees. Instead, potential borrowers were often led to high-cost and sometimes unfavorable loans that resulted in richer commissions for Countrywide's smooth-talking sales force, outsize fees to company affiliates providing services on the loans, and a roaring stock price that made Countrywide executives among the highest paid in America.
 Countrywide's entire operation, from its computer system to its incentive pay structure and financing arrangements, is intended to wring maximum profits out of the mortgage lending boom no matter what it costs borrowers, according to interviews with former employees and brokers who worked in different units of the company and internal documents they provided. One document, for instance, shows that until last September the computer system in the company's subprime unit excluded borrowers' cash reserves, which had the effect of steering them away from lower-cost loans to those that were more expensive to homeowners and more profitable to Countrywide. 
 Now, with the entire mortgage business on tenterhooks and industry practices under scrutiny by securities regulators and banking industry overseers, Countrywide's money machine is sputtering. So far this year, fearful investors have cut its stock in half. About two weeks ago, the company was forced to draw down its entire $11.5 billion credit line from a consortium of banks because it could no longer sell or borrow against home loans it has made. And last week, Bank of America invested $2 billion for a 16 percent stake in Countrywide, a move that came amid speculation that Countrywide's survival was in question and that it had become a takeover target -- notions that Countrywide publicly disputed.
 Homeowners, meanwhile, drawn in by Countrywide sales scripts assuring ''the best loan possible,'' are behind on their mortgages in record numbers. As of June 30, almost one in four subprime loans that Countrywide services was delinquent, up from 15 percent in the same period last year, according to company filings. Almost 10 percent were delinquent by 90 days or more, compared with last year's rate of 5.35 percent. 
 Many of these loans had interest rates that recently reset from low teaser levels to double digits; others carry prohibitive prepayment penalties that have made refinancing impossibly expensive, even before this month's upheaval in the mortgage markets. 
 To be sure, Countrywide was not the only lender that sold questionable loans with enormous fees during the housing bubble. And as real estate prices soared, borrowers themselves proved all too eager to participate, even if it meant paying high costs or signing up for a loan with an interest rate that would jump in coming years.
 But few companies benefited more from the mortgage mania than Countrywide, among the most aggressive home lenders in the nation. As such, the company is Exhibit A for the lax and, until recently, highly lucrative lending that has turned a once-hot business ice cold and has touched off a housing crisis of historic proportions.
 ''In terms of being unresponsive to what was happening, to sticking it out the longest, and continuing to justify the garbage they were selling, Countrywide was the worst lender,'' said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. ''And anytime states tried to pass responsible lending laws, Countrywide was fighting it tooth and nail.'' 
 Started as Countrywide Credit Industries in New York 38 years ago by Angelo R. Mozilo, a butcher's son from the Bronx, and David Loeb, a founder of a mortgage banking firm in New York, who died in 2003, the company has become a $500 billion home loan machine with 62,000 employees, 900 offices and assets of $200 billion. Countrywide's stock price was up 561 percent over the 10 years ended last December.
 Mr. Mozilo has ridden this remarkable wave to immense riches, thanks to generous annual stock option grants. Rarely a buyer of Countrywide shares -- he has not bought a share since 1987, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings -- he has been a huge seller in recent years. Since the company listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 1984, he has reaped $406 million selling Countrywide stock.
 As the subprime mortgage debacle began to unfold this year, Mr. Mozilo's selling accelerated. Filings show that he made $129 million from stock sales during the last 12 months, or almost one-third of the entire amount he has reaped over the last 23 years. He still holds 1.4 million shares in Countrywide, a 0.24 percent stake that is worth $29.4 million. 
 ''Mr. Mozilo has stated publicly that his current plan recognizes his personal need to diversify some of his assets as he approaches retirement,'' said Rick Simon, a Countrywide spokesman. ''His personal wealth remains heavily weighted in Countrywide shares, and he is, by far, the leading individual shareholder in the company.'' 
 Mr. Simon said that Mr. Mozilo and other top Countrywide executives were not available for interviews. The spokesman declined to answer a list of questions, saying that he and his staff were too busy. 
 A former sales representative and several brokers interviewed for this article were granted anonymity because they feared retribution from Countrywide.
 AMONG Countrywide's operations are a bank, overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision; a broker-dealer that trades United States government securities and sells mortgage-backed securities; a mortgage servicing arm; a real estate closing services company; an insurance company; and three special-purpose vehicles that issue short-term commercial paper backed by Countrywide mortgages.
 Last year, Countrywide had revenue of $11.4 billion and pretax income of $4.3 billion. Mortgage banking contributed mightily in 2006, generating $2.06 billion before taxes. In the last 12 months, Countrywide financed almost $500 billion in loans, or around $41 billion a month. It financed 177,000 to 240,000 loans a month during the last 12 months.
 Countrywide lends to both prime borrowers -- those with sterling credit -- and so-called subprime, or riskier, borrowers. Among the $470 billion in loans that Countrywide made last year, 45 percent were conventional nonconforming loans, those that are too big to be sold to government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Home equity lines of credit given to prime borrowers accounted for 10.2 percent of the total, while subprime loans were 8.7 percent. 
 Regulatory filings show that, as of last year, 45 percent of Countrywide's loans carried adjustable rates -- the kind of loans that are set to reprice this fall and later, and which are causing so much anxiety among borrowers and investors alike. Countrywide has a huge presence in California: 46 percent of the loans it holds on its books were made there, and 28 percent of the loans it services are there. Countrywide packages most of its loans into securities pools that it sells to investors.
 Another big business for Countrywide is loan servicing, the collection of monthly principal and interest payments from borrowers and the disbursement of them to investors. Countrywide serviced 8.2 million loans as of the end of the year; in June the portfolio totaled $1.4 trillion. In addition to the enormous profits this business generates -- $660 million in 2006, or 25 percent of its overall earnings -- customers of the Countrywide servicing unit are a huge source of leads for its mortgage sales staff, say former employees.
 In a mid-March interview on CNBC, Mr. Mozilo said Countrywide was poised to benefit from the spreading crisis in the mortgage lending industry. ''This will be great for Countrywide,'' he said, ''because at the end of the day, all of the irrational competitors will be gone.'' 
 But Countrywide documents show that it, too, was a lax lender. For example, it wasn't until March 16 that Countrywide eliminated so-called piggyback loans from its product list, loans that permitted borrowers to buy a house without putting down any of their own money. And Countrywide waited until Feb. 23 to stop peddling another risky product, loans that were worth more than 95 percent of a home's appraised value and required no documentation of a borrower's income.
 As recently as July 27, Countrywide's product list showed that it would lend $500,000 to a borrower rated C-minus, the second-riskiest grade. As long as the loan represented no more than 70 percent of the underlying property's value, Countrywide would lend to a borrower even if the person had a credit score as low as 500. (The top score is 850.) 
 The company would lend even if the borrower had been 90 days late on a current mortgage payment twice in the last 12 months, if the borrower had filed for personal bankruptcy protection, or if the borrower had faced foreclosure or default notices on his or her property. 
 Such loans were made, former employees say, because they were so lucrative -- to Countrywide. The company harvested a steady stream of fees or payments on such loans and busily repackaged them as securities to sell to investors. As long as housing prices kept rising, everyone -- borrowers, lenders and investors -- appeared to be winners. 
 One former employee provided documents indicating Countrywide's minimum profit margins on subprime loans of different sizes. These ranged from 5 percent on small loans of $100,000 to $200,000 to 3 percent on loans of $350,000 to $500,000. But on subprime loans that imposed heavy burdens on borrowers, like high prepayment penalties that persisted for three years, Countrywide's margins could reach 15 percent of the loan, the former employee said.
 Regulatory filings show how much more profitable subprime loans are for Countrywide than higher-quality prime loans. Last year, for example, the profit margins Countrywide generated on subprime loans that it sold to investors were 1.84 percent, versus 1.07 percent on prime loans. A year earlier, when the subprime machine was really cranking, sales of these mortgages produced profits of 2 percent, versus 0.82 percent from prime mortgages. And in 2004, subprime loans produced gains of 3.64 percent, versus 0.93 percent for prime loans.
 One reason these loans were so lucrative for Countrywide is that investors who bought securities backed by the mortgages were willing to pay more for loans with prepayment penalties and those whose interest rates were going to reset at higher levels. Investors ponied up because pools of subprime loans were likely to generate a larger cash flow than prime loans that carried lower fixed rates. 
 As a result, former employees said, the company's commission structure rewarded sales representatives for making risky, high-cost loans. For example, according to another mortgage sales representative affiliated with Countrywide, adding a three-year prepayment penalty to a loan would generate an extra 1 percent of the loan's value in a commission. While mortgage brokers' commissions would vary on loans that reset after a short period with a low teaser rate, the higher the rate at reset, the greater the commission earned, these people said.
 Persuading someone to add a home equity line of credit to a loan carried extra commissions of 0.25 percent, according to a former sales representative.
 ''The whole commission structure in both prime and subprime was designed to reward salespeople for pushing whatever programs Countrywide made the most money on in the secondary market,'' the former sales representative said. 
 CONSIDER an example provided by a former mortgage broker. Say that a borrower was persuaded to take on a $1 million adjustable-rate loan that required the person to pay only a tiny fraction of the real interest rate and no principal during the first year -- a loan known in the trade as a pay option adjustable-rate mortgage. If the loan carried a three-year prepayment penalty requiring the borrower to pay six months' worth of interest at the much higher reset rate of 3 percentage points over the prevailing market rate, Countrywide would pay the broker a $30,000 commission. 
 When borrowers tried to reduce their mortgage debt, Countrywide cashed in: prepayment penalties generated significant revenue for the company -- $268 million last year, up from $212 million in 2005. When borrowers had difficulty making payments, Countrywide cashed in again: late charges produced even more in 2006 -- some $285 million.
 The company's incentive system also encouraged brokers and sales representatives to move borrowers into the subprime category, even if their financial position meant that they belonged higher up the loan spectrum. Brokers who peddled subprime loans received commissions of 0.50 percent of the loan's value, versus 0.20 percent on loans one step up the quality ladder, known as Alternate-A, former brokers said. For years, a software system in Countrywide's subprime unit that sales representatives used to calculate the loan type that a borrower qualified for did not allow the input of a borrower's cash reserves, a former employee said. 
 A borrower who has more assets poses less risk to a lender, and will typically get a better rate on a loan as a result. But, this sales representative said, Countrywide's software prevented the input of cash reserves so borrowers would have to be pitched on pricier loans. It was not until last September that the company changed this practice, as part of what was called in an internal memo the ''Do the Right Thing'' campaign.
 According to the former sales representative, Countrywide's big subprime unit also avoided offering borrowers Federal Housing Administration loans, which are backed by the United States government and are less risky. But these loans, well suited to low-income or first-time home buyers, do not generate the high fees that Countrywide encouraged its sales force to pursue.
 A few weeks ago, the former sales representative priced a $275,000 loan with a 30-year term and a fixed rate for a borrower putting down 10 percent, with fully documented income, and a credit score of 620. While a F.H.A. loan on the same terms would have carried a 7 percent rate and 0.125 percentage points, Countrywide's subprime loan for the same borrower carried a rate of 9.875 percent and three additional percentage points. 
 The monthly payment on the F.H.A. loan would have been $1,829, while Countrywide's subprime loan generated a $2,387 monthly payment. That amounts to a difference of $558 a month, or $6,696 a year -- no small sum for a low-income homeowner.
 ''F.H.A. loans are the best source of financing for low-income borrowers,'' the former sales representative said. So Countrywide's subprime lending program ''is not living up to the promise of providing the best loan programs to its clients,'' he said.
 Mr. Simon of Countrywide said that Federal Housing Administration loans were becoming a bigger part of the company's business. 
 ''While they are very useful to some borrowers, F.H.A./V.A. mortgages are extremely difficult to originate in markets with above-average home prices, because the maximum loan amount is so low,'' he said. ''Countrywide believes F.H.A./V.A. loans are an increasingly important part of its product menu, particularly for the homeownership hopes of low-to moderate-income and minority borrowers we have concentrated on reaching and serving.'' 
 WORKDAYS at Countrywide's mortgage lending units centered on an intense telemarketing effort, former employees said. It involved chasing down sales leads and hewing to carefully prepared scripts during telephone calls with prospects. 
 One marketing manual used in Countrywide's subprime unit during 2005, for example, walks sales representatives through the steps of a successful call. ''Step 3, Borrower Information, is where the Account Executive gets on the Oasis of Rapport,'' the manual states. ''The Oasis of Rapport is the time spent with the client building rapport and gathering information. At this point in the sales cycle, rates, points, and fees are not discussed. The immediate objective is for the Account Executive to get to know the client and look for points of common interest. Use first names with clients as it facilitates a friendly, helpful tone.'' 
 If clients proved to be uninterested, the script provided ways for sales representatives to be more persuasive. Account executives encountering prospective customers who said their mortgage had been paid off, for instance, were advised to ask about a home equity loan. ''Don't you want the equity in your home to work for you?'' the script said. ''You can use your equity for your advantage and pay bills or get cash out. How does that sound?'' 
 Other documents from the subprime unit also show that Countrywide was willing to underwrite loans that left little disposable income for borrowers' food, clothing and other living expenses. A different manual states that loans could be written for borrowers even if, in a family of four, they had just $1,000 in disposable income after paying their mortgage bill. A loan to a single borrower could be made even if the person had just $550 left each month to live on, the manual said. 
 Independent brokers who have worked with Countrywide also say the company does not provide records of their compensation to the Internal Revenue Service on a Form 1099, as the law requires. These brokers say that all other home lenders they have worked with submitted 1099s disclosing income earned from their associations. 
 One broker who worked with Countrywide for seven years said she never got a 1099. 
 ''When I got ready to do my first year's taxes I had received 1099s from everybody but Countrywide,'' she said. ''I called my rep and he said, 'We're too big. There's too many. We don't do it.' ''
 A different broker supplied an e-mail message from a Countrywide official stating that it was not company practice to submit 1099s. It is unclear why Countrywide apparently chooses not to provide the documents. Countrywide boasts that it is the No. 1 lender to minorities, providing those borrowers with their piece of the American homeownership dream. But it has run into problems with state regulators in New York, who contended that the company overcharged such borrowers for loans. Last December, Countrywide struck an agreement with Eliot Spitzer, then the state attorney general, to compensate black and Latino borrowers to whom it had improperly given high-cost loans in 2004. Under the agreement, Countrywide, which cooperated with the attorney general, agreed to improve its fair-lending monitoring activities and set up a $3 million consumer education program.
 But few borrowers of any sort, even the most creditworthy, appear to escape Countrywide's fee machine. When borrowers close on their loans, they pay fees for flood and tax certifications, appraisals, document preparation, even charges associated with e-mailing documents or using FedEx to send or receive paperwork, according to Countrywide documents. It's a big business: During the last 12 months, Countrywide did 3.5 million flood certifications, conducted 10.8 million credit checks and 1.3 million appraisals, its filings show. Many of the fees go to its loan closing services subsidiary, LandSafe Inc. 
 According to dozens of loan documents, LandSafe routinely charges tax service fees of $60, far above what other lenders charge, for information about any outstanding tax obligations of the borrowers. Credit checks can cost $36 at LandSafe, double what others levy. Some Countrywide loans even included fees of $100 to e-mail documents or $45 to ship them overnight. LandSafe also charges borrowers $26 for flood certifications, for which other companies typically charge $12 to $14, according to sales representatives and brokers familiar with the fees.
 LAST April, Countrywide customers in Los Angeles filed suit against the company in California state court, contending that it overcharged borrowers by collecting unearned fees in relation to tax service fees and flood certification charges. These markups were not disclosed to borrowers, the lawsuit said. 
 Appraisals are another profit center for Countrywide, brokers said, because it often requires more than one appraisal on properties, especially if borrowers initially choose not to use the company's own internal firm. Appraisal fees at Countrywide totaled $137 million in 2006, up from $110 million in the previous year. Credit report fees were $74 million last year, down slightly from 2005.
 All of those fees may soon be part of what Countrywide comes to consider the good old days. The mortgage market has cooled, and so have the company's fortunes. Mr. Mozilo remains undaunted, however.
 In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, he conceded that Countrywide's balance sheet had to be strengthened. ''But at the end of the day we could be doing very substantial volumes for high-quality loans,'' he said, ''because there is nobody else in town.''

HEADLINE: How Congestion Pricing Could Play Out

 BODY:
COMMUTING to Manhattan by car has long meant enduring mind-numbing traffic and paying more and more for tolls, parking and gas. So in April, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed charging cars $8 to enter Manhattan below 86th Street on weekdays, suburban drivers had reason to groan yet again.
 But the plan, which is likely to be revised during negotiations with lawmakers in Albany next year, may turn out to be a net benefit for commuters who drive into Manhattan or take mass transit. That's because the city's plan appears focused on reducing the number of cars that come into the city and on raising billions of dollars to improve mass transit in the region. 
 In fact, drivers who live in the outer boroughs of New York and use the free East River bridges -- the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg and Queensboro -- to commute into Manhattan may be hit with the biggest burden, because congestion pricing fees will amount to a de facto toll.
 ''The impact on people in the suburbs will be very modest,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. ''We don't want to have toll shopping, which produces a surprising amount of congestion,'' he added, referring to drivers who go out of their way to take free bridges and clog local streets in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan.
 By contrast, drivers from the suburbs will be able to deduct tolls from their $8 fee, shrinking it by as much as $6 for those who use the Hudson River crossings -- the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge. Transportation analysts say, however, that even though the additional $2 can certainly add up, it will not be enough to persuade drivers to abandon their cars en masse.
 Transportation officials are also confident that the number of drivers who switch to mass transit will be minimal because most commuters coming into Manhattan from Long Island, Westchester and Connecticut already take public transportation. According to a survey by Metro-North Railroad, 89 percent of Manhattan-bound commuters who live along the Hudson Line north of Croton-Harmon take the train, and for commuters who live along the Harlem Line, 81 percent take the train. On Long Island, close to 90 percent of those who commute into the city use the railroad.
 If the Long Island Rail Road adds a third track between Floral Park and Hicksville, as it plans, there will also be more trains to carry city residents to jobs on Long Island during the morning rush hours, distributing traffic more evenly.
 Even those who continue to drive into Manhattan once the plan is in place will benefit if it does what it is supposed to do -- reduce traffic by 6.3 percent in the zone.
 At the same time, some of the $380 million the city expects to raise in the first year of congestion pricing will go to improving mass transit, including building express bus lanes and paying for new train tunnels under the East and Hudson Rivers that will increase capacity on the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit.
 ''If we assume that congestion pricing works, it tells the rest of the region to look at their development needs,'' said Robert E. Paaswell, the executive director of the University Transportation Research Center at the City College of New York.
 Still, the money generated from congestion pricing will take years to collect and spend. In the meantime, suburban commuters face crippling traffic jams, overcrowded trains and buses and a shortage of parking spaces at train stations. So any new riders might be getting on trains and buses that are already running at capacity.
 ''We have a crowding problem, and we can't expect to handle an increase in ridership because we're not adding more trains until 2009 or 2010,'' said Jim Cameron, the chairman of the Connecticut Metro-North New Haven Rail Commuter Council.
 Mr. Cameron said that 15 percent of Metro-North trains are out of service every day, and Connecticut residents must wait an average of four years to get reserved parking spots at stations on the New Haven Line. There are similarly chronic shortages in New Jersey, Westchester and Long Island. At the Princeton Junction station in West Windsor, N.J., for instance, there are 3,560 spots to accommodate 7,080 daily riders. 
 Federal transportation officials this month promised to chip in $354 million to improve mass transit in the New York area if the city meets certain criteria. But most of the money is earmarked for projects within the five boroughs, including $214 million for bus depots in Queens and Staten Island. Far less is dedicated to solving transportation bottlenecks in the suburbs. 
 That means commuters will have to wait for existing projects to be completed. For instance, New Jersey Transit and other agencies are building a second rail tunnel under the Hudson to double the number of trains --New Jersey Transit's own and Amtrak's -- into Penn Station. The $7.5 billion tunnel is not expected to be opened until 2016. 
 Before then, the city's congestion pricing plan -- which, pending approval in Albany, is expected to go into effect on a trial basis by March 2009 -- will add 28,000 trips a day on New Jersey Transit buses, trains and light-rail cars, according to forecasts by the state's Department of Transportation. ''The bus service is already at capacity, so to add 50 or 60 more buses would be difficult,'' said Kris Kolluri, New Jersey's transportation commissioner. ''To accommodate this surge in ridership could be a challenge.''
 New Jersey Transit and the state's Department of Transportation have added nearly 15,000 parking spots at train, bus and light-rail stations since 2002 and expect to build an additional 3,700 in the next three years to keep up with ridership, which has hit records the past several years. 
 Mr. Kolluri and transportation officials elsewhere say that more spaces could be added, but that many towns are unwilling to accept them because they fear an increase in traffic -- the same problem that has led Mr. Bloomberg to pursue congestion pricing so vigorously.

HEADLINE: Inside a Jumble of Poverty, Texas Families Build a Future

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
RIO GRANDE, Tex. -- Along muddy roads invisible from the highway, some families crowd into battered trailers patched with plywood. Others jam into self-constructed dwellings that seem designed by Dr. Seuss -- wood and tarpaper shacks attached to half-finished concrete-block rooms, wires and hoses snaking in. 
 The counties of South Texas are among the nation's poorest, and their jumbled subdivisions, known as colonias, home to 400,000 Hispanic-Americans, can certainly look the part. Since the 1950s, developers have carved small lots from mesquite woodlands and floodplains, selling them to workers with the promises that utilities, sewers and paved roads would follow. They rarely did, and for decades the colonias were seen as hopeless slums. 
 But now a different picture is emerging. After years of protests by residents, belated regulation by the state, and an influx of aid from government and private groups, more than two-thirds of the colonia dwellers in six border counties finally have access to water lines, safe sewage disposal or both, compared with a small minority just 15 years ago, according to a report by the state in December. 
 Through frugality and hard work, in a process known as incremental building that is rare in the United States but common in the Third World, families are transforming hovels into homes, one wall and window at a time.
 While the jerry-built shacks may look crude, they are often the works in progress of determined parents willing to spend decades to create a heart for their extended families. Many start with used trailers and upgrade as their finances improve. Their determination perhaps explains why the colonias, despite infrastructure gaps and lack of amenities like parks and street lights, are not suffused with the bleak resignation evident in the most blighted urban centers or parts of the deep south. 
 Delfino and Martina Martinez bought their lot three years ago on Las Lomas colonia near here for $19,800, paying 18 percent annual interest to the seller. They and their three children crammed into a battered ''Holiday Rambler'' trailer. As the family struggled along on his construction jobs and food stamps, Mr. Martinez, 49, built two concrete bedrooms. Next will come a kitchen, living room and bathroom. 
 ''People see the colonias as a bunch of run-down places where all these Hispanics live in squalor,'' Jorge Vanegas, director of the Center for Housing and Urban Development at Texas A&M University, said. But they are abuzz with ambition, and with recent government aid, he said, ''we've seen progress on many fronts,'' although new, underserved colonias ''keep popping up in new areas.'' 
 Belying another stereotype, a large majority of residents are long-term, legal residents or citizens, data show. Original buyers were often migrant workers, but now more residents work at minimum-wage retail jobs, in construction or in housecleaning. 
 As the infrastructure of the colonias (pronounced coe-LONE-yas) improves, however, the soaring price of land makes quality housing harder for workers to afford. 
 The Martinez family, with an annual income of about $15,000, worries about its $200 monthly payments to the seller. The family paid $700 last year for a septic tank -- before that, they went to a relative's house to use the bathroom -- and several hundreds more for water and electrical hookups. To put a roof on their new bedrooms, they obtained a $2,500, two-year loan from the Community Resource Group, a nonprofit organization based in Arkansas that has helped thousands of colonia residents secure proper deeds and now offers small home-improvement loans. 
 On a recent evening, as a dozen chickens roamed, a fat pig grunted and the radio played lively Mexican music, Mr. Martinez was digging up the hard ground behind the bedrooms with pick and shovel, getting dirt fill for the slope where he will build the new rooms. 
 ''We have faith our life will be better,'' Mr. Martinez said, ''as long as our health is O.K.''
 The history of the colonias is filled with broken promises to buyers and contracts that left many vulnerable to losing everything when they missed payments. Titles were not handed over until land was paid for, and sometimes deeds were not officially recorded. 
 But protests by residents and groups like the United Farm Workers of America, as well as rising Hispanic political power, drew state attention. Since 1989, laws have tightened development standards. The state appointed ombudsmen to ensure that buyers got the required services.
 In 1995, the Texas Legislature required developers of new colonias to install electricity, water lines and sewage pipes or septic tanks. 
 Federal and state grants have also helped bring utilities and paved streets to older colonias, though the task is far from complete. The 2006 state analysis of six counties found that the continuing lack of infrastructure and proper drainage in 442 colonias with 62,675 residents ''exposes the population and surrounding communities to increased threats of infectious diseases and public health hazards.'' 
 Some early residents used colonia homes as a springboard to moving on, but many have shown determination to sink roots in this region, where lax zoning standards permit them to live in houses as they build them. The results are not always pretty or safe, but for many, they offer a chance they could not pursue elsewhere.
 ''In our culture, once you have property, you belong, and even if it's a shack, you stay,'' said Blanca Suarez, the Starr County ombudswoman for the state's Colonia Initiatives Program. 
 Despite their hard work, most residents remain poor, with longstanding problems like low high school graduation rates. Nearly all the children are covered by Medicaid, but Texas provides little health coverage to adults. 
 Elia Estrada, 35, is suffering the consequences. Ms. Estrada, her husband, a construction worker, and their three children have been living in a one-bedroom structure while she and several relatives help finish a house at Proyecto Azteca in San Juan, Hidalgo County. Families put in 550 hours of ''sweat equity,'' and then they can buy one of the 800-square-foot, three-bedroom homes for $30,000 on a 20-year no-interest mortgage. The houses are attractive and meet all codes. 
 ''We'll have our own bedrooms,'' she enthused, taking a break from painting windows.
 ''But I'm sick a lot these days,'' she added. She found a doctor who would see her for just $35 and discovered she has high blood pressure and diabetes. But she cannot afford treatment. 
 The oldest colonias tend to have the nicest houses, in part because families bought plots for $500 and have had decades to complete construction. In newer settlements like the eight-year-old Abraham colonia, also in Hidalgo County, empty lots now cost upwards of $20,000 and many residents are still at the early stages of making a house. 
 Alma Avila, 33, her husband and four children live in a yellow trailer in Abraham with missing window panes that they cover with plywood. The satellite dish is, she said with a laugh, ''just for decoration.''
 But Ms. Avila and her husband are taking the long view. They bought their plot five years ago for $14,000, on a 15-year loan.
 ''Once we finish paying for the lot, we'll have money to start thinking about a house,'' she said. ''I hope this trailer will last 10 more years.'' 
 Ms. Avila has already planted saplings and flowers. 
 ''I want to live here forever,'' she said. ''Someday I can sit under those trees.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about a program in South Texas that helps families gradually rebuild shacks into homes misstated the surname of the Starr County ombudswoman who oversees the state's Colonia Initiatives Program. She is Blanca Juarez, not Suarez. Also, the article carried an incorrect dateline, and a picture caption repeated the error. The article and photograph were from Rio Grande City; there is no town named Rio Grande.

HEADLINE: Schools Scramble for Teachers Because of Spreading Turnover

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: GREENSBORO, N.C. 

 BODY:
The retirement of thousands of baby boomer teachers coupled with the departure of younger teachers frustrated by the stress of working in low-performing schools is fueling a crisis in teacher turnover that is costing school districts substantial amounts of money as they scramble to fill their ranks for the fall term.
 Superintendents and recruiters across the nation say the challenge of putting a qualified teacher in every classroom is heightened in subjects like math and science and is a particular struggle in high-poverty schools, where the turnover is highest. Thousands of classes in such schools have opened with substitute teachers in recent years.
 Here in Guilford County, N.C., turnover had become so severe in some high-poverty schools that principals were hiring new teachers for nearly every class, every term. To staff its neediest schools before classes start on Aug. 28, recruiters have been advertising nationwide, organizing teacher fairs and offering one of the nation's largest recruitment bonuses, $10,000 to instructors who sign up to teach Algebra I. 
 ''We had schools where we didn't have a single certified math teacher,'' said Terry Grier, the schools superintendent. ''We needed an incentive, because we couldn't convince teachers to go to these schools without one.''
 Guilford County, which has 116 schools, is far from the only district to take this route as school systems compete to fill their ranks. Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality, a nonprofit policy group that seeks to encourage better teaching, said hundreds of districts were offering recruitment incentives this summer. 
 Officials in New York, which has the nation's largest school system, said they had recruited about 5,000 new teachers by mid-August, attracting those certified in math, science and special education with a housing incentive that can include $5,000 for a down payment. 
 New York also offers subsidies through its teaching fellows program, which recruits midcareer professionals from fields like health care, law and finance. The money helps defer the cost of study for a master's degree. The city expects to hire at least 1,300 additional teachers before school begins on Sept. 4, said Vicki Bernstein, director of teacher recruitment.
 Los Angeles has offered teachers signing with low-performing schools a $5,000 bonus. The district, the second-largest in the country, had hired only about 500 of the 2,500 teachers it needed by Aug. 15 but hoped to begin classes fully staffed, said Deborah Ignagni, chief of teacher recruitment.
 In Kansas, Alexa Posny, the state's education commissioner, said the schools had been working to fill ''the largest number of vacancies'' the state had ever faced. This is partly because of baby boomer retirements and partly because districts in Texas and elsewhere were offering recruitment bonuses and housing allowances, luring Kansas teachers away.
 ''This is an acute problem that is becoming a crisis,'' Ms. Posny said.
 In June, the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, a nonprofit group that seeks to increase the retention of quality teachers, estimated from a survey of several districts that teacher turnover was costing the nation's districts some $7 billion annually for recruiting, hiring and training.
 Demographers agree that education is one of the fields hardest hit by the departure of hundreds of thousands of baby boomers from the work force, particularly because a slowdown in hiring in the 1980s and 1990s raised the average age of the teaching profession. Still, they debate how serious the attrition will turn out to be. 
 In New York, the wave of such retirements crested in the early years of this decade as teachers left well before they hit their 60s, without a disruptive teacher shortage, Ms. Bernstein said. 
 In other parts of the country, the retirement bulge is still approaching, because pension policies vary among states, said Michael Podgursky, an economist at the University of Missouri. California is projecting that it will need 100,000 new teachers over the next decade from the retirement of the baby boomers alone.
 Some educators say it is the confluence of such retirements with the departure of disillusioned young teachers that is creating the challenge. In addition, higher salaries in the business world and more opportunities for women are drawing away from the field recruits who might in another era have proved to be talented teachers with strong academic backgrounds.
 ''The problem is not mainly with retirement,'' said Thomas G. Carroll, the president of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future. ''Our teacher preparation system can accommodate the retirement rate. The problem is that our schools are like a bucket with holes in the bottom, and we keep pouring in teachers.'' 
 The commission has calculated that these days nearly a third of all new teachers leave the profession after just three years, and that after five years almost half are gone -- a higher turnover rate than in the past.
 All the coming and going of young teachers is tremendously disruptive, especially to schools in poor neighborhoods where teacher turnover is highest and students' needs are greatest. 
 According to the most recent Department of Education statistics available, about 269,000 of the nation's 3.2 million public school teachers, or 8.4 percent, quit the field in the 2003-4 school year. Thirty percent of them retired, and 56 percent said they left to pursue another career or because they were dissatisfied. 
 The federal No Child Left Behind law requires schools and districts to put a qualified teacher in every classroom. The law has led districts to focus more seriously on staffing its low-performing schools, educators said, but it does not appear to have helped persuade veteran teachers to continue their service in them. 
 Tim Daly, president of the New Teacher Project, a group that helps urban districts recruit teachers, said attrition often resulted from chaotic hiring practices, because novice teachers are often assigned at the last moment to positions for which they have not even interviewed. Later, overwhelmed by classroom stress, many leave the field.
 Chicago and New York are districts that have invested heavily and worked with teachers unions in recent years to improve hiring and transfer policies, Mr. Daly said.
 ''But most of the urban districts have no coherent hiring strategy,'' he said. Many receive thousands of teacher applications in the spring but leave them unprocessed until principals return from August vacations, when more organized suburban districts have already hired the most-qualified teachers, he said.
 ''There isn't any maliciousness in this,'' Mr. Daly said, ''it's just a conspiracy of dysfunction.'' 
 In Guilford County, Washington Elementary School, which serves students from a housing project, had churned through several principals and most of its teachers several years ago, and had repeatedly failed to make federal testing goals, said Dr. Grier, the superintendent. 
 ''Teachers were worried it was becoming a failing school,'' Dr. Grier said. To rebuild morale, he recruited a principal from Chicago, Grenita Lathan. Her first year at Washington was a nightmare, Ms. Lathan said, because her predecessors had been so panicked to fill classroom vacancies that they had hired ''just anybody.''
 ''All they wanted was warm bodies in the classroom,'' she said. At job fairs, qualified teachers she tried to hire shunned her, she said.
 Under Guilford County's incentive program, math or reading teachers who sign on at any of 29 high-poverty schools receive bonuses of $2,500 to $10,000. They can earn additional bonuses if they raise achievement.
 Those incentives helped Ms. Lathan recruit solid teachers last year, she said, and after much tutoring and hard work, students met federal testing targets. This summer all but one teacher signed up for another year.
 Other Guilford County schools have also used the incentives to hire promising people.
 Rebecca Rheinheimer moved from Indiana this summer, attracted by a $2,500 bonus to teach at Oak Hill Elementary, where the teaching staff has been strengthened by the use of such bonuses. The school, in High Point, met its federal testing targets this spring for the first time in several years.
 Margaret Eaddy-Busch, a veteran math teacher, moved from Philadelphia this summer to teach at Dudley High, which had become known as a hard-to-staff school. She will receive a $10,000 bonus for teaching Algebra I. 
 ''If I survived in Philly for 10 years,'' Ms. Eaddy-Busch said, ''I'll do just fine here.'' 
 But it remains unclear whether the incentive program will retain good teachers as effectively as it attracts them. 
 ''It's challenging to teach in these high-needs schools,'' said Mark Jewell, president of the local teachers union. ''These new teachers will have a trial by fire, and then it'll be a revolving door.''

HEADLINE: Mexico's Plutocracy Thrives on Robber-Baron Concessions

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Growing up in Mexico City, I always knew Mexico was an unjust country -- a place where small coteries of the privileged control all power and wealth while half the population lives in poverty. But it never occurred to me that Mexico would have billionaires.
 It does. According to Forbes magazine, last year there were 10 Mexicans among the world's 946 billionaires. 
 That might not seem out of line in a country with 100 million-plus people, which accounts for about 1.6 percent of the global economy. But here's what takes the cake, especially if you're Mexican like me. Earlier this month, Fortune reported that Carlos Slim Helu, a Mexican, had just surpassed Bill Gates to become the world's richest man, with a fortune worth $59 billion.
 To put it in perspective, Mr. Slim's treasure is equivalent to slightly less than 7 percent of Mexico's total production of goods and services -- one out of every 14 dollars' worth of stuff made by all the people in the country. 
 The income distribution in the United States may be fast approaching Mexican levels of inequality, but in relative terms, Mr. Gates isn't even in Mr. Slim's league. His $58 billion fortune is less than 0.5 percent of the nation's G.D.P.
 Indeed, by this measure, Mr. Slim is richer even than the robber barons of the gilded age. John D. Rockefeller, America's richest man, was worth the equivalent of about 1.5 percent of the nation's G.D.P. 
 It takes about nine of the captains of industry and finance of the 19th and early 20th centuries -- Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt, John J. Astor, Andrew Carnegie, Alexander Stewart, Frederick Weyerhaeuser, Jay Gould and Marshall Field -- to replicate the footprint that Mr. Slim has left on Mexico.
 But the momentous scale is not the most galling aspect of Mr. Slim's riches. There's the issue of theft.
 Like many a robber baron -- or Russian oligarch, or Enron executive -- Mr. Slim calls to mind the words of Honore de Balzac: ''Behind every great fortune there is a crime.'' Mr. Slim's sin, if not technically criminal, is like that of Rockefeller, the sin of the monopolist.
 In 1990, the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sold his friend Mr. Slim the Mexican national phone company, Telmex, along with a de facto commitment to maintain its monopoly for years. Then it awarded Telmex the only nationwide cellphone license. 
 When competitors were eventually allowed in, Telmex kept them at bay with some rather creative gambits, like getting a judge to issue an arrest warrant for the top lawyer of a competitor. Today, it still has a 90 percent share of Mexico's landline phone service and controls almost three-quarters of the cellphone market.
 Monopolies tend to generate a ton of money. Mr. Slim, a shrewd investor, deployed it well -- buying up hundreds of Mexican companies and entering wireless markets across Latin America. It's hard for a Mexican to spend a day without handing him some money.
 But Mexico has paid, dearly. In 2005, there were fewer than 20 fixed telephone lines for every 100 Mexicans, and less than half had cellphones. Just 9 percent of households had Internet access. Mexicans pay way above average for all these services. 
 Mr. Slim's style of wealth accumulation is not rare in modern Mexico. From television to tortillas, vast swaths of the Mexican economy are controlled by monopolies or oligopolies. Many of Mexico's billionaires were created by the government during the privatization of state-owned companies in the 1990s. 
 That is what is most difficult to swallow for a Mexican. The United States government split up Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. A court imposed a consent decree on Mr. Gates's Microsoft to curtail its monopoly practices. In Mexico, Mr. Slim's monopoly is understood to be the natural order of things. Ask former President Vicente Fox, who appointed a former Telmex executive as minister of communications in 2000. 
 The United States today is heading toward a Mexican-style social contract. The concentration of 44 percent of the nation's income among the top 10 percent of taxpayers is on a par with Mexico's disparities. It's getting hard to find government officials in Washington without deep ties to corporate interests.
 But perhaps the United States and its moguls can still provide a positive example for Mexico's coddled titans. Mr. Gates is giving his fortune away to tackle diseases in Africa and help poor Americans graduate from high school. (He has given more than $30 billion to his foundation.)
 Earlier this year, Mr. Slim said he would increase the donations to his companies' foundations to $10 billion from $4 billion. He has another $20 billion to go to catch Mr. Gates.

HEADLINE: Iraqi Prime Minister Says 2 U.S. Senators Need to 'Start Making Sense Again'

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki on Sunday extended his tongue-lashing of foreign politicians who have questioned his government, saying that Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Carl Levin needed to ''start making sense again'' after the senators, both Democrats, called for his ouster.
 Mr. Maliki, who previously reacted with anger to President Bush's criticism of the Iraqi government's lack of political progress, also lashed out at the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, who called for Mr. Maliki to be replaced in an interview that appeared on the Newsweek Web site on Sunday. 
 But Mr. Maliki appeared to reach a new level of stridency with his reply to Senator Clinton, of New York, and Senator Levin, of Michigan. In remarks in a news briefing that referred to the senators by name, Mr. Maliki said they had spoken ''as if Iraq is one of their cities.''
 ''Iraq is a sovereign country, and we will not allow anyone to talk about it as if it belongs to this country or that,'' Mr. Maliki said. He added a phrase that could be translated as indicating that the senators ought to make sense again or should return to a logical path.
 Later in the day, Mr. Maliki appeared to have calmed down as he went through a series of meetings and participated in a joint statement of broad political unity by two major Kurdish parties, two Shiite parties, including his Dawa Party, and a bloc led by Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni.
 The White House, eager for signs of progress, welcomed the agreement. A spokeswoman, Emily A. Lawrimore, said the leaders' decision was ''an important symbol of their commitment to work together for the benefit of all Iraqis.''
 In advance of a report on progress in Iraq by the United States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker, and the American commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the statement appeared tailored to show that steps toward political unity had been taken. 
 The report by Mr. Crocker and General Petraeus is widely expected to point to some advances on security and the economy, partly as a result of an American troop increase. But the fractious government has made little progress in crucial areas like laws regulating the development of Iraq's oil resources and governing the sharing of oil revenues.
 But Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih, a Kurd, who was at the multiparty talks, said that he thought the participants had negotiated the statement in good faith.
 ''I hope that this agreement offers us an opportunity to move beyond the political crisis that has afflicted the country,'' Mr. Salih said. ''I would consider this an important step forward, but we have to admit that we have more work to do.''
 Mr. Crocker was at the meeting of officials pushing along an agreement, Mr. Salih said.
 In his earlier news briefing, Mr. Maliki also gave very qualified support to another initiative he has been pressed to accept: bringing former members of the Baath Party of Saddam Hussein back into the government.
 ''The doors are open for all the politicians who don't call for violence and the use of weapons against the government,'' Mr. Maliki said.
 ''But some people want to bring back the old regime,'' he added. ''They want to bring back the time when the minority governed the majority. This time is past, and no one can do anything outside the political process.''
 Still, despite the promising signs on Sunday, Iraq's political process remains all but completely stalled. And Mr. Maliki's government has been gravely weakened by major defections in the past few weeks. In the most recent, the secular political alliance Iraqiya, led by former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, withdrew from the government on Friday.
 In an interview on Sunday on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' Mr. Allawi said his alliance had ''lost our faith in the capability of the current government of salvaging the country and moving forward.''
 ''I don't see that we are getting closer to reconciliation,'' he said. ''I don't see that we are getting closer to getting rid of militias. I am not seeing that we are getting closer to having assertive policies, foreign policies, which would not allow Iran to intervene in Iraqi affairs.''

HEADLINE: A Solution Seen To 'Brain Drain'

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
A new academic study details the benefits and the threat of a ''reverse brain drain'' -- skilled foreign workers going back to their home countries because they cannot get visas in the United States. One of the study's authors has a solution that is not in step with the high-tech lobby. He advocates getting rid of the H-1B visa, the temporary work permit for skilled workers. 
 Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow at the Harvard Law School and executive in residence at Duke, said last week that the H-1B program is ''wonderful for technology companies and employers. They have a captive audience.''
The H-1B, he said, allows the sponsoring company to control employees, and often underpay them, as critics of the visa program contend.
 Instead, Mr. Wadhwa said the United States should simply grant skilled immigrant workers permanent residence visas, so-called green cards. The new report says that more than one million skilled workers -- scientists, engineers, doctors and researchers -- are competing for 120,000 permanent residence visas each year. 
 The surging backlog, the study adds, results in skilled workers returning to their home countries.
 The report, published last week, was conducted by researchers at Harvard, Duke and New York University. 
 ''If these people stay, we win,'' Mr. Wadhwa said. ''If they work with our brightest people and learn American ways and go back, we have a big problem. The risk is they leave and compete with us.''

HEADLINE: Forty Years of Growth, Except Where It Was Expected

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Sometime in the 1950s, Amelia Delgado planted a sapling outside her Lower East Side tenement at 145 Clinton Street, where she and her husband, Ramon, were raising five children. The children are grown, have done well and now have children of their own. Her husband died 14 years ago. 
 Her tree still stands, tall as a building, even if the building has long been gone.
 It was torn down, along with dozens of other rickety tenements, in 1967, after the city gave the Delgados and nearly 2,000 of their neighbors in a 14-block area 90 days to pack up and be relocated in the name of urban renewal. 
 Today, Mrs. Delgado, 78, lives in a tidy subsidized apartment on Grand Street, which she shares with two perky dogs and a free-flying pair of parakeets, both named Baby. From her living room window, she can still see her tree. She can also see the lot where she and her family once lived, which is now home only to a motley assortment of parked cars.
 ''Forty years without doing anything,'' she said. ''We had to move and everything was knocked down. Why? So the rich can move there now?''
 Emptiness has been the one constant for the five remaining city-owned parcels in the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area along Delancey Street, near the Williamsburg Bridge. At a time when the city has few lots to build housing for low- and moderate-income tenants, the five undeveloped parcels are an incongruous sight, especially since officials and advocates considered them the biggest patch of vacant city land in Manhattan.
 In the last few months, a local group, the Seward Park Area Redevelopment Coalition, has begun a campaign to get officials to support housing on the empty lots, though history and politics have not been on their side.
 Attempts over the years to do anything with those lots have failed. On one side are housing advocates who want to preserve housing for residents of modest means as the area goes upscale with nightspots, high-rises and renovated tenements. Their efforts have been rebuffed by residents of the nearby co-op complexes -- built by labor unions for their members decades ago, but in more recent years home to young professionals paying higher prices -- who want to protect their investment with development that is mostly, though not exclusively, market rate.
 ''It's a terrific location,'' said Jerilyn Perine, who was commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development when the most recent proposal for residential and commercial construction failed in 2003. ''But what you need here is urban planning therapy.'' 
 Housing advocates and officials noted that contentiousness over redevelopment is not unusual. In some cases, like that of the Arverne site in the Rockaways, environmental issues stalled development. In other areas, like Cooper Square or the Upper West Side in Manhattan, longtime residents of buildings sometimes proved difficult to appease.
 But the Seward Park site had none of those problems, since the buildings had been razed in 1967. Yet developing anything there became difficult, advocates and former city officials said, given the competing interests. 
 About 1,000 units of public or subsidized housing were built in the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area. The five lots that sit still untouched were considered for low- and moderate-income housing in 1981, but that plan failed when it was shot down by Andrew Stein, the borough president at the time.
 ''The past is the past, and we want to move forward,'' said Harriet Cohen, a member of the local coalition. ''We're not saying it has to be 100 percent low income. But affordable housing is what's needed in this community, in the city as a whole.''
 Harold Jacobs, the general manager and a longtime resident of the Hillman Houses, one of several co-op complexes in the area, questioned that assumption. ''Why call for low-income housing in a neighborhood that already has the second-highest concentration of low-income housing in the entire state?'' he said. ''Why not sell the property at the highest market rate possible, take that money and put up low-income housing somewhere else? This neighborhood is booming, so it should be developed at market rate.''
 The co-ops have also boomed in recent years. In 1996, the residents of the Seward Park Houses, another of the co-op developments, took the complex private, and the apartments they bought for $5,000 or less were suddenly worth hundreds of thousands. 
 B. Pietro Filardo, an architect who is on the board of the Seward Park Houses, said that while he would prefer to see development of market-rate housing, he was not opposed to seeing some units set aside for low- and moderate-income families.
 ''It's a huge drag on our quality of life already because it is empty,'' he said. ''You come here and see the white trucks with graffiti and razor wire, it just reeks of urban blight.''
 Msgr. Neil Connolly finds the whole standoff surreal. He came to the area as pastor of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in 1985, leaving behind a South Bronx parish ringed by desolate blocks of brick and rubble. Twenty-two years later, his old Bronx neighborhood looks downright pastoral with parks and private houses. And the lots on Delancey Street look just as ratty as ever. 
 He has helped convene meetings, sponsored petition drives and held rallies for housing on those sites. While he said city officials have been sympathetic, they have shied away from tackling those lots lest they anger Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker whose electoral base includes the co-op developments. 
 ''Sheldon Silver moves with the co-op crowd,'' Monsignor Connolly said of past attempts to build housing. ''He stopped it.''
 Recent attempts by the housing coalition to gain support have been met with silence from Speaker Silver's office. Well, not total silence. Ms. Cohen said she was told by a senior aide in the speaker's office that he would not meet with them.
 Dan Weiller, a spokesman for the speaker, said Mr. Silver has met with many local groups over the years. But he added that the city -- not Mr. Silver -- was responsible for anything that happened on the urban renewal site.
 One former city official familiar with the site faulted the city's Economic Development Corporation, the agency responsible for the property, for inaction on the lots. While the Economic Development Corporation may be skilled with commercial development, it is not adept at planning for residential areas, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is still active in housing development. 
 Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, said that her agency was going to be soliciting proposals for commercial development on a corner of the area, and that it would be working with the city's housing department on the remaining lots. She did not specify a timetable for the latter.
 Current housing officials declined to comment about the sites. But Ms. Perine, the former commissioner, said the failure to build on the site reflected the reality that officials -- and she included herself -- focused on neighborhoods where they could build, rather than bicker.
 ''You had complicated politics and complicated local constituencies,'' she said. ''Ultimately, somebody has to be a champion for it. That never happened down there.''
 Six floors above Clinton Street, two parakeets zip through Mrs. Delgado's living room, alighting atop their open cage. The small parlor is decorated with portraits from graduations and snapshots from family gatherings. 
 ''We were poor,'' she said. ''But decent.'' 
 She still cannot fathom why she sacrificed her old home to see nothing replace it. Not that she, like many of her former neighbors who were united by the common language of aspiration, is opposed to sacrifice. 
 ''I lifted my children up,'' she said. ''They are professionals. Once you raise them up from poverty, with a lot of work, you can look back satisfied. Now, I can die in peace.'' 
 She looked out her window to the tree. Her tree. 
 ''It was such a small tree,'' she said. ''I was young. It's funny what you remember.''

HEADLINE: LOOKING AHEAD

 BODY:
LOOKING TO THE FED While the markets have stabilized a bit, investors still wonder whether the Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate. They will be scrutinizing any remarks made on Friday by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, at the annual symposium of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which continues Saturday. 
 The Fed will give some insight into its earlier thinking, when it releases minutes of its Aug. 7 meeting (Tuesday).
 ECONOMIC INDICATORS Reports this week will include existing home sales for July (Monday); the Conference Board consumer confidence index for August (Tuesday); a revision of second-quarter gross domestic product (Thursday); and personal income and spending for July, the Chicago purchasing managers' index for August, factory orders for July and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for August (Friday).
 COMPANY REPORTS Earnings will be led by DaimlerChrysler (Wednesday), the last to include Chrysler, and Dell (Thursday).
 Other earnings reports will come from Borders (Tuesday); TiVo and Williams-Sonoma (Wednesday); and Freddie Mac, H&R Block, Sears and Take-Two Interactive (Thursday).
 KATRINA DEADLINE Wednesday will be the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, and a surge in lawsuits against insurers is expected in Louisiana because of a deadline for filing cases.
 Lawmakers have passed two laws that gave conflicting dates for the deadline, which the federal courts also follow. One version set Aug. 30 as the deadline for filing Katrina suits, while another set it for Sept. 1.
 ALTRIA BOARD TO MEET Altria may discuss a spinoff of Philip Morris International at its board meeting (Wednesday).
 VOTE ON TOPPS SALE Shareholders of the Topps trading card company will vote Thursday on the proposed $385 million buyout by Tornante, the private company headed by Michael D. Eisner, above, and the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners.

HEADLINE: Late to Web Retailing? There's Still Money There

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
DURING the tech bust, GSI Commerce Inc. was the company that salvaged many operations. Beginning in 2000, as start-ups failed, GSI increased its business by buying distressed online retailers like Fogdog.com and Ashford.com, and running the entire operations more efficiently than the retailers could themselves. 
 Now the business, which makes money by helping companies like Toys ''R'' Us and Linens 'n Things operate online stores, hopes it can again raise its growth through an acquisition of a different kind. 
 The company, which is based in King of Prussia, Pa., announced this month that it would buy privately held Accretive Commerce, one of GSI's few big competitors, for $97.5 million in cash. The acquisition should help GSI maintain its position as the leader in this niche, analysts said. 
 But no matter who may be in the lead, just about everyone is doing well, thanks to new investments in e-commerce technologies and services by traditional retailers, like Diane von Furstenberg and Tommy Bahama, and others.
 ''These companies are all experiencing growth, and a lot of it is coming from the late bloomers,'' said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst with Forrester Research. ''There are also tons of companies that may have had some semblance of a Web presence who are now building out their e-commerce functionality.''
 GSI, for instance, signed an agreement this year to build the first e-commerce site for Gordon's Jewelers, a division of Zale Corporation. And last week, GSI unveiled a revamped e-commerce site for the Public Broadcasting Service, ShopPBS.com. 
 Assuming its deal with Accretive closes as expected within the next two months, those clients will line up with roughly 15 other customers that Accretive had attracted in recent years, including American Eagle Outfitters and Restoration Hardware. 
 Analysts said the purchase is a good defensive measure, as Accretive had competed directly with GSI. But according to Michael G. Rubin, GSI's chief executive, the acquisition is significant in that it improves the company's flexibility. 
 GSI makes most of its money by signing up stores for all-in-one packages of e-commerce services, in which GSI designs and manages the Web site, carries inventory and handles shipping -- in most cases, running the entire online operations for clients. In exchange, it keeps an undisclosed share of the revenues. 
 The Accretive acquisition underscores a shift in strategy, where GSI is giving clients more options, like e-mail promotions or Web site design, for a flat fee. 
 GSI's shift away from a one-size-fits-all approach is a wise one, said Aaron Kessler, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, an investment firm. Mr. Kessler said that the company's increased focus on selling advertising services to its clients, in particular, ''helps them become more of an agency. That's a higher-margin business.''
 Some of Accretive's customers pay others like ATG, an e-commerce software company, to build their Web sites, or install software to help manage their inventory of goods online.
 But because GSI also sells the same services and products to clients, its acquisition of Accretive could have ripple effects for ATG. Bob Burke, ATG's chief executive, said he expected to keep Accretive's customers even after the business moves to GSI.
 GSI, a publicly traded company, reported that its second-quarter revenue increased about 10 percent from the same period a year earlier. Before announcing the Accretive acquisition, GSI said it had expected sales for its fiscal year to top $721 million, and net income to reach more than $41 million.
 One curious development in this category in recent years is what analysts have characterized as the diminished stature of Amazon.com. Several years ago, Amazon opened a new line of business it called Enterprise Solutions, by signing Borders, Toys ''R'' Us and other big retailers to deals in which Amazon would essentially run the e-commerce operations of those businesses.
 The Toys ''R'' Us partnership, though, devolved into a bitter dispute in 2004 after the toy retailer accused Amazon of violating their contract by allowing competing toy sellers to offer goods on Amazon.com. Amazon lost the ensuing lawsuit last year, which released Toys ''R'' Us from the partnership. Borders has said it would not renew the Amazon deal when it expires next year.
 Mr. Kessler, of Piper Jaffray, said Amazon ''has made a strategic decision to stop competing for larger players.''
 An Amazon spokesman, Craig Berman, declined to comment on Mr. Kessler's statement. ''Enterprise Solutions is an important option for merchants, along with the other offerings we have,'' he said. ''And it's an important component to be able to offer merchants, regardless of their size.''
 Fry Inc., which builds and operates Web sites on behalf of companies like Brookstone and Godiva also has benefited from more demand from retailers. According to David Fry, the company's chief executive, sales have increased by 30 percent over the past two years. (The company is privately held and does not disclose revenue figures.)
 Mr. Fry said that sales should continue to grow briskly, despite GSI's strengthened competitive position, and despite a general slowdown in the domestic growth of e-commerce sales. E-commerce executives, he said, will need expertise to compete.
 ''As an e-commerce manager, in the past, you didn't have to do anything to get 30 percent growth,'' Mr. Fry said. ''Now, you have to do what other people do: work for a living and take customers away from your competitors.''

HEADLINE: Man Who Put Girls' Photos On Internet Plans to Move

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
A self-described pedophile said he would leave California after a judge ordered him to stay away permanently from places where children gather, the man told a television station for a report that was broadcast Sunday. 
 ''I have to leave the state, really, I can't live here under this Orwellian protocol,'' the man, Jack McClellan, told the station, KABC. ''It's nightmarish.''
 Mr. McClellan did not say where he planned to go. He did not immediately return a message left on his cellphone by The Associated Press. He has been unemployed and living in his car since arriving in Southern California this summer from Washington State.
 Mr. McClellan, 45, came to the attention of the authorities because of a Web site where he posted photographs of children in public places and discussed how he liked to stake out parks, public libraries, fast-food restaurants and other areas where little girls congregated. His Internet service provider took down his Web site more than a month ago.
 Mr. McClellan maintained he started the site as a form of therapy and would not do anything illegal. He has never been charged with molesting.
 But on Friday, the judge, Melvin Sandvig of Los Angeles County Superior Court, issued a permanent injunction and a three-year restraining order that prohibit Mr. McClellan from coming within 30 feet of schools, playgrounds and other places where children congregate.
 The ruling narrowed an injunction issued earlier in the month that barred Mr. McClellan from coming near anyone younger than 18 anywhere in the state. Mr. McClellan spent 10 days in jail for violating that injunction when he was arrested this month near a child care center at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 The new ruling also bars Mr. McClellan from contacting, videotaping or photographing children or publishing their photographs without written consent from a guardian or parent. Mr. McClellan could be arrested if he violates that prohibition.

HEADLINE: China Agrees to Raise Its Product Standards

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: MANILA, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Southeast Asian countries and China agreed to strengthen product standards and safety, economic ministers said Sunday. The move follows recalls of several tainted Chinese products from international markets.
 China's commerce minister, Bo Xilai, defended the quality of Chinese goods, saying 99 percent of his country's exports to the United States and Japan passed quality controls and adhered to global quality standards. 
 A joint statement issued Sunday by economic ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China, at the end of their annual consultations, said product quality and food safety were common challenges faced by every country. All parties should actively cooperate in improving controls and ensuring quality, it added.
 ''The ministers agreed to urge relevant government agencies to properly deal with product quality-related cases by strengthening consultations with the view to protecting the safety and health of consumers while not impeding bilateral trade and economic cooperation,'' it said.
 Chinese goods have come under intense scrutiny in recent months after toxic chemicals were found in exports ranging from toothpaste to seafood and pet food ingredients.
 With growing numbers of countries rejecting Chinese goods, China has sought to reassure consumers by highlighting similar problems in other countries and criticizing foreign media for playing up the safety problems.
 At a joint news conference by the ministers, Mr. Bo said that 50 percent of products manufactured in China were made by foreign enterprises, and that more than 60 percent of exports were made and inspected according to standards set by foreign importers and buyers.
 ''In the past 29 years, the annual growth rate of Chinese exports is 17 percent, and this itself shows a high degree of recognition of product quality of China by other countries,'' Mr. Bo said. Nevertheless, if even only 0.1 percent of Chinese products are problematic, his government will seriously address the matter, he added.
 China is Asean's fourth major trading partner, after the United States, the European Union and Japan. Chinese foreign direct investment in Asean nations reached $936.9 million in 2006.
 Asean and China signed a trade in goods agreement in 2004 and a trade in services deal in January. An investment agreement is still under negotiation as part of steps to establish the Asean China Free Trade Area.

HEADLINE: In Online World, Pocket Change Is Not Easily Spent

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
The idea of micropayments -- charging Web users tiny amounts of money for single pieces of online content -- was essentially put to sleep toward the end of the dot-com boom. In December 2000, Clay Shirky, an adjunct professor in New York University's interactive telecommunications program, wrote a manifesto that people still cite whenever someone suggests resurrecting the idea. Micropayments will never work, he wrote, mainly because ''users hate them.'' 
 But wait. Amid the disdain, and without many people noticing, micropayments have arrived -- just not in the way they were originally envisioned. The 99 cents you pay for a song on iTunes is a micropayment. So are the tiny amounts that some operators of small Web sites earn whenever someone clicks on the ads on their pages. Some stock-photography companies sell pictures for as little as $1 each. 
 ''Micropayments are here,'' said Benjamin M. Compaine, a consultant and lecturer at Northeastern University who specializes in media economics, ''they just have not evolved in the way that everybody expected.''
 From the earliest days of the Web until around the time of Mr. Shirky's manifesto, the expectation was that a handful of companies would provide platforms -- or perhaps a single ubiquitous platform -- that would enable Web users to pay a penny, a dime or a dollar for a bit of content such as a newspaper article, a comic strip or a research report. Simply clicking a link would complete the transaction. 
 Sellers of content -- at the time, newspaper companies -- were among the most interested in the idea as they looked for revenue that did not depend on advertising. And the Web, rather than being a threat to their business, would allow them to expand their audience vastly.
 But the problems proved insurmountable. Many micropayments companies have shut down, been acquired or changed their business models over the years. Among them: DigiCash, CyberCash, First Virtual Holdings and Peppercoin. 
 They used various systems, but in general users paid into accounts with their credit cards and then drew from those accounts. In the mid- to late '90s, electronic cash had become such a popular concept that some politicians worried that it might threaten the stability of the nation's currency. 
 But the economic and technical challenges were enormous. Consumers were reluctant to pay even a tenth of a cent for something they believed should be free. ''There is a certain amount of anxiety involved in any decision to buy, no matter how small,'' Mr. Shirky wrote in 2000.
 It turns out, however, that consumers are more than willing to pay for certain types of content in certain situations. Consumers ''expect to pay for music and movies, but not so much for the printed word,'' said George Peabody, an analyst with Mercator Advisory Group, which serves the payments industry. 
 ''Closed loop'' systems like iTunes are the most successful, Mr. Peabody said. That's where consumers have a continuing relationship with the merchant and usually pay with their credit cards. ''Open loop'' systems, where the consumer pays many merchants through a single payments processor -- the way micropayments were originally envisioned -- are much less successful. ''To date, the market has said there is insufficient demand for these services,'' concluded a research report Mercator published in April.
 There is another problem with closed-loop systems: cost. The fees for every transaction are too high to make tiny payments worthwhile for many online content sellers -- sometimes those fees exceed the price of the content being sold. For most merchants, according to the report, purchases of less than $1.50 aren't worth it. 
 One solution is to aggregate purchases, or group purchases over a period of time, and then process the payments in a single transaction. That's how iTunes works. But credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard, which charge fees for transactions, ''aren't really happy with that idea,'' said Mr. Peabody, because it means less money for them.
 Visa and MasterCard prohibit most merchants from aggregating payments directly. The networks have recently promoted their efforts to serve the ''small payments'' market -- encouraging consumers to use cards for parking meters, for example.
 But so far, they have stopped short of widely supporting aggregated-payment systems. There are ''operational challenges,'' said Pam Zuercher, Visa's vice president for product innovation. Visa is evaluating such systems, she added, because ''there is an undeniable trend -- users want to use their cards for very small purchases.''
 Merchants can aggregate payments through another company, but that adds to costs and ''implementation has been tough,'' Mr. Peabody said. For sellers of the lowest-priced content -- anything under 75 cents -- micropayments have been made irrelevant by the easy availability of online advertising, Mr. Peabody said. Programs like AdSense from Google, which allows even the smallest Web publishers to have relevant ads placed on their sites, make micropayments unnecessary. The program pays Web publishers what are often very small amounts each time a reader clicks on an ad.
 Looked at another way, though, AdSense is based on micropayments. ''All the criteria are there,'' said Mr. Compaine, the Northeastern University lecturer, ''but the money isn't coming from the end user; it's coming from the advertisers.'' 
 Bill Densmore, a founder of the payments firm Clickshare, a former newspaper publisher and now a consultant and a director of a citizens' media project at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, has been promoting micropayments from the beginning.
 He envisions Web publishers joining with one another and with producers of other content to create huge networks, sharing users and, in effect, revenue. 
 For example, he said, a large newspaper could sell subscriptions that would allow its readers to download music from iTunes or Rhapsody, read articles from regional papers, and watch movies and TV shows from YouTube or Comedy Central. 
 Some material would be sold for a fee -- with the payments managed internally by the network. Mr. Densmore acknowledged that this is all pie-in-the-sky at this point. But, he said, for newspapers in particular, the status quo is not good enough. In that business, he said, there are ''enough people feeling enough pain that they need to be open to asking what models might work.''

HEADLINE: First Lady Cancels Trip to Australia

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Laura Bush has canceled plans to accompany the president on a trip next month to Australia, citing a pinched nerve, her office said Sunday. 
 President Bush is to arrive in Sydney on Sept. 4, three days before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum there, said Prime Minister John Howard of Australia. Mr. Bush is to have bilateral talks with Mr. Howard and take part in a state visit to Australia before the forum.
 Mr. Howard has said that the president will leave the meeting a bit early to be back for the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and to prepare for a crucial Sept. 15 progress report on Iraq.
 Mrs. Bush injured a nerve in her neck and shoulder this year while hiking, said her press secretary, Sally McDonough, adding that Mrs. Bush's doctors had strongly advised her to not travel overseas, saying such long flights could aggravate the problem.
 The Bushes are spending a few days at their ranch here. 
 On Monday, Mr. Bush will leave for fund-raisers for Republican candidates in Albuquerque and Bellevue, Wash. Mrs. Bush will fly to Wyoming on Monday to dedicate a national park visitor center before joining the president in New Orleans, where they plan to commemorate the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Redone Deal Not Thought Contagious

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
As the deal for Home Depot's wholesale supply unit was renegotiated over the weekend, a question lingered about whether the push to lower the price was a harbinger for other buyouts.
 Home Depot agreed Sunday to make several concessions in the sale of the unit, HD Supply, including lowering the price by $1.8 billion, to $8.5 billion, and keeping a sizable stake in the unit. The deal is expected to be completed as early as today when the paperwork is finished, people involved in the talks said last night. 
 With the credit markets all but frozen, some investors have been fretting that anxious banks and private equity firms may try to repeat the feat with other buyouts, like those for First Data, the credit card processor, or TXU, the Texas energy giant, which are scheduled to be completed in the next two months. 
 But fears about a rash of renegotiated or collapsed deals increasingly seem misplaced, analysts said yesterday.
 As investors have sifted through the $400 billion in deals that are scheduled to be completed, it appears that Home Depot may have been a special case -- it had numerous idiosyncrasies that aligned to make the renegotiations possible -- that and may make it less likely that other deals will follow in its path.
 ''I don't think it's a paradigm change,'' Donna Hitscherich, a professor of finance and economics at the Columbia Business School.
 For one, the sale to a consortium of buyout firms that included Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice involved an asset, rather than an entire company. As a result, the parent company was able to retain an equity stake and provide financing -- Home Depot will hold onto 12.5 percent and also agreed to provide $1 billion in debt financing -- two crucial factors in averting the deal's collapse.
 Also, in contrast to companies like First Data or Alltel, the rural cellphone service provider, Home Depot was not being sold -- and in this case, was desperate for cash. Home Depot was counting on the sale to help finance a $250 million share buyback to lift its flagging stock. 
 In announcing this month that it might reprice the deal, Home Depot said it was cutting the price it was offering in its buyback, and some feared that the repurchase might be withdrawn entirely if the deal fell apart.
 Furthermore, it took more than the implosion of the debt markets to drag Home Depot back to the table. There was the simultaneous blow of the collapsing housing market, which has sapped profits from HD Supply specifically, and from Home Depot more generally. 
 In this case, it was the private equity firms, not the banks, that came back to the table first, despite saying that HD Supply's worsening financial condition was reason enough to walk away.
 It remains unclear whether the buyers actually had legal ground to walk away without paying a $309 million breakup fee. The material adverse change clause, which requires something significant to change, specifically ruled out ''changes affecting any or all of the wholesale distribution industries for construction'' and ''general financial or capital market conditions, including interest rates or currency exchange rates.'' 
 But Home Depot could not afford to call the bluff of the private equity firms and agreed to lower the price to $9 billion.
 Then the banks rushed in, demanding their own concessions. Though Home Depot's legal counsel, Martin Lipton of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counseled that the first renegotiated deal did not alter the agreements with the banks, the heads of JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers indicated otherwise.
 Though the banks themselves could not declare that a material adverse change had occurred, they seemed to have argued that Home Depot and the private equity firms essentially admitted as much. That left an opening to press forward with their own demands.
 Still, the role of the material adverse change clause seems limited in most other buyouts, analysts said. It could, however, have been a factor in the deal for the Chrysler Group and may be a factor for the impending Sallie Mae buyout. 
 Even then, crucial differences remain. Though the Chrysler deal was also a sale of a unit in a troubled industry, the negotiations among DaimlerChrysler, Cerberus Capital Management and the JPMorgan-led consortium of banks were far friendlier, as all parties admitted that the sale of the American carmaker could not go through without significant help. 
 Hence, when the banks were unable to resell more than $12 billion in buyout-related debt in the markets, Cerberus and Daimler agreed to hold a collective $2 billion of that on their books.
 At Sallie Mae, the buyers -- the buyout firms J. C. Flowers and Friedman Fleischer & Lowe, and JPMorgan and Bank of America -- have all but declared a material adverse change in the student lender, citing several bills circulating in Congress; the company, however, has fiercely contested those claims. 
 Stock in Sallie Mae's parent, the SLM Corporation, has fallen as much as 11 percent since the squabble was made public.
 But few think the buyers want to break off the deal. And some have argued that Sallie Mae's clause about material adverse change is close to airtight, setting a high bar for the buyers to make their point.
 Like virtually any buyer, private equity firms would prefer to pay less. But absent the combination of very specific conditions, it is not clear they can doctor other deals to match the Home Depot script.

HEADLINE: In Volatility, Redemption For Manager

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The debacle in mortgage lending that spurred wild daily swings in the markets has tripped up many hedge funds.
 But it has been a boon to Convexity Capital Management, the giant hedge fund that makes arcane trading bets that benefit from volatility. As a result of trades involving credit default swaps and cross-currency option trades, the fund, which had been down about 4 percent through May, was up nearly 12 percent through July. 
 To be sure, Convexity is not the only hedge fund that has benefited from the fallout over mortgage-backed securities and the tighter credit market. 
 Paulson Credit Opportunities, a $2 billion fund that bet against subprime lending, has more than tripled through July, according to an individual close to Paulson Credit who asked not to be identified.
 And some smaller funds, like Balestra Capital, which bet against mortgage-backed bonds, have also benefited. That fund, which is now worth $206 million, is up 84.7 percent through July.
 Convexity, however, has drawn significant attention. The fund, which was started last year with $6.3 billion, was the largest hedge fund start-up. It is run by Jack R. Meyer, who was the chief executive of the Harvard Management Company and oversaw Harvard University's endowment for 15 years. 
 For most of that period, Harvard's 15.9 percent annual compound growth was second only to Yale, which has earned 16.3 percent over the last 21 years.
 So eager were investors to pour cash into Convexity, based in Boston, that Mr. Meyer could have easily raised additional start-up money, according to hedge fund specialists, even though the initial investment required a three-year commitment.
 For a year and a half, however, returns were disappointing. The fund, which was started in February 2006, was down 4 percent that year and had fallen another 4 percent through May.
 Because Mr. Meyer had produced such strong, consistent results at Harvard, Convexity's troubles became the subject of endless speculation. 
 But the recent volatility has enabled a turnaround. 
 When Mr. Meyer and his team were at Harvard, the endowment was known for making money by betting on small pricing differences between different kinds of securities. 
 For example, Mr. Meyer and his team might capitalize on the price difference between new Treasury issues and older ones. And to magnify gains, they would leverage those bets as much as 15 to 1.
 But in 2006, when Convexity started, volatility in the fixed-income markets declined significantly. Although Mr. Meyer declined to comment for this article, several hedge fund specialists said the decline undermined the value of the fund's option positions and wiped out any value the firm got from its trades. 
 Then came the market turmoil of recent months. Among other things, Convexity has made a long bet on credit default swaps, which are essentially a form of insurance against companies defaulting on bonds. As concerns about defaults have risen, the cost of that insurance has increased and the value of default swaps has soared. 
 Other Convexity trades are far more complex and esoteric. 
 For example, the fund benefited this year from cross-currency option trades, the result of movements in the underlying exchange rates of one country's currency compared with another. Convexity bought cheap options on the currencies to capture the movements. The fund also benefited from volatility in bonds indexed to inflation.
 Though Mr. Meyer and his group are still highly leveraged, the ratio is about five to one, far lower than it had been at Harvard, according to several people with knowledge of the fund who asked not to be identified. 
 Perhaps the best-known beneficiary of Convexity's recent turnaround is the Harvard endowment. When the endowment, now led by Mohamed A. El-Erian, released its returns for fiscal 2007, it said that it had not lost money in July but had had a 0.4 percent gain. 
 The announcement was meant to reassure Harvard after the loss of $350 million in Sowood Capital Management, a hedge fund started by former Harvard money managers that was forced to sell its portfolio and return $1.5 billion to investors.
 Although Harvard did not go into details, the returns at Convexity, where it had invested $500 million, undoubtedly helped to offset the loss on Sowood. 
 When Mr. Meyer started Convexity, he was joined by his two top lieutenants at Harvard, David Mittelman and Maurice Samuels, who had been criticized by Harvard alumni after reports that in 2005 Mr. Mittelman had earned $18 million and Mr. Samuels had earned $16.9 million.
 The team has created an almost identical strategy at Convexity.
 According to several people close to the fund who asked not to be identified, investors can select a benchmark, and compensation is determined by how much the fund makes over that point, on the theory that managers should not benefit unless they add value. 
 For example, if a benchmark is up 5 percent and Convexity is up 11 percent, the fund is entitled to 20 percent of the profit on the 6 percent difference. (Many funds would calculate profit on the entire 11 percent.)
 Convexity is similar to many funds in using a ''high water mark.'' If a negative year is followed by a positive year, managers do not receive compensation until the fund has recouped the losses from the bad year.

HEADLINE: The State of New Orleans: An Update

BYLINE: By AMY LIU and NIGEL HOLMES. 
Amy Liu is the deputy director of the Brookings Institution's metropolitan policy program and a co-author of its New Orleans index. Nigel Holmes is a graphic designer.

 BODY:
TWO years after Hurricane Katrina toppled New Orleans's levee system, leaving more than half the city under water, there are signs of revival. The city's population has climbed to 68 percent of its pre-hurricane level, the work force is 78 percent of what it was before the flood, and sales tax revenues have rebounded to 84 percent. 
 But some troubling trends persist. The city's share of the region's population has dropped to 30 percent, an indication that economic activity is shifting to the suburbs. Even as the city has added workers, a greater share are unemployed now than were a year ago. And important sectors of the economy -- health care, education, and leisure and hospitality services -- are still missing critical workers.
 Progress on improving school quality, public safety and access to child care, doctors and hospitals has been slow. Crime, especially violent crime, has risen significantly. And as of May, fewer than half of New Orleans's schools had reopened. While the city plans to open 25 more public schools by Labor Day, many repairs are still needed to get them ready.
 Most fundamentally, the housing recovery is lagging. Home repairs have slowed as many families wait for the state to deliver critical Road Home grants. Of the more than 180,000 families who have applied for this rebuilding assistance, only 22 percent have received their checks. With many houses still damaged, real estate values in the hardest-hit parts of the city continue to drop, even as prices have risen in the suburbs. And the limited housing supply has driven up rents. 
 This year, as Louisiana elects a new governor, and next, as America chooses a new president, voters should look for leadership in rebuilding the Gulf Coast. The recovery is just beginning, and without strong leadership it is likely to be a long time before greater New Orleans is again a safe, robust city for all its residents.

HEADLINE: China in Africa (1 Letter)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''China's Trade With Africa Carries a Price Tag'' ( front page, Aug. 21): 
 As any laid-off American factory worker or small-business owner can attest, the Chinese trade juggernaut has already rolled across this country. Why should we be surprised that it now has the entire continent of Africa, with its undeveloped industries and vast natural resources, in its sights? 
 Under the banner of free trade, China is doing what China does best: using Africa as a supply depot to produce everything from cars to shoes more cheaply than anyone else, and selling them back to the rest of the world, and Africa, at cutthroat prices. 
 The Chinese know that they don't need guns to colonize a continent, and unless their trade practices are regulated in some way, they will do every bit as much harm to Africa's economy and security as an occupying army.

HEADLINE: What Looks and Sounds Like a Bailout?

 BODY:
A recurring question in the recent turmoil in the financial markets has been whether the Federal Reserve would bail out the banks, nonbank lenders and investors who are complicit in the excesses that sparked the credit crisis. Events have overtaken the debate. The bailout is well under way. 
 Earlier this month, as the credit squeeze tightened and the Fed began to inject extra billions of dollars into the banking system, the injections were viewed as standard operating procedure. By midmonth, when the Fed cut the lending rate it charges federally insured banks to borrow directly from the Fed, the move was viewed more as a way to calm the markets than to grease their wheels, mainly because it was of no direct use to nonbank lenders reeling from the credit crunch -- like Countrywide, the nation's largest mortgage lender. 
 But by Aug. 20, one business day after cutting the lending rate, the Fed allowed Bank of America and Citigroup's Citibank to breach the regulatory cap on the size of loans they're permitted to make to their brokerage affiliates. Using the brokerages as conduits, the banks will be able to easily funnel substantial sums of money to their clients, like the ailing nonbank lenders. 
 The cap on loans to an affiliate is a tenet of prudent banking. So waiving it, even temporarily, is a significant escalation of the Fed's rescue efforts. Under normal circumstances, a bank is limited to lending any one affiliate an amount equal to 10 percent of the bank's regulatory capital. Fed documents released last Friday disclosed that the banks would be allowed to lend up to $25 billion apiece, or about 30 percent of their capital. 
 Compromising the cap to that extent attests to the Fed's belief that a bailout is necessary to avert greater harm to the financial system and the broader economy. 
 But even if the Fed succeeds in managing the crisis, its actions stir questions anew about the longer-term sustainability of the debt-fueled state of the American economy. 
 And they are yet another reminder that even as officials are quick to try to counter threats from Wall Street, they have yet to make any real progress toward heading off the coming wave of foreclosures, which could rock the markets as early as this fall and create a social crisis on top of a financial one. 
 Bailouts are tolerable only if the help they provide is in the broad public interest, and if they're followed by punishing wrongdoers and imposing new rules and procedures that help to ensure that the same problems will not happen again. The Fed is playing out its role in the bailout, but the Bush administration and Congress have yet to step up to theirs.

HEADLINE: In Washington, Measuring a Lifeline

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
Faced with a possible tidal wave of home foreclosures beginning this fall, Democrats and Republicans are battling over a philosophical question with huge practical implications: should the government ride to the rescue?
 Both the Bush administration and Democratic leaders in Congress agree that legions of homeowners could be overwhelmed in the next 18 months, as low teaser rates expire on more than two million adjustable-rate mortgages, causing monthly payments increase sharply.
 More ominously, falling real estate prices and a pullback among mortgage lenders are expected to make it more difficult for overstretched homebuyers to either refinance their way out of trouble or simply sell their houses.
 ''This is really just the beginning,'' said Karen Weaver, global director for securitization research at Deutsche Bank. ''There's a big wave of defaults coming over the next 12 to 18 months.'' 
 From a political perspective, the wave would be crashing during the primary and general election campaigns next year.
 But the Bush administration and Congressional Democrats are ideologically divided about what Washington should do. Administration officials are reluctant to bail out people who bought homes they could not afford or simply gambled that easy credit and rising real estate prices would lead to quick profits.
 Democrats, though opposed to a broad bailout, are proposing an array of measures to help lower-income people renegotiate their loans and stay in their homes.
 ''You cannot simply decree that there will be no foreclosures,'' Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said. ''You can't just give people a free ride.''
 Mr. Frank and other Democrats are pushing for changes that they hope will free more money for lower-income families and shift the balance of power between borrowers and lenders. 
 The proposals would expand the program of insuring home loans under the Federal Housing Administration, part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development; create a national fund for ''affordable housing''; expand the ability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored finance companies, to buy renegotiated subprime mortgages; and give bankruptcy judges more power to order easier terms for borrowers.
 The Bush administration, with the Treasury Department heading the efforts, is looking for more limited solutions. Administration officials are working on their own ideas to let the F.H.A. insure slightly more expensive homes, which could make it easier for people with low incomes or weak credit to switch out of subprime mortgages and into more traditional fixed-rate loans.
 Robert K. Steel, under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, has been put in charge of developing other ideas, but administration officials have said little about what those might be.
 ''The president has asked Treasury to be clearly focused on actions that can be taken, things we can do, to help mortgage holders who are in danger of losing their homes,'' a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, Jennifer Zuccarelli, said. ''We are looking at all other options to help stressed borrowers.'' 
 For the last six years, administration officials have followed a laissez-faire approach, saying they did not want to restrict innovative mortgage products.
 But it may be difficult to continue that hands-off policy much longer. The number of foreclosure filings in July was almost double that of a year ago, according to RealtyTrac, which provides real estate data. About 13 percent of adjustable subprime mortgages are past due, but most of the problems are on loans whose monthly payments have not yet been adjusted upward.
 Deutsche Bank estimates that about $400 billion in subprime loans are scheduled for rate increases of 30 percent or more by the end of 2008. 
 Consequently, many Democratic lawmakers are pushing for measures that would make it easier for imperiled homeowners to replace their adjustable subprime mortgages with more traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. 
 Democrats also want the administration to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy a larger volume of mortgages for their own portfolios. The two government-sponsored companies buy billions of dollars in mortgages each year, up to a loan limit of $417,000, and package them into securities that can be traded. They also hold some of the bundles of mortgages in their own portfolios to increase returns to shareholders. 
 Democrats, including Mr. Frank in the House and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate banking committee, contend that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could help thousands of people refinance their subprime mortgages if the two finance giants were allowed to hold those loans in their portfolios. 
 The Treasury Department has opposed that kind of expansion, arguing that the two companies crowd out commercial rivals because they exploit an implied government guarantee to borrow money at lower rates than their rivals.
 Treasury officials have indicated a willingness to let Fannie and Freddie play a bigger role, but they argue that letting the two companies hold more mortgages -- the current regulatory limit is about $700 billion for each -- would pose a risk to taxpayers without helping homeowners. 
 Mr. Frank has argued that Congress should also increase the size of mortgages that Fannie and Freddie can buy, from $417,000 now to $500,000 or even $650,000 in markets like San Francisco and New York.
 Some specialists warn that simply switching out of an adjustable loan will not keep all homeowners from losing their houses.
 ''The problem is that a lot of people have bought more house than they can afford and in many cases the price has dropped a great deal,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research, a liberal research group in Washington. ''If we do a workout that allows someone to pay off a $240,000 mortgage on a house that would only sell for $220,000, have we really done them a favor?''
 Democratic lawmakers have proposed changes that would give borrowers more power to negotiate lower interest rates or even a lower loan amount.
 Supporters say such a move might benefit lenders, because foreclosing and re-selling a property can be costly -- especially if real estate prices are declining.
 This year, lawmakers persuaded the Financial Accounting Standards Board to allow companies that service mortgages, as opposed to the investment funds that may actually own the mortgage, to negotiate changes.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has proposed that the government distribute $300 million to nonprofit groups that could advise families on how to refinance or renegotiate their mortgages. The Senate recently included $100 million for such programs in a spending bill for HUD. 
 Another idea, being considered by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, would give bankruptcy judges the ability to revise mortgage contracts, much as they already do when sorting out payments to other kinds of creditors.
 ''The most important thing in the mortgage market is not about money, but about the rules of the game,'' said Eric Stein, senior vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit organization based in Charlotte, N.C., that has long criticized subprime lending.
 Mr. Stein and other industry critics would ban the steep penalties for prepaying mortgages. Such penalties, which are rare for prime borrowers, or those with good credit, oftenmake it prohibitively expensive for people to refinance. 
 Mortgage lenders are expected to fight such a prohibition, arguing that prepayment penalties make it possible to offer very low initial interest rates to higher-risk borrowers.
 Some advocates for low-income homeowners argue that the government may have to rescue people, at a cost of billions of dollars. 
 Democratic presidential candidates, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Senator John Edwards, have called for a billion-dollar fund to help low-income homeowners. 
 ''We have entered the arena of 'too big to fail,' '' said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit group in Washington. ''We need to pony up and prevent the market from deteriorating further.''
 For the moment, neither Democratic leaders in Congress nor Mr. Bush have much appetite for a true bailout. But that could change as the elections draw nearer.

HEADLINE: Useful Mutants, Bred With Radiation

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

DATELINE: VIENNA 

 BODY:
Pierre Lagoda pulled a small container from his pocket and spilled the contents onto his desk. Four tiny dice rolled to a stop.
 ''That's what nature does,'' Dr. Lagoda said. The random results of the dice, he explained, illustrate how spontaneous mutations create the genetic diversity that drives evolution and selective breeding.
 He rolled the dice again. This time, he was mimicking what he and his colleagues have been doing quietly around the globe for more than a half-century -- using radiation to scramble the genetic material in crops, a process that has produced valuable mutants like red grapefruit, disease-resistant cocoa and premium barley for Scotch whiskey.
 ''I'm doing the same thing,'' he said, still toying with the dice. ''I'm not doing anything different from what nature does. I'm not using anything that was not in the genetic material itself.'' 
 Dr. Lagoda, the head of plant breeding and genetics at the International Atomic Energy Agency, prides himself on being a good salesman. It can be a tough act, however, given wide public fears about the dangers of radiation and the risks of genetically manipulated food. His work combines both fields but has nonetheless managed to thrive.
 The process leaves no residual radiation or other obvious marks of human intervention. It simply creates offspring that exhibit new characteristics.
 Though poorly known, radiation breeding has produced thousands of useful mutants and a sizable fraction of the world's crops, Dr. Lagoda said, including varieties of rice, wheat, barley, pears, peas, cotton, peppermint, sunflowers, peanuts, grapefruit, sesame, bananas, cassava and sorghum. The mutant wheat is used for bread and pasta and the mutant barley for beer and fine whiskey.
 The mutations can improve yield, quality, taste, size and resistance to disease and can help plants adapt to diverse climates and conditions.
 Dr. Lagoda takes pains to distinguish the little-known radiation work from the contentious field of genetically modified crops, sometimes disparaged as ''Frankenfood.'' That practice can splice foreign genetic material into plants, creating exotic varieties grown widely in the United States but often feared and rejected in Europe. By contrast, radiation breeding has made few enemies.
 ''Spontaneous mutations are the motor of evolution,'' Dr. Lagoda said. ''We are mimicking nature in this. We're concentrating time and space for the breeder so he can do the job in his lifetime. We concentrate how often mutants appear -- going through 10,000 to one million -- to select just the right one.''
 Radiation breeding is widely used in the developing world, thanks largely to the atomic agency's efforts. Beneficiaries have included Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand and Vietnam.
 Politically, the method is one of many quid pro quos the agency, an arm of the United Nations in Vienna, offers client states. Its own agenda is to inspect ostensibly peaceful atomic installations in an effort to find and deter secret work on nuclear weapons.
 Plant scientists say radiation breeding could play an important role in the future. By promoting crop flexibility, it could help feed billions of added mouths despite shrinking land and water, rising oil and fertilizer costs, increasing soil exhaustion, growing resistance of insects to pesticides and looming climate change. Globally, food prices are already rising fast.
 ''It's not going to solve the world food crisis,'' said J. Neil Rutger, former director of the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart, Ark. ''But it will help. Modern plant breeders are using every tool they can get.'' 
 The method was discovered some 80 years ago when Lewis J. Stadler of the University of Missouri used X-rays to zap barley seeds. The resulting plants were white, yellow, pale yellow and some had white stripes -- nothing of any practical value.
 But the potential was clear. Soon, by exposing large numbers of seeds and young plants, scientists produced many more mutations and found a few hidden beneficial ones. Peanuts got tougher hulls. Barley, oats and wheat got better yields. Black currants grew.
 The process worked because the radiation had randomly mixed up the genetic material of the plants. The scientists could control the intensity of the radiation and thus the extent of the disturbance, but not the outcome. To know the repercussions, they had to plant the radiated material, let it grow and examine the results. Often, the gene scrambling killed the seeds and plants, or left them with odd mutations. But in a few instances, the process made beneficial traits. 
 In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States government promoted the method as part of its ''atoms for peace'' program and had notable successes. In 1960, disease heavily damaged the bean crop in Michigan -- except for a promising new variety that had been made by radiation breeding. It and its offspring quickly replaced the old bean.
 In the early 1970s, Dr. Rutger, then in Davis, Calif., fired gamma rays at rice. He and his colleagues found a semi-dwarf mutant that gave much higher yields, partly because it produced more grain. Its short size also meant it fell over less often, reducing spoilage. Known as Calrose 76, it was released publicly in 1976.
 Today, Dr. Rutger said, about half the rice grown in California derives from this dwarf. Now retired in Woodland, Calif., he lives just a few miles from where the descendants grow, he said.
 A similar story unfolded in Texas. In 1929, farmers stumbled on the Ruby Red grapefruit, a natural mutant. Its flesh eventually faded to pink, however, and scientists fired radiation to produce mutants of deeper color -- Star Ruby, released in 1971, and Rio Red, released in 1985. The mutant offspring now account for about 75 percent of all grapefruit grown in Texas.
 Though the innovations began in the United States, the method is now used mostly overseas, with Asia and Europe the leading regions. Experts cited two main reasons: domestic plant researchers over the decades have already made many, perhaps most of the easiest improvements that can be achieved with radiation, and they now focus on highly popular fields like gene splicing.
 ''Most scientists here would say it's pretty primitive,'' Norman T. Uphoff, a professor of government and international agriculture at Cornell University, said of the method. ''It's like being in a huge room with a flashlight.''
 But the flashlight is cheap, which has aided its international spread.
 Today, the process usually begins with cobalt-60, a highly radioactive material used in industrial radiography and medical radiotherapy. Its gamma rays, more energetic than X-rays, can travel many yards through the air and penetrate lead.
 Understandably, the exposure facilities for radiation breeding have layers of shielding. Scientists run small machines the size of water heaters that zap containers full of seeds, greenhouses that expose young plants and special fields that radiate row upon row of mature plants. In Japan, one circular field is more than 650 feet wide. A shielding dike some 28 feet high rises around its perimeter.
 Dr. Lagoda said a rust fungus threatened the Japanese pear, a cross between pears and apples. But one irradiated tree had a branch that showed resistance. He said the Japanese cloned it, successfully started a new crop and with the financial rewards ''paid for 30 years of research.''
 The payoff was even bigger in Europe, where scientists fired gamma rays at barley to produce Golden Promise, a mutant variety with high yields and improved malting. After its debut in 1967, brewers in Ireland and Britain made it into premium beer and whiskey. It still finds wide use.
 ''The secret,'' reads a recent advertisement for a single malt Scotch whiskey costing $49.99 a bottle, is ''the continued use of finest Golden Promise barley and the insistence on oak sherry casks from Spain.''
 The atomic agency in Vienna has promoted the method since 1964 in outreach programs with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in Rome.
 Starting roughly a decade ago, for instance, the atomic agency helped scientists fight a virus that was killing cocoa trees in Ghana, which produces about 15 percent of the world's chocolate. The virus was killing and crippling millions of trees.
 In the city of Accra on the Atlantic coast, at the laboratories of the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission, the scientists exposed cocoa plant buds to gamma rays. The mutants included one that endowed its offspring with better resistance to the killer virus.
 The scientists planted the resistant variety on 25 farms across Ghana ''with no evidence of a resurgence,'' M. R. Appaih, executive director of the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana, told the agency.
 The atomic agency had similar success in the Peruvian Andes, where some three million people live on subsistence farming. The region, nearly two miles high, has extremely harsh weather. But nine new varieties of barley improved harvests to the point that farmers had surplus crops to sell.
 In 2006, Prof. Gomes Pando won the Peruvian prize for Good Government Practices for her work on the radiation mutants.
 In Vietnam, the agency has worked closely with local scientists to improve production of rice, a crop that accounts for nearly 70 percent of the public's food energy.
 One mutant had yields up to four times higher than its parent and grew well in acidic and saline soils, allowing farmers to use it in coastal regions, including the Mekong Delta.
 Last year, a team of 10 Vietnamese scientists wrote in an agency journal, Plant Mutation Reports, that the nation had sown the new varieties across more than one million hectares, or 3,860 square miles. The new varieties, they added, ''have already produced remarkable economic and social impacts, contributing to poverty alleviation in some provinces.''
 Dr. Lagoda said that radiation breeding, though an old technology, was undergoing rapid growth. New methods that speed up the identification of mutants are making radiation breeding even more popular, he said. 
 ''Now it becomes interesting again,'' he said of the method. ''It's not a panacea. It's not the solution. But it's a very efficient tool that helps us reduce the breeding time.''
 Spreading the secret, Dr. Lagoda added as he played with his tiny dice, ''is very gratifying because we really, really help people.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 1, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the use of radiation to produce mutations of crops misstated the properties of Japanese pears. Although Japanese pears have the crisp texture characteristic of apples, they are not a cross between apples and pears. They are pears, from the species Pyrus pyrifolia.

HEADLINE: Two Infusions of Vision to Bolster New Orleans

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
 In the two years since Hurricane Katrina, what has the rebuilding effort produced? No grand designs. No inspired vision for the future of New Orleans. There have been only a handful of earnest, grass-roots proposals to preserve what's left of the historic fabric. 
 Amid this atmosphere of malaise, two recently announced projects for downtown New Orleans stand out as the first truly creative attempts to foster the city's resurrection. The first, an extravagant proposal for a new New Orleans National Jazz Center and park by Morphosis, is the most significant work of architecture proposed in the city since the Superdome. The second, a six-mile-long park and mixed-use development along the Mississippi, designed by TEN Arquitectos, Hargreaves Associates and Chan Krieger Sieniewicz, would undo decades of misguided building on the riverfront.
 The design of the riverfront project has yet to be finished; even the developer concedes that it would take years to build under the best conditions. And construction of the park would probably require the cooperation of city, state and federal agencies -- an almost laughable notion, based on recent experience. 
 Still, the scope and creative ambition of these projects suggest how architecture could someday be vital to the city's physical and social healing. Both seek to transform dead urban areas into lively public forums, employing powerful architectural expressions of a democratic ideal. 
 The proposed Jazz Center, designed by Thom Mayne of Morphosis in Santa Monica, Calif., is conceived as a great social mixing chamber, with music embedded in its core. For architects, its form may bring to mind early-1960s ''Walking Cities'' fantasies by the British firm Archigram: gigantic nomadic machines that could carry entire urban settlements in their bellies. 
 The center, however, is firmly rooted in the postwar context of downtown New Orleans. Situated on the corner of Poydras Street and Loyola Avenue, it would be flanked by cool glass towers. An elevated section of Interstate 10 cuts through the city just to the west; the imposing form of the Superdome, its broad crisscrossing ramps extending from the street right through the structure, stands just a block away.
 Like the Superdome, the Jazz Center would be a piece of urban infrastructure: big, tilting columns raise one end so that street life slips directly underneath the building. Visitors enter by a grand staircase set beneath the bowl of a performance hall. From there, they may continue into a large exhibition space and cafe or climb another staircase to glass-encased foyers suspended above the sidewalk. 
 The curvaceous walls of the 820-seat performance hall suggest a womb floating within the city's fabric. A 350-seat ''black box'' hall sits to one side, separated by a vertical slot of glass -- the last glimpse of the outside world before entering the shared intimacy of the halls.
 The design reflects longstanding themes in Mr. Mayne's work. Like many architects of his generation, raised in the postwar optimism that made large-scale civic projects seem possible, he sees the post-industrial city as a work in progress; for him, private buildings, public space and urban infrastructure form a fluid, seamless whole.
 Mr. Mayne, more than most, imbues his designs with the progressive postwar social values. His goal is to build better, more refined machines -- an especially resonant metaphor in a city suffering because of its neglected, aging infrastructure.
 The same impulse infuses the design of Mr. Mayne's park. On a three-block-long site across Poydras Street from the Jazz Center, the park would require the demolition of the current City Hall, an undistinguished 1950s structure with minor flood damage. A new city hall would rise in its place, flanked by a new state office building and district court house. The existing public library designed in 1959 by Curtis & Davis, the city's pre-eminent Modernist firm, stands at the park's northern edge.
 This project, an effort to jumpstart downtown development, is still in its nascent stages. Conceived by Strategic Hotels and Resorts (which owns the neighboring Hyatt Hotel), it has yet to receive serious attention from the three levels of government that would pay for most of the construction.
 Yet it is possible to discern the architect's intent. The park is anchored by a great lawn at one end and by a more formal landscape at the other. A series of small band shells, for informal outdoor performances, are embedded in an undulating landscape that frames the park's outer edge. The band shells are covered by inflatable roofs that help tie the composition together while adding a sense of intimacy.
 The results are strikingly different from the unimaginative mix of tourist-friendly casinos, convention centers, retail malls and sports complexes -- often with faux historical themes -- that transform many urban centers into soulless adult theme parks. Mr. Mayne's design is based on the classical notion of the city as a vibrant democratic forum: gathering places for a vibrant intellectual and social mix. 
 The same democratic spirit imbues the waterfront proposal. The stretch of riverfront property near downtown received minimal damage during the storm. But since the 1980s, much of it has been cut off from the city by a warren of ersatz piazzas, retail malls, chain restaurants and a sprawling convention center.
 Commissioned by Sean Cummings, a local developer, the plan would give back some dignity to the downtown riverfront. A series of terraces and parks reconnect the city with the waterfront. The cheesy food kiosks at the foot of Canal Street, for example, would be swept away to create a vast plaza stepping down to the water. A reconfigured ferry terminal would bend down to meet the water's edge.
 Farther downstream, the architects propose a vast public park at the end of Poland Street, a main thoroughfare, and a public amphitheater overlooking the water. At the park's other end, a series of glittering towers would act as a counterpoint to the downtown skyline, visually connecting the eastern and western parts of the city.
 In some respects the riverfront proposal reflects the willingness to turn over large segments of the public domain to private interests. The ''towers in the park'' could be seen as reinforcing class stratification: an enclave of luxurious glass towers overlooking the poverty-stricken neighborhood of the Lower Ninth Ward. Yet the notion of the riverfront as a cohesive element in a fractured city is powerful, especially because it avoids the banal historicism threatening to engulf what's left of the authentic city.
 The problem all three projects face is that they are dependent upon government and private interests mobilizing for the public good. So far, those in charge of the rebuilding efforts have been practicing a form of benign neglect. These new architectural visions will not become reality if business interests are left to rebuild the tourist city while the public realm is ignored.

HEADLINE: Existing-Home Sales Fall to 5-Year Low

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes fell to a five-year low in July and the glut of unsold properties climbed to the highest since 1991 as the housing slump dragged on. 
 With no recovery in sight for housing, lower property values and higher mortgage costs threaten to weaken consumer spending, economists said. The Federal Reserve this month acknowledged a growing risk to economic growth because of the rout in credit markets.
 Purchases declined 0.2 percent, to an annual rate of 5.75 million, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday in Washington. While the retreat was less than forecast, inventories of single-family homes rose to the equivalent of a 9.2 months' supply. Since last year, overall existing sales were down 9 percent.
 The Midwest accounted for the decline in sales. Purchases declined 2.2 percent in the Midwest and were unchanged in the South. They increased 1 percent in the Northeast and 1.8 percent in the West.
 ''We are very likely to see home sales continue to drop,'' said Ethan S. Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Holdings in New York, who accurately predicted the number. ''There's a big imbalance between supply and demand, with lots of people who want to sell and lots of hesitant buyers.''
 Sales were projected to fall 0.9 percent, to a 5.7 million annual rate, according to the median estimate of 74 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Predictions ranged from 5.5 million to 6 million. Existing-home sales averaged 6.51 million in 2006.
 The median price of an existing home fell to $228,900, a 0.6 percent drop from July a year ago, the Realtors group said.
 The supply of homes for sale at the end of the month climbed 5.1 percent, to 4.59 million. At the current sales pace, that represented 9.6 months' worth, up from 9.1 months' worth in the previous month.
 ''Unfortunately, worse news lies ahead,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. Stricter borrowing rules mean more foreclosures and fewer qualified buyers, which will be ''adding up to lower home sales and lower prices; it is hard to see a bottom before mid-2008.''
 Monthly figures on home resales are compiled from contract closings and may reflect sales agreed upon weeks or months earlier, while new-home purchases are recorded when a contract is signed, making them a more timely barometer. Resales account for about 85 percent of the housing market.

HEADLINE: Hidden in Plain Sight, Asbestos Haunts a Town

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
''Libby, Montana'' sets a high bar for itself. An opening voice-over, covering idyllic home-movie scenes of life in the West, proclaims: ''Either this is the most horrific story I've ever heard in my life, or those people are completely crazy. It couldn't have happened.''
 The story in ''Libby,'' to be shown tonight on most PBS stations as part of the documentary series ''P.O.V.,'' is definitely horrific. It is the tale of how an entire town in Montana was exposed to asbestos for decades without its knowledge, resulting at last count in an estimated 1,500 cases of lung abnormalities in a population of about 8,000, and of how W. R. Grace & Company knew the asbestos was there. The film isn't exactly the blood-stirring anti-corporate agitprop you might expect. The directors, Drury Gunn Carr and Doug Hawes-Davis, explain in production notes on the PBS Web site, pbs.org, that they chose to structure it like a mystery, doling out information a little at a time, ''because for many people in Libby, it was a mystery why they were getting sick.'' 
 That decision mutes the anger that's clearly present and also results in a documentary that can be hard to follow and frustratingly incomplete if you don't already know the framework of the long-running and complex story.
 Mr. Carr and Mr. Hawes-Davis might have felt that we should already know the basics: Grace's problems with asbestos, which have driven the company into bankruptcy and are the subject of a continuing criminal trial, have been covered exhaustively by the national news media, beginning with an expose of the Libby tragedy in The Seattle Post-Intelligencer in 1999.
 And the filmmakers' impressionistic, elegiac approach is often suited to the report's large ironies. Those begin with the fact that what otherwise would have been an obscure fishing and logging camp had the incredible luck -- good or bad, depending on your point of view -- to sit next to a huge deposit of vermiculite, a material used in insulation and many other products.
 From there -- as the Libby mine produced 80 percent of the world's vermiculite from 1919 until it was closed in 1990, and as the vermiculite was found, as early as the 1950s, to be contaminated with tremolite, a form of asbestos -- it was Libby's treasured isolation that worked against it. Or that Grace, which took over the mine in 1963, used against it.
 In the film's most dramatic anecdote, a worker recounts learning almost by accident in 1979 that tremolite, a word known around Libby, was in fact asbestos. When he confronted a Grace official, he says, the executive threw up his hands and exclaimed, ''I thought everybody knew that.'' The asbestos was being hidden in plain sight.
 As we watch the people of Libby quietly pursuing medical claims and lobbying for help with the cleanup, it becomes clear how they have also been betrayed by their own middle-American faith in institutions -- including the Environmental Protection Agency, whose timidity and penny-pinching come in for criticism along with the economic authoritarianism practiced by Grace.
 About those medical claims: There's a scene in the film (first shown at festivals in 2004) in which a woman recites a list of drugs she's trying to have paid for under the Grace-administered plan for those with asbestos-related illnesses. It includes Vioxx. If one corporate scandal doesn't get you, another will.

HEADLINE: Japan: Bank Noted a Credit Risk

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Many members of the Bank of Japan policy board agreed in early July that there was uncertainty in the outlook for adjustments in the American housing markets because of subprime mortgage problems, minutes of the central bank's meeting of July 11-12 showed. Some members said it was not highly likely that the subprime loan problems would severely affect credit markets, the minutes showed, but if that were to happen, there was a ''possibility that global financial and economic conditions could be badly affected.'' The nine-member board agreed by an 8-1 vote to keep the overnight call rate target at 0.50 percent. The policy makers maintained the view that the United States economy would probably achieve a soft landing toward the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Taiwan-Based PC Maker Buying Gateway

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Acer, the Taiwan-based maker of personal computers, said Monday that it had reached an agreement to acquire Gateway for $710 million, a move that reorders the competitive landscape both here and abroad.
 The deal gives Acer a well-known brand name in the United States market and better access to crucial retailers, like Best Buy and Circuit City, computer industry analysts said. The deal may also help Acer build its market share in Europe. 
 Through a previous agreement, Gateway has the first right of refusal to buy Packard Bell, a computer maker with a relatively strong presence in Western Europe. Acer indicated on Monday that Gateway intended to go forward with an acquisition of Packard Bell. 
 ''Acer is making a double play here,'' said J. P. Gownder, an analyst with Forrester Research. 
 Acer said it planned to pay $1.90 a share, a 57 percent premium over Gateway's Friday close. The agreement brings to an end the independence of Gateway, which has experienced an erosion of its fortunes and prominence in the last decade.
 The deal underscores the increasingly global nature of the personal computer market. Acer, which has its headquarters and chief executive in Taipei, has a president based in Italy. It is in a fierce competition with Lenovo, based in China, to become the world's third-largest computer maker behind Dell and Hewlett-Packard.
 Lenovo, which in 2005 acquired the personal computer business of I.B.M., has indicated it would be interested in acquiring Packard Bell to bolster its own European position. But that prospect appears to be blocked by Acer's deal to acquire Gateway.
 There are challenges for Acer -- particularly in marketing multiple brand identities in the American market, industry analysts said. Acer has marketed itself as a relatively high-end brand, while Gateway has catered to the lower end of the market with its brand, emachines. 
 ''The question is how they're going to manage the brands and channels,'' said David Daoud, an analyst with IDC Research. He added that another risk was that Acer was ''acquiring a company that is losing market share.''
 IDC reported that in the second quarter, Gateway had 5.6 percent of the personal computing market in the United States, while Acer had 5.2 percent. Combined their market share puts them third behind Dell, with 28.3 percent, and Hewlett-Packard, with 23.4 percent.
 Richard Black, a spokesman for Acer America, said the company hoped to capitalize on greater access to American retailers; Acer began selling at Best Buy only this year and in Circuit City in 2006, he said. 
 In Europe, IDC said, Acer had 14 percent market share in the second quarter; if it adds Packard Bell's 3 percent market share, it could leapfrog Dell and become the second-largest vendor there, behind Hewlett-Packard. 
 Size matters in the PC industry, as shown by the success of the computer business of Hewlett-Packard, which was combined with that of Compaq. 
 Acer said that it expected the deal to give it size and scale to allow it to cut procurement and component costs. 
 Mr. Daoud said the broader challenge for Acer and its competitors is that the demand for desktop computers has been sluggish in recent years and the products have increasingly become commodities. 
 Hewlett-Packard, Dell and to some extent Acer have sought to diminish the impact of the commodity trend by marketing computers as highly personal and stylish devices rather than one-size-fits-all products. The companies that have grown the fastest in the last year, including Hewlett and Acer, have had strong sales of notebook computers.
 The Gateway acquisition will have little effect in the Asian market, outside of Japan, where Lenovo leads with about 21 percent of the market. Acer has 6.6 percent, according to IDC.
 The deal is a relatively quiet exit for Gateway, which once was synonymous in the United States with direct-to-consumer sales. Stung by the slowdown of computer consumption and falling prices and margins, the company's share price has fallen far from the heights of November 1999, when it hit $82.50. It closed at $1.82 Monday.
 Mr. Black said that Acer had not decided what it would do with Gateway's existing brands and whether it might include them in the Acer brand.

HEADLINE: 'A Normal Down Day' On Weak Home Sales

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street pulled back yesterday, losing momentum from last week's gains after news that sales of existing homes slipped in July for a fifth consecutive month stirred concerns about the strength of the economy.
 The National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing homes slipped by 0.2 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.75 million units. Inventories rose 5.1 percent to a record 4.59 million units.
 A fresh round of buyout news might have acted to limit the stock market's losses yesterday, which were small compared with the triple-digit plunges the Dow Jones industrials suffered in early August. 
 ''I think there is still a little bit of nervousness about the credit market, but that seems to be abating slowly,'' said Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist for ING Investment Management.
 ''We had a very strong week last week and I wouldn't attribute this down market to any return to panic,'' he said, referring to concerns about bad loans and a drying up of liquidity that upset markets in recent weeks. ''I think it's just a normal down day.''
 The Dow fell 56.74 points, or 0.42 percent, to 13,322.13. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.58 points, or 0.85 percent, to 1,466.79, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 15.44 points, or 0.60 percent, to 2,561.25.
 Bond prices rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling to 4.57 percent from 4.62 percent on Friday. The price rose 12/32, to 101 14/32. Bond prices move opposite their yields.
 Mr. Gendreau contended investors gained a sense last week that the subprime and credit market problems were not necessarily going to sink the economy.
 That, however, makes the likelihood of an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's next meeting less certain than it might have appeared two weeks ago, he said.
 Mr. Gendreau said the Fed has ''gone out of its way'' to add liquidity, doing so again with a $9.5 billion short-term injection into the banking system.
 There still seems to be an appetite for corporate deal making. United States Steel said it would buy Stelco of Canada for about $1.1 billion; the Swiss engineering company ABB said it would sell its oil and gas production plant to Chicago Bridge & Iron for $950 million; and the Taiwanese computer vendor Acer said it would acquire the computer maker Gateway for $710 million.
 Gateway surged 61 cents, or 50 percent, to $1.82.
 But it is possible that the huge buyout sums of this year, which drove the Dow to record highs last month, might slip as debt becomes more difficult to take on.
 Home Depot has tentatively agreed to sell its wholesale distribution business to private equity firms for $8.5 billion, which is $1.8 billion less than originally planned. The deal includes a Home Depot guarantee of $1 billion of the debt the buyers will take on to complete the transaction. Home Depot shares rose 57 cents, to $35.25.
 News of tie-ups among big companies seemed to offer little help to small-capitalization stocks. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.48 points, or 1.19 percent, to 789.45.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than two to one on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to a light 2.35 billion shares compared with 2.56 billion shares traded Friday.
 Light, sweet crude rose 88 cents to settle at $71.97 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Thornburg Pays Collateral Owed To Wachovia

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Thornburg Mortgage Inc., the jumbo mortgage specialist sued by the Wachovia Corporation last week, said yesterday that it repaid the $5.1 million in collateral that was the basis of the bank's litigation. 
 ''As promised, today Thornburg Mortgage paid Wachovia $5.1 million to meet its obligation in full, and the matter has been resolved,'' a Thornburg spokeswoman, Suzanne Lopez, said yesterday in an interview.
 A Wachovia spokeswoman, Christy Phillips-Brown, said the bank had received the payment and had not decided whether the suit, filed in United States District Court in New York, would be dropped.
 ''We're received payment on the obligation late today, and we're currently reviewing our options,'' Ms. Phillips-Brown said.
 The companies agreed this month to unwind a series of interest rate swaps, the bank said in a complaint filed Thursday in the court in New York. The bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., claimed last week that it had not then received the collateral, which was used in a derivatives transaction.
 Thornburg curtailed new lending after investors in the commercial paper market refused to buy the short-term debt it uses to finance home loans.
 The company, based in Santa Fe, N.M., has said it plans to resume normal operations in the next two weeks.
 Wachovia shares rose 9 cents, to $49.66. Thornburg fell $1.60, to $11.65.

HEADLINE: Candidates Call Anew for Rebuilding of New Orleans

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE and SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
The presidential candidates returned to New Orleans yesterday to press for the rebuilding of the city, using the coming second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina to attack the Bush administration while highlighting their own initiatives to aid the people there.
 Saying that New Orleans ''occupies a central place in my campaign,'' former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina offered a variety of proposals -- including getting more police officers into the city and improving health care -- at a forum there that also featured one of his main Democratic rivals, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York.
 Such visits to New Orleans have become a regular part of the campaign circuit for candidates in both parties, but especially for Democrats seeking to capitalize on what they say are the Katrina-related failures of the Bush administration. 
 Mr. Edwards kicked off his presidential campaign in New Orleans last December and started his much-publicized antipoverty campaign last month with a walk through the city's devastated Lower Ninth Ward.
 In addition to her visit last night, Mrs. Clinton toured the city in May, focusing on areas that benefited from the fund-raising efforts of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and the first President Bush. And Senator Barack Obama of Illinois went on a walking tour of a New Orleans neighborhood on Sunday and called for streamlining the bureaucracy to funnel aid to the city and strengthen law enforcement there.
 Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican, echoed Mr. Obama's sentiments at yesterday's forum at the University of New Orleans, saying that bureaucracy had stalled the recovery of the city. Mr. Huckabee said the government needed to put ''people first, paperwork next in a disaster the size of Katrina.''
 But no candidate is trying to associate himself more with New Orleans than Mr. Edwards, who has used the city as a microcosm for larger issues of poverty, one of his core campaign themes. 
 ''Katrina was one of the moments where the curtain is pulled away,'' Mr. Edwards said in remarks prepared for delivery last night, ''and we can all see the problems of poverty and racial discrimination for what they are, and how far we have to go for equal rights and economic justice.'' 
 Nearly every candidate has called for more police officers, better health care, and an elimination of the corruption and red tape that has slowed recovery. 
 Specifically, Mr. Edwards said he supported efforts to reduce a nursing shortage and to build a proposed biomedical corridor. He said he would prosecute cronyism among private contractors and use the settlement money to pay for more police officers. 
 He would also appoint an inspector general to examine potential misuse of federal recovery money and pick someone to oversee the rebuilding who would report directly to the president. 
 Mrs. Clinton, in her tour of New Orleans in May, had proposed streamlining federal rules to speed up the distribution of federal relief money and has also proposed legislation to make the Federal Emergency Management Agency an independent, cabinet-level department. 
 The visits came as the Republican field awaited the expected entry into the race of former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee. On a visit to Minnesota yesterday, Mr. Thompson, who has not formally declared his candidacy, signaled that an announcement would happen soon.
 ''I'll have a statement to make on that in the near future,'' he said. ''It's not part of a campaign strategy or being cute or anything like that. We've been working hard for a long time. We've been doing in a few months what others have taken years to do, in some cases.''

HEADLINE: Census Shows A Modest Gain In U.S. Income

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
The nation's median household income grew modestly in 2006, the Census Bureau reported yesterday, even as the percentage of people without health insurance hit a high. 
 Experts said the rise in income was mainly a reflection of an increase in the number of family members entering the workplace or working longer hours. Average wages for men and women actually declined for the third consecutive year. 
 ''There's lots of evidence that more people are working,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal policy group in Washington. ''The important theme going on here is a labor market that's definitely offering people more work and more hours, but at lower wages.''
 The slight improvements in household income and a drop in the poverty rate came during a period of job growth, particularly toward the end of 2006, and declining inflation as a result of falling oil prices. But in 2007, the economy has begun weakening because of the national housing slump, and inflation has jumped. The average wage peaked at $17.52 an hour in February and has since fallen, according to Labor Department data. 
 Some Republicans seized on the new data as evidence that Bush administration policies had been good for people's pocketbooks. In a statement, President Bush said the news was a sign that Congress should not raise taxes. The data, he said, confirmed ''that more of our citizens are doing better in this economy, with continued rising incomes and more Americans pulling themselves out of poverty.'' 
 But others saw a mixed picture, with household incomes still below their peak before the last recession in 2001. 
 ''Too many low- and middle-income families are not sharing in the gains,'' said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, another liberal research group. ''These figures are inconsistent with claims that the policies of recent years have produced an outstanding economic track record.''
 And the new data on the rise in the number of those uninsured prompted advocates for the poor to step up their call for Congress to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides subsidized insurance to children of the working poor. Mr. Bush has threatened to veto measures proposed by the House and Senate. 
 Changes in economic circumstances varied regionally and by race and age. 
 Although median household income rose by seven-tenths of a 1 percent over all, the only statistically significant increase was in white households. It was the first real increase for white households, after adjusting for inflation, since 1999, census officials said. 
 In the meantime, the poverty rate fell in 2006 for the first time this decade. But Hispanics were the only ethnic group with a statistically significant drop, to 20.6 percent from 21.8. The number of whites, blacks and Asians living in poverty was virtually unchanged. 
 About 24 percent of blacks lived in poverty in 2006, compared with 8.2 percent of whites and 10.3 percent of Asians.
 Elderly people appeared to have gained the most. Their poverty rate was the lowest since 1959, when the government began collecting such data. Some experts predicted that this trend would continue as hundreds of thousands of affluent baby boomers age in the next few decades. 
 Over all, the nation's median household income rose to $48,201 in 2006, from $47,845 in 2005. It was the second consecutive year in which income rose slightly faster than inflation, after five years of decline. 
 Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, said that while the year-to-year increase in household income was small, the broader picture over the last few decades was more promising and more important. 
 ''Over all,'' Mr. Besharov said, ''a lot of groups have done better over the last 40 years.''
 The West was the only region to experience a drop in the number and percentage of people in poverty last year. The South continued to have the highest poverty rate, at 13.8 percent, versus 12.3 percent nationally, and the lowest median household income, $43,884.
 Among large cities, Plano, Tex., a Dallas suburb, had the highest median household income in 2006, while Cleveland, Miami, Buffalo and Detroit had the lowest. Among smaller cities, Youngstown, Ohio, and Syracuse had some of the lowest incomes. 
 Census officials attributed the rise in the uninsured -- to 47 million from 44.8 million in 2005 -- mostly to people losing employer-provided or privately purchased health insurance. The percentage of people who received health benefits through an employer declined to 59.7 percent in 2006, from 60.2 percent in 2005.
 The percentage of people with government-provided health insurance also dropped, to 27 percent from 27.3 percent.
 ''While the employer-based system slowly unravels,'' Mr. Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute said, ''the public system isn't quite stepping up to the plate to pick up the slack, and therein lies the problem.'' 
 Mr. Besharov agreed, but said, as many critics do, that census figures did not accurately count the number of uninsured. He also said it was important to remember that employers were struggling with major increases in the cost of providing health benefits.
 ''Employers are really feeling a bite here,'' Mr. Besharov said, ''and so as much as possible, they're trying to limit these increases and push them onto the employees. That means a lot of people drop their coverage.'' 
 The number of uninsured children increased to 8.7 million, or 11.7 percent, in 2006, from 8 million, or 10.9 percent, in 2005. 
 Texas had the highest percentage of uninsured residents in 2006, 24.1, while Minnesota had the lowest, at 8.5 percent.
 Just over half of household income was concentrated in the top 20 percent of Americans in 2006, about the same as in 2005. Households in the lowest 20 percent, on the other hand, accounted for only 3.4 percent of the nation's household income. 
 Manhattan had the greatest income disparity between rich and poor residents outside Puerto Rico, according to an analysis of the data conducted for The New York Times by the sociology department of Queens College. It was followed by Apache County, Ariz., which is rural and largely American Indian, and the District of Columbia. 
 Mr. Bernstein attributed the drop in wages to the waning bargaining power of workers, and said it was disappointing, given that 2006 was the fifth year of economic recovery since the recession of 2001. 
 But Mr. Besharov said immigration could be to blame. ''Wages are pretty weak,'' he said, ''not the least because we have a lot of immigrants in this country willing to work a little more than everyone else.''

HEADLINE: Priced Out of Rome

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FITZPATRICK

 BODY:
Who wouldn't want to live in Rome, one of the most beautiful cities in world? 
 But even relatively wealthy people have thought twice about buying in the city in recent years as prices for luxury properties in the historic center now average 9,000 euros ($12,300) per square meter, or $1,143 per square foot, while a luxury home near the Spanish Steps can cost as much as 18,000 euros ($24,625) per square meter, or $2,289 per square foot.
 ''It's a wonderful place to live but prices have become overheated,'' said Barbara Mutsaers, an American who has lived in and around Rome for 38 years with her husband Anthony Mutsaers. 
 When the couple first came to Rome, they spent seven years living in the city and then almost 20 years in Frascati, one of the many castelli Romani, or ancient hilltop towns, southeast of Rome. But by 2002, they decided they wanted something less suburban.
 A chance detour brought them to a bucolic avenue dotted with old farmhouses, what the Italians call ''rustici.'' The houses sat on a ridge covered with vineyards just outside the town of Zagarolo, a town of more than 12,000 in the central Italian region of Lazio. ''It was all agricultural land then and absolutely unknown to foreign buyers, though just 30 minutes to Rome by train,'' said Mr. Mutsaers, who was working then as an economist at the United Nations's offices in the city. 
 The Mutsaers bought a 220-square-meter (2,370-square-foot) house with an acre of land and broad views over the Alban hills toward Rome. Then they set about renovating it in a modern American style. The house's main level is an open-plan style, and there are three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms. 
 They also added a terrace to the rear of the house, where they both spend long hours soaking up the warm sunshine and looking out over their lush back yard, which stretches 200 meters (656 feet) down through vineyards to a kiwi plantation. 
 But now Mr. Mutsaers is retired and the couple, both in their 70s, have decided they must sell and get something more manageable.
 The decision was made reluctantly. ''Now that the street has been discovered, the farmers have moved out and the Sunday farmers, like us, have moved in,'' Mr. Mutsaers said. ''But the area retains its feeling of seclusion and has become something of a retreat for movie people. Ursula Andress lives up the road.''
 According to real estate agents at Tecnocasa, a real estate agency, sale prices in Zagarolo vary from 2,100 euros ($2,870) per square meter, or $267 per square foot in the historic center to 1,700 euros ($2,325) per square meter, or $216 per square foot outside of town. 
 But the Mutsaers warn that those numbers will be changing soon. ''Prices will rise abruptly once the Metro comes here and when the New York University campus they are building here is finished next year,'' Mr. Mutsaers said.
 And, while the prices may be attractive compared with central Rome, anyone who doesn't speak Italian will find the process to be a difficult one. Much of Lazio remains ''undiscovered'' by foreign buyers so there are few English-speaking agents, Mrs. Mutsaers said. ''It's all word of mouth around here. It's not like Tuscany where there are lots of agents used to working with foreigners, so it's difficult to find what you want, though there is fantastic potential,'' she added.
 ''All quite surprising,'' Mr. Mutsaers said. ''You have all this and Rome on your doorstep. I can't think of anything better.''

HEADLINE: Bleak Findings on Health Insurance

 BODY:
The Census Bureau's report on the state of American health insurance was as disturbing as its statistics on poverty and income. The bureau reported a large increase in the number of Americans who lack health insurance, data that ought to send an unmistakable message to Washington: vigorous action is needed to reverse this alarming and intractable trend. 
 The number of uninsured Americans has been rising inexorably over the past six years as soaring health care costs have driven up premiums, employers have scaled back or eliminated health benefits and hard-pressed families have found themselves unable to purchase insurance at a reasonable price. Last year, the number of uninsured Americans increased by a daunting 2.2 million, from 44.8 million in 2005 to 47.0 million in 2006. That scotched any hope that the faltering economic recovery would help alleviate the problem.
 The main reason for the upsurge in uninsured Americans is that employment-based coverage continued to deteriorate. Indeed, the number of full-time workers without health insurance rose from 20.8 million in 2005 to 22.0 million in 2006, presumably because either the employers or the workers or both found it too costly. 
 Sadly, the one area where the nation had made progress -- reducing the number of uninsured children -- took a turn for the worse. The number of uninsured children under 18 dropped steadily and significantly from 1999 to 2004, thanks largely to an expansion in coverage of low-income children under two programs operated jointly by the states and the federal government, Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Then last year the number of uninsured children jumped more than 600,000 to reach 8.6 million. The main reason, advocacy groups say, is that access and funding for the low-income programs became tighter while employer coverage for dependents eroded.
 The challenge to the White House and Congress seems clear. The upward trend in the number of uninsured needs to be reversed because many studies have shown that people who lack health insurance tend to forgo needed care until they become much sicker and go to expensive emergency rooms for treatment. That harms their health and drives up everyone's health care costs.
 The most immediate need is to reauthorize and expand the expiring State Children's Health Insurance Program. It has already brought health coverage to millions of young Americans. It should be reinvigorated to bring coverage to many millions more.

HEADLINE: Calls Grow for Foreigners to Have a Say on U.S. Market Rules

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and KATRIN BENNHOLD

 BODY:
Politicians, regulators and financial specialists outside the United States are seeking a role in the oversight of American markets, banks and rating agencies after recent problems related to subprime mortgages.
 Their argument is simple: The United States is exporting financial products, but losses to investors in other countries suggest that American regulators are not properly monitoring the products or alerting investors to the risks.
 ''We need an international approach, and the United States needs to be part of it,'' said Peter Bofinger, a member of the German government's economics advisory board and a professor at the University of Wurzburg.
 While regulators in the United States have not been receptive to the idea in the past, analysts said that Europe and Asia had more leverage now. Washington might have to yield if it wants to succeed in imposing bilateral regulations on government-owned investment funds from emerging economies. 
 ''America depends on the rest of the world to finance its debt,'' Mr. Bofinger said. ''If our institutions stopped buying their financial products, it would hurt.'' 
 Half a dozen American banking and financial regulators -- including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board -- had no comment. Several noted that they were not the sole regulators of the subprime market.
 In general, Washington's reaction has been that it wants ''no form of oversight,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. 
 Banks and investment funds from China to France suffered losses after buying mortgage-related securities and complex financial products based on them in the United States. 
 In many cases, investors were caught by surprise because American rating agencies had given the products top ratings, leading buyers to believe there was little risk. International investors are also asking why American lenders were allowed to give mortgages to home buyers who could not repay them.
 ''In a globalized economy with hedge funds, leveraged buyouts and all these investment funds, we have to ask the question about more transparency,'' said Claude Bebear, the chairman of the supervisory board of the insurance company AXA. 
 In Europe, the credit crisis appears to have emboldened those who have long been pushing for stricter international rules. 
 Washington and London rebuffed the German government earlier when it pushed for an international code of conduct for hedge funds. Now some economic advisers to the German government are going further, suggesting that rating agencies should be nationalized, that large-scale loans be registered publicly and that minimum standards be developed for complex debt securities. 
 The head of the Council of Economic Analysis in France, which advises the prime minister, said hedge funds should be subject to stricter disclosure rules about their risk exposure. 
 Christian de Boissieu, president of the group and a member of the Committee for Credit and Investment Institutions, which helps regulate French banks, is calling for a global register of hedge funds. In addition, he said, complex securities should be scrutinized before being sold to bank portfolios. 
 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who has vowed to ''moralize financial capitalism,'' has asked his finance minister, Christine Lagarde, to prepare a proposal for stricter disclosure rules on market participants before an October meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 7. On Monday, in a foreign policy speech, Mr. Sarkozy called again for stronger global regulations to avoid financial crises. 
 The Chinese central bank said yesterday that it was moving to standardize disclosure of all asset-backed securities as it increases its own market for the financial instruments. Information about loans, terms and borrowers will need to be included in any new securities in China, it said.
 The United States and Britain are the source of the bulk of the world's sophisticated financial products, like the ones that broke down recently. 
 ''At the heart of the issue is that the largest financial institutions continue to innovate and create ever more sophisticated products,'' said Chris Rexworthy, director of enhanced regulatory services at IMS Consulting in London and a former regulator with the Financial Services Authority in Britain. 
 Regulators talk about the importance of stress-testing, Mr. Rexworthy said, but recent developments create concerns that ''institutions are either not investing enough effort in this, getting it wrong, or just producing things too complex for their risk-assessment models to cope with.'' 
 ''Greater cooperation on the international stage between regulators is undoubtedly one of the things we need to see more of.'' 
 United States regulators are aware of the problem. Regulators have found that credit standards were loosened for home loans, and that borrowers in some cases did not understand or qualify for the loans they were given. 
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said in June that the department was seeking better oversight, increased efficiency and a reduction in overlap in general.
 Some American regulators have been pushing for more international cooperation. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been discussing greater oversight of hedge funds, and it signed several cooperation agreements with regulators from China to Germany in the last 18 months. 
 The S.E.C. understands ''the need for closer international cooperation,'' said Andrew Larcos, the public affairs officer for the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the global regulatory body. 
 Still, Mr. Larcos added, because the subprime mortgage loans that started the crisis were primarily from the United States, the situation obviously raises questions about market regulation.
 In the United States, much of the focus is on rating agencies, which are paid by banks for rating products, and which sometimes attached investment-grade ratings to securities that turned out to be not up to that standard. 
 Joseph Mason, a finance professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia, and Josh Rosner, the managing director of the research firm Graham Fisher, have pushed for more oversight of rating agencies. 
 ''It's not just the U.S. regulators that failed, though they did fail,'' Mr. Rosner said. International regulators have ''thrown the keys to the rating agencies,'' which have been left in charge of the safety and soundness of bank capital, insurance and pension money. 
 In Australia, where investors have embraced financial products like derivatives and swaps, several hedge funds were hard hit by exposure to subprime loans, and analysts said they expected it would be months before the extent of the problem became clear. 
 As geographical boundaries are broken down, ''a problem in one location is a problem everywhere,'' said Dick Bryan, a professor of economics at the University of Sydney. 
 ''There is the need to challenge the sovereignty of national regulators,'' he said. ''Why should the rules of lending in the U.S. be left to U.S. regulators when the consequences go everywhere?'' 
 Asian nations were pushing for regional cooperation even before the latest credit problems, as cross-border investing and their equity markets have boomed. 
 Whether the outcry will result in changes remains to be seen. Soon after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, President Bill Clinton and a number of regulators and politicians pushed to remake the global financial system. But the impetus faded as markets stabilized.
 Economists now expect an increase in international regulation, particularly because Washington has raised questions about the need to impose standards on large investment funds controlled by countries like Russia and China.
 Ms. Lagarde, the French finance minister, predicted that negotiations might indeed succeed. ''There are a lot of shifts happening,'' she said. ''Once the dust has settled we will see where the different powers stand and what will be on the bargaining table.''

HEADLINE: Wages Are on the Rise in China As Young Workers Grow Scarce

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHENZHEN, China, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
At the Dahon bicycle factory here, Zhang Jingming's fingers move quickly and methodically -- grabbing bicycle seats, wrapping them in cardboard and smoothly attaching them to frames. 
 Working a 45-hour week, Mr. Zhang makes the equivalent of $263 a month; as recently as February, he was making just $197. Some of his higher pay comes from working more efficiently. ''When I first started, I wasn't this fast,'' he said. 
 But a good portion reflects a raise Mr. Zhang got: to 1.45 cents for each bicycle seat from 1.32 cents. It is a small difference that signifies major change. 
 Chinese wages are on the rise. No reliable figures for average wages exist; the government's economic data are notably unreliable. But factory owners and experts who monitor the nation's labor market say that businesses are having a hard time finding able-bodied workers and are having to pay the workers they can find more money. 
 And higher wages in China are likely to lead to higher prices in the United States -- at the mall, at the grocery, even at the gas pump. 
 Chinese companies are already passing along some of their higher costs to overseas customers. Prices for goods from China, after years of gradual decline, have risen 1.2 percent since February, according to the Labor Department. July's increase was the biggest yet: 0.4 percent compared with June. Chinese companies and contractors are also passing on the cost of the rising value of their currency, the yuan, up 8.8 percent against the dollar in the last two years.
 For decades, many labor economists said that China's vast population would supply a nearly bottomless pool of workers. So many people would be seeking jobs at any given time, this reasoning went, that wages in this country would be stuck just above subsistence levels. As recently as four years ago, some experts estimated that most of the perhaps 150 million underemployed workers in the countryside would be heading to cities.
 Instead, sporadic labor shortages started to appear in 2003 at factories in the Pearl River delta of southeastern China. Now those shortages have spread to factories up and down the Chinese coast, specialists say. 
 This summer, Mary Gallagher, a Chinese labor specialist at the University of Michigan, visited five sportswear factories near Shanghai and Guangzhou. She found them all struggling to hire and retain workers. One had shut one of its two main production lines because it had nobody to sew shirts and other garments.
 ''Basically half the factory was shut down and one dormitory was empty,'' Ms. Gallagher said.
 In interviews, factory executives across the country complained of being forced to give double-digit raises in order to find and keep young workers at all skill levels. Three or four years ago, said Zhong Yi, vice general manager of a leather-jacket manufacturer in Hangzhou in east-central China, 800 to 1,100 yuan a month ($105 to $145) ''was a good salary.'' 
 ''Now,'' he said, ''1,500 is the bottom'' ($198). 
 Chinese officials are quick to say that there is no overall shortage of labor -- rather, there is a shortage of young workers willing to accept the low wages that prevailed in the 1990s. Factories in cities like Guangzhou advertise heavily for young workers, even while employment offices consider it a success if someone over 40 can find any job in less than a year.
 ''Now they're taking workers into their early 30s,'' said Jonathan Unger, director of the Contemporary China Center at Australian National University in Canberra, ''but anything older than that and they think they can't take the conditions, the 11-hour days,'' as well as work on weekends, and a tedious life in factory-owned dormitories. 
 Plant owners' refusal to hire blue-collar workers over 35 or 40 is colliding with the demographic reality of China's one-child policy. The number of workers in the 20-to-24-year-old range is already shrinking as more of them go to universities instead of entering the work force after high school, and the International Labor Organization projects that workers in this age range will edge slowly downward through at least 2020.
 Visiting villages from tropical Gaoyao in the southeastern corner of the country to dusty Houxinqiu in the northeast, it is striking how few young adults remain after so many have left for the cities. A recent government survey of 2,749 villages in 17 provinces and autonomous regions found that in 74 percent of villages, there were no workers fit to travel to distant cities, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
 A separate report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences warned of coming labor shortages even in rural areas as soon as 2009.
 This lack of laborers of desirable age is hardly making China a worker's paradise. Factory wages remain extremely low by Western standards: roughly $1 an hour for better-paid workers near the coast, compared with as little as 50 cents early this decade.
 The pay looks especially low in dollar terms, partly because China has intervened in the currency markets to hold down the value of the yuan and keep exports competitive. The cost of living is low in dollar terms for the same reason; entrees at an air-conditioned restaurant three blocks from the bicycle factory here start at 50 cents for a large plate of fried rice.
 Moreover, labor regulation is weak in China, as shown most vividly this year by the discovery that brick kilns in the north of the country had kidnapped and enslaved hundreds of children and mentally disadvantaged adults, working them under brutal conditions with little or no pay. 
 And wages are stagnating in the middle of the labor market -- workers who consider themselves too educated for entry-level jobs in a garment factory, but lacking the skills or experience to command a premium salary elsewhere. ''It's easy to find a job with not a very high salary,'' said Chen Zheng, a 24-year-old auto worker and high school graduate in Ningbo. ''It's not easy if you want a higher wage.'' 
 The hardest variable to judge in China's changing labor market is the pace of productivity growth. Since there are few reliable statistics, the best way to assess productivity is to look at individual factories like the Dahon operation here, which produces bicycles that collapse for easy storage.
 David T. Hon, chief executive of the privately held Dahon Group, said that while he had been raising wages 10 to 15 percent a year, the average labor cost for each bicycle had actually edged downward. This is possible, he said, because sales are growing 30 percent a year and increasingly large-scale production has brought savings. The cost of engineering a new bicycle design, or handling the accounting and other back-office operations, is spread over more and more bicycles as production rises.
 The price changes in China are unlikely to immediately affect broad measures of inflation in the United States though longer-term effects are likely, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in a speech on March 2, just as prices for imports from China were reaching a low point. Mr. Bernanke suggested that the price changes would have minimum effect because the total of Chinese imports was small in relation to the broad American economy. 
 A bigger question, one harder to answer, is how much cheap Chinese imports have forced American manufacturers to keep their own prices low. And will that price restraint persist if Chinese products become more expensive?
 For instance, American, European and Japanese automakers have been putting a lot of pressure on parts suppliers to cut prices by forcing them to compete for contracts with low-cost Chinese producers.
 Rising overall incomes in China also affect American inflation indirectly. Higher incomes in this country contribute to soaring demand by Chinese for cars, air-conditioners and other energy-consuming products.
 China is now the world's second-largest oil importer after the United States. More demand will help push up global oil prices and inflation.

HEADLINE: A Sobering Census Report

 BODY:
The economic party is winding down and most working Americans never even got near the punch bowl.
 The Census Bureau reported yesterday that median household income rose 0.7 percent last year -- it's second annual increase in a row-- to $48,201. The share of households living in poverty fell to 12.3 percent from 12.6 percent in 2005. This seems like welcome news, but a deeper look at the belated improvement in these numbers -- more than five years after the end of the last recession -- underscores how the gains from economic growth have failed to benefit most of the population. 
 The median household income last year was still about $1,000 less than in 2000, before the onset of the last recession. In 2006, 36.5 million Americans were living in poverty -- 5 million more than six years before, when the poverty rate fell to 11.3 percent.
 And what is perhaps most disturbing is that it appears this is as good as it's going to get. 
 Sputtering under the weight of the credit crisis and the associated drop in the housing market, the economic expansion that started in 2001 looks like it might enter history books with the dubious distinction of being the only sustained expansion on record in which the incomes of typical American households never reached the peak of the previous cycle. It seems that ordinary working families are going to have to wait -- at the very minimum -- until the next cycle to make up the losses they suffered in this one. There's no guarantee they will.
 The gains against poverty last year were remarkably narrow. The poverty rate declined among the elderly, but it remained unchanged for people under 65. Analyzed by race, only Hispanics saw poverty decline on average while other groups experienced no gains.
 The fortunes of middle-class, working Americans also appear less upbeat on closer consideration of the data. Indeed, earnings of men and women working full time actually fell more than 1 percent last year.
 This suggests that when household incomes rose, it was because more members of the household went to work, not because anybody got a bigger paycheck. The median income of working-age households, those headed by somebody younger than 65, remained more than 2 percent lower than in 2001, the year of the recession.
 Over all, the new data on incomes and poverty mesh consistently with the pattern of the last five years, in which the spoils of the nation's economic growth have flowed almost exclusively to the wealthy and the extremely wealthy, leaving little for everybody else.
 Standard measures of inequality did not increase last year, according to the new census data. But over a longer period, the trend becomes crystal clear: the only group for which earnings in 2006 exceeded those of 2000 were the households in the top five percent of the earnings distribution. For everybody else, they were lower. 
 This stilted distribution of rewards underscores how economic growth alone has been insufficient to provide better living standards for most American families. What are needed are policies to help spread benefits broadly -- be it more progressive taxation, or policies to strengthen public education and increase access to affordable health care. 
 Unfortunately, these policies are unlikely to come from the current White House. This administration prefers tax cuts for the lucky ones in the top five percent.

HEADLINE: Between the Mumbles, Images of Sorrowful Poetry

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Aaron Katz's film ''Quiet City'' is punctuated with images of New York at twilight that cast a mood of reflective melancholy reminiscent of the loneliness at the heart of Edward Hopper paintings. Silhouettes of television aerials against a glowing orange and purple sky; yellow traffic lights on a nearly deserted avenue; a silvery subway train in the middle distance slipping through the dusky, blue-gray light; an industrial landscape at sunset: These and other beautiful images, photographed by Andrew Reed, resonate with the characters' lives.
 ''Quiet City'' belongs to the movie genre labeled mumblecore, so named partly because the young, nerdy characters in these films rarely address any subject outside their immediate social sphere. If they don't actually mumble their words, the tone of their conversations is restricted to various shades of chat, much of which seems trivial. It is a filmmaking sensibility, filtered through Jean-Luc Godard and John Cassavetes and distantly related to punk, with the spirit of defiance replaced by resignation to the art of diminished expectations. 
 God, as they say, is in the details. And as the two main characters, Jamie (Erin Fisher), a visitor to New York from Atlanta, and Charlie (Cris Lankenau), a recently unemployed New York resident, make their way through Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, you are as likely to define them by who they're not as by who they are. 
 They're not the sort of sexed-up would-be celebutantes who overrun MTV, VH1 and tabloid television. Nor are they soulless, well-tailored M.B.A.'s or eccentric dot-com visionaries with billionaire agendas on whom the media also likes to dote. 
 Clean-cut bohemians might be the most accurate description, although there is nothing especially arty about their demeanor. Charlie confesses that his ideal job would be one in which he supported himself doing absolutely nothing. Jamie admits, with some embarrassment, that she works in an Applebee's restaurant. She is very pretty, while Charlie, who doesn't seem to have a vain bone in his body, epitomizes the word schlub.
 For all its air of casualness and the actors' unerring ability to deliver semi-improvised dialogue that sounds overheard, ''Quiet City'' is a formal movie, elegantly edited, whose images, both still and moving, are conjoined to a soundtrack that reduces the noise of the city to an evocative background hum, quiet but not silent. When music intrudes, it tends to be minimalist pop played on a toy keyboard. 
 Jamie and Charlie meet by chance in a nearly deserted subway station when Jamie, dragging a suitcase, approaches him to ask for directions to a diner where she is supposed to meet her New York friend Samantha. Charlie escorts her there and waits for Samantha to appear, but she never does. 
 He eventually invites Jamie to hang out at his apartment, and the two end up spending the next 24 hours drifting around New York. They drop in on a friend of Charlie's to retrieve a borrowed hat, and visit a Park Slope art opening and its after-party. 
 The mumblecore genre, with its minimalist aesthetics, minuscule budgets, home-movie casting of friends and acquaintances and its fly-on-the-wall, quasi-documentary spontaneity, is so wide-open for parody that it is a sitting duck for the most withering send-up. ''Quiet City'' is fortunate to arrive just before the inevitable demolition crews arrive to tear it to shreds. Tender and sad, it is a fully realized work of mumblecore poetry.

HEADLINE: In Troubled District, School Starts With Enough Books but Not Enough Money

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: ROOSEVELT, N.Y., Aug. 22 

 BODY:
Students returning to school here can expect to find some things they have learned to do without in the five years their district has been under state control: enough textbooks for everyone, correct class assignments, even toilet paper in the bathrooms.
 But after hiring new teachers and adding Advanced Placement classes, the 2,800-student district in Nassau County faces an $8 million debt. It expects to run short of cash for salaries, buses and utilities by October unless the State Legislature authorizes a bailout, without which district administrators say they will have to borrow more or shut the schools.
 ''It's like a sword of Damocles; you're kind of waiting and waiting and holding your breath,'' said William J. Brosnan, the state-appointed interim superintendent. He took over in July after the previous superintendent resigned amid criticism over the deficit. ''It's very serious if you can't pay your bills.''
 After decades of mismanagement and weak student performance, in 2002 Roosevelt became the only one of more than 700 school districts in New York ever taken over by the Education Department, which has since poured about $200 million into the district for improvements, including new buildings. 
 Five years on, the mounting financial crisis has elicited outrage and recriminations from parents, teachers and community leaders over what they see as the state's failure to turn around a struggling district that is almost entirely black and Hispanic; four out of five students are poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-rate lunch.
 ''It's worse today than when they took it over,'' said Frank Scott, co-chairman of the Roosevelt Watch Society, a community group formed in 2005 to scrutinize school operations. ''You have parents and taxpayers who are so beaten down they don't know what to do. They just give up.''
 Some critics have called for the district to be consolidated with those of more affluent nearby communities, saying that Roosevelt lacks the tax base to support its own school system. Many residents have long contended that the state takeover was engineered, in large part, to keep their students out of better-off districts. 
 ''New York State has no solution for the school district, so it's keeping it on life support,'' said Alan Singer, an education professor at Hofstra University in Hempstead. ''Roosevelt has become the state's Iraq. It's a quagmire and it cannot get out.''
 The state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, said it had been difficult to oversee the district's finances because administrators were often late in providing financial reports and information about purchases. 
 Mr. Mills said he did not use the state's special authority to appoint a full-time fiscal administrator for the district until last year because he did not realize the extent of the problems until an audit revealed lax budget practices and spending controls that were sometimes ''deliberately overridden.''
 ''Certainly, the state -- my colleagues and I -- should have seen the problems earlier,'' Mr. Mills said in a phone interview. ''When we did see it, it was too late to prevent a deficit.'' 
 The bailout of the Roosevelt schools has stalled in the Legislature, largely over a disagreement about who should pay the debt. In June, the State Senate passed a bill to close the fiscal gap with an advance in state aid that would be paid back over 30 years. But some Assembly members want the $8 million to be carved out of the Education Department's budget, something the department says is unconstitutional. 
 The district has improved graduation rates and test scores in recent years despite its financial woes. For instance, 90 percent of fourth graders passed the English test this spring and 89 percent the math test, and the statewide averages are 68 percent in English and 80 percent in math. But among seventh graders, 40 percent passed the English test and 22 percent the math test, and the statewide averages at that level are 58 percent in English and 66 percent in math. 
 Even as the district has made some academic gains, many students and their parents describe a chaotic learning environment. As the schools prepare to open, the district lacks a high school principal and a permanent superintendent. Parents complain about a badly pockmarked parking lot at the high school. The football team, which won the Long Island championship last year, practices with equipment donated by other districts. 
 Brian Taylor, 17, said he probably could have done better than a C in his geosciences class last year if he had his own textbook to complete homework assignments, rather than having to search for answers on the Internet. Georgia Thompson, also 17, said she was one of many students who spent the first week of school last year in the guidance office trying to sort out mistakes in their schedules. ''It's not fun to go to school here with these problems,'' she said, ''but you can't do anything but make the most of it.''
 Under state control, Roosevelt has received an extra $6 million a year in state aid; last year, according to the state comptroller's office, the district got about $34 million -- more than half its $63 million budget -- from Albany and Washington. 
 In addition, the state has committed more than $180 million to replace the three elementary schools with new structures -- two of which have been completed -- and build a new middle school and renovate the high school. 
 State education officials appoint the Roosevelt superintendent and four of the five school board members; the fifth was elected for the first time this spring, and the rest of the board is scheduled to return to local control by 2011. The state is also required by law to approve any purchases of $25,000 or more.
 A state comptroller's audit concluded in March that Roosevelt administrators repeatedly overestimated state aid and overspent their budget. For the 2005-6 school year, the district budgeted $25.3 million for salaries, a decrease of $1.5 million from the year before, then spent $28 million, adding 45 positions.
 Ronald O. Ross, who was appointed by Mr. Mills and served as superintendent from 2004 to 2007, said he had focused on improving academic matters, adding Advanced Placement classes and a Chinese language program and strengthening the chess team, and left the finances to state officials and district business administrators. ''I was trying to put in place the things the kids needed,'' Mr. Ross said. ''The state took it over, and they were not willing to put in the money that was needed.'' 
 Roger Tilles, the Long Island representative on the State Board of Regents, said Mr. Ross was a polarizing figure who was quick to become defensive. He recalled how Mr. Ross once stood up at a Regents meeting and declared, ''I don't know about you, but when I wake up in the morning, my underwear says Fruit of the Loom and not Superman.''
 ''The state had appointed people who were, in my opinion, incompetent,'' Mr. Tilles said. ''It was clear that this was a job that wasn't being handled right.''
 Mr. Mills responded to Roosevelt's financial crisis by sending 50 staff members to the district last spring to review its operations, and assigning a senior deputy commissioner to oversee the district personally. Nineteen administrative and teaching positions have been eliminated since January to cut costs, while a full-time auditor from the state comptroller's office has been in the district since June.
 District administrators say they have also made a number of academic improvements. For instance, class schedules were mailed home after first being reviewed by guidance counselors for errors. Honors math and science classes were created for ninth graders. Social studies textbooks have been updated in the elementary schools, and extra textbooks were ordered to fill shortages at the middle school and high school.
 ''It's a new day in Roosevelt,'' Mr. Brosnan said. ''We've been through the crisis -- the crucible -- and now we're in the rebuilding process.'' 
 But many residents say the schools cannot move forward with an $8 million debt hanging over its head.
 ''I thought they were improving things until the last budget came out,'' said Carrie Hall, a retired nurse with a 10-year-old son, who said she could not afford an increase in her $6,000-plus annual property taxes. ''I'm thinking about selling and moving away, because it's ridiculous.''
 Robert Summerville, Roosevelt's lone elected school board member, said he remained skeptical about the state's promises after years of waiting.
 ''How many times have they run that same commercial?'' he said. ''I've been around long enough and seen enough to know there's no substance to their claims. Until I see it, I don't believe it.''

HEADLINE: Belonging and Belief, Found in Scrap Lumber

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
In the world of museums and galleries, the British artist Mike Nelson is highly respected: he was recently included for a second time on the shortlist for the Turner Prize, whose winner is to be announced in December. People tend to return Mr. Nelson's calls. They show up for meetings with him.
 But in the other world he has inhabited, just as long and almost as fully -- that of junkyards and demolition sites, the shadowy resting places of detritus he mines around the world in search of raw material for his artwork -- his name does not carry quite the same weight.
 ''Um, I don't know, maybe he'll be here in 20 minutes or so,'' mumbled a man the other day in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, half napping outside the closed shutters of an unmarked salvage repository whose owner had assured Mr. Nelson that he would open at noon and who, not for the first time, had failed to show. 
 Three quarters of an hour passed. Another man, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt, black velvet riding hat and a tremendous amount of wooden neck jewelry, arrived pushing a grocery cart and informed Mr. Nelson that the junkman in charge was having van problems and would not be appearing anytime soon.
 Mr. Nelson, in search of old metal doors and jambs for a New York project, returned to his rented Silverado pickup and, consulting his Hagstrom map, plunged back into the streets of Brooklyn.
 ''The story of my life here,'' he said, smiling bitterly. ''Every time I show up at one of these places, it's some guy who's had problems with his van.''
 It is no insult, and no exaggeration, to say that Mr. Nelson is one of the best trash trawlers in the international art world, a keen connoisseur of the world's castoffs who has haggled with junk purveyors in places as far-flung as Sao Paulo, Istanbul, Melbourne, Venice, San Francisco, Geneva and London, where he lives and works.
 His artworks are not exactly objects but, in the tradition of Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, whole environments, warrens of rooms and corridors, fake taxi offices and crack dens, constructed from and furnished with the things he scavenges in the cities where he creates exhibitions. 
 One writer has described Mr. Nelson's constructions as neither reality nor fantasy but a ''third space'' that ''opens out onto both.'' 
 More than a month ago Mr. Nelson, 40, took up temporary residence in New York to begin one of his largest projects, commissioned by the public art organization Creative Time. That installation, ''A Psychic Vacuum,'' is a labyrinthine construction within a long-derelict wing of the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side. Viewers will find their way through it (or not, if they become lost), passing by spaces that evoke the tattoo parlors and storefront psychics of the neighborhood, places Mr. Nelson sees partly as emblems of a search for belonging and belief in America. 
 The exhibition, to open on Sept. 8, is his first major show in the United States and also his first experience contending with the entrenched and enigmatic interests of the junk economy on the East Coast, which he rates alongside Istanbul as the most difficult he has ever encountered. 
 ''It's dreadful,'' he said of the New York junk market, in his quick, clipped accent. ''It's awful.''
 One problem in the sometimes illicit world of salvage, where issues of ownership and taxes can be as twisted as scrap metal, is simply getting the sellers to show up and do business. He had some luck in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, buying convex surveillance mirrors from a man named Georgie, who was closing an old variety store. 
 Sometimes, as he did the other day on the way to get coffee, he spots a pile of street lumber on its way from a gutted apartment to the dump. He immediately grabbed his cellphone to alert a builder working with him. 
 ''It's some two-by-fours and a nice bit of lath,'' he reported cheerfully. ''Remember that place where we got those radiators that time?''
 But he often meets with unexplained reluctance (negotiations with two elusive men near Philadelphia foundered in a McDonald's, where the men do business) or plain old price gouging. ''Normally this is the kind of junk people just give away,'' he said, ''but for some reason I can't find any of it here. Or none that I can afford.''
 Nato Thompson, a Creative Time curator working with Mr. Nelson, said that part of the difficulty lay in the very nature of Mr. Nelson's work, in which constructed spaces are meticulously made to feel as if they have not been constructed, or at least not as artworks. They seem to have sprung up fully formed, like something out of the fevered minds of the authors Mr. Nelson favors: Edgar Allan Poe, Jorge Luis Borges, William S. Burroughs, H. P. Lovecraft.
 In the hulking old Essex Street building, for example, Mr. Nelson has put together expanses of creaking wood floors from salvaged wood. The battered floors appear as if they have been in the market since its construction during the La Guardia administration, but they, and the heavy metal doors that open onto mazelike corridors, have been there only a few weeks.
 ''A lot of the architectural elements that will be in this show people won't even notice consciously, but they will notice them subconsciously,'' Mr. Thompson said. 
 He added, though, that such a specific stratum of junk was not easy to come by. ''A lot of the stuff is too old to be considered something you'd want to sell on eBay, but not old enough to be considered vintage.''
 Or, as Mr. Nelson says: ''It takes a lot of effort to make something look as if it's been there forever, as if it's old. It's really kind of perverse.''
 On a recent afternoon inside the market Mr. Nelson and four workers were hammering and sawing, sweating profusely with no air-conditioning. Walls and hallways were beginning to take shape. In a back area Mr. Nelson had begun to stockpile the smaller things he would use to detail the individual rooms. Against one wall were piles of old magazines and posters and dusty lights and bar stools.
 On a worktable next to a pack of cigarillos sat Mr. Nelson's current reading, a book about werewolves by Montague Summers, an eccentric British author known for his translation of a medieval witch-hunter's manual.
 Mr. Nelson, whose shaggy black beard climbs his cheeks, warned, leering, ''It's probably best to avoid me on the full moon.''
 He dearly wishes, however, that the debris dealers of New York would not. After several hours of scavenging through Bedford-Stuyvesant that day, he returned in the afternoon with no more than a ceramic light socket and a circular fluorescent fixture with fake wood grain.
 ''Quite lovely pieces, those,'' he said sarcastically, adding, ''Just another normal day for me -- and an empty truck.''
 Mike Nelson's ''Psychic Vacuum'' runs Sept. 8 to Oct. 28, Fridays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m., at the Essex Street Market, 117 Delancey Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side. Admission is free; (212) 206-6674; www.creativetime.org.

HEADLINE: Volatile Markets? Art World Takes Stock

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The fall art auctions are almost three months away, galleries are still in their summer hiatus, and the Dow keeps fluctuating. But the art world is wondering how volatile financial markets might affect its own specialized market. What will happen at the major art auctions in November? Will collectors pull back on buying sprees until the mortgage lending industry stabilizes? Will sellers decline to consign their art, assuming that the run of record prices in recent years is due for a reversal? Or will they rush to sell now, fearing that by spring prices will be lower? 
 ''There is a potential for a very big change here,'' said Maxwell L. Anderson, a former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art who recently became director of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. ''If there is a short-term flood of the market with attempted sales of works, which then depresses the value of works that are available, the unhappy effect is it creates a general dampening of enthusiasm for buying art.''
 Eli Broad, the billionaire Los Angeles collector, predicts that troubles in the subprime mortgage market will rein in recent astounding levels of spending. 
 ''We've seen an unprecedented appreciation of contemporary art in the 35 years that I've been collecting,'' he said. ''We're bound to have a correction. I don't know if it will happen at the November auctions, or it will happen next May.''
 Back in June, soaring prices had prompted Mr. Broad to predict that the art market could be headed for a downturn like the one in the 1990s. And these days he remains wary. ''I'm not sure we've seen the worst yet,'' he said.
 The auction houses, unsurprisingly, present a more optimistic reading and say that art sales do not always follow economic cycles. ''These kinds of assets don't tend to react -- in the past -- on a week-to-week basis to market volatility,'' said William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby's chief executive. ''If we go into a broad recessionary environment, undoubtedly that has an implication. But in the short to medium term, I believe there will be continued strong demand from all over the world for great works of art.''
 Although it is in their interest to be bullish, the auction executives can point to recent history to support their position. The 1987 stock market crash was followed by a two-year acceleration in the art market, Mr. Ruprecht noted, adding that a similar upswing came after the 1998 economic downturn. 
 The Doyle New York auction house even achieved record sales after the crash of 1987. In 1989 a Chardin still life sold there for $2.5 million, then the highest auction price for an 18th-century painting, and a Rembrandt print fetched a record $990,000. 
 ''Over the last 20 years, the market has dropped a little and come roaring back,'' said Elaine Banks Stainton, the executive director of Doyle's paintings and drawings department.
 Michael Moses, who helped create the Mei/Moses Fine Art Index of prices, said the art market tended to follow the financial market by six months to a year. ''We do have this historical phenomenon of the art market lagging behind the stock market,'' he said. ''It requires substantial change in wealth for a long period of time before people decide to change their investment decisions.''
 ''When the big sales come along in November and December,'' he added, ''the stock markets might be doing something totally different. Art is a much slower-moving market only because it doesn't trade that often.''
 While some buyers may drop out, auction house executives say, others will step in: the pool of potential buyers has increased as collectors grow more diverse. 
 ''The art market today feels as if it is substantially more global, with substantially broader groups of people -- with different sources of wealth, with different perspectives on volatility,'' Mr. Ruprecht said. ''You've got entrepreneurial wealth, you've got Asian wealth, Russian wealth, Middle Eastern wealth, petroleum wealth, financial wealth -- all, in many cases, competing for a common group of things.''
 The most competitive categories are contemporary, Modern, Impressionist, old masters and 19th-century paintings. But others areas, notably Asian art, are emerging.
 ''For every downside, there are always opportunities on the other side,'' said Kathleen M. Doyle, chairwoman of Doyle, which will hold its first sale of contemporary Chinese art in the fall.
 Marc Porter, the president of Christie's, sees about 30 to 40 different markets, each with its own loyal or growing constituency. ''Old masters, American paintings and Latin American paintings are not necessarily moving in the same direction,'' he said. ''It's broadly cyclical and not directly tied to the stock or real estate market.'' 
 Because consignments for the November sales are still being negotiated -- along with the guarantees that can promise a seller an undisclosed minimum, regardless of the auction's outcome -- it may be too soon to make comparisons with last year's fall sales. But Sotheby's reports that its consignments so far are running ahead of last year's. 
 One source of consignments -- estates -- largely remains constant, however. ''People don't necessarily die in sync with the financial market,'' Ms. Doyle said. 
 Aby Rosen, the Manhattan real estate developer and art collector, predicts that if buyers or prices do fall off, they will drop only slightly. Instead of buying two paintings at $500,000 each, he explained, a collector might buy 10 paintings at $10,000, or 5 at $20,000 each.
 ''Rather than five people bidding for the same painting, it will be three people,'' Mr. Rosen said. ''Instead of making threefold on a sale, sellers will make two-and-a-half fold.''
 What many who make their living in the art market are counting on is that there will always be people who use art to telegraph their wealth, along with expensive cars, houses and jewelry. 
 ''The sense that buying art is important, vital, cool, accessible, sexy is not going away,'' said Lucille Blair, an art consultant for collectors. 
 But art has also become an asset with an intrinsic and lasting value. ''It's one of the only asset classes that's not leveraged at all, so that a Warhol hanging in somebody's house truly represents a million dollars in capital,'' Mr. Porter of Christie's said. ''There may be years when it's worth less, or years when it's worth more. It's real, it's tangible and it doesn't have a whiff of a derivative product about it.''
 Others concede that it is too early to make predictions. ''Nobody really knows what's going to happen in the financial markets,'' said the developer Jerry I. Speyer, chairman of the Museum of Modern Art and himself a collector. ''In my experience, people buy the best of whatever they can buy, if they can afford to buy.''

HEADLINE: Wildflowers Find Favor With Highway Gardeners

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: NEWARK, Del. 

 BODY:
For Americans on the move, a rest stop on the East Coast's main thoroughfare, Interstate 95, seems an unlikely setting for a revolution. But to a growing number of horticulturalists, the vegetation stretching beyond the gas pumps toward the highway median might as well be marching behind a fife and drum.
 Dark green switchgrass stands four feet tall. Asters, amonsia with tiny blue flowers, and flowering white thoroughwort nestle there, in place of a simple lawn. Down the road, the cloverleaf for I-95 and Route 896 is filled with golden Indiangrass; its gossamer flowers riffle as trucks whiz by. 
 This is the meadow vista that stretched before the eye back when Delaware was a colony, and earlier. Now these regional plantings are increasingly favored by the country's highway gardeners, who see themselves as heirs of an environmental Enlightenment. Their credo is, Get the mowers out of the 12 million acres of roadsides and median strips around the United States, and let the wildflowers and grasses grow. 
 Roadsides, they say, are the national front porch. Why, then, should they look like an English formal garden or a Scottish golf course? Why shouldn't they mimic the land as it was before highways? 
 In part as a frugal move -- not mowing can save states tens of thousands of dollars each year -- at least a dozen states including Colorado, Delaware, Nebraska, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington, have increased their inventory of native plantings. 
 In the words of a University of Delaware horticulturist, Susan S. Barton, an adviser to the state's Department of Transportation, ''We're doing it so when you're driving around Delaware you know you're in Delaware, not in the tropics.''
 But the movement, which began before World War II in the Midwest, well before Lady Bird Johnson's beautification project in the 1960s, has more heart than muscle. Roadsides fulfill a variety of engineering functions. They must provide clear lines of sight and easy drainage. As for aesthetics, a Delaware poll showed that the public prizes neatness more than nativeness. 
 And so the pushers of native plants must fight endless battles with their economic and aesthetic opponents: turf-grass vendors, lawn mower jockeys who make a living cutting 20-foot median swaths in the summer sun, or garden clubs that favor manicured beds of tulips, poppies and lilies over meadow grasses that can look downright blowsy. 
 Jeanette Carey, who with her husband, George, runs a farm in southern Delaware, said the native grasses ''just look awful.'' 
 Her husband, a state representative, said many neighbors complained after the median grasses grew tall. ''There was nothing but weeds in the middle of the road,'' Ms. Carey said. ''It should look like a lawn, mowed.'' 
 Thomas Yoakum, an environmental manager with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, wants to give native grasses a chance. But some experiments, like the switchgrass planted near Bedford, Pa., on Route 30, left the impression of a botched hair transplant. 
 Jon Johnson, a research support associate with the Roadside Vegetation Management Project of Pennsylvania State University, worries that because switchgrass is highly flammable during droughts a tossed cigarette butt could force a road to be closed. 
 Other states have joined the native plant revolution, at least in theory. More than 5,000 species of wildflowers and grasses flourish along Texas roadsides. Nebraska has limited mowing on its rights of way, a practice that provided some wildlife habitat; in years of drought, native grasses can be harvested to provide hay for the cattle industry.
 As Jane Lareau of the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League put it, ''I would love people to see things that are native, not a stupid poppy or canna lily.'' 
 But some states take more traditional tacks. North Carolina, for instance, plants acres of oxeye daisies every year, though they are considered a noxious weed in other states. Tennessee, a western neighbor, has oxeye daisies on its list of invasive plants and wants to be rid of them. 
 ''Oxeye daisies are the bane of my existence,'' said Bonnie L. Harper-Lore, a restoration ecologist for the Federal Highway Administration who is based in Minnesota. 
 Derek C. Smith, a roadside environmental engineer in North Carolina, happily pleads guilty to daisy-pushing. His state's highway vegetation program, paid for in part by fees from vanity license plates, is a source of pride.
 While native plants make up about one-third of the state's inventory of roadside plants, compared with as little as 10 percent in the 1980s, Mr. Smith said, ''our citizens like a lot of the nonnative plants, bright red poppies and the like.'' 
 If the advocates of native plant gain more traction, they can thank champions like Calvin Ernst, 66, a successful seed seller from Meadville, Pa. His shyness belies a canny eye for what will grow and what will sell, and a passion for taking the landscapes of his region near Lake Erie back to their roots, literally. 
 Years ago, Mr. Ernst was a proponent of a creeping, bushy plant with small leaves called crownvetch, which is now a staple of Pennsylvania highways, particularly in the Alleghenies. Highway engineers prize its ability to grow fast and to thrive in poor soils and on steep hillsides. When the Interstate System was being built in the 1960s and 1970s, Mr. Ernst found himself selling crownvetch around the country, and making a tidy profit doing so.
 That was then. Now crownvetch is a villain of native-plant proponents, seen as an invasive bully whose presence discourages the growth of native flowers. (Nonnative, or exotic plants, often have a biological edge over natives -- perhaps they have fewer natural enemies.)
 Ernst Conservation Seeds, where Mr. Ernst is the general partner, still sells crownvetch seeds to the state, but about three-quarters of its wares are now seeds for native plants, collected by hand from Appalachian forests or Carolina marshlands. On the Delaware stretch of Route I-95, the seeds have blossomed into broom sedge, switchgrass and little bluestem grass. 
 Ms. Barton, the horticulturist in Delaware, said that of the 13,414 acres that the Department of Transportation has planted, about 3 percent, or 425 acres, have been with native plants.
 Natives need to be left alone to grow to their full height. On the nonnative areas, mowing eight times annually costs $162.72 an acre using state workers, or $800 an acre using contractors. On the native plots, mowing once yearly costs $20.34 an acre with state personnel or $100 an acre with contractors, Ms. Barton said.
 Joseph Wright, who runs the mowing program in southern Delaware, said mowers had trouble digesting tall stands of native plants and broke down.
 Where Mr. Wright does not mow, local farmers, like Fred Bennett, 82, sometimes move in. ''In front of my house I mow it every week,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''I like long hair on a woman but not on a man and not growing around my house.''

HEADLINE: New York's Gap Between Rich and Poor Is Nation's Widest, Census Says

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
From 2005 to 2006, the rich grew richer in the New York region and the poor, over all, remained poor, producing the widest income gap of any major metropolitan area, according to census figures released yesterday. 
 In the counties of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that make up the metropolitan area, the top one-fifth of earners made nearly 20 times what the bottom fifth earned, according to the first such detailed measure of local income inequality by the Census Bureau. 
 ''New York stands out, ahead of Los Angeles, San Francisco and other large metros, which attract both high- and low-income people,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. 
 In Manhattan, the disparity was especially wide. The wealthiest 20 percent of Manhattanites made nearly 40 times more than the poorest 20 percent -- $351,333, on average, compared with $8,855, a bigger gap than in any other county. 
 Even so, Manhattan's wealthiest were outdone by residents of suburban Fairfield County, Conn. There, the top fifth made $362,103, and the top 5 percent earned $746,726. That compared with $710,116 for the top 5 percent of Manhattan earners and $415,442 for the top 5 percent in the New York region as a whole -- also the highest of any major metropolitan area.
 In New York City, the actual number of poor people counted by the census increased from 2005 to 2006, in part because the latest tally included residents of shelters and similar group housing. But among families and their children -- categories not affected by the counting change -- the poverty rate appeared to have declined slightly since a peak in 2004.
 In Manhattan, the poverty rate among children dropped sharply -- to 27 percent from 32.5 percent. City officials boasted about the decline. But one reason for it may be that poor children's parents can no longer afford housing in Manhattan, and they are being replaced by wealthier youngsters. 
 Over all, the poverty rate in the city was 19.1 percent, about where it had been for the previous six years, which meant that about one in five New Yorkers lived below the official poverty line, defined by the federal government as $20,650 for a family of four. 
 Median income in the city barely budged, to $46,480 in 2006, statistically only slightly higher than the adjusted $44,835 recorded the year before.
 Reflecting the region's vast income disparities, New York was again the only state in which both the poverty rate and the median household income surpassed the national average. 
 New Jersey had the second highest household income, at $64,470, behind Maryland. But the poverty rate in Camden, N.J., at 35.6 percent, was also among the nation's highest. 
 On a different measure, median family income, Connecticut led the nation at $78,154. But the poverty rate in Hartford was 30.3 percent.
 In the South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan, the poverty rate among children was 54 percent.
 At $59,281, the metropolitan area slipped from 9th to 10th in median household income, with Seattle leapfrogging ahead. Metropolitan New York ranked 4th among whites, 10th among blacks, 12th among Asians and 25th among Hispanics in median income.
 New York City's steady poverty rate was in contrast to a national decline. Analysts as diverse as Steve Malanga of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, and David R. Jones of the Community Service Society, a liberal advocacy group, agreed that competition for low-wage jobs in the city, many of them filled by immigrants, depressed their income.
 ''We haven't seen much movement at all in terms of diminishing poverty,'' said Mr. Jones, the society's president.
 Mr. Malanga, a senior fellow at the institute, cited some declines -- in the poverty rate for families, to 16.3 percent in 2006 from 16.7 percent the year before, and among households headed by women, to 30.4 percent from 31.2 percent. But he agreed that the city's ''economic rebound has tended to be at the high end, and our poverty levels are not going down as fast as at the national level.''
 Commenting on the decline in the number of poor people in Manhattan, Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, said, ''It is clear that low- and middle-income New Yorkers are being priced out of Manhattan and that poor people are being driven to the outer boroughs and the suburbs.'' 
 The poverty rate rose in Rockland and Putnam Counties, but it was unclear how much of the increase was attributable to the change in how the numbers were counted.
 The census also measured the proportion of people without health insurance coverage. The number declined in New York, to 13.2 percent, and in Connecticut, to 10.4 percent, and rose slightly in New Jersey, to 14.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Navy Yard, a Roomy Haven for Industry, Once Again Is Booming

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Navy Yard, one of New York City's major industrial real estate sites, is undergoing a renaissance.
 Since last fall, new developments totaling 1.3 million square feet have been announced for the yard, a 300-acre industrial park on the East River between the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges. This is in addition to the 4 million square feet already in use, in about 40 buildings that have more than 230 tenants employing about 5,000 people.
 One important part of the new wave of development is a multistory building to be built for B&H, the photography and video retailer, which already is a tenant of the Navy Yard. Steiner Studios, a movie studio that opened at the industrial park in 2004, is renovating a vacant building. The yard is also converting four other vacant buildings to create a 250,000-square-foot food complex that the developer hopes will attract tenants like food manufacturers and processors. 
 All this development represents the largest expansion at the yard since its heyday during World War II, when more than 60,000 people worked there. 
 Although ships were built in the marshland of the yard during the Revolutionary War, the area came into its own after 1801, when the federal government bought the land and began using it to build warships. The battleships Maine, Arizona and Missouri were built there. 
 The federal government shut down the yard in 1966. New York City bought it for $24 million in 1967 and reopened it as an industrial park in 1971. Since 1981, it has been run, under contract with the city, by the not-for-profit Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation. 
 The administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has injected more than $30 million into upgrading the yard, and it is planning to invest an additional $180 million in the next three years to install roofs and windows; rebuild piers; and modernize roads and the electrical, water and sewage systems. 
 The city's recent investment has ''made it clear to the private sector that the Navy Yard is a good place to invest and build,'' said Andrew H. Kimball, president and chief executive of the yard's development corporation. 
 Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, agrees. ''The Navy Yard was a vast, underused asset, but under Bloomberg, it's been able to attract additional private investment, improve its infrastructure, attract firms that have expanded and attracted new ones,'' he said. 
 Among the companies investing at the yard is Steiner Studios, which occupies 310,000 square feet on a 15-acre campus and employs 500 to 1,000 people, depending on production schedules. 
 Steiner is renovating a 289,000-square-foot, seven-story building from the World War II era to add production space and to rent to other media companies. This expansion, which is to cost about $50 million, is expected to create 550 jobs.
 B&H, a tenant at the yard since the late 1990s, occupies a four-story, 160,000-square-foot building, which it uses as a warehouse. It will soon begin work on a new building that Herschel Jacobowitz, B&H's chief information officer, said would probably be six stories, with 600,000 square feet. 
 This building, expected to cost more than $50 million and to be one of the largest new multistory industrial buildings in the city, is likely to house several offices now in Manhattan. The number of B&H workers in Brooklyn is expected to rise from more than 200 today to as many as 900.
 Also expanding at the yard is Duggal Visual Solutions, which sells photographic services. It has been at the industrial park since 1998. It first occupied 10,000 square feet and quickly doubled its space. Duggal recently took over 8,000 square feet in a second building and is negotiating for an additional 40,000 square feet. 
 The tenants say the yard has many things going for it, including a large local work force, round-the-clock security and access, and large, relatively unobstructed spaces. This last feature is especially valuable for Duggal, which makes huge advertising banners. 
 The yard's location is also a selling point. It is near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges and is a short train ride from Manhattan. The nearest subway stops are a 15- to 20-minute walk, but the yard runs a shuttle service.
 Another advantage is the likelihood that the yard will remain an industrial park and not be redeveloped, as many New York industrial sites have been.
 ''Every five years, the city is losing approximately 15 percent of its industrial space, because it is being converted into residences, offices, retail,'' said John G. J. Ritter, an executive vice president of Sholom & Zuckerbrot, a commercial real estate brokerage in Queens. ''That is why the Navy Yard is so helpful.''
 Tenants of the Navy Yard cite few disadvantages, although Baldev Duggal, president of Duggal Visual Solutions, said it was sometimes hard ''to convince employees to go to Brooklyn.''
 Obstacles like subway proximity clearly have been surmountable. The Brooklyn Navy Yard has had a 98 percent occupancy rate for leasable space for the last five years and has gone from net cash flow of $700,000 in 2001 to $5.5 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, because of annual rents that can be more than $20 a square foot. 
 Besides the new food complex and B&H and Steiner expansions, the yard has begun work on an 87,000-square-foot building that will be completed next June and is intended for multiple tenants.
 Also under development are 75,000-square-foot and 150,000-square-foot buildings for industrial tenants and a 60,000-square-foot supermarket for the neighborhood, to be open by 2010 in the southwest corner of the yard.

HEADLINE: Questions On City's Role In Demolition Near 9/11 Site

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM; Diane Cardwell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The former headquarters of Deutsche Bank, at the edge of ground zero, has been in state hands for more than three years, ever since the Pataki administration fashioned a deal to buy and demolish it. The wounded tower had stood as both an ugly reminder of Sept. 11 and the slow progress in rebuilding downtown Manhattan.
 But for at least 30 months, New York City officials have themselves played a role alongside first the Pataki and now the Spitzer administration in helping to determine how the contaminated 41-story building at 130 Liberty St. was to be demolished, who was to do the work, how much they would be paid and, ultimately, whether the companies hired for the job were reputable firms.
 As it turned out, the subcontractor hired for the demolition was an organization comprised of executives from one company without the requisite experience and two senior executives from a second company under scrutiny by city investigators, a company whose former owner twice had been convicted of federal crimes, and had been accused of ties to organized crime. 
 The subcontractor, known as the John Galt Corporation, is now the focus of a criminal investigation after two firefighters died in an Aug. 18 blaze; evidence points to the fire's being caused by workers smoking on the building's upper floors. The efforts of firefighters to combat the blaze were badly compromised by an inoperable sprinkler system and a nonworking standpipe in the contaminated building.
 The Galt firm was hired even though the city and the state had jointly established an agency -- the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center -- and charged it with coordinating construction activity downtown, and preventing troubled contractors from getting work there. A former city investigator was appointed to the agency. Interviews with current and former officials involved in the work at the Deutsche Bank also show that at least two senior Bloomberg administration officials were clearly aware that the executives from the suspect company, Mitchell Alvo and Donald Adler of Safeway Environmental, had ultimately been hired to work on the demolition project.
 Records show that one of those officials was Martha Stark, the commissioner of the city's Department of Finance. Ms. Stark served on a committee of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation overseeing the Deutsche Bank building, and received a copy of a letter responding to the continuing concerns of city investigators regarding the two men from Safeway after the Galt Company was hired.
 To date, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his aides have said little about their knowledge of the troubled company at the heart of the demolition work.
 The administration has refused to say whether senior officials were alerted by city investigators about their objections to the use of Safeway and its executives. And it has refused to say whether Ms. Stark briefed anyone about the company's role, and the concerns swirling around it.
 A spokesman for Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, who served on the board of the downtown development agency, indicated last week that Mr. Doctoroff was aware that the Safeway executives had been hired, but had been satisfied that safeguards had been put in place to prevent any wrongdoing. It was unclear whether Mr. Doctoroff knew about the full range of concerns of city investigators.
 Yesterday, a mayoral spokesman, Stu Loeser, again refused comment, citing the investigation by the Manhattan district attorney. But the records show City Hall officials attended a meeting convened by Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. Eliot Spitzer at Gracie Mansion on Jan. 29, 2007, after the John Galt Company and Bovis Lend Lease, the company that hired Galt, walked off the demolition job in a bid for more money. The companies complained they were being asked to do more work than the contract entailed.
 The city eventually backed the state's decision to provide an additional $40 million to complete the demolition and remediation work, money that, if finally approved, would flow in part to the Safeway executives.
 That meeting took place seven months after the city's Department of Investigation took action against Safeway that would probably prevent it from doing future city work and five months after the agency's investigation of the John Galt Corporation blocked that company from winning a contract to tear down the Bronx House of Detention. Again, it was unclear whether those concerns were ever raised during the negotiations at Gracie Mansion.
 Diane Struzzi, a Department of Investigation spokeswoman, citing the current criminal inquiry, would not say whether officials from the agency had notified anyone inside city government, from the mayor and Deputy Mayor Doctoroff, down to lower-level managers, about their concerns.
 Much of the work in rebuilding downtown, of course, had been headed over the years by the Pataki administration, which first created the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. The state, now under the direction of Mr. Spitzer, controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and is a partner with New Jersey in the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center site.
 State officials from the Pataki and Spitzer administrations have yet to explain their roles and responsibilities at the Deutsche Bank building.
 District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau has subpoenaed records from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, John Galt, Bovis, the Fire Department and others as part of a widening investigation. 
 But the city's Department of Investigation has long been interested in Safeway Environmental, its owners and executives. Its concerns originated from the criminal convictions and accusations of organized crime connections against Harold Greenberg, a former Safeway owner.
 Indeed, in the summer of 2005, city investigators persuaded the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to disqualify Safeway from getting a $13 million contract to erect scaffolding at the Deutsche Bank building. And in early 2006, it sent a letter to the development agency cautioning against using Safeway officials in the much larger undertaking of demolishing the building.
 Nonetheless, in January 2006, Bovis and the development agency struck an agreement that allowed the Safeway executives to play a role in the project. Under the terms of the arrangement, Mr. Alvo and Mr. Adler were required to cooperate with an unspecified inquiry by the Department of Investigation.
 A former official who had been involved in the project said the Department of Investigation did not learn of the arrangement until March 31, in a meeting with the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center.
 Charles Maikish, a command center official, eventually conceded in a letter to city investigators that he had been remiss in failing to consult the Department of Investigation and acknowledged that the department had supplied the command center with ''negative'' information about Mr. Adler and Mr. Alvo, according to two people who have seen the letter.
 Mr. Maikish's letter indicates that he sent a copy to Ms. Stark.
 In the following months, city investigators' interest in Safeway intensified -- as it intervened to end the company's involvement in several city contracts.
 One deal was with the city's Department of Sanitation. The Department of Investigation sent a letter dated May 5, 2006, to Mr. Alvo, president of Safeway, notifying him that the company was in ''default'' of a monitoring agreement that allowed the company to undertake contracts with Sanitation. Among the reasons for the finding, the letter said, is that two Safeway officials, Mr. Alvo and Steven Chasin, had refused to submit to follow-up interviews with investigators as the agreement required.
 It was precisely that sort of requirement -- that Safeway officials would continue to cooperate with investigators -- that reassured state and city officials that Mr. Alvo and Mr. Adler could be cleared to work on the Deutsche Bank demolition job.

HEADLINE: Gains Unclear as Israeli and Palestinian Leaders Meet

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and ISABEL KERSHNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, discussed the core issues of contention between their peoples at a meeting here on Tuesday, but it was unclear how closely they moved toward a foundation for a final settlement.
 The core issues are the final borders of the two states, the status of Jerusalem and the Old City and a solution to the problem of Palestinian refugees. 
 Their meeting, at Mr. Olmert's official residence, followed one three weeks ago in Jericho on the West Bank. The Bush administration has pushed the two men to meet to discuss the shape of a settlement, to bolster a two-state solution and provide what American officials call a ''political horizon'' that makes necessary concessions seem more palatable. 
 The goal is supposed to be a set of principles, or outline agreements on major issues, that can be blessed by the West and moderate Arab states at an international meeting sponsored by the United States in late fall.
 Tuesday's meeting, which the Israelis called ''very constructive,'' lasted nearly three hours, with Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas meeting alone for 100 minutes.
 ''They spoke about fundamental issues, about how to arrive at the solution of two states for two peoples,'' said an Israeli spokesman, David Baker. He would not be specific, but Israeli officials said that Mr. Olmert had proposed another session in the next two weeks and then the creation of working groups to prepare for the fall international meeting.
 Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator and a participant, said: ''All the outstanding issues concerning final-status negotiations need discussion. These talks did not reach the level of details.'' He said that no documents had been exchanged. 
 Mr. Abbas wants more specificity on the details of a settlement than Mr. Olmert is prepared to provide. They also discussed narrower questions of checkpoints, economic and security cooperation and prisoners, and agreed that their respective ministers should resume cooperation after a hiatus since Hamas's victory in elections in January 2006. They also agreed to discuss weapons smuggling into Gaza with Egypt and Washington, and to set up a joint economic council in mid-October in Tel Aviv with the former British prime minister, Tony Blair.
 The stakes are high for Mr. Abbas, who has already lost Gaza to Hamas, said Ali Jarbawi of Birzeit University in Ramallah. ''He's gambling, basically,'' Mr. Jarbawi said. ''If nothing tangible comes out of it by November, he will be exposed to very harsh criticism from everybody. People are extremely cynical about the whole process. They want to see an end result.''
 Palestinians, he said, ''want to know, for example, that a Palestinian state will be established five years from now, and where, and what is required from the Palestinian side to get there. 
 ''They want a time frame,'' he continued, ''and an irreversible process not subject to Israeli political changes or movable benchmarks.''
 The two met on the 21st birthday of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured in June 2006 in a raid near Gaza by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups. 
 Negotiations through Egypt with Hamas, and with Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails, have produced no results because Hamas wants hundreds of prisoners freed, a price Israel considers too high both in terms of numbers and the severity of their acts. Mr. Olmert is also reluctant to reward Hamas while Mr. Abbas is trying to show that moderation and negotiation are more productive. 
 Corporal Shalit's family celebrated with a huge birthday cake for him at a Tel Aviv rally. His father said that Hamas had refused to publish a letter from him to his son in a Palestinian newspaper.
 Before the meeting, Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas tried to reassure their respective publics that nothing serious would be bargained away.
 Mr. Abbas told the Voice of Palestine radio that a fall meeting that yielded only a ''declaration of principles,'' as Mr. Olmert has called them, would be useless. 
 Mr. Olmert said before the meeting that any accord would follow the phases of the so-called road map, an essentially moribund 2003 peace plan. He seems to mean is that Israel will not give up much of the West Bank until the Palestinian Authority cracks down on groups the West deems terrorists, including Islamic Jihad and Hamas. 
 Mr. Abbas also said he had asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice when the fall conference would be, which countries would attend and what its content would be. She had no firm answers, he said. 
 A senior American official said that the conference remained ''embryonic,'' and that serious discussions would continue after Labor Day. Ms. Rice is expected back in the region next month, probably just after another Olmert-Abbas meeting, which is expected to occur before the Israeli new year begins on Sept. 13. Nimr Hamad, a political adviser to Mr. Abbas, said that ''for the past two months, the Israelis have avoided entering into details about the problems of final status,'' and Mr. Abbas is trying to force the issue.
 The meeting was cordial, with Israel grateful to the Palestinian police for rescuing an Israeli major who made wrong turns on Monday and ended up alone, in uniform, in the middle of Jenin on the West Bank. His car was surrounded by angry youths, who overturned and burned it.
 Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni of Israel met Monday night with the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, to discuss economic issues. Mr. Fayyad said Israel was moving too slowly to improve Palestinian lives by removing checkpoints. Mr. Olmert's office said the army was debating what checkpoints to remove to ease control but not lose it.
 Mr. Fayyad said the offices of 103 charities, mostly affiliated with Hamas, would be shut for ''violating the law'' and serving as a cover for militancy. The order is not likely to have any effect in Gaza, which Hamas controls.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Proposes Expanding Tax Credit to Fight Poverty

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took his antipoverty message to a national stage on Tuesday, proposing an $8.5 billion expansion of the federal earned income tax credit to bring more poor people, especially men, into the work force. 
 In a meandering speech at a conference organized by the Brookings Institution, Mr. Bloomberg argued that because the antipoverty programs of the past decade, which focused on women with children, were reaching the limit in their ability to drive down poverty rates, it was time to focus on men.
 ''If we are going to achieve another round of substantial gains like the kind we experienced post-1996, then we have to do more to connect fathers to jobs and to their families,'' he said. ''And we have to increase the rewards for work so that work pays, both for parents and individuals.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's plan would allow 21-year-olds who do not have children living with them to qualify for the tax credit. The age limit is now 25. He also proposes raising the tax credit's maximum qualifying income to just over $18,000 from $12,000. With those and other adjustments, Mr. Bloomberg said, someone who now makes $11,000 a year could see his or her tax benefits rise by nearly $1,000 from $86, with an additional $350 coming from the city and state.
 The plan, which would need Congressional approval, also would require recipients to keep up their child-support payments and to work at least 26 weeks a year. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's plan would apply to about 445,000 residents in New York, almost 80 percent of whom would be new recipients. Nationwide, about 19.7 million people would qualify, with 10.5 million of them newly eligible.
 Acknowledging the hefty price tag, Mr. Bloomberg said the economy would benefit from having more people working and more fathers paying child support.
 After delivering the speech, which sounded at times like a blueprint for a national campaign, Mr. Bloomberg fielded questions about his presidential ambitions. ''I'm not going to run for president,'' he said. 
 The speech -- which began with a joke about his visit here (no, he said, it was not part of a ''stealth campaign'' to become attorney general) -- zigzagged among several topics, including public education, illegal immigration and the problems of ''partisan bickering.'' 
 Pledging to work with New York City's Congressional delegation to enact his proposal, Mr. Bloomberg said the city was designing a new way to measure poverty rates. Many poverty analysts consider the current measure, in use since 1964, to be antiquated.

HEADLINE: Pit Trading to End for Pork Bellies And Selected Products in Chicago

BYLINE: By DOW JONES

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
The CME Group, created recently when Chicago's big futures exchanges merged, said Tuesday that it was closing trading pits for pork bellies and other products as traders increase their focus on electronic platforms. 
 As part of their recent merger, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade plan to consolidate their trading floors and electronic-trading platforms and to shift more trading business to computer screens.
 Starting in March, a handful of products that are floor-traded in limited amounts will move exclusively to CME's Globex electronic platform. Those include agricultural products like frozen pork bellies futures and options, and cash dairy products.
 Some financial products will also move to exclusive screen trading, including one-month Libor futures and Euroyen futures, and options on futures. Commodities leaving the pits include 100-ounce gold options, 5,000-ounce silver options and ethanol futures.
 CME also said trading of all foreign exchange futures products would be consolidated into a single trading pit, while the trading of some foreign exchange products would move to Globex.
 None of the moves affect the biggest products at CME, which are financial futures and options tied to United States interest rate expectations. Those are traded both electronically and on trading floors.
 While some of the pits at issue have become sleepy, closing them represents a symbolic shift for the exchange and the culture of floor trading in Chicago. Pork bellies, for example, have been traded on the floor for 46 years.

HEADLINE: Fed Report Stirs Unease, Sending Dow Down 280

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Volatility returned to Wall Street yesterday, sending stocks plunging as investors grew more uneasy about the economy and about whether the Federal Reserve will take steps to prevent credit market problems from spreading further. 
 The stock market found little to assuage concerns in minutes from the Fed's last meeting, released during afternoon trading. 
 In the minutes from the Aug. 7 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank noted the turmoil in the markets and said a further deterioration in financial conditions ''might require a policy response,'' but did not discuss a cut in the benchmark federal funds rate, which Wall Street has wanted. 
 The meeting predated a number of actions taken by the central bank to try to alleviate market volatility, including the Aug. 17 lowering of the discount rate, the interest the Fed charges banks to borrow money.
 Stocks were down the entire session on further worries about the economy. The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence sagged in August, and a Standard & Poor's housing index showed that home prices in the second quarter posted the sharpest decline since 1987.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 280.28 points, or 2.1 percent, to 13,041.85. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 34.43 points, or 2.35 percent, to 1,432.36, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 60.61 points, or 2.37 percent, to 2,500.64. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 21.6 points, or 2.74 percent, at 767.83.
 Fixed-income investors were encouraged by the consumer confidence report, which could indicate the Fed will be more likely to lower rates at its September meeting. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.51 percent from 4.57 percent Monday. The 10-year note's price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 16/32, to 101 30/32.
 Light crude oil fell 24 cents, to $71.73 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Analysts said there just was not much to encourage stock investors in a day with many traders on vacation and little in the way of corporate news. And, the lack of rate-cut support from the Fed minutes did not change matters.
 Investors might also be positioning themselves ahead of a speech by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Investors are looking not only for further details about a possible rate cut, but also for any impression Mr. Bernanke has about his recent campaign to inject liquidity into the markets.
 The New York Fed -- which carries out the central bank's market operation -- announced a 10-day repurchase agreement worth $9.5 billion to extend through Labor Day. The Fed also announced another repurchase worth $2 billion.
 Financial services stocks were among the hardest hit during the session. A Merrill Lynch analyst, Guy Moszkowski, cut ratings on Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns because of concerns about earnings. 
 Shares of Citigroup fell $1.65, or 3.45 percent, to $46.14. Lehman dropped $3.47, or 6 percent, to $54.28. Bear Stearns declined $3.78, or 3.4 percent, to $108.42. 
 The S.& P. housing report pushed shares of home builders lower. Hovnanian Enterprises fell 80 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $10.46. The luxury-home builder Toll Brothers dropped 94 cents, or 4.27 percent, to $21.06. D. R. Horton declined 46 cents, or 3 percent, to $14.75.
 Medco Health Solutions said it would pay $1.3 billion in cash for a diabetes treatment supplier, PolyMedica. Medco fell $1, to $85.11, while PolyMedica surged $6.40, or 14 percent, to $51.69.

HEADLINE: Not All HDTVs Can Keep Up With the Action

BYLINE: By JOE HUTSKO

 BODY:
Sit for the first time in front of a high-definition TV tuned to a nature program broadcast in HD, and the reaction is almost always the same: a dropping of the jaw. But if you're a sports fan or serious video gamer, the same set showing the Super Bowl or a car-racing game might elicit a different response: the screen cannot keep up with the action.
 Fast movement results in a blur, what the TV industry calls ghosting, because the screen's ability to refresh the image cannot keep up with the action. So viewers for whom action matters need to pay as much attention to how fast images are processed as to the size of the screen. 
 As the price of big-screen HDTVs continues to drop, more people are giving up their bulky cathode-ray tube TVs for slim plasma or L.C.D. TVs. ''Sets are already 25 percent cheaper this year and will continue falling through the holiday season,'' said James L. McQuivey, the television market analyst for Forrester Research. ''It has gotten to the point where big retailers like Best Buy only carry a handful of non-HDTV sets,'' he said. 
 The scarcity of tube sets is unfortunate for gamers and sports fans. Although flat-panel HDTVs are light enough to hang on the wall, high-definition cathode-ray tube TVs provide the best picture because they produce the blackest of blacks and the most contrast, and they have a fast response time. 
 Matthew Jones, 29, an information technology assistant for Somerset Community College in Somerset, Ky., discovered the benefits of last-generation technology when he bought a 30-inch Sony XBR widescreen tube TV two years ago. Mr. Jones, an avid video game player, said, ''The picture quality is great, and I didn't notice any problems with response times.'' The downside? ''It weighs over 200 pounds,'' he said.
 Indeed, as the size of the screen increases, the depth and the weight also increase. It is hard to find HDTV tube TVs with large screens, so the choice for consumers who want a large screen comes down to finding the flat-screen technology that blurs the least. 
 Some manufacturers are marketing their TVs as a perfect fit for game consoles. Sharp, for instance, offers two L.C.D. HDTVs intended for gamers. The 32-inch LC-32GP1U ($1,400) and the 37-inch LC-37GP1U ($1,800) feature ''Vyper Drive,'' which Tony Favia, Sharp's senior product manager, says is designed ''to reduce the lag time between the game console input and the TV display to imperceptible levels.'' 
 But David Carnoy, executive editor of Cnet.com, which reviews TVs, considers this marketing malarkey. He said manufacturers fall back on such terms to overcome the idea that liquid crystal display TVs are not good for gaming or home theater. ''Now, with all the talk of faster refresh rates, L.C.D. TVs are losing that knock against them,'' he said. ''It's similar to the problem that plasma makers have had vis-a-vis burn-in. They've never been able to completely escape that rap.''
 Rear-projection TVs using digital light processing technology, or D.L.P., can cause a ''rainbow effect'' for some viewers when there is fast movement on the screen. Mr. Jones, the video game player, was one of those viewers, as he learned after he upgraded to a wider screen last year. He had chosen a 52-inch HDTV with a resolution of 1,080 pixels. The TV, a Mitsubishi that uses rear-projection D.L.P., was not what he had hoped for. 
 ''I didn't notice at the store, but I'm one of the few who sees the rainbows on D.L.P.,'' Mr. Jones said. ''Whenever something bright shot across the screen, I could see the image for a split second separate into the primary colors,'' Mr. Jones said. 
 He returned the TV to the store and went with his ''original gut feeling,'' spending an additional $200 for a 50-inch Sony SXRD rear-projection HDTV. Mr. Jones said ''the image it produces is great.''
 A few definitions help to explain the differences in speed. The two important terms are response time and refresh rate. Response time is the measure of how fast a colored pixel on the screen turns white and then back to a color. Faster is better. Response time is measured in milliseconds (often written as ''ms'' on specification sheets), and 8 to 12 milliseconds is typical. Six milliseconds is increasingly common.
 More and more, manufacturers are promoting their models' refresh rates rather than response times. A desirable rate is 120 hertz. The refresh rate, the number of times an image is displayed each second, is expressed in hertz, or Hz. Higher is better. 
 Game players and sports fans tend to be early adopters of TV technology, so manufacturers are making an effort to please them. ''Improving the smoothness of motion for action and sports has been a major focus of manufacturers this year,'' said Ross Rubin, who follows consumer technology trends for the NPD Group. ''Toshiba, Philips, Sony, Samsung and others have rolled out technologies that provide 120-hertz refresh rates, and the difference when compared to the previous 60 hertz is definitely visible when viewed side by side.''
 Mr. Carnoy of Cnet concurs. ''Most major L.C.D. manufacturers are starting to put out HDTVs with 120-hertz refresh rates that deliver a 4-millisecond response time,'' he said, adding that 120 hertz ''is sort of the '1080p' of 2007, that hot new spec that's featured on higher-end sets.'' 
 ''Gamers and movie fanatics who demand the ultimate picture and performance from an L.C.D. TV,'' Mr. Carnoy said, ''can spend the extra dough for a top-of-the-line set.''
 Cnet reviewers recommend the Sony KDS-60A2020, a 60-inch rear-projection HDTV. The model, which cost $2,600, is no longer in production. The replacement, to come out this fall, will be the $2,700 Bravia KDS-60A3000, which Sony said is 20 percent slimmer than last year's model. CNET also recommends an L.C.D. TV from Samsung, the 46-inch LN-T4665F, which earned praise for its wide viewing angle. It is high definition, with a resolution of 1,080 pixels, and costs $2,800.
 But Mike Brady, editor of the HDTV review site DigitalAdvisor.com, warns in his buying guide that although 1,080 pixels is the pinnacle of HD, no television channels broadcast at that level. So for a consumer who will not be using a high-resolution device like a PlayStation 3 or a high-definition DVD player, a 720-pixel HDTV would be a less expensive option and would still showcase high-definition programs. 
 For such a model, Mr. Brady recommends an L.C.D. unit by Syntax-Brillian, the 42-inch Olevia 342i. It sells for about $800. Cnet also recommends a relatively affordable Panasonic unit, the TH-42PX77U, which sells for about $1,250. The model, a 42-inch plasma HDTV with a resolution of 720 pixels, earns kudos because it displays a clear picture in a bright room, rivaling L.C.D. HDTVs, which are known for their generally brighter displays.
 Anyone hooking up game consoles and DVD players should also make sure that the set has enough HDMI ports. HDMI is the new standard for cables conveying a high-definition signal. One would want ports for at least three HDMI connections.
 But in the end, size also matters. ''The thing I like to tell people is that if you're trying to decide between two different screen sizes, always go bigger,'' Mr. Carnoy said. ''I know people who bought 42-inch plasmas who now regret not stepping up to the 50.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 1, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Thursday about choosing high-definition televisions for viewing video games or sports referred imprecisely to a number used to denote TV resolution. The television industry markets TVs as either 1080p or 720p, but the ''p'' refers to the progressive scan of the image, not pixels of resolution. (Screen resolution is determined by the number of lines multiplied by the number of pixels in each line. A 1080p TV has more than 2 million pixels; a 720p TV has about half that many.)

HEADLINE: An Investor Activism Uncommon in Japan

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Tomomi Yano was an unlikely maverick. When the unassuming Mr. Yano became head of investment at one of Japan's biggest pension funds in 2001, corporate executives here assumed that he was simply another former bureaucrat parachuting into semiretirement. Japan's vast government-run pension system, the reasoning went, would provide a comfortable nest after his 31 years at the labor ministry.
 But instead of putting up his feet and joining Japan's flock of compliant boards and shareholders, Mr. Yano became a champion of shareholder rights, pressing Japan Inc. to perform. In a country known for cozy relationships between companies and their big institutional investors, his attitude was unprecedented. 
 And unlike American investment funds, or even the handful of upstart Japanese investors, who have hit brick walls in their efforts to increase shareholder returns in this country, Mr. Yano comes with impeccable establishment credentials -- and that has made corporate Japan heed his demands. 
 Within months of taking over, Mr. Yano announced that his $11 billion fund would no longer automatically support management at the more than 1,000 companies in which it had holdings if managers failed to meet certain investment standards, such as paying annual dividends to shareholders. 
 Since that time, he has forced companies to downsize bloated boards, to raise dividends and to better inform and respond to shareholders.
 ''Yano is a standard-bearer for the cause of shareholder value,'' said Marc Goldstein, who heads the Tokyo office of Institutional Shareholder Services, a firm that helps big investors evaluate corporate management performance. ''His position means that he cannot be dismissed like foreign hedge fund managers can be dismissed.''
 Still, promoting shareholder interests was not an easy task in a country where, unlike Western nations, most listed companies are still run exclusively by employees who fill all management and board positions. Big investors customarily approve management decisions without question, and small shareholders are largely ignored.
 While hardly as rich as big-time American investors like Kirk Kerkorian, or as colorful -- the owlish Mr. Yano spends weekends playing Go, the ancient Asian board game of strategy -- he has become a leading voice in the broader debate over how much Japan should change its restrained brand of capitalism to resemble the freewheeling British-American model. 
 During the 1990s, when the country's $5 trillion economy stagnated, Japan did embrace disruptive corporate downsizing and some deregulation. But now that the economy is growing again, Japan is hesitating whether to carry change into the realm of corporate governance and particularly over the question of who should control companies -- their employees or their shareholders.
 Advocates of shareholder rights, like Mr. Yano, say that changing corporate culture is the only way to solve the biggest long-term challenge facing the country: paying for the retirement of its rapidly aging society. Only by increasing stock market returns, they argue, can Japan sufficiently increase the value of personal savings and pension funds to finance the retirement of the current generation of workers. 
 Opponents, though, fear that focusing greater attention on the bottom line will force companies to cut more jobs and increase social inequality. Companies, courts and even shareholders have rejected hostile takeover bids by foreign funds -- most prominently, the failed effort this summer by an American hedge fund, Steel Partners, to acquire Bull-Dog Sauce, a Japanese condiment maker and producer of a steak sauce common in the nation's kitchens.
 ''Japan reacts negatively when Warren Lichtenstein comes in thinking he can teach Japan how it should do things,'' said Yuzo Fujishima, a corporate governance analyst at the Daiwa Institute of Research, referring to the head of Steel Partners. ''Yano-san ends up being more effective because he is seen as working to fix a pressing national problem, not just turn a quick profit.''
 That combination of activism and respect has led many here to call Mr. Yano and his fund, the Pension Fund Association, Japan's answer to the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the huge pension fund that has been a vocal advocate for American investor interests. 
 Like Calpers, Mr. Yano and his fund are seen as defending the interests of average workers -- in this case, some 29 million Japanese who have contributed wages to his fund. 
 As significantly, Mr. Yano is inspiring a growing number of imitators, mostly smaller pension funds that are printing investment guidelines like the ones he has pioneered, and pressing companies to increase returns.
 Mr. Yano's campaign for shareholder rights began in 2001, when he joined the pension fund as executive managing director, the title he still holds. He was surprised to find that the poor performance of its stock portfolio was threatening its future ability to make payouts to pensioners.
 At the labor ministry, where he had helped set policy on pensions and national hospitals, he had little experience managing investments. 
 Still, he decided that the only way to save the fund was to improve its returns. And in a fund as big as his, which invests in almost every industry in Japan and has holdings in most large companies, that meant changing the nation's corporate culture.
 Initially, it seemed like a quixotic task, with Mr. Yano writing letters to companies asking them to make investor-friendly changes like raising dividends and shrinking corporate boards. His investment guidelines required companies to have posted a profit in at least one of the preceding three years.
 Though modest by American standards, the guidelines created a stir in Japan, where pension funds had never paid so much attention to returns. More shocking still was Mr. Yano's threat to punish companies that failed to meet his standards by voting against management at shareholder meetings. Company managers began to complain about him privately or in the Japanese press.
 ''They didn't confront me directly because they knew I was right,'' Mr. Yano said. ''I was just asking them to do for shareholders what companies are supposed to do.''
 One of his first victories came in 2002, when he persuaded Fanuc, a maker of industrial robots, to reduce the size of its board to 10 from 30. He made a real splash in 2005, when his organization filed one of the first lawsuits by a pension fund in this country, against the Seibu Railway Company for losses related to an accounting scandal.
 Mr. Yano began to speak publicly in favor of shareholders' rights, even in companies in which he had no stake. 
 Last month, he raised eyebrows by supporting a foreign fund, Perry Capital of New York, in its bid to buy a stake in NEC Electronics, a semiconductor maker, from the parent NEC. It was the first time in recent memory that a pension fund manager had publicly backed foreign investors against a blue-chip Japanese company.
 ''He looks like the stereotype of the gray-suited ex-bureaucrat, ready to defend the status quo,'' said Scott Callon, president of Ichigo Asset Management, an activist fund here. ''But when he speaks, he just shatters it. He is bringing issues into the open that Japan needs to face.'' 
 But while most analysts and investors think that Japan is changing, they also maintain that it will stop short of shareholder-driven capitalism. ''It used to be that shareholders were on the bottom of management's list of priorities,'' Mr. Yano said. ''Now, we are No. 2 or No. 3, after employees and maybe business partners. But that's progress.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally As Investors Chase Deals

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The stock market recovered almost all of its losses from Tuesday's sharp sell-off as investors went bargain-hunting yesterday at Wall Street's equivalent of a late summer sale.
 The morning after the market's worst day in three weeks, the Dow Jones industrial average started the trading session up immediately almost 100 points. The rally fed on itself as trading continued, and stock prices ended the day posting some of their largest gains so far this year.
 The Dow rose 247.44 points, or 1.9 percent. Broader indexes fared even better. The Standard & Poor 500-stock index gained 2.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite increased 2.5 percent. 
 Trading was a near mirror image of Tuesday. All 30 stocks in the Dow average and all but 18 of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. index climbed. On Tuesday, 29 Dow stocks and 487 S.& P. 500 stocks declined.
 Market strategists said the cascading nature of the rally suggested that computer trading algorithms programmed to buy low were at work. But individual investors looking for bargains were also a factor, as were rising oil prices and word from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank was ''prepared to act as needed'' to prevent the recent market distress from spreading further.
 Trading volume was low -- typical for a day in late August -- suggesting that the market's big swings this week have been somewhat exaggerated. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1.3 billion shares changed hands, compared with a daily average of about 1.8 billion.
 ''For as big as the movements we've seen the last two days, the volume has been pretty low,'' said Ernie Ankrim, chief investment strategist at Russell Investments, an investing and financial research firm in Tacoma, Wash. ''So I'm not sure I take too much stock in this. When you have small volumes you can have large movements dictated by relatively few market participants.''
 The Dow closed yesterday at 13,289.29. The S.& P. 500 rose 31.40 points, to 1,463.76, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 62.52 points, to 2.563.16. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 101 16/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.56 percent, from 4.51 percent.
 Energy company stocks led the charge yesterday as oil prices jumped to a three-week high on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price of a barrel of crude oil for delivery in October rose 2.5 percent, to $73.51, after the Energy Department reported that the nation's gasoline and oil reserves fell more last week than Wall Street forecasters had predicted. 
 After leading the market's decline on Tuesday, shares of financial companies like Lehman Brothers and Citigroup rebounded yesterday as Wall Street saw a greater possibility that the Fed will lower its benchmark short-term lending rate by half a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, when it meets on Sept. 18. Futures contracts for the Fed's key rate yesterday showed that nearly half of traders now expect a half-point rate reduction.
 The Fed has given no indication that a rate cut is imminent. But it has signaled that it is at least willing to consider one. Yesterday, the Fed again suggested that a rate cut was possible if conditions in financial markets deteriorated further.
 In a letter to Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, Mr. Bernanke wrote that the Fed's policy making arm was ''prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.''
 Mr. Schumer, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has been one of the loudest voices in Congress calling for the government to regulate mortgage lenders more closely. Mortgage companies have played a central role in the recent market tumult as banks have all but stopped buying asset-backed securities, fearing that the assets were bad subprime loans.
 Yesterday Mr. Schumer took aim at the nation's largest mortgage lender, Countrywide Financial, saying the company should ''bury its bad business practices and reverse some of the damage it has already inflicted on our housing market.''
 At issue was the allegation, which Countrywide has disputed, that the lender improperly steered customers to high-cost mortgages that resulted in richer commissions for Countrywide's sales representatives and large fees to company affiliates providing services on the loans.
 Yesterday's rally on Wall Street was helped in part by the absence of any big developments in the financial world. Recently, news that major investment banks have lost billions of dollars because of their exposure to bad subprime loans has sent Wall Street reeling.
 ''When you don't have any news, that's good news,'' said Todd Leone, head of trading at Cowen & Company, a New York brokerage firm.
 But how much the financial market turmoil has affected the economy is still not known. And investment strategists cautioned that the extent of the damage would not begin to be fully revealed until next month when economic indicators, like the government's employment report, are released.
 ''The maximum risk time is going to be the next 60 days when the major economic reports come out and they have some post-crisis data in them,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. ''I definitely see that we're going to have some volatile and scary days ahead.''
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 17-day cash management bills and 2-year notes:

HEADLINE: Executive Puts Rival's Patent to the Test

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
David Goldin, a small-business owner, counts himself as one of the first winners to emerge from all the changes now roiling a long-staid corner of the law: patents.
 Mr. Goldin said he spent thousands of hours flying all over the country to search for obscure business contracts and to pick the brains of people in his niche of the financial services industry before finding 48 typewritten pages in the archives of a company called Paymentech in July 2006. 
 That and other evidence he gathered were instrumental, he said, in persuading the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas this month to invalidate a patent held by a Georgia company called AdvanceMe. The patent covered the way the company makes cash advances to merchants in return for a cut of their future credit card receipts. AdvanceMe had accused Mr. Goldin's own cash advance business, AmeriMerchant, of infringing on its patent.
 ''It's a victory against patent trolls,'' Mr. Goldin said. ''This has changed the landscape. The days of coming up with an obvious idea and patenting it and using legal extortion are over.'' 
 The Texas ruling was one of the first to apply a new test established by the Supreme Court on April 30 that makes it more difficult to obtain patents on new products that combine elements of already existing patents. Experts say the Texas opinion was certainly the first to apply the new standard to financial services and probably the first to apply it to a business method.
 The Supreme Court's ruling is just one of the changes that are throwing patent law -- one of the underpinnings of American innovation and economic growth -- into turmoil, said Gerry Elman, founder of Elman Technology Law PC in Swarthmore, Pa., who practices intellectual-property and Internet-related business law. 
 Though Mr. Elman sides with Mr. Goldin in the AdvanceMe case, he believes small businesses will, in general, be the losers.
 ''In the past, they have relied on the patent system to become big businesses,'' he said. ''But now, the patent system is being gutted on the strength of lobbying by the information technology industry. Big businesses will be able to copy innovation with impunity and thumb their noses at the inventions of the little guy.''
 In any event, it is clear that all types of businesses are entering a new legal environment.
 Among the other patent law changes Mr. Elman cited are 
 new and complex regulations issued by the Patent Office last week; 
 an opinion by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington last week that requires plaintiffs asserting willful infringement of a patent to show that the defendant was ''objectively reckless''; and 
 various legislation before Congress.
 The Supreme Court ruling, in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex, set more flexible standards for courts to decide whether a patent meets the legal requirement for not being ''obvious.''
 ''KSR was a gizmo thing, having to do with an electronic sensor in an accelerator pedal that changed the pedal's position depending on the height of the driver,'' Mr. Elman said. ''KSR said Teleflex's invention was obvious, and the Supreme Court agreed.''
 It was the first time in four decades that the court had revisited the meaning of ''obvious'' in patent law, Mr. Elman said, and the implications of raising the bar for inventors are, in his view, huge.
 James Fornari, head of the intellectual property department at Gersten Savage, a Manhattan law firm, says the Supreme Court ruling ''will make it easier for examiners to reject applications, using a more rigorous standard on obviousness,'' while the Federal Circuit appellate opinion will make it more difficult for marginal patent owners to file infringement suits.
 In an e-mail statement, Glenn Goldman, AdvanceMe's chief executive, said, ''Although we feel vindicated that the court found clear infringement of our patent by each of the defendants, we respectfully disagree with the court's findings on validity.'' He said his company had filed a notice of appeal on Aug. 16. He declined to comment on Mr. Goldin's version of events.
 For all Mr. Elman's fears of the threat to small business, Mr. Goldin views tighter rules for patent awards as a godsend for entrepreneurs.
 His fight with AdvanceMe was not the first challenge he has faced in his entrepreneurial career. His first business, which he started in college, was organizing parties, including a New Year's Eve celebration in Madison Square Garden and the reopening of Studio 54. The Studio 54 party was a ''disaster,'' he says, because 5,000 people showed up, almost double the capacity. ''People were furious,'' he said. ''I had to walk out with bodyguards.''
 He started a Web company in August 1995 with three partners, sold it three years later and became an instant Internet millionaire, but held onto the acquiring company's stock too long and watched it swoon from $66 to 50 cents.
 He started AmeriMerchant in 2002 as a simple credit-card-processing company, but after spotting a more lucrative opportunity, cash advances to merchants, he became a referral agent for AdvanceMe, and in 2005 began doing the transactions himself.
 On Feb. 28, 2006, at AdvanceMe's request, he says, he met with its chief executive, Mr. Goldman, and the president, Tom Burnside, who offered to license their company's collection methods to him. ''I said, 'I don't understand how you can have a patent on something that has been around since the 1980s,' '' he recalled. ''They kept saying they had a 'patent on the technology.' '' 
 The next day, Mr. Goldin says, Mr. Goldman called him to say his company had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against AmeriMerchant -- on the day before their meeting.
 His first reaction was fear. His second was anger. ''Losing was not an option,'' he said.
 Mr. Goldin, 35, said he found out that the only way he could win was to get AdvanceMe's patent invalidated, and to do that he had to find written evidence that its payment system had been around at least one year before the patent was filed in July 1997.
 He started a blog (http://merchantcashadvanceblog.blogspot.com/) to argue his case and appeal for supporting evidence.
 He said that Tim Litle, the founder of Litle & Company, a processing company, told him the AdvanceMe patent was identical to what he did in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But how to prove it? Mr. Litle had sold the company in 1995, and all his documents went with the sale. 
 Mr. Goldin said he hit pay dirt when Paymentech, which had acquired Litle & Company, faxed him those 48 pages of documents dated from February 1992 to February 1994. The papers referred to a merchant who had paid Litle & Company out of its credit card receipts.
 ''We got it!'' he recalled thinking.
 Today, he said, he feels both vindicated and exhausted. For a year and a half, he said, ''I had two jobs: corporate C.E.O. and detective.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Weapons, Given to Iraqis, Move to Turkey

BYLINE: By DAVID S. CLOUD and ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Weapons that were originally given to Iraqi security forces by the American military have been recovered over the past year by the authorities in Turkey after being used in violent crimes in that country, Pentagon officials said Wednesday.
 The discovery that serial numbers on pistols and other weapons recovered in Turkey matched those distributed to Iraqi police units has prompted growing concern by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates that controls on weapons being provided to Iraqis are inadequate. It was also a factor in the decision to dispatch the department's inspector general to Iraq next week to investigate the problem, the officials said.
 Pentagon officials said they did not yet have evidence that Iraqi security forces or Kurdish officials were selling or giving the weapons to Kurdish separatists, as Turkish officials have contended. 
 It was possible, they said, that the weapons had been stolen or lost during firefights and smuggled into Turkey after being sold in Iraq's extensive black market for firearms. Officials gave widely varied estimates -- from dozens to hundreds -- of how many American-supplied weapons had been found in Turkey.
 Over the past year, inquiries by federal oversight agencies have found serious discrepancies in military records of where thousands of weapons intended for Iraqi security forces actually ended up.
 The disclosure of the weapons in Turkey, part of those investigations, came on the same day that the Army announced moves aimed at addressing a widening scandal that has generated 76 criminal investigations involving contract fraud in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. Twenty civilians and military personnel have been charged in federal court as a result of the inquiries. 
 ''The reports suggest we have serious issues in this area,'' Army Secretary Pete Geren told reporters on Wednesday, adding that the criminal inquiries and the reported diversion of Iraqi weapons to Turkey were major reasons behind his decision to take action now. 
 Mr. Gates sent the Pentagon general counsel, William J. Haynes II, to Turkey last month for talks with Turkish officials, who had been complaining for months that American-supplied weapons were being used in murders and other violent crimes carried out, in some cases, by Kurdish militants.
 Turkey's allegations that Iraq was being used as a sanctuary to carry out attacks inside Turkey have strained relations between the Bush administration and Ankara over the past six months, with Turkey not ruling out a military intervention into northern Iraq to stop the activity.
 American officials said that it appeared that the weapons found in Turkey were given to Iraqi units in 2004 and 2005 when, in the rush to build police and army units, controls on distribution of firearms had been much weaker. Gen. David H. Petraeus, who was then in charge of training and equipping Iraqi forces and who is now the top American commander in Iraq, has said that the imperative to provide weapons to Iraqi security forces was more important at the time than maintaining impeccable records.
 By checking serial numbers, American officials confirmed that some of the recovered weapons, which included handguns made by Glock, an Austrian weapons manufacturer, had originally been bought by the Defense Department for distribution in Iraq, the officials said.
 Geoff Morrell, a Pentagon spokesman, said at a briefing on Wednesday that Mr. Gates was ''deeply troubled by the reports and allegations'' about problems accounting for American-supplied weapons in Iraq.
 Pentagon officials said Wednesday that the problem of weapons turning up in Turkey was part of a larger investigation being carried out by the Pentagon inspector general, Claude M. Kicklighter, a retired Army three-star general, into allegations that American-supplied weapons had been improperly accounted for and fallen into the wrong hands. 
 ''General Kicklighter has informed the secretary that he will remain in-country as long as it takes to find out if record-keeping problems persist, and if so, make recommendations to the commanders on the ground how to fix those problems,'' Mr. Morrell said.
 American officials added that they had not seen firm evidence that the firearms had been found in the hands of Kurdish separatists from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, the hard-line Kurdish separatist group that for years has used northern Iraq as a sanctuary to carry out attacks inside Turkey.
 Turkish officials have complained in recent months that Kurdish officials in senior positions in the Iraqi government, including Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan region, are actively supporting the Kurdish Workers Party, known as the PKK. Mr. Barzani and other Kurdish officials say they do not support attacks by the PKK into Turkey.
 At the Pentagon on Wednesday, Mr. Morrell said, ''If American-issued weapons have ended up in the hands of criminals in Turkey or terrorists in Turkey, that is not based upon the policy of this department or this government.''
 As the American authorities work to clamp down on any illicit flow of American-supplied weapons to insurgents, Mr. Geren, the Army secretary, announced that two new review panels would address immediate problems and systemic shortcomings in the contracting system. 
 One panel of retired generals and civilian contracting experts, led by Jacques Gansler, a former top Pentagon acquisition official, will examine the Army contracting system and report back in 45 days how to improve its organization, staffing levels, auditing ability and other functions to prevent fraud, waste and abuse. 
 The second review, led by Lt. Gen. N. Ross Thompson III and Kathryn Condon, two Army contracting specialists, will examine current operations, Mr. Geren said. It will look for improprieties in the 18,000 contracts awarded from 2003 to 2007 by the Army's big contracting office in Kuwait. Those contracts to clothe, house and feed American forces moving in and out of Kuwait are valued at more than $3 billion.

HEADLINE: No Time for Threats

 BODY:
French President Nicolas Sarkozy made the wrong gesture at the wrong time by brandishing the possible use of force against Iran's nuclear weapons program in his first major foreign policy address. The United States and its allies need to be stepping up their efforts to resolve the serious dangers posed by Iran through comprehensive negotiations and increased international economic pressure, not by talking about military action. 
 Mr. Sarkozy, who has previously said that France would not join Washington in military action against Iran, did not exactly endorse an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in Monday's speech. He asserted that a nuclear-armed Iran would be ''unacceptable'' and reaffirmed support for the ongoing diplomatic initiative by the United States, France and other world powers. That initiative involves the imposition of U.N.-mandated sanctions against Iran while offering significant political and economic benefits if Iran stops enriching uranium. It is a deal Tehran so far has refused. 
 What's scary is that his comments may reflect his understanding of where American policy is headed. Far closer to Washington than his predecessor, Mr. Sarkozy just spent time with President Bush on vacation in Maine. His remarks, reflecting his blunt, no-nuance style, will be read as a warning to Tehran and to countries reluctant to increase the penalties for Iran's nuclear ambitions. The message: If the diplomatic initiative fails, Iran will have nuclear weapons or there will be military action to prevent it. Mr. Bush added to the bullying yesterday by suggesting the nuclear threat from Iran was a justification for keeping American troops in Iraq. 
 Unvarnished comments like Sarkozy's are likely to backfire in Iran, stoking nationalist sentiment to the advantage of hard-line leaders, like President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who stand up to the West and resist compromise. They may also be read by Bush administration hawks as a sign of growing European acceptance of the military option. France has shown impressive diplomatic resolve and should be cashing that in for further diplomatic pressure on Iran. Mr. Sarkozy should not give Mr. Bush any excuse to lessen the diplomatic push. 
 The chance of persuading Tehran to forsake nuclear weapons at this point may be slim. But the international community has at least one more opportunity to intensify sanctions. Over the past few years, the United States, Britain, France and Germany have made remarkable strides in forging an international consensus opposed to Iran's nuclear weapons program. But for that to translate into effective sanctions, the U.N. Security Council must remained united. 
 Tehran made a deal this month with U.N. inspectors to resolve questions over its nuclear program that is just another pretense of addressing international concerns. China and Russia, the main obstructionists on the Security Council, will try to use that deal as another excuse to resist tougher sanctions. The United States and its allies must creatively push for the maximum sanctions possible. This is the time for robust diplomacy, not threats.

HEADLINE: A Return To The Mother Of Conflicts

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is on book leave.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 The sources of global frustration with the Bush administration have been many and varied, but its refusal over several years to get serious about the Israel-Palestine conflict has ranked high. To dream some path led from Baghdad to Jerusalem was always upside-down foolishness.
 So President George W. Bush's discovery last month that ''Iraq is not the only pivotal matter in the Middle East'' was encouraging, as was his tacit relegation of the ''road map'' to nowhere. The Bush endgame, like Clinton's, is going to see a push for a resolution of the mother of all conflicts. 
 R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, told me a ''supreme effort to help Israelis and Palestinians define a framework for Palestinian statehood'' is to be made. ''We don't rule out Palestinian statehood, certainly not, within the term of this presidency,'' he said.
 The convocation of a conference in the United States in November ups the ante and demonstrates that the incremental has been supplanted by a thrust for the finish line.
 Is this just a hopeless lunge for the history books from a lame-duck administration undone by Iraq? Bush, swagger stripped, is weak. Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, may be even weaker. The Palestinians are split, the region radicalized by Iran rising and Iraq fissuring.
 But low expectations are a diplomat's ally. It may seem foolish to speak of exhaustion in a conflict with such proven regenerative capacity. Yet that is what a senior U.S. official found recently in the region, alongside a conviction that ''it's time to change the Israeli-Arab equation.''
 In fact, that equation has already changed. The Palestinian national movement and global jihadism are distinct, but to the extent the former has been permeated by the latter it has redoubled the determination of Palestinian pragmatists like President Mahmoud Abbas and his prime minister, Salam Fayyad, to deliver.
 Regular Abbas-Olmert meetings of late are one sign of this. The Israelis like Fayyad, a manager and doer. Radicalizing currents are such that people see ''this opportunity may not materialize again,'' Burns argued.
 Another shift involves Iran's growing influence -- in Shia-dominated Iraq, in Lebanon through Hezbollah and in Gaza through Hamas. The Shia crescent makes Sunni states jumpy. Israel is Iran's enemy. The enemy of an enemy can be a friend.
 ''Most, if not all the Sunni countries, see Iran as disturbing, unhelpful and violent,'' Burns told me. ''It's a hard question whether they now see Iran as more dangerous than Israel. But most of these states understand that Israel is not a threat to them while Iran might be.''
 To coax Gulf countries to reach out to Israel -- a Saudi presence with Israel at the November conference is a core U.S. strategic aim -- the United States is readying a multibillion-dollar military aid package for them. It needs Congressional approval that will not come easily.
 The package ''says to the Iranians and Syrians that the United States is the major power in the Middle East and will continue to be and is not going away,'' Burns said. It is designed to strengthen Sunni allies and bolster their conventional deterrence against Iran.
 Unlike Clinton in 2000, who tried to coax Yasir Arafat to compromise and hoped Middle Eastern states would follow, Bush is trying to capitalize on Sunni unease to get the region to reinforce the Abbas-Fayyad peace push.
 The other side of this approach is confrontation with Tehran. Burns argues there is no other strategic choice if Iran continues to enrich uranium and embrace terrorists.
 The price, however, will be Iranian use of surrogates to attempt to sink in blood any Israeli-Palestinian progress. Why not quietly expand existing contacts with Iran in Baghdad to cover all issues? 
 A decisive political contest has begun. The United States must deliver by November or its conference will be a farce that only feeds the sophisticated Iranian propaganda machine. 
 Delivering means Saudis at the same table as Israelis: de facto, if not de jure, recognition. It means enough hammering on Israel's ''occupation'' -- Bush's word -- to enable Abbas-Fayyad to get the West Bank economy moving.
 It means sufficient progress on territorial compromise and the principles governing the thorniest issues -- Jerusalem and refugees -- for Palestinians in Gaza to wonder if they are missing the statehood express.
 The Bush administration, in its uncritical war-on-terror embrace of Israel, contributed to Palestinian hopelessness on which Hamas thrived. It can undo that damage only by ushering in hope.

HEADLINE: Neither Arenas Nor Dives, New Clubs Hope to Succeed With More Style

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
It's the kind of thing you might expect to see in a multimillion-dollar concert hall in Berlin or Los Angeles, not in a rock club in a former mayonnaise plant in Brooklyn: a sloped ceiling incorporating sophisticated acoustical design, made up of eight curved segments that are suspended from the roof on rubber mounts.
 But there it is at the Music Hall of Williamsburg, the latest development in a building spree that has radically changed the live-music landscape of New York over the last few years. Set to open on Tuesday with a concert by Patti Smith, the Music Hall, which holds 550 people, has been under construction for five months by its owners, the Bowery Presents, a concert promoter that also operates the Bowery Ballroom and the Mercury Lounge and puts on shows at Webster Hall. And in October the Bowery Presents will open another club, the 3,000-capacity Terminal 5 on West 56th Street in Manhattan. 
 Brian Swier, the Music Hall's architect, pointed out on a recent tour some of the other details of the new space, which has been built on the site of the former Northsix club on North Sixth Street. After gutting the interior and removing the ceiling between the first and second floors, Mr. Swier built balconies on the side, similar to those he created for the Bowery Ballroom eight years ago. Like the ceiling, the balcony walls are rounded to minimize harsh sonic reflections, and the steel pillars that held up the first-floor ceiling are being removed, leaving a wide, spacious room with unimpeded sightlines from virtually any spot.
 ''It's the Bowery in Brooklyn,'' said John Moore, one of the principal partners of the Bowery Presents.
 As local rents have skyrocketed, and even the big players of the national touring market have increased their investments in smaller spaces, the usual economic pattern of club turnover in New York has changed. In the past small clubs sprouted as often as others closed, but in the last three years the losses have mounted as clubs like the Bottom Line, CBGB, Tonic and Sin-e have been forced out by debt and rising rents. At the same time a number of spiffy new midsize clubs have opened, including the Highline Ballroom and the Blender Theater at Gramercy in Manhattan and the Luna Lounge in Brooklyn. 
 Live Nation, the world's biggest concert promoter, has responded to the local challenge posed by the Bowery Presents and A.E.G. Live, a national company that operates the Nokia Theater in Times Square, by shaking up its New York staff and investing in small and midsize rooms in the area. Live Nation is looking to open several new spaces in New York and New Jersey and to remodel the Gramercy, said Kevin Morrow, a former House of Blues executive who is the new president of Live Nation's New York division. (Live Nation bought House of Blues last year for $350 million.)
 ''We're going to fix it up to make a certain vibe that was never there before,'' Mr. Morrow said of the Gramercy. ''We're going to bring in some House of Blues elements in the way it looks.'' He mentioned paintings, vivid lighting and ''some really cool artwork and tapestries and stuff.'' The 650-capacity Gramercy does not have the room for a full House of Blues-style makeover, he said, but ''we're definitely going to funk it up.''
 The Bowery Presents' second looming move in this chess game is Terminal 5, to open on Oct. 11 with the Brooklyn indie band the National. On the site of the former Exit dance club, the room is big enough to compete with the Hammerstein and Roseland Ballrooms, two other large clubs in Midtown, both operated by Live Nation. 
 Named in tribute to Eero Saarinen's 1962 T.W.A. building at Kennedy Airport, Terminal 5 is a rectangular box with two upper levels of balconies on three sides. Though it has not required such extensive renovations as the Music Hall of Williamsburg -- the stage will be enlarged and smaller rooms along the balconies will be opened up -- a tour this week revealed soon-to-vanish remnants of the club's disco past: a room with mirrored ceilings and pink padded walls, plastic ''La Mega 97.9'' maracas from a radio promotion lying in rubble. 
 Northsix was a pioneer in Williamsburg when it opened in 2001, specializing in metal and aggressive avant-rock. Despite the arrival of some similar spaces nearby like Europa, Northsix's programming void has not been filled, though the heart of any longtime New York metal fan will be warmed by one recent comeback: L'Amour, the landmark club in Bay Ridge that had early shows by Guns N' Roses and Metallica, reopened in June on Staten Island. 
 Other new rooms are on their way. Peter Shapiro, who owned Wetlands, the TriBeCa rock and jam-band club that closed in 2001, is planning next spring to open Brooklyn Bowl, a 20,000-square-foot combination bowling alley and performance space in Williamsburg. And the party-metal singer Andrew W. K. is looking to open a club at 100 Lafayette Street, just below Canal Street, though he and his partners would not say when.
 All of this raises the question of whether the local market can support such an explosion of new spaces, and what effect musical gentrification will have on traditionally artist-friendly neighborhoods. Next door to the Music Hall is Galapagos, an eclectic performance space that will be moving to the Dumbo neighborhood in Brooklyn after 12 years in Williamsburg. Robert Elmes, Galapagos's founder and director, said that he hopes to work with his former landlord to keep some kind of arts space open, but that it would have to present more profitable and less experimental work.
 ''The programming profile that Galapagos is missioned to accomplish can no longer live in Williamsburg,'' Mr. Elmes said. ''Puppets just don't pay the rent, so we're moving ourselves, our resident artists and the puppets all down to Dumbo.'' 
 The Bowery Presents is confident that the market is healthy and that the continuing strength of Williamsburg as a nightlife destination will serve as a draw for its new club. The company said that its study of the ZIP codes for ticket buyers to the first Music Hall shows revealed that slightly more people from Manhattan than from Brooklyn will be coming to Williamsburg.
 ''Even that it was close was a surprise,'' said Jim Glancy, one of the Bowery partners, of the ZIP code report. ''But it reflects where people are living and partying and hanging out and where the hip young neighborhood is.''

HEADLINE: Faith and Civic Pride Clash Over Parade on Yom Kippur

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
HERKIMER, N.Y.
 When volunteers first got together 18 months ago to plan festivities marking the 200th anniversary of this down-on-its-luck village in central New York, they quickly agreed on one thing: The occasion deserved a grand parade, one with more convertibles, marching bands, dignitaries and floats than any other in recent memory.
 All they had to do, then, was pick a date.
 Herkimer, a village of 8,000 about 13 miles southeast of Utica, was incorporated on April 6, 1807, but to schedule a parade in April meant to risk holding it under snow. May and June were out because of exams at the local community college and graduation ceremonies at the high school. ''And in the summer,'' said Mayor Mark M. Ainsworth, ''too many people are away.'' 
 Someone pulled out a pocket calendar and suggested Sept. 22, homecoming weekend at Herkimer High.
 ''It seemed like the perfect time,'' said Mayor Ainsworth, who also heads the Herkimer Bicentennial Commission, a citizens' group that has raised $50,000 to sponsor the parade and a more modest roster of activities spread throughout the year. ''We didn't know it at the time, but we were making a big mistake.''
 As it turned out, Sept. 22 is Yom Kippur, one of the holiest dates in the Jewish calendar and a day of strict observance for the storied yet dwindling congregation at Temple Beth Joseph, the village's sole synagogue.
 In late March, when the congregation's president, Judi Laymon, found out about the parade's schedule, she called the mayor, with whom she had gone to high school, and asked if there was anything he could do to avoid the conflict.
 ''I hoped that through negotiations we could pick another day for the parade,'' said Ms. Laymon, whose paternal grandfather, Joseph Pizer, helped found the congregation in the 1930s. ''We're part of the community, too, and we all wanted to participate in the celebrations, but we just couldn't do it on Yom Kippur.''
 Organizers agreed to delay the start of the march and change the route of the parade, originally planned to run past the synagogue at the height of Saturday's religious service. But they were dead set on the date.
 ''We were at a point where everything fit, the bands were booked, everything was in place,'' said Katherine L. Nichols, a village trustee and chairwoman of the parade committee. ''It was too late in the process to make significant adjustments.''
 The decision provoked a very public battle, which played out for months in church halls, at civic meetings and on the pages of local newspapers. Apologies, issued in private and in public, were accepted early on, but have done little to quash a controversy that has sullied an event devised to energize a place trying hard to resurrect its glorious past.
 ''I don't understand how this could have slipped by,'' said Patt Lewis, who has owned a print shop on Main Street for 18 years. ''The sad thing is that if people had been more careful, this could have been avoided from the get-go.''
 Herkimer occupies land that once housed Fort Dayton, a colonial encampment on the north side of the Mohawk River. It takes its name from a Revolutionary War general who led a colonialist contingent in the Battle of Oriskany, one of the bloodiest in the eight-year conflict.
 The village thrived after the construction of the Erie Canal, its streets speckled with factories and mills cranking out shoes, clothes, furniture and coat hangers. Several of the factories belonged to Jewish merchants, who started moving here in the mid-1800s. The first to arrive, Frank Popper, opened a hotel on Main Street. The ones who followed ran hoop-skirt plants, as well as knitting and lumber mills. Main Street later became a bustling road lined with restaurants, hardware shops, a movie theater and department stores.
 The public library is named after a Jewish man, Frank J. Basloe, who died in 1966 and is still considered one of the village's most generous benefactors. (A panel of judges who will select the parade's best in show is going to assemble just outside the library building, on Main Street.) 
 ''Our past economic prosperity is due, in part, to the contributions of the Jewish community,'' said Susan R. Perkins, executive director of the Herkimer County Historical Society.
 And Vernon L. Lee, who at 100 is half as old as the village, recalled one of its Jewish merchants in an interview about his selection as the parade's grand marshal in late August.
 ''I must mention Nate Myers's men's clothing store, where I used to shop,'' said Mr. Lee, referring to an immigrant from Lithuania who founded the village's Hebrew Society. 
 But as the canal ceased its operation, as industries closed their doors and as shopping malls stole Main Street's clientele, the village fell on hard times. The movie theater closed. Elegant homes still stand on the northern edge of Main Street, but most have been carved into apartments and are in desperate need of a paint job.
 On the opposite end, a whiff of revival emanates from a cozy cafe that opened below new privately owned student dormitories; a restaurant and pizzeria are set to open next door. In between, however, abandoned storefronts pockmark dilapidated facades, which stand along sidewalks refurbished with small state grants.
 The synagogue, meanwhile, erected at the corner of Prospect and Church Streets in 1949, continues to thrive in spite of its own difficulties: It serves just 40 families, a far cry from its heyday, and no longer has a resident rabbi.
 ''A lot of our children don't stay here, like other children from the area, who go elsewhere for more opportunities,'' Ms. Laymon said. ''Still, Herkimer is our home, so we feel saddened and, in some ways, left out.''
 The Herkimer Interfaith Clergy Council, an umbrella religious organization, said in a letter published in June by a local newspaper, The Evening Telegram, that it refused to ''participate in something that will not allow all faith communities to be represented.'' 
 That same month, the bicentennial commission's secretary, Connie Vertucci, issued a challenge of sorts via The Observer-Dispatch of Utica: ''If anyone out there knows he or she can do a better job, step up. I would love to spend the rest of the year gardening, reading and generally calling my time my own.'' 
 On June 29, The Observer-Dispatch itself pitched in with an editorial: ''Marching bands might add temporary excitement to a celebration, but drumbeats quickly fade away,'' it said. ''When the history of Herkimer's bicentennial celebration is written, it would be better that it be remembered as an all-inclusive community event rather than one that slammed the door on some of its people.''
 A week later, administrators at Herkimer County Community College decided to withdraw their participation in the parade.
 ''This is not a religious issue; it doesn't matter that this happens to be the Jewish community'' being excluded, the college's president, Ronald F. Williams, said in an interview. ''It is that a segment of the community was left out, either by happenstance or intent, and village officials did not stand up and say, 'Hey, it's time to stop this.' ''
 Mayor Ainsworth, who at 42 is serving his fifth consecutive two-year term, said that he was ''just one person in a committee,'' and that if he could have had his way, he would have changed the date of the parade.
 ''I know a lot of people in the Jewish community, and I feel sick to my stomach that this happened,'' he said. ''It took all the joy out of the celebration. But if there's any positive to come out of this, I hope it's that it will make us more aware of the groups that make up our community, and that we'll stand together, in spite of our differences.''

HEADLINE: Speculators Seen As Causing Many Defaults

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Investors who tried to turn a profit on the housing market are having an outsize influence on surging mortgage defaults in former boom states like California and Florida, a banking industry group said Thursday. 
 The trade group, the Mortgage Bankers Association, released an analysis of mortgage defaults in Florida, Nevada, Arizona and California, states that experienced strong price appreciation during this decade's housing boom.
 As of June 30, properties owned by investors in those states accounted for a higher percentage of defaults than the national average, the M.B.A. said.
 ''Defaults are on the rise in most parts of the country, but it should be recognized that it is not always the case of a homeowner losing his or her home but is often the case of an investor gambling on a continued increase in home values and losing that gamble,'' said Douglas G. Duncan, the trade group's chief economist.
 Nevada had the highest share of investor-owned defaults. Among defaults on loans given to borrowers with strong credit, 32 percent were by investors. For defaults on loans given to borrowers with weak credit, 24 percent were by investors.
 That compares with a national average of 16 percent for less-risky borrowers and 12 percent for risky borrowers, according to the M.B.A.
 Arizona had the second-highest percentage of investor defaults, followed by Florida and California.
 The report comes amid debate about what effect the housing market's slump will have.
 The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, expanded at an annual rate of 4 percent in the April-June quarter, significantly higher than the 3.4 percent rate the government initially estimated a month ago.

ART
 '25 YEARS LATER: WELCOME TO ART IN GENERAL' To celebrate its 25th anniversary, the scruffy, downtown, nonprofit art space Art in General is presenting a dozen newly commissioned installations by artists who have participated in its recent programs at the well-heeled Midtown gallery of UBS, one of the world's leading financial firms. It is an unorthodox partnership, though there is something immensely appealing about the idea of experimental art invading this sterile corporate environment. A handful of the artworks even poke fun at corporate culture and greed, including Ana Prvacki's mock money-laundering service (complete with a promotional video); the Dutch collective Bik Van der Pol's installation inspired by an out-of-print guidebook, ''How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found''; and Lee Walton's hiring of an actor to hang around the gallery's 51st Street entrance for an hour each day, pretending to be an office worker at lunch. Bleachers are provided nearby for viewers in the know. 
 Several pieces invite audience participation, including Surasi Kusolwong's 2007 work ''Ping-Pong (New York Common Sense),'' above, a mirrored Ping-Pong table covered in kitsch figurines; Kianga Ford's white, cocoonlike structures for relaxing and listening to stories on headphones; or Chitra Ganesh and Mariam Ghani's library of chilling -- even sickening -- information on immigration issues, including detentions, deportations and legal battles. Occasionally an office worker stops, sits down and starts reading. At this point the exhibition begins to make sense, sort of: It is about introducing radical, experimental art to new audiences. (Through Nov. 9, UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, 212-713-2885, artingeneral.org.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 Museums
 ? AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention. and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RICHARD POUSETTE-DART,' through Sept. 25. The youngest member of the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart (1916-1992) helped break the ice for the movement, only to be omitted from its histories. This show, while too small to make sense of his enormous output, confirms his originality, but also that he did his best work after 1960, when he extended his Ab-Ex origins into an eccentric hybrid of Minimal and Op Art that is alternately hallucinatory and kitschy. His late paintings don't so much hang on the wall as float in front of it, looking like either planes of granular light or slabs of jeweled stucco. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 ? INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did comprises most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman) 
 ? INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN-AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, a little too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)
 * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
 ? THE MET: 'NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,' through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; John Cederquist's elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) 
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,' through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father (an architect) and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master's from the Maryland Institute College of Art, which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled ''Ripa'' (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine's work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France's difficulties we feel echoes of our own. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,' through Jan. 13. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with ''sacred'' sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole's epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, ''The Course of Empire,'' is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher B. Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro- slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there was another in which slavery was defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, books and historical objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. (See above.) (Edward Rothstein)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'THE DONNER PARTY,' through Sept. 16. Jim Shaw's ''Donner Party'' merges the saga of the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party, westbound settlers trapped in the High Sierras in the winter of 1846 to 1847, with Judy Chicago's benchmark feminist installation ''The Dinner Party.'' The central element is a ring of miniature covered wagons that mimics the dining table in Ms. Chicago's work, with 27 sculptures assembled from items purchased in thrift stores. It may seem like a work based on sick, twisted, juvenile humor (O.K., it is -- but that's Mr. Shaw's allure), yet ''The Donner Party'' also contemplates how myths -- national or, in the case of Ms. Chicago, individual -- are forged and perpetuated, and it serves as a cautionary tale for taking them too seriously. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Schwendener)
 ? P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS,' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject of ''organizing chaos'' is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitiello. (See above.) (Smith)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'PETER YOUNG: 1963-1977,' through Sept. 24. This ebullient show retraces the rapid rise of a maverick abstract painter who made it big and then took a pass, leaving town to settle eventually in Bisbee, Ariz. With the dot as his main staple, he worked in an array of styles, mixing Color Field, Minimalism and Process Art as he pleased. There are near-Photo-Realist images of streaming galaxies; luscious motifs derived from folding bare canvas onto painted canvas; chunky necklaces made of acrylic paint; and quirky line paintings stretched on tree branches. The show is a blast from the past that singes the present. (See above.) (Smith)
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'GENERATION 1.5,' through Dec 2. Generation 1.5 refers to people who emigrate during their adolescent years, whose identity is shaped by both their old and new cultures. Some of the works in this exhibition address this process; elsewhere the show floats into general meditations on globalization and cultural dislocation. Lee Mingwei's ''Quartet Project,'' a sound and video installation, uses monitors playing a performance of Dvorak's ''American Quartet.'' Seher Shah's drawings combine lotus patterns, Mecca cubes and Western architectural motifs, and works by Rirkrit Tiravanija and Emily Jacir explore the successful contemporary artist as a globalized citizen. The show is emblematic of the museum's program, which is increasingly devoted to reflecting the borough's extreme diversity, but risks turning the immigrant experience into a platitude. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'MIDNIGHT'S DAYDREAM,' through Oct. 28. The three artists in this show were artists in residence at the Studio Museum of Harlem in the last year, but their work represents very different approaches. Titus Kaphar is the classicist, taking European and American portrait paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries and reconfiguring them into strategic compositions. Wardell Milan II is the archetypal collagist, photographing arrangements of art reproductions, family photos and images cut from magazines. Demetrius Oliver is the Conceptualist, working in the trickster vein of David Hammons and Duchamp. All three, however, actively confront race and (art) history, which often seems a mandate for young black artists. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Schwendener)
 WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbaran's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the piece de resistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul.

 'KOREAN FUNERARY FIGURES: COMPANIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE OTHER WORLD' What makes this somewhat unusual for a show of mortuary art is that the kkoktu, or figures adorning funeral biers, were created for ordinary citizens rather than for aristocrats or the wealthy. They're also rather fun and friendly. Brightly painted clowns, acrobats and animals were meant to accompany the dead into the next world, to ease the journey and provide consolation for the mourners. Among the 74 kkoktu are versions of ''The Guide,'' riding an animal; ''The Guard,'' who protects the soul from evil spirits; ''The Caregiver'' (generally women); and ''The Entertainer,'' as well as a replica of a funeral bier modeled on a late-18th-century original from Tongyoung, South Kyongsang Province. The Korea Society, 950 Third Avenue, (212) 759-7525, koreasociety.org, through Nov. 20.

 'DOUBLE X-RATED: WHERE THE GIRLS ARE' The ''Double X'' in the title of this all-woman group show, organized by Amelia Abdullahsani, refers to female chromosomes, which clearly do not determine any one art style. Despite a shared realism, goth-subculture portraits by the Stockholm-based Ulrika Minami Warmling are very different from Noel Grunwaldt's beautiful watercolors of dead birds. Katrin Sigurdardottir hides landscapes in boxes; Francesca Gabbiani conjures them up in collages; Joy Garnett continues her project of painting the contemporary political landscape, in this case in images derived from news reports of burning Paris immigrant neighborhoods. Stellan Holm Gallery, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, stellanholm.com, through Sept. 8. (Cotter)
 'MICROWAVE, FIVE' Where most galleries reveal their ''program,'' or general slant, with more or less candor in summer group shows, ''microwave, five'' is like a manifesto. A few veteran artists who work with obsessive precision, like Yayoi Kusama and Tom Friedman, offer some historical grounding. Younger artists include Ken Solomon, whose hand-painted postage stamps sent through the mail are here, as well as Jacob El Hanani, Adam Fowler, Xawery Wolski and Gloria Ortiz-Hernandez. Missing is Yuken Teruya, maker of virtuosic tree sculptures cut out of paper bags, and one of Ms. Bienvenu's most popular artists and probably the best representative of this meticulous aesthetic. Josee Bienvenu, 529 West 20th Street, joseebienvenugallery.com, through Sept. 15. (Schwendener)
 'PACKEDSOCKDRAWER' This is a strong candidate for best 2007 summer show title, even if, by no fault of its own, the recently closed ''NeoIntegrity,'' at Derek Eller, with nearly 200 artists, felt more like a packed sock drawer. The compactness of the show's title is echoed in both the works and the installation of Steve McCall's abstract, biomorphic paintings; David Moreno's photographs with concentric-circular compositions; Gary Batty's minute filigrees drawn on thick, cream-colored, handmade paper; and Tamara Zahaykevich's petit, colorful wall-mounted sculptures made with foam board, tape and glue. The caveat with a great show title is that you're tempted to stretch it out to the work, which here means comparing it to footwear, but we won't go there. Feature Inc., 530 West 25th Street, featureinc.com, through Sept. 20. (Schwendener)

 MARTIN CREED: 'FEELINGS' Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of beanbag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an antigravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)
 SOL LEWITT: 'DRAWING SERIES ...' If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)
 ? NINA BERMAN: 'PURPLE HEARTS' One of the more shocking photographs to come out of the current war in Iraq was taken last year in a rural town in the American Midwest. It's a studio portrait by Nina Berman of a young Illinois couple on their wedding day. The bride is dressed in a traditional white gown; the groom, a former Marine sergeant, is in full dress. Her expression is unsmiling, maybe grave. His face is all but featureless, with no nose and no chin, as blank as a pullover mask, the results of disfiguring wounds sustained in combat. The show also includes 10 portraits of wounded veterans from Ms. Berman's series ''Purple Hearts.'' Whatever your politics, the show, installed in a small storefront gallery, adds up to a desolating antiwar statement. Jen Bekman Gallery, 6 Spring Street, between the Bowery and Elizabeth Street, Lower East Side; (212) 219-0166, jenbekman.com, through Sept. 8. (Cotter) 
 Public Art
 MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct,'' and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31.

 'EMANCIPATORY ACTION: PAULA TROPE AND THE MENINOS' Paula Trope's work with the meninos, children who live in the favelas, or shantytowns, in Rio de Janeiro, is similar to Zana Briski's ''Kids With Cameras'' project, chronicled in the film ''Born Into Brothels.'' Like Ms. Briski, Ms. Trope distributes cameras among the children, but the cameras are rudimentary pinhole devices, and the grainy, blurry photographs, which look as if they were taken with a fisheye lens, are less photojournalism than elements in a larger conceptual project. Influenced by Brazilian art from the 1960s and '70s, made by -- Helio Oiticica, Cildo Meireles, Miguel Rio Branco and the filmmaker Glauber Rocha, figures central to Neo-Concretism, Tropicalia and Cinema Novo, Ms. Trope cites ''otherness'' and issues of authorship as central to her project. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 249-8950; closes Saturday. (Schwendener)
 ? GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE SHAPES OF SPACE' The Guggenheim takes time off from thematic blockbusters to bring the public up to date on recent acquisitions, provocatively installed by three younger curators among an astute selection of older works from the collection. The theme is space, one of modern art's central concerns. The results are mixed, but cause for optimism. It is not every day you can look at a Mondrian while listening to disco and rap emanating from another kind of grid: the flashing patterns of a digitized dance floor by Piotr Uklanski. The atmosphere can get a bit mall-like at times, but this is what every New York museum needs to do more: play with the collection and find new ways to bring it to life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Wednesday. (Smith)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION' A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum's collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: ''The question is not what you look at but what you see.'' Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans's late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore's landscapes and Rachel Harrison's photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show -- only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms -- it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Tuesday. (Schwendener)
 'OLD SCHOOL' The contemporary painters in ''Old School'' are interested in what might be called the proto-Surrealist sensibility of art made centuries before Freud. Anj Smith, Jakub Julian Ziolkowski and Hilary Harkness work well alongside Brueghel. A painting attributed to the School of Caravaggio serves as a reasonable springboard for grotesque still-life reinterpretations by Glenn Brown and John Currin, and portraits by Elizabeth Peyton and Jan van Noordt, among others. ''Old School'' skips the heavy art history explaining how paintings functioned as religious tracts, sermons on morality and proof of social status. But if you want art history, the Frick is only a block away. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com; closes Friday. (Schwendener)
 'SUBSTANCE & SURFACE' This impressively consistent but slyly varied group exhibition takes the modernist monochrome as its not-so-subtle subtext. Nearly everything on view has corners, a single dominating color and adheres to the wall one way or another. The theme is ostensible purity achieved by impure means, including sliced towel, unfurled cassette tape, homemade sandpaper, carpet, painted pebbles and pegboard. This 20th-century staple just keeps keeping on. Bortolami, 510 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com; closes Friday. (Smith)
 'THROUGH THE LIES OF YOUR DARK, DARK EYES' AND 'ALAIN DISTER: ELEGY FOR THE SUMMER OF LOVE' It might not have been planned, but both of these shows now at Envoy have something to say about the role of aesthetics in youth movements. ''Through the Lies of Your Dark, Dark Eyes'' is like an epilogue to art of the last decade that borrowed heavily from Gothic music and literature -- only here doom and gloom are tempered with ''bits of sentiment'' and the ''calm in endless despair,'' according to the gallery release. Alain Dister's photographs taken in New York and California in 1967 and 1968 rely on the good looks and canny fashion sense of his counterculture subjects, but Mr. Dister was on to something, identifying how youth movements are often characterized by -- and even find substance in -- style, from the black lipstick and eyeliner of the Goths to the barefoot dandy strutting down Haight Street. Envoy, 131 Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 226-4555, envoygallery.com; closes Saturday. (Schwendener) 
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RESISTANCE IS ... ' This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it's smart, engaging and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn't look or feel more apposite. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio)

HEADLINE: Growth Pace Accelerated In 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The economy enjoyed a strong revival in the spring, although growing troubles in housing and credit markets have darkened prospects considerably since then.
 The gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, expanded at an annual rate of 4 percent in the April-June quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That was the strongest showing in more than a year and considerably higher than the 3.4 percent estimate for growth made a month ago. 
 The performance reflected increased activity in areas like international trade and business investment, offseting a continued plunge in housing construction.
 But that growth could be the best showing for some time as the economy continues to be battered by the worst housing slump in 16 years and a widening credit crisis that has made financial markets highly volatile in recent weeks.
 ''The economy has taken a significant blow from the turmoil in financial markets and the housing downturn, which is intensifying,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com.
 Many economists said they expected growth to slow to around 2 percent in the current quarter, just half the spring pace, and perhaps dip below 2 percent in the final three months of the year as the impact from the market turbulence on consumer and business confidence takes more of a toll.
 But analysts said they still believed that the economy, whose current expansion will be six years old in November, would be able to avoid a full-blown recession.
 ''While a recession in the United States is clearly possible,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight, a research firm, ''one of the biggest positives going forward is that the rest of the world still looks good, which means we will get continued help from rising exports.''
 An improved trade performance, representing higher sales of American products overseas and lower imports, was the biggest contributor to the second-quarter improvement, adding 1.4 percentage points to the 4 percent growth rate.
 Analysts said they were confident that the Federal Reserve would act in time to ward off a recession by cutting interest rates should current financial troubles intensify.
 In a second report Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits rose for a fifth consecutive week, increasing by 9,000, to 334,000 last week, the highest level since April.
 Analysts said some of those gains probably came from rising layoffs in the mortgage industry, where many firms specializing in offering subprime loans have had to cut workers or close.

HEADLINE: Abandoned at the Border

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. HOAR. 
Joseph P. Hoar, a retired Marine general, was commander in chief of the United States Central Command from 1991 to 1994.

 BODY:
FOR more than a year, men and women in our armed forces have been urging the United States to bring to safety the Iraqi translators and others who have worked beside them and are now the victims of retaliation. A Marine captain, Zachary Iscol, said he owed his life and the lives of his men to his Iraqi translator. ''Just coming to work was an act of heroism and courage on his part,'' Captain Iscol said. 
 On July 7, the administration received another urgent call to action on this issue, this time from Ambassador Ryan Crocker. In a cable to Washington, he laid out the dangers his Iraqi employees faced. ''Just last week we recovered and identified the bodies of two ... who were kidnapped in May,'' he wrote. Mr. Crocker wanted to be able to assure the Iraqis on his staff that they had some hope of receiving refuge in the United States. 
 It is shameful that more than four years into this war, Iraqis working at our embassy cannot count on the United States to protect them or to help them find a new home when their work with us has made it impossible to survive in their own country.
 Similarly, it is both cruel and foolish for the United States to ignore the plight of more than two million others who have fled and are struggling to survive in Syria and Jordan. The United States pledge this week of $30 million to help educate Iraqi refugees in the region is dwarfed by the need.
 Dealing with the refugee crisis is vital to the national security of the United States. Continuing indifference to suffering that we had a strong hand in causing will turn our Muslim supporters against us. More important, it repudiates the fundamental values of our country and costs Iraqis their lives. 
 The administration has promised to resettle 7,000 Iraqi refugees by September. By the beginning of August, it had brought in just 190. Jordan has taken in some 700,000 Iraqi refugees -- equivalent to more than 10 percent of its own population. Syria has taken in more than 1.2 million, and significant numbers are in Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and the Persian Gulf states. Unlike the United States, none of these countries are well prepared to integrate refugees. Sectarian fighting has paralyzed the Lebanese government, Jordan is water poor, and Syria struggles with a poor economy and high unemployment. At a recent conference in the region, these countries pleaded for international help to deal with the crisis. 
 So while tiny Jordan struggles to cope with 700,000 refugees, the United States will not meet a goal of only 7,000. The United States is sending a clear message to the refugees and the countries sheltering them: you are on your own. 
 Without serious American or other international support, a downward spiral is beginning for the refugees and the Middle East. In Jordan, the cost of living has doubled for all residents, leading to sharp resentment against both the Iraqis and the government. In turn, the Jordanian government has denied most Iraqi refugees the right to work and restricted their access to health care.
 Syria, one of the last countries to keep its borders open to the Iraqis, has suggested it cannot continue to do so much longer without some kind of international support. Social services there are collapsing, and poverty has driven many refugees toward desperation. 
 This strain could all have a terribly destabilizing effect on the Middle East. This year, for the first time, the Jordanian government is giving Iraqi children access to public education -- which means keeping 30 schools open for double shifts. By some estimates, half a million Iraqi refugee children are now out of school, and some have missed up to three years of their education. In a region where Al Qaeda is becoming a franchise, ensuring that these children can go to school is as vital to regional security as fighting insurgents in Iraq. 
 As September comes with no sign of progress in Iraq, momentum is finally building in Congress for a new comprehensive strategy that will at least prevent the instability there from spreading. As a key part of that strategy, the United States must reach out to Iraq's neighbors -- including Syria -- and demonstrate a willingness to help support and take in refugees, starting with those who risked their lives to stand with us.

HEADLINE: Freddie Mac Earnings Drop 45%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Freddie Mac, the nation's No. 2 buyer and backer of home mortgages, set aside more than $300 million in the second quarter to account for bad loans, contributing to a 45 percent drop in profit. 
 The company is seen as a source of housing market stability, along with its larger government-sponsored sibling Fannie Mae. Nevertheless, Freddie Mac, based in McLean, Va., said it had recorded the provision for credit losses in the quarter because of problems with loans originated this year and last year.
 The action comes amid a deepening mortgage crisis nationwide that has bankrupted more than 50 lenders, many of them ones that had served borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit.
 Shares in Freddie Mac closed down 5 percent, at $60.07.
 Freddie Mac said it was experiencing higher delinquency rates on the East and West Coasts, and not just in areas of the Midwest with high unemployment.
 The company said losses from defaulted mortgages, while still a tiny portion of its mortgage portfolio, rose to 0.02 percent in the second quarter and were expected to keep rising into next year. While those losses are worsening, they are still below average for the company, the chief financial officer, Anthony S. Piszel, said.
 ''Given the credit environment, we think we performed reasonably well,'' he said.
 The government-sponsored company, which is returning to normality after an accounting scandal four years ago, makes money from interest payments on mortgages it holds on its books and on fees from insuring mortgages sold to investors.
 It earned $764 million, or $1.02 a share, for the three months that ended June 30. That compares with profit of $1.4 billion, or $1.93 a share, a year ago.
 The results missed Wall Street expectations, with analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expecting a profit of $1.16 a share on revenue of $1.69 billion for the quarter. Revenue rose 4.8 percent, to $2.26 billion, from $2.15 billion in the quarter a year ago.

HEADLINE: Shares End Mixed After a Seesaw Day

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks finished a back-and-forth session mixed yesterday as investors grappled with weaker-than-expected economic data and weighed the chances that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. 
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is expected to speak today at the central bank's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. He said in a letter on Wednesday to Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, that Fed policy makers were ''prepared to act as needed'' if the market's turmoil damages the economy. The Fed's next meeting is Sept. 18, but some on Wall Street expect the central bank could act sooner.
 The Commerce Department said second-quarter gross domestic product grew 4.0 percent -- its fastest pace in more than a year, and well above the 0.6 percent rise in the first quarter. But the broadest measure of economic health came in slightly lower than many anticipated, and the report suggested that business investment, not consumer spending, was the main driver of growth.
 Also, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said United States home prices rose just 0.1 percent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, the lowest quarterly increase since 1994.
 The Dow fell 50.56 points, or 0.38 percent, to 13,238.73. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.12 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,457.64, while the Nasdaq rose 2.14 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,565.30. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.21, or 0.53 percent, to 783.11.
 A worse-than-expected quarterly earnings report from Freddie Mac because of troubles in mortgage lending fed some selling early in the day, as did signs that companies were still finding that demand for commercial paper was low.
 In addition, Lehman Brothers lowered its ratings on investment banks, stirring concerns about how well their profits will hold up in a market where it is tougher and more expensive to get deals done. Goldman Sachs fell $2.34, to $171.38; Merrill Lynch slid 93 cents, to $72.18; and Morgan Stanley fell $1.05, to $60.16.
 In one possible bright spot, some investors say they see some positive signs for the technology sector, giving the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index a large boost.
 Late on Wednesday, Sigma Designs posted a strong second-quarter profit, which, excluding special items, beat Wall Street estimates. Sigma Designs rose $4.07, or 10.5 percent, to $42.70. Other technology stocks -- including Apple, Cisco Systems and Motorola -- also had solid gains. Apple rose $2.17, to $136.25, Cisco advanced 43 cents, to $31.43, and Motorola tacked on 28 cents, finishing at $16.75.
 Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.50 percent from 4.56 percent on Wednesday. The price rose 14/32, to 101 30/32.
 Light crude oil fell 15 cents, to $73.36 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about five to three on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to a light 2.59 billion shares compared with 2.77 billion traded Wednesday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: A Lower Peninsula Spot Draws a Wider Crowd

BYLINE: By JEFF VANDAM

 BODY:
EVERY year, it seems, the vacationers and second-home owners arrive earlier in Leland, Mich., attracted by the spirit-altering sunsets over the shipwreck-salted Manitou Islands and a modest life of sand, trees and deep blue water.
 Roosting on the shoreline between feisty Lake Michigan and the calm of Lake Leelanau, Leland has for decades drawn summer flaneurs from Detroit and Chicago to its fishing and beaches.
 Now, real estate agents say, that base is growing in the bantam-size hamlet in the sleepy sugar-sand portion of Michigan's lower peninsula that most residents call ''Up North.'' Visitors from the South and the West are joining the Midwesterners for local winery tours and Leland's summer food and wine festival, which are all part of its sauntering way of life.
 And good weather last spring spurred a surprising early tide of out-of-towners. So the Cove, a restaurant that has proudly mounted a collection of outboard motors on its walls, opened earlier in the season than usual to sate the collective craving for a plate of fresh fried perch. 
 Michael Steichen, a 57-year-old oral surgeon from the northwestern suburbs of Chicago, understands the allure. He has taken his family to Leland since the late 1970s, hypnotized enough by the blue water that seems to appear in every direction to make the six-hour drive several times a year. ''When we tell people here in Chicago that we have a vacation home that far away, they say, 'Isn't that just too far to go?' '' Dr. Steichen said. ''I tell them once I'm here, it's not far away enough from Chicago.''
 The Steichens have boated around both Lake Leelanau and Lake Michigan for years, amazed at the lack of crowds even on the Fourth of July, often finishing the day by tying up their boat on the Leland River and having dinner at the Bluebird, a revered local restaurant. 
 ''My children are now in their early-to-mid-20s,'' Dr. Steichen said, ''and they look back on that time growing up there as really the best part of their lives.''
 Until recently, the Steichens kept a cottage, as Michiganders call small summer houses, on Lake Leelanau, as well as a patch of land on Lake Michigan, only to sell both and buy a three-bedroom house with 200 feet of frontage on Lake Michigan, separated from Route M-22 by a large pine forest. Although Dr. Steichen shied from discussing the price he paid, local real estate agents say family-size houses on either lake generally start at $1 million.
 The Scene
 For all the sun and sand that provide a great deal of Leland's cachet, they are not its defining symbols, nor is the silver-green local fish called chub that is depicted on hats at Harbor House Trading Company on Main Street. (One slogan: ''Got chub?'')
 More than anything, the township's key feature is Fishtown, a collection of weathered century-old fishing shacks camped around the Leland River where it meets Lake Michigan. Though battered old fishing boats with names like Far-Fetched and Sea Witch are still available for hire, many of Fishtown's shacks are now home to shops like the Village Cheese Shanty, which makes sandwiches and sells venerated Michigan beers like Bell's Oberon.
 Outside Fishtown, there are small shops like Leelanau Books and a few artists' studios, as well as a coffee bar, a historical museum and, tellingly, several real estate firms. For dinners and breakfasts, many families, like the Steichens, make a tradition of eating at the Bluebird, a 74-year-old restaurant that offers up 22 desserts with its brunch buffet on weekends. 
 And if Leland starts to feel a bit too small, there is the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, a stunning collection of towering sand bluffs, just 15 miles down Route M-22.
 Pros
 Leland is far from many places, but hardly isolated. The peninsula on which it sits, abutting one side of Grand Traverse Bay to the east, is a growing place where vineyards are arriving rapidly among the cherry orchards, and nearby towns are hustling to build up restaurants and condominiums along their waterfronts. 
 Still, it's the very opposite of frenetic. ''We have, I think, two stop lights in the entire county,'' said David Shiflett, a Leelanau County commissioner. 
 Cons
 For those looking for a four-season resort, Leland may not be ideal. The best weather months are typically from May through September; several shops are open only then.
 On the topic of stores, Leland has few besides the groceries at the Leland Mercantile Company on Main Street, and many homeowners make the 27-mile trip down the peninsula to Traverse City, which has about 15,000 people and a branch of Meijer, a homegrown Michigan superstore.
 The Real Estate Market
 Mark Carlson, a real estate agent and manager of the Leland office of Coldwell Banker Schmidt Realtors, said Leland essentially has four types of properties, with varying degrees of cost and no set architectural style. 
 First in price and demand are beachfront and waterfront houses and lots; whether they are on Lake Leelanau or Lake Michigan, price per frontage foot remains basically the same, with a range of $2,500 to $12,500 and total prices from $1 million to $5 million, Mr. Carlson said. Then there are houses with water or sunset views, followed by inland properties that contain small farms or vineyards, which start at around $4,000 per acre, though vineyards can bring as much as $10,000. Last, there are the houses and bungalows within Leland itself, not on the water or in view of it but a short walk away, which start at around $250,000. 
 ''There are other properties, and less expensive properties,'' said Perry Pentiuk, who owns Venture Properties in Leland. ''But if someone says, 'I want to buy a lake lot for $250,000,' I'm going to be really hard pressed to find them something on any lake. That's the fact: Leelanau County, it's expensive here.''
 Despite an economic slowdown in Michigan, the market in Leland has not taken a hit, said Tim Schaub, an owner of the Schaub Team of ReMax Bayshore Properties in Traverse City, with sales up roughly 5 percent over 2006. Vacant lots on the water are desirable, and if an out-of-town buyer purchases a small cottage on a waterfront lot, the cottage is sometimes demolished. 
 Those out-of-town clients, Mr. Carlson said, represent most of the local customer base. He added that the amount of time a house remains on the market varies greatly, though the premium houses on Lake Michigan or Lake Leelanau tend to be snatched up if they are not grossly overpriced.
 LAY OF THE LAND
 POPULATION 2,134, according to a 2006 Census Bureau estimate.
 SIZE 45.6 square miles of land.
 LOCATION Leland is on Michigan's Leelanau Peninsula in the northwestern corner of the state's lower peninsula.
 WHO'S BUYING Families from Detroit, Grand Rapids and Chicago are prime movers, ranging from auto workers to professionals.
 GETTING THERE Leland is about 30 miles from the Cherry Capital Airport in Traverse City, which has regular flights to Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis. If you're driving, Detroit is 280 miles away and Chicago is about 350. 
 WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING It's hard to get more central than the Falling Waters Lodge in Fishtown (200 West Cedar Street, 231-256-9832; www.fallingwaterslodge.com), over the Leland River's waterfall with the Lake Michigan beach next door. Its 21 rooms and suites range from $69 to $179 a night.

 DANCENOW/NYC FESTIVAL Early September is the calm before the live-performance storm in New York, and as if to remind audiences of the chaos that awaits them, the 13th annual DancenOw/NYC Festival returns with a weeklong run of more than 70 choreographers, from the aspiring to the established, in a flurry of sampler showings (left, Sara Joel and Kevin Gibbs, appearing on Sept. 9). This year the festival is honoring five troupes that have reached the 10-year mark; such longevity, along with baseball pitchers who can make it out of the sixth inning, is becoming an increasing rarity in these economically trying times. The troupes -- David Parker and the Bang Group, Brian Brooks Moving Company, nicholasleichterdance, Gina Gibney Dance and Young Dance Makers -- will each perform a dance from 1997, and a new work commissioned by the festival. DancenOw takes a grab-bag approach to programming, but some eye-catching names include the irrepressible portraitist Larry Keigwin, the Stephen Petronio Company alumna Jimena Paz and the Butoh-inspired Vangeline Theater, which, along with Ms. Paz and others, will perform site-specific gallery dances during the festival. 
And be on the lookout for dance films and video projects. (Tuesday through Thursday, and Sept. 6, at 7:30 p.m.; Sept. 8 and 9 at 2 p.m., with a free, informal showing of collaborative work on Sept. 10 at 6 p.m.; Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077, dtw.org; $20 in advance, $25 at the door.) CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

HEADLINE: Building a Modern Arsenal in India

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
India is developing a military appetite to match its growing economic power.
 Over the next five years, military analysts expect the country to spend as much as $40 billion on weapons procurement alone, more than its entire annual armaments budget today -- upgrading systems as diverse as jet fighters, artillery, submarines and tanks in its largely Soviet-era arsenal. As a result, India will become one of the largest military markets in the world.
 For American contractors, which had been shut out of India for decades, the surge in demand comes just as relations between Washington and New Delhi reach a new level of warmth. 
 In terms of ''potential for growth, India is our top market, '' said Richard G. Kirkland, Lockheed Martin's president for South Asia. 
 But whether United States companies can turn that potential into profits will depend on more than warm relations between officials in their capitals; it will depend on how they finesse the particular challenges of the new market -- especially, competition from their Russian counterparts.
 The stakes of the contest were underscored this week when the Indian defense ministry called for bids to fill an order for 126 fighter jets, a contract that could be worth $10.2 billion. 
 Determined to build a domestic arms industry, India is requiring foreign suppliers to make a sizable portion of any military goods in this country. In the case of the jet fighter contract, the successful bidder must produce goods worth half the contract's value in India. So, the American companies have been busily pairing up with locals.
 So far, most partnerships are little more than agreements to collaborate on future projects. In February, Raytheon and the electronics division of the Indian giant Tata Power signed such an agreement. The same month, Boeing signed an accord with an Indian engineering firm, Larsen & Toubro, to develop new projects. And Northrop Grumman has signed on with Bharat Electronics and Dynamatic Technologies, both of Bangalore, to investigate joint opportunities. 
 The Americans' interest in India goes beyond weapons. This country has booming markets in commercial aviation, shipping and infrastructure projects, which means opportunities for the logistics and security units of the big American contractors. 
 Walter F. Doran, the president of Raytheon Asia, and a former commander of the Navy's Pacific fleet, predicts that India may be ''one of our largest, if not our largest, growth partner over the next decade or so.'' 
 The hefty increase in military spending reflects the country's changing view of itself. India, like ''all aspiring nations, is seeking its place on the world's stage,'' Adm. Sureesh Mehta, chief of staff of the Indian Navy, told thousands of white-suited officers at a naval conference in New Delhi in July. 
 In particular, India is positioning itself as a policeman of nearby waterways, especially the Indian Ocean. A spokesman for the defense ministry, Sitanshu Kar, said: ''If you look at the rim from west Asia to Asia-Pacific, that entire area accounts for over 70 percent of the traffic of the petroleum products for the whole world. We have a role to play to ensure that these sea lanes are secure.''
 An American carrier, the Trenton, which the Indian Navy bought and renamed the Jalashva, can, for example, carry 450 soldiers and half a dozen helicopters, and be used to evacuate Indian nationals, deliver aid or intervene in conflict areas.
 Yet India is virgin territory for American armaments makers. Decades of cold war-era distrust, when India aligned itself much of the time with the Soviet Union; followed by sanctions that President Clinton imposed after India tested nuclear weapons in 1998, made India a sort of no-go area for American companies. 
 Under the Bush administration, sanctions have been lifted and military ties have deepened. In July, the two governments announced a commercial nuclear energy agreement. Under the accord, the United States will share nuclear technology with India, including fuel. The deal requires a radical, India-specific exception to American law and underscores the Bush administration's commitment, made two years ago, to help India become ''a major world power.'' 
 But many arms industry analysts say that winning big orders in India will still be a challenge for Americans. In many cases, companies will be competing directly against India's traditional supplier, Russia, which has manufacturing agreements in place and is still the largest supplier. Though relations unraveled after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, they were repaired in the late '90s and the two countries are negotiating some $10 billion in contracts, including an Indian air defense system. 
 ''The Russians are going to get quite a bit of this business,'' Andrew Brookes, an aerospace analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, predicted. 
 Congress could present another hurdle for American companies; lawmakers could prohibit sale of the most advanced military equipment, Mr. Brookes said, while there is a perception that the Russians will ''sell first-rate stuff.'' 
 Nonetheless, Americans are winning some deals. Lockheed Martin is in final talks to sell six C-130J cargo planes for $1 billion. It would be the largest American military sale to India to date. 
 The defense ministry has asked Lockheed and Boeing to bid on the $10.2 billion jet order, as well as Saab, which makes the Gripen fighter, and the European team building the Eurofighter jet. They will all confront the MIG Russian Aircraft Corporation, which owns the developer of the MIG, the jet that the Indian Air Force now flies. 
 In general, the Russians have been the most discreet of suitors. At the recent naval conference here, Western companies took out booths, sponsored meals and cocktail hours, and had dozens of their name-tagged employees working the crowd. Several representatives from the United States armed services also glad-handed. But a Russian presence was hard to find.
 Maj. Gen. Aleksandr A. Burov, military attache at the Russian Embassy in New Delhi, said in a telephone interview that he could not comment on any commercial deals. He did make a point of noting that the chief of Russian land forces had recently visited India, stopping in Agra and Goa. 
 Several calls and a faxed message to an embassy number that General Burov said would lead to someone who could answer questions went unanswered, as did calls to the New Delhi office of MIG Russian Aircraft. 
 In some parts of the Indian military, officers split along generational lines, some American officers who interact regularly with the Indian military said. Older officers are likely to support purchases from Russia; younger ones may prefer buying from the United States. 
 The recent nuclear agreement with the United States also complicates the situation of American companies. The agreement has been strongly criticized in some corners, reflecting an undercurrent of continued distrust in this country toward the United States -- which is still seen by many, mostly because of past relations, as wanting to squelch India's rise to global prominence.
 Some politicians say that India made too many concessions to Washington to get the deal and that these will restrict its nuclear testing.
 To take effect, the agreement will require legislation by the United States Congress. 
 The recent improvement in relations with the Pentagon has generated controversy in other ways. At the beginning of July, when the American aircraft carrier Nimitz made a port call near the southern city of Chennai, formerly Madras, it was met by fiery protests from port workers and politicians. 
 The defense ministry insists that economics, not politics, will guide its decisions. Speaking of the jet fighter deal, its spokesman, Mr. Kar, said, ''We're strictly going by two considerations -- the operations requirements of the air force and the best price we get.'' 
 American manufacturers, not surprisingly, maintain that Western technology would be an improvement over the Russian planes and weapons systems that Indians use now or could buy.
 Switching to Western equipment would allow the military to ''bring new technology to bear faster, with more precision,'' Mr. Kirkland of Lockheed said. If the Indian Air Force chose Lockheed's fighter, he said, it would be able to conduct joint exercises with the United States Air Force and the forces of 18 other countries that fly the plane. 
 Still, American contractors have no illusions about their Russian competitors. ''It's difficult to unseat an incumbent,'' said Randy Belote, a spokesman for Northrop Grumman.

HEADLINE: Bush Plans Steps to Help Troubled Borrowers

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
President Bush, in his first response to low-income families hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, plans to announce several steps Friday aimed at helping Americans with credit difficulties to meet the rising cost of their housing loans, administration officials said Thursday. 
 The officials said Mr. Bush would call for the Federal Housing Administration to raise the ceilings on what it can charge for federal mortgage insurance, a move that they said would enable an additional 80,000 homeowners with spotty credit records to take advantage of the program, beyond the 160,000 likely to use it this year and next.
 Several other steps the administration plans to announce involve seeking legislative changes and what one official called ''jawboning'' of banks and other lending institutions to avoid foreclosing on distressed mortgage holders.
 Administration officials briefed a handful of news organizations on the proposals to be announced by President Bush, apparently to generate attention for these steps at a time of rising Democratic criticism and to demonstrate concern for Americans anxious over their ability to pay their housing costs.
 Democratic presidential candidates and Congressional leaders have hammered the administration in recent weeks, charging Mr. Bush with indifference to the plight of an estimated two million homeowners whose mortgage costs are expected to go up in the next year and a half.
 Many of these homeowners are lower-income families caught in the squeeze of variable-rate mortgages whose cost is certain to spike in coming weeks and months even as the value of their homes declines. Many are considered likely to default, possibly increasing the global turmoil in the financial markets.
 In addition, Mr. Bush is expected to endorse several proposals backed by Democrats in Congress that would raise the ceiling on the amount of mortgage insurance available for refinancing and to provide tax relief to those who renegotiate their mortgages to their financial advantage.
 The recent turmoil in the financial markets was prompted in part by a decline in housing values in the United States, a rise in interest rates and the prospect that mortgage holders will default on their payments. That prospect in turn is causing losses to investors and lenders around the world.

HEADLINE: Bush will Offer RELIEF FOR SOME On Home Loans

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from San Francisco.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
President Bush, in his first response to families hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, plans to announce several steps Friday to help Americans who have credit problems meet the rising cost of their housing loans, administration officials said Thursday.
 The officials said Mr. Bush would call for the Federal Housing Administration to change its federal mortgage insurance program in a way that would let an additional 80,000 homeowners with spotty credit records sign up, beyond the 160,000 likely to use it this year and next.
 The administration is offering his plan, which will include what one official called jawboning of lenders to persuade them not to foreclose on some borrowers, at a time of growing attacks on Mr. Bush from Democrats who say he has remained on the sidelines amid increasing anxiety over whether millions of Americans could end up losing their homes. Other elements of the plan would need legislative action, requiring Mr. Bush to win over the Democratic leadership in Congress.
 Administration officials, who asked not to be identified, briefed a handful of news organizations on the proposals to be announced by Mr. Bush at an appearance in the White House Rose Garden on Friday morning. 
 The main objective of the package, one senior official said, is not to affect the stock markets but to help low-income homeowners, many of them concentrated in certain neighborhoods in several distressed areas of the country, such as Ohio and Michigan. 
 ''The primary focus is to help individuals who have an opportunity to stay in their homes to stay in their homes,'' this official said. ''The subprime mortgage situation is having a crushing effect on a lot of communities right now.''
 Despite the assertion that affecting the markets is not the goal, one administration official said Thursday evening that concern about Wall Street's reaction did affect the timing of the briefing. He said there was a fear that if the White House announced in the morning that Mr. Bush would be making an announcement on housing, there could be confusion as buyers and sellers of mortgage securities guessed what the announcement would be.
 But secondarily, this official said, helping homeowners keep their homes and refinance or renegotiate the terms of the mortgages could have a stabilizing effect on the financial institutions that have these mortgages in their portfolios, and help them write down the value of the mortgages or sell them off at a loss.
 ''You can't solve the problems in the financial markets unless you can make some progress on the retail end of it,'' said this official. ''This is also a step to get banks to start loaning again.''
 Another factor in the decision to disclose details ahead of time was that Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was planning to give a speech on housing on Friday at the Fed's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and that speculation about his comments would also unsettle the markets.
 As they put together the proposals, top administration officials consulted with financial institutions, some members of Congress, housing counseling groups, academic specialists, and also with Mr. Bernanke. 
 Several other steps the administration plans to announce involve seeking legislative changes. Mr. Bush, for example, is expected to endorse proposals backed by Democrats in Congress that would raise the ceiling on the amount of a mortgage that can be refinanced with federal insurance. 
 He is also expected to support legislation that would provide tax breaks to homeowners whose mortgage debt is forgiven, in whole or in part, by lenders. The federal government currently collects taxes on the amount of a loan that is forgiven. 
 Democratic presidential candidates and Congressional leaders have hammered the administration in recent weeks, charging Mr. Bush with indifference to the plight of an estimated two million homeowners whose mortgage costs are expected to go up in the next year and a half.
 These two million mortgages, all held by homeowners with credit problems and with homes that are declining in value, are valued at $500 billion to $600 billion, administration officials said. The total value of American mortgages is about $10 trillion.
 Many of these homeowners are lower-income families caught in the squeeze of variable-rate mortgages whose cost is expected to soar in coming weeks and months. With their home values declining, many are considered likely to default, possibly adding to the global turmoil in the financial markets. The administration officials who briefed reporters sought to underscore Mr. Bush's willingness to work with Democrats, an unusual display of bipartisanship from an administration that has tangled with Democrats on many economic and budget issues.
 The administration's legislative proposals are likely to be similar to bills that Congressional Democrats have proposed, but there is still room for considerable argument over details. In general, the administration wants home buyers to pay for any measure that might help them, and Democrats want measures that provide extra help to people with low or moderate incomes.
 But administration officials said they would continue to oppose one measure that Democrats strongly endorse: an increase in the total dollar value of mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing-finance companies, can hold in their investment portfolios. 
 Until now, Mr. Bush and his top economic advisers, particularly Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., have focused on the broad prospects of the American and global economies and the disarray in financial markets.
 Two weeks ago, when asked about the problems of mortgage holders, Mr. Bush said that many Americans struggling with their mortgages had failed to read the fine print on the loans.
 But some in the administration and some Republicans are also concerned that there has not been enough talk from Mr. Bush about lower-income homeowners. These Republicans have said the administration's response so far is reminiscent of its initial delays in relief after Hurricane Katrina two years ago.
 The plans to be outlined by Mr. Bush are to be in the form of administrative actions taken unilaterally and proposals for enactment by Congress, many of them already in various bills sponsored by leading Democrats.
 Among the Democrats with such proposals are Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee; Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee; and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
 One senior official said, however, that the administration would encourage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help low-income holders of subprime mortgages refinance or renegotiate the loans, rather than lifting the companies' investment limits.
 Mr. Frank has said that the administration is ideologically opposed to letting the two mortgage agencies play a role in assisting homeowners in the current crisis, but the administration official said that was a misconception.
 Mr. Bush also plans to enlist Mr. Paulson and Alphonso R. Jackson, the secretary of housing and urban development, to consider regulating home-lending practices in the future to crack down on predatory practices. In addition, they are to study the role of credit-rating agencies, some of which have been accused of giving unrealistically positive ratings to packages of mortgages, which were then acquired by hedge funds and other institutions.
 One official said the administration's proposals would not include a bailout of institutions that bought mortgages that have plummeted in value.
 ''We are not using the b-word,'' he said, referring to the talk of bailing out lenders. 
 One economist said the efforts seem well intentioned. The F.H.A. can help provide another option to homeowners who need to refinance, and the government should do what it can to encourage mortgage companies to modify loans, rather than foreclosing on them.
 The administration could also help homeowners in higher-priced markets by temporarily raising the $417,000 limit on loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy from mortgage companies, said the economist, Thomas Davidoff, an assistant professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.
 But he noted all the efforts would likely only have a limited impact, given the number of loans resetting to higher interest rates in the coming months.
 ''This is helpful. But you had millions of people taking loans they should not have been taking, and investors lending money at too low interest rates,'' Mr. Davidoff said. ''Nothing is going to make those bad decisions go away.''

HEADLINE: Why a U.S. Subprime Mortgage Crisis Is Felt Around the World

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON and HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
The evening entertainment for roughly 500 financial executives at the Deutsche Bank global derivatives conference last month in Barcelona did not come cheap -- the Rolling Stones reportedly were paid more than $5 million. 
 ''The best part is, it's coming out of your bonuses,'' Mick Jagger joked to the crowd.
 The hosts of the conference could well afford it. After all, the business of creating new finance vehicles like derivatives and structured products has exploded in recent years. And at the time of the conference, there remained a mostly rosy view of such instruments, because of their ability to help businesses and investors spread out risk.
 But the global financial turmoil -- set off by problems with subprime mortgages -- has prompted a backlash in some quarters against such financial engineering. 
 More broadly, it has led to a better understanding of the downside of spreading risk so well -- it can be felt in all corners of the world, unsettling hedge funds, banks and stock markets as far away as Australia, Thailand and Germany. In effect, reducing risk on a global scale appears to have increased it for some players.
 ''The market appears to be finding it harder to truly understand the inherent and underlying risks involved,'' said Chris Rexworthy, who was a regulator with the Financial Services Authority in Britain for 10 years before moving recently to the private sector.
 The backlash is particularly sharp abroad, in countries that were surprised to find that problems with United States homeowners could be felt so keenly in their home markets. Foreign politicians and regulators are seeking a role in the oversight of American markets, banks and rating agencies. The head of the Council of Economic Analysis in France has called for complex securities to be scrutinized before banks are authorized to buy them.
 In the United States, regulators appear to think that the new and often unregulated investment vehicles -- which have shrunk the world and speeded up business in much the same way as the Internet -- are not all inherently flawed. 
 This opinion is captured in an analogy offered by Peter Douglas, the founder of GFIA, a hedge fund research firm in Singapore. He likens using derivatives to power tools. If you know how to use them, he said, they are exponentially better and faster for building a house, compared with using hammers, screwdrivers and handsaws. 
 If you don't, ''you could drill a hole in your head,'' he said.
 Funds and banks around the world have taken hits because they purchased bonds, or risk related to bonds, backed by bad home loans, often bundled into financial instruments called collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. 
 The losses have often surprised the investors, and in some cases the funds and the executives of the banks, who were unaware of the extent of their risks. 
 The crisis extended as far as the $2.2 trillion money market that finances the day-to-day operations of businesses, as investors wondered whether the underlying assets were sound. ''It's amazing how much ignorance and fear are out there,'' said Kevin Davis, a professor of finance at the University of Melbourne. 
 The confusion about these products lies in part in their complexity. Structured products are pooled assets that have been sliced and diced into ever more smaller, more specialized pieces.
 They offered investors higher returns at a time when traditional fixed income, or debt-related products, were producing low returns. 
 As low interest rates fueled a lending boom to borrowers with weak credit, banks looked for new ways to package those loans, so they could sell more. A central building block to offset the risk was asset-backed securities, which are bonds backed by pools of mortgages or other income-producing assets, like student loans, auto loans, and credit card receivables.
 Banks and other financial institutions pooled those asset-backed securities into new units, dividing them up again and issuing securities against them, creating collateralized debt obligations.
 The idea took off, with new combinations that were further removed from the original asset. New creations included C.D.O.'s of C.D.O.'s, called C.D.O.-squared. There is even a C.D.O.-cubed. 
 According to JPMorgan, there are about $1.5 trillion in global collateralized debt obligations, and about $500 billion to $600 billion in structured-finance C.D.O.'s, referring to those made up of bonds backed by subprime mortgages, slightly safer mortgages and commercial mortgage backed securities. 
 Many of the products have proved to be highly problematic as the underlying assets -- the subprime mortgages -- have gone bust, revealing dangerous amounts of leverage in the securities that few people could value. As a result, they have become like a potent computer virus, leaving many people fearful that they too will be affected.
 ''A lot of risk in the subprime asset-backed market is embedded in, and amplified by, C.D.O.'s,'' said Rod Dubitsky, head of asset-backed research at Credit Suisse. 
 Weaknesses in the system were laid bare, including ratings that did not accurately reflect risk and faulty assumptions on how diversified pools with multiple layers of leverage would react. 
 That in turn spooked investors in other markets, who started selling anything they thought might be risky, from stocks to loans, and in some cases putting their money into cash. 
 The combination of a subprime shock, ''untested financial innovation and leverage has led to a confidence crisis,'' said Pierre Cailleteau, Moody's Investors Service chief economist in London.
 The advent of radically more complex structured products coincided with another trend in finance: the explosion of credit derivatives, financial tools that enabled institutions like banks and hedge funds to try to hedge exposure to the huge credit market, like loans to corporations. 
 ''Credit derivatives are the fastest-growing part of any bank,'' says Derek Smith, head of flow credit trading at Deutsche Bank. He cited 80 percent growth in 2007 for his firm and average annual growth of about 40 percent for the industry. 
 Blythe Masters, a veteran of the credit derivatives revolution and the head of global derivatives at JPMorgan Chase, added, ''There has been a wall of money coming at the credit markets in the past five years.''
 Credit default swaps (what are widely known as a credit derivatives) allow two parties to exchange the credit risk of an issuer, such as a company. For example, if an investor buys a credit default swap on General Motors, called buying protection, he or she makes money when the credit weakens and makes a lot of money if G.M. goes bankrupt. 
 In the meantime, the seller of protection makes a fee from the buyer and profits if the company's credit improves. 
 Credit derivatives radically shifted the financial landscape for two reasons: they allowed banks to hedge some of their exposure to the huge loans they give corporations, and they have allowed investors to bet against, or short credit, as a hedge and to speculate. 
 For banks, shedding exposure to the credit risk of companies, or governments, or individuals, means not having to reserve as much capital for potential losses. That frees up capital to make even more loans -- to homeowners, institutional investors, corporations or hedge funds. 
 The banks found a perfect partner in hedge funds, lightly regulated pools of capital with high fees that were looking for better returns. Insurance companies and pension funds also sought the higher returns, called yield, as interest rates hit historically low rates. 
 ''Fundamentally, having 100 or 1,000 people with a slice of the risk is better than a bank holding 100 percent of the risk,'' said Robert G. Pickel, chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
 As the market for C.D.O.'s backed by structured products choked in recent weeks, the overall credit derivatives market has performed well, say some industry participants.
 ''Credit derivatives have done a good job at doing exactly what they should do: they have accurately and immediately reflected the markets' pricing of risk throughout this crisis,'' Ms. Masters said. But there has been a lot of pain. Investors purchasing derivatives are making a bet that the underlying stock or bond or loan is going to rise or fall, but they do not own it. Because buying a derivative requires much less capital than buying the loan or bond it is derived from, banks and traders can buy more of them than they could loans or bonds. That can translate into huge gains -- or, in times of stress, outsize losses. 
 Some institutions are not parsing what products are riskier than others, but rather they are rushing for the door. First State Investments in Singapore has slashed its holdings in all Asian financial firms in recent weeks.
 At this point ''it doesn't really matter what their exposure is'' to subprime products through derivatives, said Alistair Thompson, the deputy head of Asia-Pacific equities at First State. ''What concerns us is the sentiment'' in the market, he said.
 The surprises are certainly not over: there were whispers among investors in Australia this week that some local funds were still turning up unexpected subprime exposure because of credit derivatives, weeks after the problems first surfaced. 
 While that happens, markets are sure to remain skittish.
 ''Liquidity can just be turned off, and essentially it is a confidence game,'' Mr. Thompson said.

HEADLINE: DANCENOW/NYC FESTIVAL

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
DANCENOW/NYC FESTIVAL Early September is the calm before the live-performance storm in New York, and as if to remind audiences of the chaos that awaits them, the 13th annual DancenOw/NYC Festival returns with a weeklong run of more than 70 choreographers, from the aspiring to the established, in a flurry of sampler showings (left, Sara Joel and Kevin Gibbs, appearing on Sept. 9). This year the festival is honoring five troupes that have reached the 10-year mark; such longevity, along with baseball pitchers who can make it out of the sixth inning, is becoming an increasing rarity in these economically trying times. 
The troupes -- David Parker and the Bang Group, Brian Brooks Moving Company, nicholasleichterdance, Gina Gibney Dance and Young Dance Makers -- will each perform a dance from 1997, and a new work commissioned by the festival. DancenOw takes a grab-bag approach to programming, but some eye-catching names include the irrepressible portraitist Larry Keigwin, the Stephen Petronio Company alumna Jimena Paz and the Butoh-inspired Vangeline Theater, which, along with Ms. Paz and others, will perform site-specific gallery dances during the festival. And be on the lookout for dance films and video projects. (Tuesday through Thursday, and Sept. 6, at 7:30 p.m.; Sept. 8 and 9 at 2 p.m., with a free, informal showing of collaborative work on Sept. 10 at 6 p.m.; Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077, dtw.org; $20 in advance, $25 at the door.)

HEADLINE: Protests Persist in Myanmar, Despite Arrests by Junta

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Linking arms for mutual support, grim in the face of plainclothes paramilitary gangs, small groups of protesters in Myanmar have staged street demonstrations for nearly two weeks in the most sustained defiance of the country's ruling junta in a decade. 
 The protests have dwindled in size since they began on Aug. 19, but to the surprise of outside analysts, they have continued to erupt in several parts of the country. They do not appear to be centrally organized and have continued despite the arrests of a number of antigovernment leaders. 
 ''A week and a half ago, people were saying the protests didn't have that much future,'' said Dave Mathieson, an expert on Myanmar with Human Rights Watch in Thailand. ''But they are starting to spread, and they are continuing in Rangoon.'' 
 Rangoon, now known as Yangon, is the commercial capital of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. 
 The authorities are hunting down opposition figures, raiding their homes, distributing photographs of them and reportedly telling hotels to notify officials of their presence. The main opposition party told Reuters that at least 100 people had been arrested in the past week.
 In Washington, President Bush called on Myanmar to ''stop its intimidation'' of demonstrators, saying, ''I strongly condemn the ongoing actions of the Burmese regime in arresting, harassing and assaulting pro-democracy activists for organizing or participating in peaceful demonstrations.'' The persistence of the demonstrations reflects deep unhappiness with economic hardships and strong-arm government rule in one of the most repressive nations in Asia, analysts said. 
 A sharp rise in prices for fuel and cooking gas on Aug. 15, without warning or explanation, provided a focus for the protests. They have continued even though the government has pressed bus operators to lower prices. 
 Exiles and human rights groups in Thailand have received reports of a number of other protests in recent days, including demonstrations in the central town of Meikhtila and in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State in western Myanmar. 
 The unrest could complicate the government's plans to complete a constitutional convention and present a new charter to a popular vote. The carefully stage-managed convention excludes members of the opposition party of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy, and has been dismissed by analysts both inside and outside the country as no more than a facade of a democratic process. 
 There have been unconfirmed reports that the convention will conclude Monday. According to the junta's ''road map to democracy,'' next comes a ''stable environment'' in preparation for a referendum. 
 The protests may also be spreading because of transmissions through the Internet of photographs and video that have slipped past government controls. Some of the more arresting pictures show an outspoken critic of the ruling generals named Su Su Nway, 34, at the heart of a tiny group of demonstrators this week before she managed to slip away and evade arrest. 
 ''I know they've been after me since our protest on Tuesday,'' Ms. Su Su Nway told Reuters by telephone. ''I heard they have sent pictures of three women activists, including me, to several of their offices.''
 The visual images have given the small demonstrations a disproportionate impact, both abroad and at home. 
 ''That's the big difference from 1988,'' said Mr. Mathieson of Human Rights Watch, referring to antigovernment demonstrations that swept the country then. ''The technology is completely different. Even though the military's power may be the same, the ability of the protesters to get their message around the country has grown.'' 
 The 1988 demonstrations were crushed by the military, bringing the current junta to power. Thousands of people were killed. 
 In 1990, the junta held a parliamentary election and lost overwhelmingly to the National League for Democracy. The junta annulled the result, clung to power and began a fitful process of drawing up a constitution that it says will lead to a new round of elections. 
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has been under house arrest for 11 of the past 17 years, and her release has been a primary demand of critics abroad. 
 Myanmar is mostly closed to foreign reporters, and the only news media to witness the demonstrations were local journalists for news agencies. 
 For now, the demonstrations are tiny compared with those of 1988, in part because the government has gone to great lengths to prevent a new uprising. 
 It has moved universities from major cities to disperse the students who have historically formed the core of protest. In addition, the creation of a new capital in a remote area has removed from Yangon the civil servants who swelled the protests in 1988. 
 The government has also stockpiled food in warehouses as a buffer against economic crises that could lead to unrest. 
 And it has created the civilian gangs that have beaten and arrested demonstrators this month. Wielding brooms and hoes, they pose as members of the public, chiding the demonstrators before beating and seizing them, according to wire service reports. 
 Known as the Swan-ar Shin, or Masters of Force, they appear to have taken the place of military intelligence enforcers in combating protests. 
 On Tuesday, according to the reports, they pushed their way through onlookers to rough up about 15 demonstrators before driving them away in trucks. On Wednesday, three trucks, each carrying about 20 young men, waited at the side of the road at Hledan Junction in Yangon, the scene of the biggest protests.

HEADLINE: Caribbean Visions Of Tropical Paradise And Protest

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
In its apparent continuing effort to be as un-Manhattan as possible, the Brooklyn Museum has been cooking up shows that the fashion-obsessed art establishment is guaranteed to find uncool. Hip-hop, ''Star Wars,'' feminism. What could be next? ''Infinite Island: Contemporary Caribbean Art'' is next. 
 Multiculturalist terms like identity, hybridity and diversity may sound like words from a dead language in Chelsea, but they are the lingua franca of the Brooklyn show. Once-hyped forms like installation art and the neo-conceptual object may be disdained by Manhattan tastemakers, but they are embraced here.
 The embrace is wide. ''Infinite Island'' is a large show: 45 artists, with a collective of designers, photographers and architects from the Dominican Republic adding to the count. The work fills two floors of exhibition space, and care has been given to the selection. Several of the most substantial pieces were commissioned for the occasion. Organized by Tumelo Mosaka, associate curator of exhibitions at Brooklyn, the show wasn't designed to travel. It's an in-house job, a labor of love. 
 That being so, I'd like to report that the labor has paid off in a triumph, but it hasn't. Nor has it produced a failure. Like many group shows, this one is all over the place stylistically. The visual and aural competition is intense, and low-impact work retreats from the field. More problematic is the fact that much of what's here treads ground already covered, in very similar ways, by other art over the years. Some of the video and photography feels generic, like scene-setting filler.
 But what's good is really good, and the very existence of a show about identity politics in 2007 is cause for reflection. A few decades back, when the art world was smaller and easier to police, and ''international'' meant Manhattan and Western Europe, New York more or less dictated what kind of art would be looked at, what ideas would circulate, what would be cool. 
 But this is no longer so. The arena has expanded. Although economically powerful, New York is increasingly just one of many art centers doing their local thing. Most work that turns up in Manhattan galleries has little connection with, or pertinence to, what artists are doing and thinking about in Africa or India or even in the Bronx. And what's happening in those places apparently holds little interest for Manhattan. 
 The average Chelsea artist -- white, male, middle class, born in the United States and a graduate of one of four or five powerful art schools -- is a preapproved art-world player, as are his dealers, collectors and critics, who mostly fit the same demographic. Cultural identity is not likely to be a burning issue for any of them. 
 But if you are an artist in one of the 14 Caribbean nations represented in the Brooklyn show, the basics can be more complicated. Your roots may be African, Asian or indigenous. And you were very likely shaped by histories of colonialism, slavery and radical displacement. These histories may dictate your class status and economic prospects in the present. 
 If art education and jobs are limited where you live, you may need to relocate. This will mean entering a new social environment, probably learning a new language and feeling pressure to put aside, or suppress, familiar customs and values. Initially, at least, you will be outside the existing power loop. And you may stay outside, waiting, say, for a green card that never arrives. 
 Under such circumstances, your identity -- the hard facts of your skin color, sex, class and political and spiritual beliefs -- may well work to your disadvantage. Certainly this identity will be thrown into relief. Very likely, it will become an element in, even the focus of, your art. If identity-based art was just a passing fad for the New York art establishment, it necessarily remains of considerable interest to a wider world.
 How such art can be persuasively presented is, of course, the question. The thematic categories Mr. Mosaka applies to the show -- religion, politics, memory, popular culture -- have been used in countless shows. They are cliches by now, perceptual straitjackets rather than enlightening guides. As conceptual models, they require rethinking, as does the model some of the art follows. 
 After the complex and subtle art about race and history produced by figures like Kara Walker and Yinka Shonibare, what can it mean now to stamp diagrams of slave ships in an attractive pattern on a gallery wall? Or to offer blurry photographs of tropical landscapes, or deep-colored lifestyle pictures, images that gain what interest they have only from explanatory wall labels? Not much, I would say. Certainly not enough to warrant inclusion in a major survey. 
 The show's best work is the most abstract, much of it performance-based. A staged photograph of a dark-skinned man carrying a stack of white bricks that obscures his face, by the Cuban artist Alexandre Arrechea, can refer to Cuba's crumbling Modernist architecture, or its persistent racism, or to something else. By avoiding full disclosure, the picture gives viewers a lot to work with. 
 For another for-the-camera performance, the Puerto Rican artist Jose (Tony) Cruz asked children playing baseball in a park to trace the trajectories of the balls they were throwing on the ground in colored powder. In the photographs the lines they drew look ghostly against the packed-down dirt of the field, like quivering beams of light.
 Much of the political work Mr. Mosaka has chosen also has a comparably light, allusive touch. Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla turn shoe prints on sand into protest art. A series of photographs by Quisqueya Henriquez sets images of the Caribbean paradise of tourist lore next to others of the actual tainted Eden of social unrest and economic deprivation, without making the contrast instantly clear. 
 One of the show's stated purposes is to ask whether there is, in fact, a cultural entity -- or a type of contemporary art -- that can be securely identified as Caribbean. And it arrives at its answer -- no -- through a display of sheer multiplicity. There may be fundamental links between the diaristic drawings of the Trinidadian artist Christopher Cozier; the platinum-plated plantains of the Puerto Rican Miguel Luciano; the self-portrait in lederhosen of the Haitian artist Jean-Ulrick Desert; the participatory installation by the conceptual artist Satch Hoyt; and a sad, suspenseful video piece by the young Cuban artist Alex Hernandez Duenas. But if so, they are not mapped here. 
 Mr. Hernandez Duenas's contribution is an exhibition standout. So is the mystical flying machine called ''Dreamcatcher'' by the Jamaican-born New Yorker Arthur Simms, who should be a lot better known in the city. The piece de resistance, though, is a sculpture by a British artist of Caribbean descent, Hew Locke. 
 Titled ''El Dorado,'' it's a monumental portrait bust of Queen Elizabeth II assembled from thousands of small, cheap toys -- plastic gold guns, plastic swords, rubber lizards and scorpions -- with a kind of topiary hedge of fake flowers for crown and coiffure. Whether as a tribute or an insult, it's sensational. 
 Despite some fine things, though, the show feels warmed over and sluggish: it doesn't have the sense of risk or discovery that a re-arguing of identity as a subject now needs, at least in a New York context. (Luckily, another contemporary show, ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World,'' a joint project of El Museo del Barrio, the Queens Museum of Art and the Studio Museum in Harlem, is coming in 2009.) 
 Nor will it give anyone who has problems with the maverick direction the Brooklyn Museum has been taking -- and who does not? -- much comfort. Still, in turning its back on art world whims and fads in ''Infinite Island,'' the museum is staying true to its present self, against all objections, and there's something cool about that. 
 ''Infinite Island: Contemporary Caribbean Art'' remains at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, through Jan. 27.

PERSON: Benjamin Aaron 

HEADLINE: Benjamin Aaron, 91, An Expert in Labor Law

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Benjamin Aaron, a scholar of labor law and a member of presidential commissions who throughout his career promoted increased democracy in the workplace and protection for workers not represented by unions, died Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 91 and lived in Santa Monica, Calif.
 The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, his wife, Eleanor, said. 
 Professor Aaron, the director of the Institute of Industrial Relations at the University of California, Los Angeles, from 1960 to 1975, was a leader in the field of comparative labor law, the study of how workplace issues are dealt with in different countries. 
 ''He wanted both management and workers to have a voice, and not just at the bargaining table,'' said John Trumpbour, research director of the Labor and Worklife Program at the Harvard School of Law. Workers in Germany, for example, are often represented on corporate boards.
 It frustrated Professor Aaron, Mr. Trumpbour said, that European systems of worker-management cooperation did not gain much footing in the United States.
 Presidents, however, often called on Professor Aaron to serve on or lead panels dealing with labor issues. During World War II, he was director of the National War Labor Board, which set wage guidelines and reviewed collective-bargaining agreements to avoid strikes that might hinder the war effort. He was vice chairman of the National Wage Stabilization Board during the Truman administration. The board ruled on pay settlements in a postwar period of rising inflation fears.
 In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Professor Aaron to the National Commission on Technology, Automation and Economic Progress. The fear then was that millions of people would lose their jobs because of automation, computer technology and even robots. The commission's report, released in 1966, called for federal retraining programs and money for public works projects, but accurately predicted that the technological disruption would not be as serious as some had foreseen.
 Often during his career, Professor Aaron was brought in to mediate or investigate significant labor issues, including disputes over the future of jobs in the railroad industry and whether farm workers from Mexico should be allowed into California. In 1962, he was president of the National Academy of Arbitrators. 
 Professor Aaron was born in Chicago on Sept. 2, 1915, the youngest of five children of Henry and Rose Weinstein Aaron. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1937 and received his law degree from Harvard in 1940.
 Besides his wife of 66 years, the former Eleanor Opsahl, Professor Aaron is survived by his brother, Daniel, of Cambridge, Mass.; two daughters, Judith Turner of Moscow, Idaho, and Louise Ozawa of El Cerrito, Calif.; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
 In 1966, Professor Aaron brought together prominent labor law scholars from six countries -- the United States, Britain, France, Sweden, Germany and Italy -- and formed the Comparative Labor Law Group. Synthesizing discussions held over the next 12 years, the group produced three books on topics like collective bargaining, employee benefits and job discrimination.
 ''They looked at how each of these issues was treated under the legal systems of the six countries,'' said Katherine Stone, a labor law professor at U.C.L.A. ''It enabled policy makers and scholars to examine their own legal systems and borrow ideas.'' 
 One of Professor Aaron's contentions was that most judges lack expertise in the intricacies of labor law and that nations should establish labor courts. He also believed that most American workers were poorly served by the traditional collective-bargaining system. 
 In the fall 1979 issue of the Comparative Labor Law Journal, he wrote that the chief criticism of the system was ''its failure to provide adequate statutory protection in respect to basic conditions of employment for the great majority of workers who are unorganized.''

HEADLINE: Syria Says It Will Require Visas for Some Iraqi Refugees

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and QAIS MIZHER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Friday, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Syria informed the Iraqi government on Thursday that it would start requiring visas for some Iraqis next month, Iraq's Foreign Ministry said, a step that would reduce access to the last remaining haven for fleeing Iraqis. 
 The Syrian foreign minister, Waleed al-Moallem, called the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, and informed him that a visa program for Iraqis would begin on Sept. 10, according to the Web site of the Foreign Ministry. Syria has been the only country accepting Iraqi refugees freely without a visa. Jordan does not require a visa, but largely closed its borders to Iraqis, particularly men, at the start of 2007.
 The beginning of a visa program in Syria could present serious obstacles for the American program to resettle refugees in the United States because Iraqis are required to be interviewed by American immigration authorities outside Iraq. The United States is considering Iraqi candidates for refugee status from countries in the region, but the overwhelming majority are in Syria and Jordan.
 The change, if put into effect broadly, could also present serious problems for Iraq's poorest citizens trying to flee the violence and looking for the cheapest and most direct route out. Turkey and Iran require visas, as do Kuwait and Egypt. Some are extremely difficult to obtain.
 The Syrian program will apply to the spheres of commerce, economy and science, the statement said. It did not provide further details of which Iraqis would fall into these categories. 
 Strained relations between the United States and Syria have already complicated efforts to assist Iraqis in Syria. Officials from the Department of Homeland Security have not been granted visas to Syria to conduct interviews of Iraqi refugees there, slowing the process of accepting Iraqis to the United States. 
 The United Nations estimates that more than two million displaced Iraqis live outside Iraq, with the vast majority in Syria, and that 50,000 more people are spilling out of Iraq each month. The United States has said it will take in 7,000 Iraqis. 
 The United States has stepped up efforts to help Iraqis abroad, pledging $30 million this week for educating refugee children. 
 It was not clear how Syria's new visa program would work. Under the current rules, Iraqis traveling to Syria get their passports stamped, but do not wait for long in border lines and do not pay for entry. Countries that require visas, like Turkey and Egypt, allow Iraqis to apply for visas in embassies in Iraq. 
 The Iraqi government has been pressing the Jordanian authorities to establish a visa process for Iraqis so those who are fleeing can avoid the cost and frustration of reaching the country only to be turned away.

HEADLINE: A Festival Rooted In Female Ingenuity

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

DATELINE: STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
In 1927 a wealthy New Englander who went by the sturdy name of Mabel Choate set out to preserve a building that housed a neglected 39-year-old social club in the central Berkshires, the Stockbridge Casino. Designed by Stanford White, the building had been described by The Pittsfield Sun in 1888 as the area's first ''symptom of dissipation and gaiety.'' 
 A woman of some faith, Mrs. Choate hoped to put a mission where the casino stood, so she bought the building for $2,000 and immediately bequeathed it to a consortium of arts patrons, among them the psychiatrist Austin Riggs and the Vanity Fair editor Frank Crowninshield, who had it moved a few blocks away, piece by piece via horse-drawn wagon, with the goal of turning it into a pre-eminent regional theater. 
 The casino has remained the home of the Berkshire Theater Festival, which wraps up its 79th summer season in the coming weeks, ever since. Originally called the Three Arts Society, the festival opened in June 1928 with a production of ''The Cradle Song,'' by the Spanish dramatist Gregorio Martinez Sierra. Centering on a group of nuns who bring up a baby girl found outside their convent, the play starred Eva Le Gallienne, the actress and producer who became one of the few women to direct on Broadway in the first half of the 20th century. 
 Given how deeply the festival has its roots in expressions of female ingenuity, it seems fitting that a portion of the current season should be given over to Shaw, if not exclusively in content then entirely in inclination. ''Mrs. Warren's Profession,'' Shaw's third play, which closes Sept. 1, has been running on the main stage since mid-August, while the smaller Unicorn Theater has been home to a winning production of ''Educating Rita,'' Willy Russell's 1980 reprise of ''Pygmalion'' set in a British university. (It goes on hiatus after Sept. 1 but resumes production on Sept. 27 for three weeks.)
 Essays on social aspiration and the cost of women's advancement, the plays make excellent companion pieces, especially with the Swedish director Anders Cato's bristling production of ''Mrs. Warren's Profession'' displaying Shaw's feminism in full bloom. The story of a prostitute turned brothel owner who has kept the nature of her vocation a secret from her well-bred and studious daughter, the play was born in controversy, banned by the British government when it was first written. It did not find its way to a major stage until 1902, nine years after Shaw conceived it. 
 During that same year, 1893, another play about a woman with an unseemly past opened in London with none of the surrounding storm. Shaw's effort had generated debate because he declared the perniciousness of those who judged women forced by economic adversity to make disreputable choices. ''The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,'' by Arthur Wing Pinero, took a predictably moralizing tone, killing off, by suicide, a prostitute turned society matron once it was revealed that her husband's daughter was about to marry one of the woman's former lovers.
 Shaw comes down heavily against righteousness, but Mr. Cato makes the most of the play's moments of comedy, leavening the didacticism. His set avoids the heavy paneling, velvet and wood on which so many such revivals rely to reiterate the stifling habits of Victorian life. Mr. Cato's stage is instead suggestive -- rooms connoted by doors seemingly suspended in air -- to the point of feeling ethereal. And his actors seem almost to take their cue from it, carrying themselves without lugubriousness or contrivance.
 As half the cast of ''Educating Rita'' (directed by Richard Corley), Jonathan Epstein comports himself just as felicitously. He seems almost born to midlife crises as Frank, a downtrodden professor of English who takes on the commitment of cultivating a Cockney hairdresser for the extra dollars the university provides those who extend themselves to the working classes. 
 Mr. Epstein recedes into a wonderful sloppiness and moves with the jitteriness of someone no longer able to confine himself to the skin of his own meager contentments. Literature and alcohol have stopped giving his character any solace. It is when he sees how much his new pupil, the young Rita (Tara Franklin), is willing to sacrifice to change her circumstance that he is inspired to bring new dimension to his life.
 Rita -- who has renamed herself after the author Rita Mae Brown -- finds that she has no place in her world once she enters Frank's office to learn the meaning of assonance and read Yeats. Her family and friends resent her ambition. It is at the heart of Mr. Russell's play as well as Shaw's that society betrays a particular unkindness to working-class women, denying them whole identities, the chance to live as they are and what they would like to become.
 And yet the politics of ''Educating Rita'' seem more complicated now than its clearest message would imply. First produced in the early years of the Thatcher government, the play is hardly an argument against personal responsibility. Judging from his other work, I would guess that Mr. Russell would deny any hints of conservatism. But ''Educating Rita'' certainly seems to champion the idea that class advancement comes not from welfare-state handouts but through discipline, hard work and an adoption of the interests of the much better off.
 The Berkshire Theater Festival has lived in the penumbra of its more celebrated neighbor, the Williamstown Theater Festival -- which has surely also obscured even smaller regional theaters limited to the summer season, the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival among them. 
 Begun in 1987, the Hudson Valley festival mounted a lively production of ''As You Like It'' this year on the grounds of the Boscobel estate in Garrison, N.Y. It runs through Sept. 2, and it is a delight, an unstuffy antidote to the Kenneth Branagh version recently shown on HBO.
 The director, Kurt Rhoads, sets the play in the Wild West. The stage is bare grass and hay, with the mountains across the Hudson as a backdrop. The actors slip in and out of accents that range from the kind you hear on the BBC to those you hear in ''High Noon,'' and the shift adds to the slapstick mood Mr. Rhoads is seeking.
 If you were irritated by Rosalind's marginalization in Mr. Branagh's often sullen rendering, know that she is front and center here, played with a perfect, jokey faux masculinity by Joey Parsons (who, it should be said, is a woman pretending to be a man, not a man playing a woman pretending to be a man as in Shakespeare's day).
 The production is performed outdoors. Seen over Labor Day weekend, it has the lightness to make a great coda to summer.

Author(s):
Michelle Sale, The New York Times Learning Network
Andrea Perelman, Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: one hour.
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Examine popular fashion trends and their personal tastes in clothing styles.
2. Explore the legislation and controversy over wearing pants too low by reading and discussing the article "Are Your Jeans Sagging? Go Directly to Jail."
3. Participate in a simulated radio talk show debating sagging pants.
4. Create personal fashion statement posters.
Resources and Materials:
- pens/pencils.
- blank drawing paper (one per student).
- classroom board.
- copies of the article "Are Your Jeans Sagging? Go Directly to Jail.," at www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070831friday.html (one per student).
- resources about indecent exposure laws, the First Amendment, freedom of expression arguments, etc. (civics textbooks, periodicals, computers with Internet access, etc.).
Activities and Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: As students enter the room, direct their attention to the following prompt (written on the board before class): "Choose a clothing style or outfit worn by students in your school right now. Draw a picture of someone wearing these clothes and accessories. Then, think about the answers to the following questions. Be prepared to share.
- Do you think this clothing promotes or supports a stereotype?
- Do you feel pressure to wear the latest styles? Why or why not?
- Where do you get your ideas for what is cool to wear?
- What kinds of clothing, if any, do you think should not be allowed in school? Explain your answer.
- Would you consider this same clothing inappropriate anywhere else? Why or why not?"
After a few minutes, allow time for students to share their drawings and answers to the questions. Do you find any of the clothing styles or outfits "offensive"? Why or why not? How do you think members of the school administration might feel? Why?
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "Are Your Jeans Sagging? Go Directly to Jail." (), focusing on the following questions:
a. Why are lawmakers in Louisiana trying to ban pants worn too low?
b. Do you think the penalty for wearing sagging pants in either Delcambre or Mansfield fits the crime? Why or why not?
c. Why do critics of hip-hop say sagging pants are a badge of negative behavior?
d. What argument is used to fight laws outlawing sagging jeans?
e. Do you think there is such a thing as "an unacceptable form of expression"? Why or why not? Is the form unacceptable outright, or does it depend on context?
f. What do you think of school dress codes? Support your opinion.
g. How does the N.B.A. think clothing affects behavior and image? What actions have been taken to support this?
h. What is the zoot suit? Why is it considered offensive?

3. Poll the class to find out why there is a strong connection between music and fashion. Allow time to discuss their answers. What type of music might accompany a talk show about the controversy over sagging jeans?
Explain to students that they will participate in a simulated radio talk show; the topic is sagging jeans. Inform students that you will be acting as the show's emcee, and they will play callers to the show who will offer arguments either supporting or denouncing the popular fashion style based on an assigned perspective.
Arrange the class into pairs or small groups and assign each group a role from the list below. Provide them with the associated guiding questions and give them ample time to use their data to prepare comments for the radio talk show. Advise students to think creatively about how their assigned personality might think about the topic.
To start the talk show, offer an overview of the issue, then invite "callers" to offer their opinions on the original topic or to respond to comments by the other "callers." Advise students to seriously consider how they might respond to one another's perspectives in a way that allows the discussion to progress. Caution against the use of divisive or abusive language. Write the roles, questions and talk show tips on the board or distribute them in a handout for easy reference.

3. Organize a "clothing test" to see if sagging jeans are more comfortable than regular jeans. Ask students to wear shorts, leggings or some other clothing in preparation for this activity. Have them try on a pair of sagging jeans without wearing a belt. How easy is it to walk, run, bend over, sit down, etc.? Tally the results and present them to the class. Then discuss how important comfort level is when choosing clothing, especially trendy clothes.
4. Interview parents, guardians or teachers about their views on clothing and fashion. What types of clothes or accessories do they wear? What types do they avoid? Ask them to explain their choices of style, fit, color, fabric, etc. Prepare a chart comparing their clothing preferences to your own.
5. Create a list of the top 10 most pressing issues on which you believe local governments should focus their attention. Do sagging jeans make the list? Why or why not? Prepare a brief paper explaining the rationale for the issues you targeted as priorities.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
American History - Create a timeline highlighting trends in American fashion, beginning in 1900. Include visual examples of the most popular or the most influential styles.
- Research and write a report about the Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles.
Civics - Research indecency laws for your state and write a position paper. What forms of dress are considered indecent? What items or styles are banned or regulated? What fines or penalties exist for breaking these rules? Do you agree or disagree with the laws? Why or why not?
- Explore how fashion is related to the First Amendment of the Constitution. Prepare an oral report explaining the connection and the defense a person would use if he or she were caught with sagging jeans in a state where they were illegal.
- Research the laws that give schools more freedom to limit freedoms given to Americans under the First Amendment. Create a pamphlet aimed at teaching students why school administrators can enforce a dress code, or search a locker without permission, etc.
Fine Arts and Media Studies - Watch your favorite movie or television show and analyze the clothing worn by the characters. Prepare a fashion portfolio by illustrating various articles of clothing and accessories. Analyze the styles, colors and messages sent by the clothing and accessories that appear throughout the show. Are the clothes from a particular season or time period? Would they be considered offensive or indecent? Are they outfits that you would wear or could see other people in your life wearing? For each article you draw, include a brief analysis.
Global History - Throughout history and around the world, the concept of "indecent exposure" continues to vary greatly. Choose one time period, country or culture to research and address this issue within that context. Give examples of accepted styles of dress.
Teaching with The Times - Read the paper to find articles about current legislation issues. Create a chart and fill in the following categories: What the Law Says, Why Have This Law, Who Will Be Affected by This Law, and Why This Law Is Important. Share your findings in class.
