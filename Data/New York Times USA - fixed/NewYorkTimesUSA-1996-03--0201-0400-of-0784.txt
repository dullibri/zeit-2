HEADLINE: CHINESE, IN A MOVE TO ALARM TAIWAN, FIRE TEST MISSLES

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Friday, March 8

 BODY:
China began a series of ballistic-missile tests just off the coast of Taiwan this morning to discourage aspirations for independence on the island and to intimidate its 21 million people in the two weeks before its first presidential election.
This morning the Ministry of National Defense confirmed that two Chinese M-9 missiles had landed inside previously announced target areas off Taiwan's coast, one due west of Kaohsiung and the other east of Keelung. The Ministry said that it believed the missiles were unarmed and that the Taiwan military "would continue to monitor the situation." 
 Later, officials in Washington and in Taipei said a third missiles had been launched into the area off Kaohsiung. China did not say where the missiles had been launched from.
In recent weeks China has been increasingly combative toward Taiwan, denouncing what it said were relentless efforts by Taiwan's leaders to move the island toward independence. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has said repeatedly that it would take military action to prevent the island from asserting independence.
The Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, said today that the people of Taiwan should not panic over the missile tests, but he warned of a "real disaster" if they supported independence for the island.
"The Taiwan compatriots don't have to panic over the pending military exercises by the People's Liberation Army," the New China News Agency quoted Mr. Qian as saying at the National People's Congress. "What they should really worry about is that the 'independence' seekers, with support from some international forces bent on splitting China, continue on their wrong path. That will be a real disaster."
Here in Taiwan, the Mainland Affairs Council, which plots the country's policy toward China, the missile tests.
"By firing missiles at us, Beijing is clearly using military means to attain political ends," Kao Koong-liang, the vice chairman of the council, said at a news conference. "It is attempting to influence popular morale and to obstruct the development of our constitutional democracy.
"This kind of brutal intimidation and provocation creates feelings of extreme antipathy toward the Beijing authorities among the people of Taiwan and also seriously harms relations across the Taiwan Strait and delays national unification."
In Washington, the State Department called the tests "unnecessarily provocative" and "reckless."
The missile tests, clearly intended to shock the people of Taiwan, were the most aggressive Chinese actions toward Taiwan since the 1950's, when Beijing shelled some offshore islands under Taiwan's control.
This morning's tests are the third time China has fired test missiles into the waters around Taiwan, a tactic it adopted after a visit by President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to the United States last June. But the tests this morning were far closer to Taiwan than previous ones, just 22 miles from Keelung, a northern fishing port, and 32 miles from Kaohsiung, one of Asia's busiest container-port terminals.
Major shipping companies announced on Thursday that they would continue to use the port at Kaohsiung but said they would skirt the target zone. In Japan, the Transport Ministry announced that it was rerouting all commercial flights away from Taiwan.
In the past week Taiwan has been swept by rumors of war and has witnessed runs on the American dollar, some hoarding of food and a blizzard of pronouncements from the three candidates for president.
"Everyone is worried," said Hsu Lu, the general manager of the Voice of Taiwan, an independent radio station here. "People are talking about this on the streets, on the radio of course, everywhere."
Taiwan's Government has sought to reassure the island's 21 million citizens with a stream of declarations about the country's military preparedness.
The China News quoted an unnamed Defense Ministry official as saying that while Taiwan was not able to intercept any wayward missiles from the mainland, the Taiwan Air Force was prepared to bomb missile bases in China "under the right circumstances."
At a campaign rally on Thursday, President Lee said the tests were intended to undermine Taiwan's democracy and to dissuade people from voting for him. "Don't be afraid," he declared. "Let's unite together and show our strength to the Chinese Communists."
Mr. Lee's opponents were preoccupied with the tests as well. Chen Li-an, an independent candidate, demanded that the President apologize for "bringing the country to the brink of war," according to The China News. And Peng Ming-min, the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, which seeks complete independence for Taiwan, called China a "bully, uncivilized, barbarian."
On Thursday, even before any missiles were fired, many banks were experiencing heavy buying of American dollars, according to local newspaper reports. The New Taiwan dollar was hit hard by heavy selling and lost three cents; a further fall was prevented only by the intervention of the Central Bank. Stock prices, which were rocked earlier this week, recovered strongly today.
Many supermarkets around the capital reported heavy buying of toilet paper and rice. "I told my sister to stock some toilet paper and food at home just in case there was a war," Pei Mei-kuei, a housewife in her late 50's, told Reuters on Thursday. "It probably won't happen, but it will be difficult to buy necessities if there is a war. It's better to get prepared."
Gold dealers were reporting that the sale of gold bars, a traditional haven in times of trouble, were running 20 to 30 percent above normal.
In Washington, the White House was "deeply disturbed," said its spokesman, Michael D. McCurry. He said the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, would meet today with his Chinese counterpart, Liu Huaqiu, a Deputy Foreign Minister, to talk over the sharply elevated tensions in the Taiwan Strait.
Hours after the tests, Secretary of State Warren Christopher sought to "get a dialogue going" over dinner with Mr. Liu, who was on a private visit to Washington. But Mr. Liu, like other Chinese diplomats, was not listening very closely to American concerns about human rights, trade deficits, copyright violations and Beijing's sales of missiles and nuclear-weapons technology.
Mr. Liu wanted most of all to air China's grievances over Taiwan, officials said. Chinese officials expressed fury today over the elections, and the refusal of Taiwan's leaders to discuss reunification with China.
They also lashed out at the State Department's criticism of Beijing's human rights record in a report issued on Wednesday.
A State Department official stressed that the missile tests were not acts of war or terror. As long as the missiles hit the target areas and do not strike Taiwan, the tests are no more than political theater, he said -- "but a little too close to the edge of the stage."
"The view here is that these tests, while clearly meant to make a political impact, do not constitute an economic blockade, or an attempt to mess Taiwan up commercially or economically," he said.
In Beijing on Thursday, the Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected criticism from the United States Defense Secretary, William J. Perry, and from Mr. Lake, the national security adviser.
"Actually, it is China who should be protesting," Mr. Shen said, "because the question of Taiwan is entirely China's internal affair in which no other country has the right to interfere."

HEADLINE: Dairy Legislation Takes Inclusive Approach

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Francis W. Rodgers (letter, March 5) is wrong in his assessment of my dairy proposal. Instead of criticizing me, he should thank me. 
 Mr. Rodgers's contention that my proposal would adopt nationwide the California practice of fortifying the milk we drink, resulting in a price jump of 30 to 40 cents a gallon, is backward. My legislation repealed that idea. Mr. Rodgers's beef should have been with the Agriculture Committee, which put forth the idea, rather than with the 258 of us in the House who emphatically rejected the costly suggestion.
Yes, my amendment has the support of New York's hard-working dairy farmers, who every year contribute tens of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars to New York's economy and tax revenues. My amendment also received the support of major consumer organizations and taxpayer groups. That is because this legislation prepares the dairy industry for competition in the 21st century.
How did we accomplish that? By getting the Federal Government permanently out of the practice of subsidizing the production of butter, powered milk and cheese within five years. By fully financing dairy export initiatives to create more markets for America's dairy products. And by requiring the Department of Agriculture to take the regional dairy pricing system, which does not cost taxpayers a nickel, and consolidate its 33 regions into 10 to 14.
This inclusive approach to achieving workable reform of the dairy industry is what guaranteed passage in the House of Representatives, not any amount of campaign contributions.

HEADLINE: Always Busy, Seemingly by Accident

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
Onstage, Brian Murray communicates a certain verity and an authenticity, whether he is playing Falstaff or a shady character in a Joe Orton black comedy. This is, of course, both a key to his virtuosity and also a reason he is not more celebrated. It is not easy to define a Brian Murray role, which is why he can seem so infinite.
In less than one year's time, he has been acclaimed in leading roles in three plays in New York. With witty precision, he is currently playing an unscrupulous entrepreneur of no fixed profession in Orton's "Entertaining Mr. Sloane" at the CSC. Earlier this season, he was a deeply compassionate homosexual Anglican priest driven from his parish in David Hare's "Racing Demon." Before that, he transformed himself into nine different characters, including the flamboyant title role, in a freewheeling adaptation of Graham Greene's "Travels With My Aunt." 
 For Mr. Murray, this is simply his latest halcyon year, but the hyperactivity is, as always, a coincidence. Despite four profitable decades as an actor, most of them on the New York stage, he continues to be vulnerable to the vagaries of the profession. He never knows where his next role -- or his next directorial assignment -- will come from.
Over an iced tea after a recent student matinee at the CSC, he said, "The best thing about being on a roll: you keep working out, working all the muscles at once." When he was asked if he had ever been out of work, he replied in the negative, but superstitiously knocked so hard on the cafe table that, for a moment, the table seemed to be in danger of collapsing.
That response is characteristic of the man, who by his own description is highly emotional on stage and off. "I'm what's known as a spendthrift soul," he said, adding that his quest as an actor has been "to learn economy." Even as an older actor -- he is 58 -- he still conveys a youthful exuberance on stage.
Mr. Murray is one of a small band of highly accomplished actors who are consistently employed in the New York theater. One difference between him and his peers (like Philip Bosco) is that he was born in South Africa and received his early acting training in England. He is an American citizen, and his approach to roles could be considered American. Only a slight English accent, accentuated when needed in performance, is a giveaway of his background.
Culturally, he is mid-Atlantic, which is not to suggest that he is at sea playing either Americans or Englishmen. In England he has played Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams. Here, he has been called upon to play Hugh Leonard ("Da"), David Rudkin ("Ashes") and Michael Frayn ("Noises Off"). Along with his compatriot Brian Bedford, he is one of the American theater's favorite transplanted Englishmen. (Mr. Bedford's distinction is that he often plays Frenchmen, in adaptations of Moliere.)
Encouraged by his mother, who had been a dancer, Mr. Murray had his first taste of theater as a child actor in Johannesburg. Moving to England, he soon began playing "lower-class hoodlums" in films and on television. Both he and Mr. Bedford were Teddy boys in the 1959 movie "The Angry Silence."
In 1961, Mr. Murray began the first of four years with the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-Upon-Avon. With only five days notice, he was moved up from a small role to play Romeo. It was a turning point for him, but in an unexpected way. Performing with Edith Evans and Dorothy Tutin, he realized that until then he "had gotten away with being cocky and facile," and that there was an abyss between what he had been doing and "real acting."
His education had begun, but he decided to continue it in the United States. After coming here first in Peter Brook's historic "King Lear" (he played Edgar to Paul Scofield's Lear), then in the Broadway premiere of "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," he stayed on, studying at the Actors Studio and other New York workshops. With only a brief period as a leading man, he quickly made the transition from juvenile to character actor.
If he had stayed in London, he said, he would have become a member of the acting establishment and he might have been honored with a C.B.E. or even a knighthood. Instead he chose to emigrate, attracted by the opportunity and the vitality of the American theater.
He remains a most ardent admirer of Mr. Scofield for his "simplicity, stillness and integrity," while also having a great affinity for American actors. "They tend to dig a little more into roles," he said. "They don't take things for granted, particularly when playing English parts." Looking back on his days in England, he said: "I felt too big and clumsy and not witty and elegant enough for England. I always felt my elbows were in everybody's way." In an emotional sense, he said, he "couldn't hold back."
Although he has not acted in England since 1970, several years ago he returned to South Africa to do "Shadowlands," the first time he had performed there since he was a child. It was the year after his mother died, and the experience was, he said, therapeutic because his character in the play "can't show tears, except in the little scene at the end." He recalled, "I was able to find my way through the pain I was feeling at being an orphan, at a ripe old age."
When he was asked how he is able to cry onstage, he said, "As a kid, I used to do it by yawning, and holding down the yawn." He demonstrated, and tears clouded his eyes. Now, he said, he can cry by feeling the emotion of the scene, which is what he did in "Shadowlands" and "Racing Demon." More often he is called upon to win laughs. Comedy of all varieties is his specialty.
Turning to his sharply sardonic role in "Mr. Sloane," he compared Orton to Noel Coward as a writer of high comedy, despite the fact that Orton wrote from a lower-class perspective. "I can't help feeling that he was influenced by Coward," he said. "What did they call him: the working-class Wilde? I think this play is closer to Coward. Coward's people always seem to inhabit a nonworld of actors and artists. They never seem to have a proper job. When it comes to that, neither do the people in Orton."
Mr. Murray works with equal frequency on Broadway and Off Broadway (and also acts in regional theater), and finds only one major difference in the stages: "In a small space like the CSC," he said, "you have to be careful not to push it, not to mug. It's a danger because I've got a very expressive face." Then with a look of fervent commitment, he added: "I can't live without the other character: the audience. I don't know how one can survive as an actor without sharing the same experience in the same room."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Price of Orange Juice Takes Off As Cold Snap Threatens Florida

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Orange juice prices surged to their highest levels in nearly four years on the New York Cotton Exchange yesterday as cold weather threatened Florida's crop.
On other commodities markets, copper prices advanced on signs of increased demand and a sharper drawdown in supplies. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodities gained 0.92 point, to 245.37. Falling crude oil prices drove the energy-weighted Goldman Sachs Commodity Index down 0.63 point, to 194.11. 
 Florida's weather will be unseasonably cold this weekend through Wednesday, with temperatures close to freezing, according to the Weather Services Corporation in Lexington, Mass.
Prospects of crop damage or reduced juice yields heightened concern that already-low supplies of orange juice were getting smaller, traders said.
"Any time you have weather like this, it puts pressure on the market to go up, especially now with the market so tight," said Ken Shoop, vice president of operations at the Peace River Packing Company, an orange cooperative in Fort Meade, Fla.
May orange juice soared 8.6 cents, or 6.6 percent, to $1.3775 a pound, the highest price for the active contract since April 23, 1992.
Brisk demand, particularly for fresh juice, has helped drive Florida's stockpiles of frozen concentrated orange juice down 17 percent from last year, according to the Florida Department of Citrus.
Copper surged to a 10-week high after reports of a strengthening construction market and falling stockpiles signaled robust demand.
The Labor Department said the economy added 705,000 new jobs in February, including a rise of 121,000 in construction employment, while the Commerce Department said construction spending rose three-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $537.6 billion in January.
"The huge employment number, which was a much larger gain than expected, propelled copper higher," said Monica Chitnas, a vice president of J. P. Morgan Commodities in New York.
Copper for May delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 2.7 cents, to $1.199 a pound, the highest since Dec. 29.
Falling stockpiles also indicated a healthy copper market. The London Metal Exchange said copper stockpiles fell a larger-than-expected 4,250 metric tons, to 343,525 tons, between Tuesday and Thursday.

HEADLINE: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA;
On Wall Street: For Richer, for Poorer?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Is Wall Street really to blame?
In some ways, the answer is yes.
In recent years, investors have put pressure on companies to slim down, to be more competitive. And the takeover wave of the mid-1980's showed many corporate bosses that if they did not put their shareholders first, they might themselves be unemployed after a takeover. 
 Moreover, pressure from money managers has helped reshape the compensation system for chief executives. A large part of the pay of top management these days is in stock options, which are valuable only if the share price goes up.
But who is Wall Street? Increasingly, it is us.
"We're all shareholders now," said Byron Wien of Morgan Stanley, the big brokerage firm. "What happens on Wall Street is not just the concern of some wealthy investors in New York. There is a broad range of people owning stocks and mutual funds for themselves, or for their retirement funds."
Those owners are, of course, primarily the middle class and rich. But a 1992 New York Stock Exchange study estimated that households earning less than $100,000 a year owned slightly more than half of all shares held by individuals. More than 51 million people owned stock then, up from 30 million in 1980 and just 12 million in 1959. And 31 percent of American households owned mutual funds, a mutual fund industry group estimated last year, up from fewer than 10 percent two decades ago.
Mutual fund managers and pension fund managers are often the ones who squeeze companies the hardest. The California Public Employees Retirement System, known as Calpers, has picked out numerous underperforming companies, demanding that they shape up.
Patricia Macht, a Calpers spokeswoman, said the fund, with nearly $100 billion in assets held for a million active and retired beneficiaries, prefers that companies improve shareholder returns without layoffs. But, Ms. Macht added, "There are companies that are fat, that have not taken a good look at the number of employees they need."
Most pension funds are not as outspoken, but all of them are seeking good returns. Indeed, that is the primary focus of their money managers, as it must be under Federal law. The conundrum is that there is no way to ask the fund's investors if they would prefer less emphasis on profits and more on keeping people like themselves employed.
Take the case of First Interstate Bancorp, a large California bank, which sought to fight off a takeover attempt from a rival, Wells Fargo, by merging with a Minneapolis bank. The deal would have given shareholders a windfall of at least 30 percent and saved nearly all the jobs at both banks. But Wells Fargo -- which vowed to close 400 overlapping branches and layoff upward of 9,000 employees -- prevailed, mostly because investors wanted its slightly better offer.
Americans always had a bigger stake in the stock market than they knew, because pension funds owned stocks as well as bonds. But in most cases the performance did not directly affect the payout of the traditional defined-benefit plans, which effectively promised to make up any shortfall in investment results.
That was before the rise of defined-contribution plans, in which the employee controls where the money goes, and benefits or suffers depending on how the investments perform. In 1984, only 27 percent of the assets in pension plans were in defined-contribution plans. Today, that number is more than 40 percent.
Every time someone transfers his or her retirement savings from one mutual fund to another one, seeking better performance, just a little bit more pressure is being applied to corporate America.
Wall Street is unrepentant, arguing that a company that does not grow more efficient by ridding itself of unneeded workers might find itself hopelessly uncompetitive, and thus unable to employ any workers. "Ignoring profitability," Mr. Wien said, "is the road to doom."
Similarly, the economy even may better off because workers who are not productive at one company are freed up to work somewhere else. That argument, of course, rings rather hollow to those affected.
Wall Street has long been known for taking a good idea and carrying it to excess, and perhaps that is happening now. Often the easiest way to get an enthusiastic reception from investors is to announce plans to cut costs.
When the United States was the dominant economy in the world, it was easier for companies to avoid these stark choices and still earn hefty profits. But the collapse of competitiveness in the 1970's changed that view. It probably won't return soon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Jobs Report Sends the Dollar Up, Down, Then Up Yet Again

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher yesterday after a roller-coaster session, bolstered by the Government's surprisingly strong report of job growth in February.
The Labor Department's report of a larger-than-expected gain of 705,000 in nonfarm payrolls last month devastated the stock and bond markets, since it all but wiped out chances that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates again soon to stimulate the economy. 
 Currency traders faced a quandary after the release of the employment report, which they had been awaiting all week. The strength of the report weakened the case for the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates; lower rates typically hurt a currency. But the sharp selloff in the American stock and bond markets threatened to diminish demand for dollars by foreign investors.
Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said: "At first the market decided a strong economy is good for the dollar. Then once the asset markets sold off, it decided that wasn't good for the dollar. Finally, we decided that higher bond yields are good."
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 105.72 yen, from 105.25 yen on Thursday. The dollar was changing hands at 1.4840 marks, up from 1.4763 marks. The pound fell to $1.5235, from $1.5295.
"Today you could almost throw everything you knew about the dollar out the window," said Jay Wertheimer, senior foreign exchange trader at Banco di Sicilia. "People decided they had to buy the dollar and they didn't care at what level."
The rise in the dollar came as the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 171.24 points, and Treasury prices plunged.
The employment data were somewhat skewed by bad weather and Federal Government shutdowns that hampered job growth in January. But few currency traders were willing to buck the trend.
European investors reportedly snapped up the dollar eagerly after the report, and the dollar may have been bolstered by rumors that central banks had gotten in contact with dealers about buying the dollar below 1.48 marks.
The widespread buying interest left the dollar in a position to test the 1.50-mark level in coming sessions, traders said.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Paying A Price For Candor

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THE Housing Authority isn't talking about Rafael Sencion. Nor is the Mayor's office. Their silence is understandable since Mr. Sencion is suing them for reneging on a job offer, and they prefer not to comment on such matters.
Last May, the same people he's taking to court couldn't wait to court Mr. Sencion, a tenant organizer and bachelor who volunteered for a layoff to spare the job of a co-worker and family man with less seniority. No doubt moved by his selfless act, city officials offered him a similar job at the Housing Authority and whisked him through personnel. 
But there would be no press conference where all parties could trumpet a feel-good fable for tough fiscal times. Mr. Sencion, troubled by the narrow focus on his own generosity, wrote an opinion piece for New York Newsday, in which he urged Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to rethink the cuts that led to the layoffs at not-for-profit service groups like the one were he used to work.
Bad move. The day the piece appeared, Mr. Sencion said housing officials withdrew the $35,000 job offer. A later attempt to get a job at the Civilian Complaint Review Board also went nowhere. He thinks he was blackballed, which is why he sued the city this week, alleging infringement on his First Amendment rights.
SHOULD he have shown better discretion or timing? After all, the administration that cast itself as a fusion coalition is not known for tolerating dissent.
"Some people asked why didn't I wait until I had the job first and written later," Mr. Sencion said. "Very few people have dared to go beyond and challenge the status quo. In my case, I want to be able to think and do and act the way I feel independently of what the consequences might be. I guess I'll be paying the consequences for a long time to come."
The fault isn't entirely his own or perhaps even the administration's. While the news crews raced after him and dubbed him "the Saint of the City," Mr. Sencion grew frustrated over much of the glowing coverage that concentrated on one man's act.
"The economic impact that the city's budget would have on the community, nobody was interested in that," he said. "The whole thing bothered me."
So, after the Housing Authority offered him a job, he wrote a piece that addressed his concern over cuts affecting groups that worked with the poor. "The Mayor," he wrote, "definitely has his guns aimed at the wrong target."
Then the Saint landed in limbo.
Mr. Sencion said he and a reporter for El Diario tried to question the Mayor about the change of heart a few weeks later at a breakfast meeting with Hispanic journalists. Mr. Sencion said in his lawsuit that the Mayor responded by asserting his right to hire people who agreed with his policies and his political agenda.
THAT may be going too far, said Norman Siegel, the head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Mr. Sencion. While no one disputes any Mayor's right to elect policy-making commissioners and deputies on the basis of political allegiances, Mr. Siegel cited several court decisions that said rank-and-file workers are supposed to be immune from such loyalty tests.
"Sencion's views were not compatible with the Mayor's political agenda, and that is what the First Amendment prohibits," Mr. Siegel said. "The Mayor must be neutral when it comes to hiring people in non-policymaking positions."
Mr. Sencion, who went through his savings and was scraping by on unemployment benefits until he landed a $20,000-a-year job organizing tenants for a South Bronx advocacy group last month, thinks the Mayor is too sensitive.
"He claims to be the Mayor of all New Yorkers," he said. "When he was sworn in, that was his big thing. What he's doing is basically being the Mayor of those who follow him politically."
Would another Mayor have done the same thing? For example, in 1992 when thousands of jeering police officers (and the candidate Giuliani) converged near City Hall in an unruly protest against Mayor David N. Dinkins, should they have been fired? Or were their uncivil taunts and scorn protected speech?
"I wonder if they did that to Giuliani, what would he do?," Mr. Sencion said. "Stop and think."
As for his own actions and writings, he simply says he followed his conscience. The activist in him wouldn't allow him to stay quiet. The activist friends around him would not respect him if he had.
The only ones quiet about Rafael Sencion are officials at the Housing Authority and City Hall.
Maybe it's leadership by example.

HEADLINE: Doing Major Time For a Minor Crime

BYLINE: By Randy Schain; Randy Schain heads a company that develops money-management software.

 BODY:
Every night around midnight, a dirty old van departs the Midtown South precinct and cruises lower Manhattan. This van will prowl through some of the nicest neighborhoods of the city and some of the worst. It will stay out all night, or until it is full.
The back of the van contains no seats, only a bare metal floor that smells faintly of vomit. As the evening progresses, this area will fill with members of every stratum of society, victims of a sweep by this old van and its convoy of unmarked escorts. 
 It was 1:30 A.M., on a nice block in the Flatiron district not far from my apartment. I was saying good night to a friend, watching impatiently as he finished a joint. We had seen a late show, and I was eager to get to sleep. We were both carrying plenty of identification, including New York driver's licenses and embossed photo I.D.'s from corporate employers. We were also carrying marijuana. He had a tiny bag in his pocket -- about two joints' worth -- and I had a pinch he had just given me.
The police descended on us from three directions. They were aggressive but not abusive. We were astonished, subservient and polite. The arresting officer seemed sympathetic as we were searched, handcuffed and led into the van.
The van had three other occupants: a shy white guy who worked at a tanning salon, another white guy who had just sold the first one a tiny amount of cocaine and a black guy, unemployed, who said he had been standing on a street where drugs were sold. For four hours, we sat on the floor, handcuffed from behind, as the convoy searched for more prey. (In all that time, the convoy caught one street dealer and one of his customers.) The evening finally ended when they bagged a haggard pair of white female junkies and one more guy, who said nothing the whole trip. By the end, there were 10 of us.
Although physically very uncomfortable, my friend and I were not overly worried. We joked pleasantly with our drivers, who joked pleasantly back. Neither of us had any criminal record nor any experience whatsoever with the world of cops and perps. The scene was not without its appeal. And both of us were certain that we would be issued summonses and released. A month ago, we would have been.
Not anymore. In mid-February, without any fanfare, the Giuliani administration, cracking down on so-called quality-of-life crimes, has drastically changed the punishment for using marijuana.
As part of its campaign to arrest huge numbers of misdemeanor drug offenders, the city has instructed the police to stop issuing summonses to most marijuana users. Except the lucky few who realize they should call their lawyers upon arriving at the precinct, all those arrested are sent through the central booking system. And once you are in the system, there is very little a lawyer can do until you come out the other side.
By 6 A.M., my friend's main concern was that the process was taking too long. He had a critical meeting later that morning. Then we heard the news: We were going downtown to central booking. My friend frantically called his lawyer -- who came to meet us at central booking but could not to get us out.
We spent the next 36 hours in seven different holding cells: overcrowded, filthy rooms with poor ventilation and a host of smells. For roughly half of that time, we were handcuffed, despite the bars around us. The experience was made worse by needlessly abusive guards.
My cellmates were friendly. Almost everyone was in for a drug-related charge. Crack, cocaine and heroin were the leaders, but there were several other marijuana cases, including a natty investment banker from one of the very best firms. The convoy was obviously arresting anyone, for any drug, in any neighborhood. There is a certain fairness in that.
Forty-one hours from the time of our arrest -- it can take twice that long -- we had our moment in court, and the case was essentially dismissed. The whole hearing took about 90 seconds.
By largely eliminating the routine summonses, the Giuliani administration has severely altered the de facto punishment for smoking marijuana. The pot smoker used to get a few dreadful hours in a van, followed by a summons to appear in court. This seems fair for such a low-grade misdemeanor. But now the penalty is two to four days in stifling, rancid holding cells.
The professional aftershocks of this ordeal can be far worse. My friend suffered a catastrophe. While neither of us could afford to suddenly disappear from our careers, he had especially crucial meetings those two days.He may lose his job.
Aside from an absurd legal bill, the only apparent damage I suffered was caused by a brand new puppy that had, quite reasonably after two days indoors, destroyed my apartment.
Marijuana is a double-edged pleasure that I largely avoid. One of the rare times that I choose to smoke is while listening to live music. Since one can never smoke inside a club, and I'm not wasting the best part of the high in a taxi, the Mayor has succeeded in driving all of my jazz business to a nightclub around the corner from my apartment.
Our court system is already hopelessly overburdened with petty criminals. By throwing pot into the soup, the city government is worsening a crisis, solely for the purpose of dispensing a brutal experience to a seemingly random sample of pot smokers on the street.
This is not a just punishment or a wise policy.

HEADLINE: An Illinois City, Once Down and Out, Finds Rebirth in Riverboat Gambling

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: JOLIET, Ill.

 BODY:
This once mean and wasted city is on a roll. Known just a few years ago mostly for its prison and cadavers of steel mills, Joliet is growing, building homes and adding jobs.
It has spiffed up its schools, streets and the library. Its downtown, once the nocturnal turf of gangs, has become a network of brick sidewalks and hundreds of locust trees that greet thousands of out-of-towners who pour in here day and night, every day. And even as the city has undergone this transformation, it has cut taxes. 
 "It's our time right now," said John Mezera, the City Manager and the resident most often cited for guiding Joliet's renaissance. But the good times will last only as long as the visitors, a fickle and peripatetic lot, keep coming, Mr. Mezera acknowledged.
The revitalization of this city's economy began in June 1992 with the launching of a three-story riverboat gambling casino, the Empress I, owned by the Empress Riverboat Corporation, on the Des Plaines River on outskirts of town. The Empress now has a twin, and two more riverboat casinos, the Northern Star and the Southern Star, owned by Harrah's Entertainment, are docked in a canal in the middle of downtown.
Since opening, the floating casinos, each of which can hold about 800 passengers, have showered this city with cash. An average of 17,757 people come here every day and bet a total of $1.1 million during the two-hour cruises that run 22 hours a day, according to the Illinois Gaming Board. The city collects a quarter of the 20 percent tax that the state takes from the revenues of the boats' operators, and it receives $1 for each admission, although the customers board the boats free.
 
Tax Revenues Helping City Pay Off Its Debt
Joliet's total tax revenue since the first boat opened is expected to reach $90 million by the end of this year and account for a hefty 20 percent of all its revenues over that period. Besides cutting taxes, the city has also been paying off debt, and is using about two-thirds of the revenue for capital improvements in the formerly decrepit- and abandoned-looking downtown.
The casino companies are now the biggest employers in Joliet, population 83,000, and Will County, population 375,000, paying $100million a year in wages to 4,000 workers. This sustains an economy in which the unemployment rate sometimes exceeded 20 percent in the early 1980's.
As the gambling boom has gripped America, there has been much soul-searching over whether casinos like the ones in Joliet are good or bad for cities. An industry that hardly existed outside Nevada and Atlantic City at the start of the decade, gambling has stoked miraculous recoveries of moribund riverfront communities of the Midwest and the South.
For these communities, the overnight rush that gambling can deliver is particularly seductive given the recent efforts in Congress to cut Federal spending, including aid for urban development.
But economics and experts in urban development say that although gambling is a quick way to make money, it may not lead to long-term growth because when people spend more money in casinos, they put less into savings or investments that can be loaned to growing businesses. These experts say cities tend to get carried away by the infusion of tax revenue, without considering the consequences of pinning economic development on a casino.
Meanwhile, in the cities, some residents wonder whether revenues from gambling will bring crime and addiction to gambling. And although legalizing gambling can quickly reverse a city's fortunes, the economic resurgence may prove to be short-lived as more American cities welcome casinos.
Joliet, and and eight other riverboat gambling towns in Illinois, now face competition just over the state line on the shores of Lake Michigan as the Rust Belt Indiana cities of Hammond, Gary and East Chicago are launching their riverboat casinos this year.
Midwestern casinos, unlike those in Las Vegas, draw nearly all their customers from within an hour's drive, and the 12.5 percent who come here from Indiana are likely to stay closer to home. In fact, Empress is opening a boat in Hammond that could drain business from Joliet.
Optimists say the business is so big and has been growing so fast that there is room for everyone now authorized to operate casinos. They point to statistics: attendance at casinos in Illinois doubled from 1994 to 1995, and the boats' revenues climbed two-thirds.
But one Illinois casino, near Galena, closed late last year, and another at Rock Island is ailing. Customers have been slipping across the Mississippi to casinos in Iowa. A casino in Elgin, Ill., west of Chicago, has surpassed the two Joliet operators in attendance.
To offset the loss of day-tripping customers and to keep others in town as Las Vegas does, Empress is building a 102-room hotel, the first by either operator here, across its Egyptian-style boarding pavilion. And just in case the optimists are wrong, Mr. Mezera says he has budgeted a 12.5 percent decline in his previously projected casino tax revenues, to $27.7 million, for this year, to offset the expected loss of customers from Indiana.
Even so, it is hard to find anyone here who knocks gambling as the engine of Joliet's revival. With its gambling-tax revenues, the city has spent or is in the process of spending $2.6 million for arterial streets, in part to accommodate casino traffic; $27 million for neighborhood improvements; $10 million for sewers; $4 million for schools, and $4 million to expand the police headquarters.
Joliet is also clearing $60 million in debt for city improvements, much of it accrued in the years before gambling. By the end of this year, it will have paid off $8.9 million.
"We have determined that we are going to pay off all our debt by the year 2001," Mr. Mezera said. "The important thing is that you don't create new debt, so we are now on a cash basis."
And despite of all the new spending, Joliet has also begun to cut taxes. It has eliminated a $5.50 monthly water fee for sewer improvements and a $25 annual motor vehicle tax. Property taxes are edging down, too.
 
Even a Church Leader Points to Good Results
Even among the agents of spiritual salvation, the fact that gambling underpins this economy stirs little controversy. Across the street from the pavilion where Harrah's customers eat and shop before boarding the boats is the parking lot of a church. Rather than fight gambling, the church, like the city, lines its coffers with a tax -- the $3 it charges Harrah's customers to park.
A few blocks from Harrah's, the Rev. Richard Bennett heads a Roman Catholic church in a racially mixed neighborhood. Father Bennett expressed worries about the gamblers who spend an average of $62 with each visit to the boats with nothing to show for it, and more about those who become addicted, a problem that has led to formation of a local chapter of Gamblers Anonymous.
"When the City Council was originally proposing this, five or six years ago, a church ministerial group protested about gambling and the social effects on the community," Father Bennett said. "But they just voted on what they wanted to do, and church people were ignored. Since then, no one has spoken out about it much."
Now, with that battle lost, he said, gambling has yielded important benefits. "And on the whole," he said, "it has provided jobs for people, good-paying jobs with benefits, which is important. It has provided a lot of money the city wouldn't have had."
He could use some of the money. By Feb. 11, he had exhausted the $500 he gives to the needy, and had posted a notice on his rectory door saying: "No more assistance for this month." But he blames cuts in Federal welfare for the rising demand for his aid.
For Joliet's bigger boosters, the business aboard the boats is not gambling at all, but "gaming" and "entertainment." Mr. Mezera takes umbrage at moral arguments against it. "Why is compulsive shopping O.K., where compulsive gambling is not?" he asked.
By all accounts here, the criminal side of gambling just has not shown up. Joliet has less crime than it did before the casinos opened, according to the Police Department.
Prostitution was also a fear. "Everyone said there's going to be wholesale prostitution," Mr. Mezera said. There's none."
 
But Experts Say Gambling Lacks Benefits of Factories
Economists and experts in urban development raise numerous doubts about the value of gambling as a promote to growth, saying that gambling draws money from stores, savings and investment. The experts also argue that casinos benefit a community much less than a bolted-down factory.
A factory, they say, buys more supplies and services locally than a casino does, and it sells goods far and wide, well beyond the reach of the casinos, which pulls in money only from the neighbor a couple of exits down an interstate highway. Successful factory owners also tend to invest profits locally in expansion, while most casino owners take their profits home, often far away, to invest it in other communities.
In two studies of gambling in Illinois, Earl L. Grinols, a professor of economics at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign who has studied the state's gambling economy, said that in general, "the net gain is virtually zero.
"There is a job lost or a job not created for every job you see in the casinos," Professor Grinols said. "There's very little economic growth going on in riverboat areas because of the riverboats. But city councils get euphoric over the taxes they're collecting."
The economic development authorities in Joliet and Will County say they recognize the appeal of factories and other new businesses. To diversify beyond riverboats, Ruth Fitzgerald, president of the county Chamber of Commerce, has lured a number of businesses here, including a printing plant, a Toys-'R'-Us distribution center and a Japanese steel-processing plant. But none yet compare with the casinos, the area's biggest sources of jobs and revenue.
Modern factories, the officials say, would be better for the city. "But you've got to deal with reality and take what you can get," said James Heller, the city's director of community and economic development.
"There are no big manufacturing companies for communities our size. When entertainment came along, it was perfect. We were looking for something that would change the image of Joliet. And it did."

Buchanan Courts Old Friends With a Warning

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 8

 BODY:
Tired of watching Senator Bob Dole raid the ranks of social and religious conservatives, Patrick J. Buchanan reversed himself today and said that, without more support, he might not be able to maintain the Republican Party's strict opposition to abortion.
"I do believe the right to life movement is at a critical turning point this year," Mr. Buchanan said at a meeting of about 125 ministers here. "The establishment of my party wants to get rid of this issue." 
 As recently as Tuesday evening, at a news conference in Buffalo, Mr. Buchanan said of keeping the Republican Party's anti-abortion plank, "I think we've won that battle."
His alarm about abortion was a telling note for Mr. Buchanan. His strategists had said only Thursday that he would try to reach beyond his traditional base while campaigning in Texas.
But today, as he campaigned here and in Louisiana, Mr. Buchanan tailored his speeches to help detain apostates rather than win converts, a strategy that might maintain his leverage within the party but seems unlikely to revive his chances for the nomination.
"If Bob Dole is able to win this, if the people around him in the establishment win it, they will sell out the right to life movement in the flicker of an eyelash," Mr. Buchanan said at a rally in an aircraft hangar in Baton Rouge, La., this morning.
Polling in primary states suggests that Mr. Dole is drawing more and more voters from Mr. Buchanan's base of support.
In the Georgia primary, 35 percent of people who said the Republican platform should include an anti-abortion plank voted for Mr. Dole. But in South Carolina and New York, about half of them did.
Mr. Buchanan said today that he believed that the Republican Party would continue to oppose abortion, if pressed. "I would urge the right to life movement right now, if you really care about this cause as I think you know I do, join and unite behind me now," Mr. Buchanan said during a new conference in Baton Rouge. "We need you now."
Here in Houston, Mr. Buchanan added a warning: "If the Republican Party ever dropped Ronald Reagan's pro-life plank, I think the pro-life movement would find a new home," he said.
The Buchanan campaign has started rejiggering its strategy almost as frequently as it leaves journalists behind at its events. On Thursday, aides to Mr. Buchanan said he would advertise on television in Texas. Today, he said he would not.
"There's no doubt we are husbanding our resources," Mr. Buchanan said in Baton Rouge. He said he would advertise on television in Michigan, where he hopes his "America first" trade message will appeal to blue-collar voters. "We're going to try to make it something of a battleground," Mr. Buchanan said.
Mr. Buchanan can still draw an ecstatic crowd, like the thousand people who turned out in Memphis on Thursday night to roar as he mocked "milque-toast Christianity" and declared himself the "bad dog" in the race.
But sometimes his support is not so vigorous, or perhaps his advance work is not so thorough. In Baton Rouge, only about 40 people showed up in the chilly, cavernous airplane hangar. Mr. Buchanan nevertheless treated them to new material, introducing his wife, Shelley, as "Hillary Rodham Buchanan."
At the end, laughing, he wondered aloud why anyone had turned up at all. "Are you unemployed, or what?" he asked.
Mike Muller and Joe Schumerth shouted back that they had taken vacation time from their jobs at an Exxon refinery to hear him. Mr. Buchanan, faced with the very loyalists he was trying to energize, instantly turned earnest.
"You're good men," he said, his grin gone.

Transit Tech Updates Vocational High With Courses on Modern Trains

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
John Thomas, 18 years old, wearing a blue hard hat, stood atop a ladder with a circuit tester, prodding the wiring of an old red subway car, incongruously parked in an outsize classroom at the High School of Transit Technology. The problem: a train is stalled in a crowded subway station. The assignment: find the dead circuit.
Mr. Thomas, a senior, poked at a control panel as his teen-age crew at the rear of the car shouted when corresponding circuits lighted up. 
 "All right, I think we've got it," Mr. Thomas said. "We're on our way."
In the Transit Technology course, students like Mr. Thomas are learning the rudiments of train mechanics. There's also Basic Transit Welding, Rail Car Maintenance, and Climate Control (heating and air-conditioning repair).
Transit Tech -- "the express to success," its brochures proclaim -- is a vocational school focusing on the mechanics of both the subterranean and above-ground variety of train, with 1,200 students in pursuit of jobs in transportation. Though the school, in East New York, Brooklyn, is independent of the Transit Authority, the agency's shadow looms large: the school was its idea, and it donates materials like the circa-1960 subway car, sends advisers and offers an internship program. Many students have their eyes on the New York City public transportation system as their future employer.
With the lure of good-paying jobs in a tight market, and college entrance growing more competitive, a growing number of educators and parents are encouraging students to seek hands-on training in marketable skills. When Transit Tech was established in 1986, 400 students applied. Last year, more than 5,000 competed for 400 places. At Aviation High School in Long Island City, Queens, 3,230 candidates vied for 670 slots for the current school year.
Scores of old-style trade schools, which traditionally offered teen-agers broad vocational courses heavy on woodworking, have followed suit and added courses in computers and electronics, subjects that are more relevant to today's market.
William E. Grady Vocational and Technical High School in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, which has seen a 10 percent increase in applications since 1990, now offers computer-aided design and pre-engineering courses. Virtually all public vocational schools now include an emphasis on early contact with professionals and real-life experience.
It was the Transit Authority, facing a shortage of skilled workers due to retirements, that approached the Board of Education about forming a partnership for Transit Tech. School officials immediately saw the possibilities and spent $43 million to renovate the long neglected East New York Vocational High School.
"Here we had a failed school and an agency with a shortage of technical people," said Jesse Lazarus, the principal. "It was like a marriage made in heaven."
But the school, which does not receive financial support from the transit agency, has not been the bonanza originally imagined, said John Dempsey, an assistant vice president at the Transit Authority.
Some 300 students have secured transportation jobs since the first class graduated in 1990. But the Transit Authority has no idea how many it has hired, Mr. Dempsey said, because new graduates cannot get jobs there right out of school. With Civil Service tests given only once a year and a two-year waiting list for hiring, Mr. Dempsey said many of the school's graduates instead go to private companies or other transportation systems like the Long Island Rail Road, which do not require a Civil Service test.
"I think it has been a very positive experience for the Transit Authority to know that there is a pool that can be tapped," Mr. Dempsey said. "Now what we have to do is to get them into the agency a lot quicker."
But in another departure from the old-time vocational school, some students harbor hopes for college. About 200 Transit Tech graduates have continued their education. As Mr. Thomas and his classmates worked on the subway car, they talked not only about the task at hand but also of earning degrees in electrical engineering and computer science.
"I want to go far in the transit system," said Mr. Thomas, who is awaiting word on admission to several colleges, including the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "And college will help me."
Lawrence Edwards, assistant superintendent of the Board of Education's Division of High Schools, agreed. "The old mind-set is that if you wanted to go to college, you go to one kind of school, and if you didn't, you go to another kind of school," he said. "That is not the case anymore."
Even as the vocational schools gain popularity, some educators argue that they may limit a student's education and that some teach trades for which there is little demand, like cabinet making. They contend that the average 14-year-old is too young to decide on a career. Ideally, they say, a specialized school should combine strong academic standards with the vocation.
"They can be uni-dimensional to the degree that they deprive students of options," said Robert Berne, dean of New York University's Wagner School of Public Service. "There are a lot of students who want a marketable skill and they want that at an early age. But a lot of them change their mind four, five, six times."
Transit Tech, which offers the usual high-school curriculum, is by no means an academic powerhouse. Only 3 percent of the 250 students who graduated in 1994 received a Regents-endorsed diploma, awarded to New York State high school students who pass rigorous exams; the citywide average is 18 percent. The school's average Scholastic Assessment Test score was a combined 659 in verbal and mathematics, compared with 794 for all city high schools.
But Transit Tech students score consistently above the city's minimum requirements in reading, math and writing. A 1993-94 Board of Education report showed that the school had a graduation rate of 68 percent compared with 51 percent citywide. And its dropout rate was half the city average.
Statistics, however, tell only part of the school's story. Surrounded by decrepit rows of clapboard homes, Transit Tech, a sprawling four-story building, is like a shelter in the storm that often brews in the tough streets of East New York and its environs.
After several shootings in the school's early years, there have been few violent incidents since 1992. There are no metal detectors. The hallways are free of graffiti and litter. The walls are festooned with pictures of American heroes like George Washington and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and a huge mural of Americana covers the wall near the principal's office, towering over a glass-covered train set.
"I wanted something different," said Roger Cousar, a senior from Crown Heights, Brooklyn. "Where I live there's nothing really to do except hang out. This school helps me get away and stay out of trouble. There were a lot of people pushing me -- teachers, security guards. They all wanted me to do well."
While the school attracts students from across the city, most come from the East New York area. Seventy-nine percent are black and 18 percent are Hispanic. And unlike the percentages at most vocational schools, often dominated by boys, 25 percent of the students at Transit Tech are girls, who also hold the top offices in the student government.
"You're not treated better or worse because you're a girl," said Shaquanna Henry, a senior from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. "Here they motivate you to do better, and if you have a problem, they help you. It's like we're a family here."
Transit Tech administrators seek not only good students but those with a passion for the subject. Armed with brochures and fliers, school officials periodically march into junior high schools, selling children on the notion of earning up to $30,000 a year.
"We get phone calls at home from parents who want to get their children into the school," said Janice Jones, coordinator of student affairs. "This is the place to be."
Part of the reason is the demand for mechanics. After a decades-long slump in transit system rail ridership around the country, some 60 cities are looking to develop or expand rail systems, said Chip Bishop, a spokesman for the American Public Transit Association in Washington.
"There is no shortage of demands and needs out there for rail," Mr. Bishop said, "and it stands to reason we will need people to build and maintain these systems."
Allan Hoyt, a Transit Tech senior, is ready. "I like the hands-on experience," he said. "I'm not thinking about going to college. I just want a good job."

HEADLINE: Immigrants Replace New York's Natives

 BODY:
In the first half of the 1990's, new census figures show, enormous numbers of people left New York City for other parts of the United States, and were replaced mostly by people from abroad, trends that experts say continue to further vast changes in the culture and the economy of the region.
Overall, the Census Bureau figures released yesterday show New York City's population down slightly, at 7,312,076 last July 1, compared to 7,322,564 on April 1, 1990, the date of the last census. 
 While about 300,000 more people left the city than moved to it, natural increase -- the rate at which births exceed deaths -- made up nearly all the difference.
The metropolitan region, including New Jersey and Connecticut, once again lagged behind the national growth rate, continuing a decades-old trend.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Offer an Ambitious Plan to Expand Health Care Coverage

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
House Republican leaders offered a package of health care proposals today that is significantly more ambitious than the bipartisan measure pending in the Senate, and they predicted that it would win quick passage in the House.
The Republicans said their proposals would make affordable health insurance available to half of the 40 million Americans who have no coverage. 
 Though House Republicans have not finished preparing the legislation, they said they hoped to push it through the House before lawmakers take a spring break at the end of this month.
But advocates of the Senate bipartisan measure said that by adding proposals on medical malpractice and medical savings accounts, the Republicans might jeopardize passage of any health care bill.
Representative Dennis Hastert of Illinois, chief deputy whip for the House Republicans, said their bill, like the bipartisan measure sponsored by Senators Nancy Landon Kassebaum and Edward M. Kennedy, would guarantee health insurance coverage for many people who change jobs or lose their jobs.
In addition, he said, the Republicans' bill would set limits on damages that could be recovered by victims of medical malpractice. The bill would also create tax incentives for people to establish special savings accounts to help pay medical expenses. And it would amend a 1974 law, the bedrock of the nation's private health insurance system, to make it easier for small employers to band together and buy coverage.
"While the Senate bill guarantees the right to purchase health insurance," Mr. Hastert said, "it doesn't go far enough and address the price of that policy. Common sense tells every American that the right to purchase a health insurance policy is meaningless if you cannot afford the premium."
The White House welcomed the Republicans' interest in health care, saying that "Americans are ready for Congress to pass long-overdue and meaningful health insurance reform." But Laura D'Andrea Tyson, director of President Clinton's National Economic Council, said, "We believe that the addition of controversial and experimental provisions should not be pursued if they mean that no insurance reform bill will be passed by Congress." The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill is supported by 52 senators and most House Democrats.
Some business groups have expressed similar concerns. The National Association of Manufacturers supports the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill and, in an apparent change of heart, the House Republican bill as well.
At a Congressional hearing on Thursday, Paul R. Huard, senior vice president of the association, urged House Republican leaders to "proceed with extreme caution" in pushing any legislation beyond the scope of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, warning that such a move could "sink the boat." But today, after learning more about the House Republican bill, Jerry Jasinowski, president of the association, wrote Mr. Hastert that the manufacturers were "pleased both to endorse and to enthusiastically support your plan."
Republicans and Democrats sometimes appear to have reversed the positions they took in the debate over Mr. Clinton's health care plan. Mr. Hastert said the same Democrats now supporting modest, incremental steps to expand health insurance coverage were insisting enactment of "a grandiose plan" in 1993 and 1994.
Now House Republicans say the Kassebaum-Kennedy is too modest. They say they want to put their own stamp on the legislation in this election year, to show that they can deliver health care improvements that eluded a Democratic Congress working with a Democratic President.
Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said the tax deduction and tax incentives for medical savings accounts would cost the Government $3 billion over five years. Republicans have not decided how to cover the cost, other than by cracking down on fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid, he said.
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill is tentatively scheduled for debate in the Senate on April 18 and 19. Mrs. Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican, and Mr. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, have said they will resist all amendments.
But Mr. Hastert said today: "There are going to be amendments in the Senate. The Senate is the Senate. They're going to do their thing. We don't predicate everything we do here on threats from the Senate."
Under the Senate bill, companies selling individual health insurance would have to offer such policies to people who lost group health coverage, either because they lose their jobs or switched to employers that did not offer health benefits. Mr. Hastert said House Republicans wanted to provide similar protection to workers, but were mindful of the concerns of insurance companies, which say that the premiums for individual insurance could soar as a result of such a requirement.

HEADLINE: New York's Foreign-Born Population Increases

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
In the first half of the 1990's, new census figures show, enormous numbers of people left New York City for other parts of the United States, and were replaced mostly by people from abroad, trends that experts say mean vast changes for the region's culture and economy.
Looking just at moves between the city and other parts of the United States, New York lost more than one-tenth of its population, according to Census Bureau estimates released yesterday. 
 Against that loss, foreign-born people continued to alter the city's customs and work force, contributing a net growth of 460,000 people from other countries during the same period.
Over all, the Census Bureau figures released yesterday show New York City's population down slightly, at 7,312,076 last July 1, compared with 7,322,564 on April 1, 1990, the date of the last census. While about 300,000 more people left the city than moved to it, natural increase -- the rate at which births exceed deaths -- made up nearly all the difference. The city's population has fluctuated between seven million and eight million since the 1940's.
The metropolitan region, including New Jersey and Connecticut, once again lagged behind the national growth rate, continuing a decades-old trend.
Throughout its history, New York City has been constantly remade by immigration, with native-born people leaving the city for other parts of the country, but experts say the trend appears to have accelerated in the early 90's, perhaps to the highest levels since just after World War II. "More and more, what happens to this city is hooked into the foreign-born," said Joseph J. Salvo, director of population studies at the Department of City Planning.
Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College who studies population trends, said: "This is a very significant trend, in that it creates much more of a foreign city and a poorer city."
"What we've found is that the domestic migrants out are better-educated and higher-income than average," he said. Their departure means that "the tax base to provide social services is eroding." At the same time, he said, immigrants put an increasing burden on those services, particularly public schools and hospitals. The city's schools have averaged an influx of about 20,000 students a year, largely through immigration.
Mr. Salvo agreed that immigration was bringing broad changes and real challenges to the city, but he argued that the trends were not cause for alarm. Many immigrants are well educated, he said, and they are more likely to be part of the city's work force than their native-born counterparts.
Many people who leave the city are not from the professional ranks, he said. "A lot of poor Puerto Ricans go back to Puerto Rico, a lot of Southern-born people retire and go back to the South and a lot of the foreign-born move out of the city," he said. "Those are all part of out-migration, too."
The census figures show that both the influx and the exodus peaked in the first three years of this decade, abating somewhat in the last two years.
"This was an acceleration of the trend in the 1980's," Mr. Beveridge said, adding that the city lost about 500,000 residents to domestic migration from 1985 to 1990, or less than two-thirds of the level of the last five years. One of the most serious cultural consequences, he predicted, will be a wider-than-ever divide between an international urban core and suburbs that continue to be mostly white and native-born. He said that trend is mirrored, to one degree or another, in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Houston and Dallas.
Nearly every county in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut showed a population loss to domestic migration, but in the metropolitan area, only Hudson, Essex and Passaic counties showed the kind of losses seen in New York City.
All of the new figures released by the bureau are estimates, unlike the census figures, which are based on an exhaustive attempt to count every person in the country. As a result, Mr. Salvo cautioned against drawing conclusions from small changes in the numbers, which he called "foolish precision."
Brooklyn and the Bronx are estimated to have lost residents, while Queens, Manhattan and Staten Island gained.
The Census Bureau estimates that the population of the entire country grew 5.6 percent in the five-year period, to almost 263 million; New York State's grew by almost 150,000, to just over 18.1 million; New Jersey gained more than 200,000, to more than 7.9 million, and Connecticut lost about 13,000 of its nearly 3.3 million people.
The census figures also show that the number of older people is higher and rising faster in the three-state region than in the nation as a whole. Last year, 12.8 percent of the nation's population was 65 or older, up from 12.5 percent in 1990. In New York, the percentage grew to 13.4 percent, from 13 percent; in Connecticut, to 14.3 percent, from 13.5 percent, and in New Jersey, to 13.7 percent, from 13.2 percent.
The county-by-county figures show that after a population boom in the 1980's, the New York state suburbs at the fringes of the metropolitan area saw mostly modest growth in the first half of the 90's. Rockland, Orange, Suffolk and Dutchess counties all grew more slowly in the last five years than the nation as a whole. In Connecticut, Litchfield and Fairfield Counties barely grew at all, while the population of New Haven County dropped slightly.
"This is all economically driven," Mr. Beveridge said. "In the 80's, when the economy was doing well, the city grew, those outer suburbs grew, but that came to a halt with the recession. The region has lost a lot of jobs, so it's not surprising that people leave."
But the outer ring of suburbs in central New Jersey -- Somerset, Hunterdon, Monmouth and Ocean counties -- continued to grow considerably faster than the national rate. That, too, is a reflection of the economy, Mr. Beveridge said.
"The New Jersey economy has been better than the other two states, and a lot of that has been centered on the Route 1 corridor in those counties," he said. Like New York City, the nearer suburbs -- Nassau and Westchester counties in New York, and Bergen, Passaic, Essex, Union and Hudson counties in New Jersey -- saw little change in population.

HEADLINE: Memphis Bank Buying Biggest Tennessee S.& L.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The Union Planters Corporation agreed to acquire the Leader Financial Corporation yesterday for stock valued at $486 million, creating Tennessee's largest banking company.
The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidations in the banking industry. Tennessee in particular has been seen as a ripe area for banking acquisitions, analysts have said. 
 Benjamin W. Rawlins Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Union Planters, said in a statement that the deal was a "classic in-market merger" and that "significant economies of scale can be achieved."
Union Planters, based in Memphis, is Tennessee's second-largest banking company, and Leader, also based in Memphis, is the state's largest savings and loan association. The combined company would have nearly $15 billion in assets, surpassing the First Tennessee National Corporation of Memphis as the state's biggest financial institution.
In terms of deposit market share, however, First Tennessee would remain the largest.
The plan for the combined company would include closing about 20 branches, chiefly in Memphis. Union Planter has 405 branches, most of them in Tennessee, while Leader Financial has 21.
Under the terms of the agreement, Union Planters would exchange 1.525 shares of its own stock, which at yesterday's closing price of $29.25 would be worth $44.61, for each of Leader's 10.9 million shares. The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. If the deal is not completed, Union Planters still has an option to purchase up to 19.9 percent of Leader's common stock at $41 each.
Shares of Union Planters, amid a broad selloff in the market and banking stocks in particular, fell sharply yesterday, closing down $2.25, to $29.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Leader Financial shares, however, rose $4.25, or 11 percent, to $42.25, in Nasdaq trading.
Analysts said they thought the combination was an extremely good fit. "There are some in-market synergies to be had," said Kay C. Lister, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. "These are companies that complement one another well. One's weakness is the other's strength."
For example, Leader Financial has a loan-to-deposit ratio of 125 percent, which means the company has had to borrow, sometimes from the Federal Home Loan Bank, to meet its commitments. But the combined company would be on much firmer footing, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of about 85 percent.
The deal announced yesterday will be the third significant acquisition for Union Planters in the last year. In December Union Planters completed its acquisition of the Capital Bancorporation in Cape Girardeau, Mo., for about $114 million. And more recently, it agreed to acquire the Franklin Financial Group Inc. of Morristown, Tenn., for about $150 million.
Christopher T. Kelley, an analyst at Morgan Keegan & Company, said Union Planters took advantage of a good opportunity. "They bought something very profitable, and bought it at a good price," he said. "With this acquisition, Union Planters takes out a pretty big competitor."
Leader Financial shareholders can also expect to profit. The bank first went public in 1993, with shares selling at $10. "I know one thing," Mr. Kelley said. "There are lots of happy shareholders around Memphis today."

HEADLINE: Keep College Open to the Poor

 BODY:
During the last 20 years, the incomes of college graduates have risen while workers with only high school educations have seen earnings and job opportunities evaporate. New York State, with its vast numbers of poor, cannot afford to worsen the trend. Given that imperative, one of the signal issues in Albany this spring is the dispute over funding for public colleges and universities -- the schools of choice for low-income New Yorkers seeking to better their lot.
The 21-campus City University of New York and the 64-campus State University of New York certainly need restructuring -- and perhaps even some campus closings -- to meet new fiscal realities. But cuts in student aid proposed by Gov. George Pataki have frightened even fiscal conservatives, many of whom see the cuts as too much, too fast -- and an unfair blow to the poor. 
 CUNY and SUNY have experienced a steady series of cuts in state funding -- often with dramatic consequences. The two systems were forced to impose tuition increases of $750 last year -- from $2,650 to $3,400 at SUNY and from $2,450 to $3,200 at CUNY. The higher fees drove out many struggling students, and were partly responsible for a combined enrollment drop of 16,000 in the two systems.
Now Mr. Pataki is proposing dramatic cuts and formula changes in the Tuition Assistance Program, known as TAP, that would make it even harder for low-income students to attend college. In New York City alone, TAP cuts would cause 50,000 students to lose up to $1,029 each per year -- with the heaviest hit on families earning under $16,000.
The SUNY board of trustees, now controlled by Mr. Pataki, has not protested the cuts. But an internal SUNY analysis shows justifiable worry on the front lines. At SUNY Binghamton, for example, 65 percent of the TAP recipients would lose an average of $934 each -- a ruinous sum for poor and lower-middle-class students. At some community colleges, low-income students would lose roughly 60 percent of their state aid. The administration also proposes letting aid increases lag a year behind tuition increases, further pressing poor families.
The Pataki administration says the cuts are warranted because New York is overly generous, spending three times as much on tuition assistance as Pennsylvania, Illinois or California. It estimates that, even after the cuts, nearly a third of New York's 300,000 TAP recipients will receive full-tuition scholarships. But tuition is less than half the cost of an actual SUNY or CUNY education.
State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills was on the mark when he argued against the cuts, saying that the TAP was an investment in New York's future -- and in a more highly skilled work force. That investment is already falling short of what is needed. Despite substantial enrollment increases over the last decade, higher education aid has grown more slowly in New York than in almost any other state. Before shifting costs onto the shoulders of struggling families, Mr. Pataki needs to look hard for economies elsewhere. The Legislature needs to resolve the TAP debate quickly. Uncertainty over student aid could prompt many New Yorkers not to apply to college at all.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: ON THE TRAIL;
Clinton Calls On Companies to Train Workers

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 8

 BODY:
Preaching the doctrine of corporate responsibility with the verve of evangelism and the gentle hand of voluntarism, President Clinton today urged American companies to build up their workers as well as their profits, "within the limits of their capacity."
Mr. Clinton used a speech at Harman International Industries, a consumer electronics company in the Northridge section of the San Fernando Valley, to exhort companies to follow Harman by providing generous worker training to improve not only productivity and performance but also the bonds of community and society. 
 In doing so, Mr. Clinton edged a bit deeper into the current economic and political conundrum: how can so many workers have been left anxious about layoffs and downsizing and provided with no growth in wages after inflation, while the nation's economy has ticked along and, as the White House announced today, 8.4 million jobs have been created since Mr. Clinton took office.
Unlike his Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich, who has irked some in the Administration by musing repeatedly in recent weeks about tax incentives for companies that help employees with extra benefits and training, Mr. Clinton straddled the issue today. He confined himself to celebrating the record of Harman, which makes JBL audio speakers and other products, and imploring others to follow its example.
"The most important reason I wanted to come here, even though I can't afford a Jaguar to get one of those fancy speakers you make that go in them, is because I respect what you are doing," Mr. Clinton told workers on a factory floor at midday. "You are the secret of America's future success, and what this company has done is what every company should strive to do, within the limits of their capacity."
At Harman, senior executives work on a production line 18 days a year to keep in touch with workers' concerns, and the company offers extensive retraining for employees moving from function to function. The company also has a program in which scrap wood from speaker cabinets is used to make clock faces, keeping busy workers who would otherwise be idle.
Instead of offering any new proposals, Mr. Clinton sought to connect workers' needs with his longstanding economic prescriptions, which the Republican-controlled Congress has declined to pass. These include consolidating job-training programs into a system of vouchers, offering new tax deductions for college and vocational education and raising the minimum wage.
More broadly, the President spoke of corporate conduct in the same manner as he has recently done with other values-related issues, like drug abuse, school uniforms, and violence in movies and on television. This strategy does not involve calling for more spending or passing regulations -- neither of which the Republicans would support -- but using the platform of the Presidency to advocate ideas that have broad, bipartisan appeal.
The current trip is Mr. Clinton's 23d visit to California since he took office and his second in two weeks.
Harman's chief executive, Sidney Harman, is married to Representative Jane Harman, the local Democratic Congresswoman, and Mr. Clinton's visit provided the opportunity for a little political fence-mending. Ms. Harman had objected to the Administration's decision not to expand the B-2 bomber fleet beyond its planned levels.
Today, however, Mr. Harman could only wax poetic about his and his wife's hourlong conversation with the President on the way out from Washington.
Tonight, Mr. Clinton, also for the second time in as many weeks, is at a reception at the Malibu oceanfront home of the recording mogul David Geffen. The guest list includes top film-industry officials.
Before returning to Washington on Saturday night, Mr. Clinton plans to attend a reception organized by Mayor Willie L. Brown of San Francisco to raise up to $500,000 for the Democratic National Committee.

HEADLINE: Surprise Job Report Ambushes Bond Investors

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond investors were swept up in a wild scramble to sell off holdings yesterday after the Government reported a much stronger labor market than investors had imagined. Months of pricing in the climate of a weak economy and cuts in interest rates evaporated in a flash.
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said the day was "pandemonium." Bond prices plunged and their yields registered their biggest one-day jump since 1987. 
 Fears of a strengthening economy and the rising inflation that it could bring convinced investors that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates at its next policy meeting on March 26. The next probable chance would not come until the next meeting in May.
Tom Seay of the Lexington Management Corporation told Bloomberg Business News, "For anybody who had visions the Fed was still going to cut interest rates at the end of this month, that's history."
By the close of the New York cash market, the price of the Treasury's 30-year benchmark bond was down 33/32 points, to a price of 9026/32 . The yield on the long bond, a measuring stick by which consumer, corporate and municipal borrowing is calculated, soared to its highest level since last August. The yield rose to 6.72 percent, from 6.46 percent on Thursday.
That was the largest one-day surge since June 2, 1987, when the yield soared 32 basis points, to 8.93 percent. That jump came on the day Paul A. Volcker said he would not seek a third term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The yield is now at the highest level since last Aug. 24, when it was 6.81 percent.
Traders said the the number of jobs added to the economy in February was twice what they had expected. The magnitude of the rise left many economists befuddled since only a week ago many were predicting that the Fed would cut rates this month, in reaction to a weak economy.
Mr. Fine of Chase Securities said that while the jump in payrolls eliminates any thoughts of an impending recession, it was unclear just how briskly the economy was moving. That is because broad sectors within the jobs report showed a mixed performance. "The service sector is displaying consistent growth, which is likely a true assessment of the current situation," he said. But "the construction sector showed strong growth, which is questionable as to its magnitude, and manufacturing appears to be going nowhere."
These statistics, he said, shift the Fed into a neutral position. Not only is the Fed unlikely to change its policy at the March 26 meeting, but it may also well decide to maintain its 5.25 percent Federal funds target rate through the May meeting.
Mr. Fine said that a two-year Treasury note yielding roughly 5.75 percent appeared to be consistent with a neutral Fed. Yesterday, at the close of the New York market, the two-year note was down 21/32 of a point, to a price of 9828/32 to yield 5.74 percent, up from 5.38 percent on Thursday.
"The numbers today may have overstated the pace of economic activity," Mr. Fine said, considering the weak signs that are apparent, "with our trading partners in Europe and Japan still in an economic funk, corporate mergers and downsizing activity still widespread and the baby-boomer generation still concerned about their future economic security."
"If so, inflation is unlikely to accelerate on a trend basis," he said, "and coupled with a neutral Fed that will not be stimulating the economy anytime soon, that implies the potential for lower bond yields from today's somewhat panic levels."
Like Mr. Fine other analysts suspected that the economy was not as strong as depicted in the jobs report.
Nancy J. Kimelman, chief economist for Technical Data, Boston, said: "Spikes in nonfarm payrolls like the 705,000 surge reported for February 1996 are not unusual. The important thing to remember is that spikes do not say anything about the underlying trend in employment. They do speak to the imperfect nature of surveys and statistics."
She said the bond market overreacted, in keeping with a herd mentality. After the market crash in 1987, she said, "everyone was saying the sky had fallen, and it didn't."
"And," she said, "it's not falling this time either."
Ms. Kimelman said she would not be surprised if excess selling pushed the yield on the long bond up to 7 percent. And investors may find that yield too attractive to pass up.

HEADLINE: Pulp Mills Turn Over a New Leaf;
Some Companies See Green as Just Good Business

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
OGLETHORPE, Ga.
Twenty years ago, the typical American paper mill spewed 40 million gallons of contaminated water a day into a nearby river or stream and belched fumes that stank like rotten eggs and corroded the metal of cars for miles around.
Today, the Weyerhaeuser Company's mill in this Georgia town releases just 11 million gallons of much cleaner effluent a day into the Flint River and emits a faint and not unpleasant scent resembling turpentine. And many other paper producers, responding to tougher environmental laws and the threat of litigation, are following the same pristine path. 
 For environmentalists, there is even better news on the horizon: The day is coming, Weyerhaeuser and some other big paper companies say, when their water discharges will approach zero, all but eliminating pollution and saving huge amounts of fresh water. As an added environmental benefit, some companies are even talking about extracting beneficial tree chemicals like calcium from recycled water and returning them to the forest floor to enrich the soil.
The result of all this is an important if little heralded environmental success story: the transformation of a manufacturing process that was once a blight on the nation's water and air into a benign backdrop to the ecological landscape.
"Twenty five years ago the rivers ran black and fish kills were a common event," said John Ruston, a paper industry specialist at the Environmental Defense Fund. Now, he said, most mills have ended most pollution that can be seen or smelled and have cut unseen but environmentally damaging waste by 80 to 90 percent.
Regulations were the goad at first, but more recently some companies have made environmental performance a competitive tool. "The best companies have found a way to integrate the environment in their investment decision making," Mr. Ruston said. "They have found ways to use less water, less energy and still increase production, which is a competitive advantage."
To be sure, some environmentalists will never be happy so long as paper companies cut down trees. But many of the nation's 537 mills are heading in a direction once considered unthinkable: creating a system that eliminates the discharge of water altogether. They call this goal "closing the loop."
The first target of the mills is the bleaching process, the source of roughly half their pollution. Other, mostly innocuous stages of the manufacturing process would continue to take water from streams and rivers and dump it back in.
The transition would not only keep American waterways purer, it could also remove the threats of litigation and bureaucratic crackdown that for years have hung over the industry. In 1992, for example, Weyerhaeuser was sued for $1 billion by landowners who accused it of releasing dioxin, a suspected carcinogen produced when pulp is bleached with chlorine, and other substances into waterways around its Columbus, Miss., plant. A year earlier, the owners of two paper mills agreed to pay $5.8 million in penalties to settle charges they polluted a beach in Eureka, Calif., also with dioxin and other chemicals.
Both actions were part of the aftermath of the big dioxin scare that swept the country in the late 1980's after studies showed that mills were releasing it into rivers. The reports raised fears that people downstream were eating contaminated fish or otherwise exposing themselves to dangerous levels of the chemical.
Besides lawsuits, the reports touched off a Federal crackdown on the industry, forcing it to invest up to $20 million per paper mill to reduce the dioxin in discharged water.
While earlier fears of dioxin's cancer-causing properties have abated, newer studies have linked the family of chemicals to which it belongs to reproductive disorders in humans and animals. The paper industry also worries that some other chemical that is now considered harmless might suddenly come under scrutiny as a potential threat to public health. "There are natural toxins in trees," said R. L. Erickson, Weyerhaeuser's vice president for manufacturing and technology. "We had dioxin in 1987. What will it be in 2005? By closing the loop, you can prevent future issues."
There is also a practical reason for the paper industry to wean itself of its reliance on copious amounts of water: cost. While water from the Flint River is free, Weyerhaeuser has to purify it to use it in the mill and clean it up again before it discharges it. And paper company executives worry that as the United States population grows and demand for water intensifies, their access to cheap supplies may be curtailed. "Mills that use a lot of water will not be in favor," Mr. Erickson said. "There has been talk in some areas of taxing water usage."
A tour of Weyerhaeuser's plant here shows how far the industry has come -- and how far it has to go. The sprawling complex uses mostly recycled water, preventing the escape of those rotten egg odors. Instead, the foul-smelling hydrogen sulfide is extracted from used water and incinerated. The mill is highly automated, requiring only a handful of workers.
But out back, contaminated water is still stored in large ponds to allow the harmful chemicals it contains to be broken down by biological action. Closing the loop on the mill's bleaching operations would reduce the need for these reservoirs, because most of the water would be re-used.
For many in the industry, 100 percent recycling is more a dream than an imminent reality. "A no-discharge plant is a very attractive proposition and at some point we will get there," said Jerry H. Ballengee, president and chief operating officer of the Union Camp Corporation, based in Wayne, N.J., which has mills and factories across the country. "But it is not around the corner. Complex chemical problems remain to be solved." Mr. Erickson of Weyerhaeuser agreed, saying the technology for closure "is not yet a fact." Industry executives also say the final leap into 100 percent recycling will be very expensive, though they did not provide estimates of the cost.
It is a measure of how far the industry has come, though, that no-discharge processes are even under discussion. Until the dioxin scare, most mills bleached wood fibers with chlorine gas. The chlorine residues of this process in water are highly corrosive to metal piping, so the water was pumped directly to treatment ponds before being disgorged into a nearby river.
In recent years, many mills have switched from chlorine gas to chlorine dioxide, and a few, like the Louisiana Pacific Corporation's Samoa mill in Northern California and Union Camp's mill in Franklin, Va., have done away with chlorine compounds entirely. The resulting waste water is far less corrosive and a better candidate for recycling.
And if eliminating water discharges remains a long-term proposition, some mills are working at it one production step at a time. Officials of Louisiana Pacific's Samoa mill, for example, plan to recycle all water used in the bleaching process by the end of this year.
Likewise, the Champion International Corporation has installed equipment at its pulp and paper mill in Canton, N.C., to recycle water used in the first two stages of its three-stage bleaching process. Champion has not said when it will be ready to "close the loop" altogether, but it has joined with Wheelabrator Water Technologies, a unit of WMX Technologies, and Sterling Pulp Chemicals, a unit of Tenneco Inc., to form a venture called the Closed Loop Alliance to market the technology to the rest of the pulp and paper industry.
Recycling has economic payoffs beyond just potential savings on water costs. For example, many mills have developed the technology for recovering and re-using the chemicals that separate the cellulose fibers in wood that are transformed into paper from the lignin glue that holds a tree together.
And they have learned to extract some tree chemicals like turpentine that they can sell, and to capture others that are burned to provide energy. "We simply could not afford to run the plant unless we could recover the digesting chemicals," said Neil Moore, one of the managers of the Flint River mill, which burns discarded tree parts for fuel and is self-sufficient in energy.
Engineers are also working on ways to remove metals and other equipment-clogging chemicals from recycled water. That effort could end up being a boon to forest ecology. "We get 6,000 pounds of calcium from trees a day," Mr. Moore said, and some in the industry favor returning that and other chemicals to the forest to enrich soils depleted by repeated harvesting.
Others are cool to the idea. Mr. Ballangee, Union Camp's president, worries that the equipment to remove these elements and crystallize them to a solid form would waste energy. "You have to ask if the reward is worth the environmental cost of making it happen," he said. "If electrical generating plants were pollution free, maybe it would be O.K., but of course they are not."
In the end, environmentalists say, it may not be practical or necessary to reduce paper mills' water discharges to absolute zero. "It is not clear that they have to go all the way," said Lauren Blum, a chemist and paper specialist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "If they can cut the flow of waste water by 90 or 95 percent, it will make a big difference in the waterways near mills."

HEADLINE: Unexpected Strength in Jobs Unsettles Stocks and Bonds;
705,000 New Jobs In February Cut Into Unemployment

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
In what appeared to be a stunningly strong rebound from the economic impact of January's blizzard, American employers added 705,000 new jobs last month while the unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent, the Labor Department said today.
The improvements were far greater than expected and suggested, at first glance, that the economy was much stronger than other recent reports had indicated. Such strength undermines the case that the Federal Reserve needs to cut short-term interest rates to stimulate economic growth. The bond and stock markets had been betting on lower interest rates, and the employment report sent them tumbling today. Bond prices fell sharply, driving the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for mortgages and other consumer interest rates -- up to 6.72 percent from 6.46 percent. [Page 38.] 
 Despite the sharp reaction of the financial markets, most economists, though acknowledging being surprised by the biggest expansion of payrolls since 1983, insisted that February's clearly unsustainable labor market results overstated the economy's strength.
"The numbers aren't as good as they looked," said Irwin L. Kellner, a senior economist at Chemical Bank. He noted, among other things, a longer-than-usual survey period that captured extra jobs anda high concentration of part-time and temporary employment in addition to the unescapable fact that the Northeast blizzard had severely, albeit artificially, depressed the January results.
Others noted that factory jobs grew by just 26,000 last month, barely one-third of their January decline.
Indeed, H. Erich Heinemann, head of the economic research unit at Brimberg & Company, an institutional broker, called the February report little more than "statistical catch-up" and derided the notion that "some great explosion" in economic activity had taken place when job growth in the first two months of 1996 was very similar to that in the comparable 1995 period.
Officials at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the report widely regarded as the most important of monthly economic indicators, said that while the February gains exceeded losses from the blizzard it was impossible to tell by how much.
Nonetheless, the White House seized on the report to boast of surpassing President Clinton's 1992 campaign pledge that the economy would generate eight million jobs in his first term. Administration officials and some other analysts raised their estimates for economic growth in the quarter ending March 31.
"The expected rebound from the January doldrums has come sooner than anticipated," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "We now expect to see solid gross domestic product growth in the first quarter of 1996 as well as throughout the rest of the year."
While the 705,000 jump in payroll jobs does indeed raise the total number of jobs created since January 1993, when President Clinton was inaugurated, to 8.4 million, economists generally say that normal growth of the population would produce nearly the same amount.
Another report today pointed to unexpected strength in the economy. The Commerce Department said construction spending rose three-tenths of 1 percent in January, to a seasonally adjusted $537.6 billion. Many economists had expected a decline, assuming severe winter storms delayed many projects. While government spending accounted for much of the increase, it was still the second consecutive monthly advance after a decline of eight-tenths of 1 percent in November.
The decline in the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent from 5.8 percent means that the rate has moved from the upper end to near the lower end of the range it has hovered in since late 1994. The rate, which moved up two-tenths of a point in January, was last at 5.5 percent in October.
Most analysts said that today's report all but ruled out a cut in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet on March 26. But some said a cut was still possible, even necessary.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, and a persistent advocate of easier monetary policy, argued that the risk of recession had not disappeared.
"Under these circumstances, the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates again" this month, he said.
Geographically, much of February's job market improvement was concentrated in the Midwest, where the already-low unemployment rate dropped to 4.4 percent from 4.7 percent. In the Northeast, where snowstorms took their greatest toll, the jobless rate edged down to 5.7 percent from 5.8.
Unemployment in the South and West was unchanged at 5.4 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively.
The main growth last month was in services, with 46,000 more health-related jobs, a jump of 79,000 jobs at temporary-help agencies and a gain of 121,000 jobs in construction. Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said the rise in construction jobs "reflects some real strength" as well as a rebound from January's exceptionally harsh weather to unusually good weather in February.
Retail trade added 166,000 jobs, more than twice the January loss, with much of the improvement in bars and restaurants, a sector especially hard hit by storms. Job growth in department stores reflected fewer layoffs than expected in the first two months of the year after weak hiring during the holiday season.
The length of the average workweek jumped 48 minutes, more than recovering from a 36-minute decline in January, while factory hours and overtime performed similarly.
The index of aggregate weekly hours, a proxy for industrial production to be reported by the Federal Reserve next Friday, vaulted to 134.5 -- 4.2 points higher than in January and 1.6 points above the December level.
Average hourly earnings, meanwhile, edged down a cent, to $11.65, reflecting the return of many low-paid and part-time workers who lost jobs to the blizzard, either because their workplace closed or because they could not reach it. Hourly earnings had risen 5 cents in January.
Still, the Leading Inflation Index compiled by Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle posted its first increase in 15 months, the biggest factor being a rise in the proportion of the population with jobs in February.
The Government's survey of households, which counts the number of people with at least one job, posted a 437,000 increase last month, after a gain of 245,000 in January.
Since the labor force expanded by only 115,000, the ranks of the unemployed dropped by 322,000, pulling down the unemployment rate.
The jobless rate for adult women, which had risen four-tenths of a point in January, eased three-tenths of a point last month, to 4.8 percent, the report also showed.

HEADLINE: A Search for Answers To Avoid the Layoffs

SERIES: THE DOWNSIZING OF AMERICA: Last of Seven Articles -- Is There a Better Way?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Gerald Greenwald slipped into his limousine near O'Hare Airport, leaned back and pondered a daring deal.
It was last fall, and Mr. Greenwald had joined United Airlines as chairman a year earlier as a seasoned practitioner of management arts, including layoffs. He had been an architect of Chrysler's recovery, shedding 60,000 workers. 
 Buy struggling USAir, he figured, and United would add valuable routes, creating the nation's largest airline by far.
"I wouldn't want to be on the other side of this," an aide recalled Mr. Greenwald as saying, referring to the problems he could create for rivals.
There was just one hitch. A year earlier most of United's 75,000 employees -- the pilots, mechanics, gate agents and middle managers -- had bought a majority stake in the airline, taking huge pay cuts in return for a commitment that none of United's employee-owners would be laid off for five years. Buying USAir would take United deeper into debt, threatening the no-layoff guarantee. It would also put United's employees in the agonizing position of ordering the downsizing of USAir, killing off the jobs of 8,000 union brothers and sisters.
As the US Air plan circulated in the company, union leaders like John Peterpaul, the gruff representative of the mechanics on United's board, raised objections. He and his union colleagues could imagine the headlines if they took jobs. And many United employees were questioning whether the strategic gain was worth the risk to their own job stability.
By the time United's board met on Nov. 13, a formal vote was not even necessary. "This was something we just couldn't do," Mr. Peterpaul recalled. "Too much pain."
Mr. Greenwald agreed, but even today he wonders whether his company made the right choice. "What is job security? It's working for a strong company. We made the only choice we could at the time. But in the long run will United be better off going it alone? I don't know. We still debate it."
Decisions like United's -- rare exceptions, to be sure -- are reminders that layoffs are not the only option for businesses trying to compete in today's economy. Across America, some companies are resisting downsizing, searching for less painful ways to survive and prosper. It isn't easy.
The sacrifices made at such companies are often substantial. And even the companies that have avoided layoffs say they do not know how long they can hold out. They are beholden, they maintain, to powerful forces beyond their control. Among them are new technologies that undercut jobs and Wall Street investors who continue to reward layoff announcements. Yet another force, and one likely to become increasingly important, is pressure from foreign nations, notably China, for American companies to move jobs onto their soil in return for access to their growing markets.
Many executives and economists, and some historians as well, agree that while the results may seem Darwinian, layoffs are a necessary part of the bargain in an economy that continues to generate wealth and new jobs, even as old ones fall away.
In recent years, though, others have wondered whether job-cutting has become too accepted as management's answer to problems. And when corporate executives pocket multimillion-dollar bonuses for driving up profits by slashing workers, some ask whether the pendulum has swung too far.
"Capitalism swings to extremes," said Jeffrey E. Garten, a former investment banker and Under Secretary of Commerce who is the dean of the Yale School of Management. "We are now deep into one of those extremes."
Recognizing the problem is one thing. It is another to frame a constructive debate about what steps might be taken to slow the downsizing or ease the difficulties of workers caught in the spiral.
At bottom, many of the solutions being discussed involve a reordering of priorities to put more emphasis on protecting workers. This can mean concessions by both workers and executives to make sure a business remains strong enough to preserve jobs. It can mean a willingness by companies and even taxpayers to spend more to help workers through one of the most wrenching transitions in decades. It can mean taking a page from other cultures that lay off employees only as a last resort. And it can mean workers themselves trying to become more self-reliant.
 
Hits and Misses
Layoffs are sometimes a matter of corporate survival. Markets and technology change quickly, threatening to turn today's blue-chip powerhouse into tomorrow's basket case. Just a few years ago, three of America's biggest corporations -- General Motors, Sears and I.B.M. -- seemed to be sliding fast. In a 1993 cover article, Fortune magazine dubbed the three "corporate dinosaurs." Each had grown bloated and bureaucratic, and was being rocked by new forces: General Motors by leaner, quality-conscious car makers at home and in Japan, Sears by more efficient retailers like Wal-Mart, and I.B.M. by a computing revolution led by the microchip and personal computers.
Three years later, after shifting strategies and shedding many thousands of workers, the companies are smaller, smarter and more nimble. The out-of-control slide has stopped and, for the most part, so have the job cuts. Indeed, I.B.M. recently announced that after cutting its payroll by 175,000 people since 1987, it is growing again, especially in its computer-services business, where it seeks to hire 10,000 workers this year. And it is awarding 8 percent pay raises to its surviving workers.
Some management experts argue that many companies downsize in a violent, overly hasty reaction to bad times. They cut without overhauling their strategy or the way they work. A survey of 1,000 companies by the American Management Association found that fewer than half the companies laying off people managed to increase their operating profits after workers were shed. "The question that too many companies ask is how can we get by with the minimum number of people," said Eric Greenberg, director of management studies at the association. "And you're not going to grow if you simply do the same work with fewer people. You end up with a demoralized work force and no new business."
Other studies have come to similar conclusions. Nitin Nohria, an associate professor at the Harvard Business School, recently studied layoffs over more than a decade at 100 large American companies. Often, too many people are fired, he found, or the wrong ones, and those who survive aren't retrained to pick up the workload in a shrunken company. "Downsizing is typically viewed as a financial exercise," Mr. Nohria said. "Companies add up their costs per employee and say, 'If we have 10,000 fewer employees, that will save us that much in expenses and make us that much more profitable.' So they cut 10,000 people across the board."
Yet that approach, Mr. Nohria said, rarely succeeds. "On average, downsizing doesn't pay." Indeed, layoffs have failed to pay off at companies including retailers like Woolworth and Kmart and technology companies like Apple Computer and Unisys.
The deep cuts can cripple product development, marketing and customer service. As business evaporates, management is forced into further cuts. Sometimes, with angry customers clamoring, management recognizes its mistake and hires again. In rare cases, executives even admit their mistake.
Consider the experience of Delta Air Lines, which last December and January watched its on-time performance plummet to the bottom of the list for major airlines. Complaints to the Department of Transportation soared. No one in Delta management had to look too hard to find the cause: In the last few years Delta had eliminated more than 10,000 positions, a mix of buyouts, multi-year leaves and layoffs.
As air travel grew last year, the company failed to hire. And then the bad winter weather hit and schedules got thrown off. Delta found itself short of baggage handlers, maintenance workers and customer-service agents. "Our customer service deteriorated," said Bill Berry, a Delta spokesman. "We found that we lost a lot of experience when we encouraged early retirements."
Now, Delta is hiring 600 workers.
 
A Popular Alternative
The United Airlines experiment in changing corporate priorities -- putting job security on par with profits -- is the largest and among the most visible cases of employees taking control of a company. It starts with people like Herb Hunter, who pilots 737's and makes well over $100,000 a year for it. A trim, laconic former Air Force pilot, he looks and sounds as if he stepped from the pages of "The Right Stuff."
But his confidence is confined to the flight deck. On the ground, Mr. Hunter muses about how he has "downsized my life" to meet the new realities of the airline world. He has given up 25 percent of his pay in return for more job security and a shareholder's stake in United, which he will receive at retirement.
Though many of his colleagues opposed the employee buyout, it was an easy decision for Mr. Hunter. He is still haunted by memories of the early 1980's, when United laid him off for two years during a severe downturn. "Suddenly I was sitting on a mortgage I couldn't pay," he recalled recently. "I got divorced, I worked in the Air National Guard just to put food on the table."
"Now I have one major interest: I want to work for an airline that will still be around when I retire."
Eighteen months ago, many doubted United's buyout would assure its survival. Today, while the airline still has plenty of problems, the signs are encouraging. In the last year, the company's stock price has doubled, easily outpacing the industry's average. United's share of the market is rising, along with the revenue generated by each employee.
As the priorities of United's employee-owners changed, so has the corporate culture. Sick time is down 20 percent. Grievances filed by the pilots are down 75 percent. So are worker's compensation claims. And the unions, with a greater stake in corporate profits, are suddenly far more flexible about work rules. When the airline wanted to renegotiate with the pilots to allow round-the-world service, the talks took just two days.
Another telling statistic is that the list of pilots seeking jobs at United has swelled to more than 10,000, even though the airline now pays less than some of its biggest rivals.
The harmony at United may not last. Other employee-ownership experiments, as at Weirton Steel & Wire, have dissolved in bitter recriminations. And at United there are periodic rumblings of dissatisfaction. The company's new employees now work for lower starting pay and a somewhat smaller stake in the company than those who were around before the employee buyout, creating two classes of workers. Flight attendants, who elected to take no pay cuts and thus got no stake in the company, often complain that the "employee-owners" treat them just as the old managers did.
The real test will likely come when the airline industry moves into one of its cyclical downswings. The company will face pressure from Wall Street -- 45 percent of United shares are still publicly traded -- and in a few years union leaders will be negotiating contracts with their own representatives on the board, whose loyalties will be torn.
"There is nothing that insulates us from competitive realities in the long term," said Douglas Hacker, United's chief financial officer. "Can't be done."
 
Retraining
Everybody's first answer when seeking the best defense for workers in an uncertain economy is education and training. And few companies invest more in training than does the Intel Corporation, a maker of the microchips used in personal computers. It spends more than $120 million a year on training, or nearly $3,000 averaged across all of its workers, more than double the national average.
Growing and highly profitable, Intel is one of the exceptional companies that can afford the cost. But it is also a matter of survival. Few industries endure technological change as rapid as in the semiconductor business. Every two or three years, with each new generation of microprocessor, the company requires a new mix of skills.
So five years ago, Intel instituted a system so that its employees can be reprogrammed as fast as its chips. Craig Barrett, Intel's chief operating officer, speaks of the retraining program as "a corporate responsibility but also something that is very much in our long-term self-interest. We have good people and we want to keep them."
But Intel offers no guarantees. In the redeployment program, workers are given four months to shop for new jobs within the company. If a worker can't find a new job, he or she has to leave the company. The four-month timetable is not inflexible. An employee can work on engineering, production or management projects that last a few months, extending the deadline.
To date, 3,600 workers, or 86 percent of the people in the redeployment program, have found jobs within Intel. But much of the responsibility rests with the workers. "Our message to our employees is that they are responsible for gaining new skills so they can continue to be employable either inside or outside the company," said Dorinda Kettmann, in human resources.
Andy Linn has heard the message loud and clear. The former Marine was working the night shift for $4.50 an hour at a convenience store outside Portland, Ore., in 1988, when he landed a job at an Intel plant nearby. He started as a $15,000-a-year technician monitoring the acid baths in which silicon wafers are dipped as one step in the production of microchips.
Since then, Mr. Linn, now 33, has found one job after another at Intel, mainly on his own initiative. He has doubled his yearly income to $30,000, and Intel has paid for his continual training and education, including tuition at a community college and four-year university. His skills have progressed far beyond the acid baths to chip technology and the Internet. He is now a "concept engineer," scouting for new-product ideas at universities.
After eight years at Intel, he observed, "I work for a fine company and I work my butt off for Intel, but there isn't a lot of loyalty in the electronics industry."
His father, John, a union foreman, is retiring this year after 40 years at Portland General Electric. Mr. Linn views his father as an artifact. "I can't even imagine working for a company for that long, or having a company want me for that long," he said. "Man, this is the 90's."
 
Self-Reliance
A decade ago, Steve Jasik embraced the same ethos of self-reliance, weathered some tough times, and came out a winner. His story resounds with the lesson, heard again and again, that while government and business can do some things, in the end workers have little to fall back on but themselves.
Mr. Jasik is a tall, dark 52-year-old who looks younger than his years. He lives in a two-bedroom tract-style house in Menlo Park, Calif., modest only by the affluent standards of Silicon Valley. He makes nearly $200,000 a year these days -- enough to afford the college educations of his two children, a retirement nest egg and the red Corvette in his garage.
Yet in 1984 Mr. Jasik, a computer programmer, was a downsizing casualty waiting to happen. He worked in Silicon Valley for the Control Data Corporation, a producer of large computers. That fall, Control Data reported a big loss, beginning a long-running retrenchment that eliminated tens of thousands of jobs.
On his own, Mr. Jasik bought an early Apple Macintosh computer. The future, he was convinced, belonged to the personal computer.
So in early 1985, he left Control Data and started his own company with $4,000. He had an idea for a software program, a tool to be used by software developers to spot bugs in Macintosh programs. He was recently divorced, paying $1,100 a month in alimony. Mr. Jasik borrowed $5,000 from a friend and $2,000 from his mother.
"It was really scary," he recalled. "In the early months, it seemed like a disaster."
He came close, he says, to selling his house. Gradually, sales began picking up, and today Mr. Jasik enjoys prosperity.
But he still watches his dollars closely. His company remains a one-man operation, run from his computer-filled den. Being on your own, he says, teaches you to work hard, save, learn new skills, and be prepared to weather some lean times. "I live below my income, and I'm an advocate of that," he said. "Nothing is guaranteed for anybody anymore."
 
Quid Pro Quo
If technology is the familiar reason companies are forced to retrain workers, Deng Xiaoping is the reason of the future.
When China's paramount leader triggered the country's remarkable economic revival, his legions of industrial planners quickly learned to play hardball with American companies vying to get into the Chinese market. They started with the Boeing Company, which now sells one of every seven jets it produces to the People's Republic.
Beijing's new rules are simple: If you want to sell planes in China, you have to make a chunk of them in one of China's four vast aerospace factories, each staffed with 25,000 workers.
So starting a few years ago, David Clay and his colleagues in Boeing's giant production hangars in Seattle began watching with growing alarm as parts they once produced -- wing ribs and horizontal stabilizers and doors and tail sections -- began showing up at the factory in giant crates marked with Chinese characters. Most are produced by workers paid in one month what Mr. Clay makes in two-and-a-half hours -- about $50.
"We're turning out more planes today than ever before," said Mr. Clay, a 42-year-old mechanic who maintains the giant equipment that picks up 80-ton plane parts. "We're the country's greatest exporter. But does that mean there are more jobs here? No way. You want a job making Boeing airplanes? Move to Xian."
In fact, Boeing's managers point out, 85 to 90 percent of the content of their planes originates in the United States, far more "local content" than in many American cars. Nevertheless, the Xian conundrum is one of the stickiest -- and most politically sensitive -- obstacles to creating a "new economy" of companies with high-technology exports that, in President Clinton's oft-repeated phrase, can "compete and win in the global economy."
While export-related jobs are more stable and pay better than their domestic counterparts, the pressure to move more such jobs abroad has been unrelenting. China has proved enormously skilled at playing Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie of Europe against each other to get more jobs for its own workers, as well as better machine tools and more technology.
Alarmed that Boeing was sending so much work not only to China but also to many American contractors, workers like Mr. Clay demanded that this "outsourcing" slow dramatically. Boeing resisted fiercely, arguing that it is far better to let China produce part of a plane than lose a multibillion-dollar order. The unions held fast. "It's bit by bit by bit," George J. Kourpias, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said. "And with each piece, you lose another $20-an-hour job."
The dispute produced one of the most vituperative strikes in the company's history last year. But out of that came an accord that many believe could serve as an early model in the battle against downsizing. Boeing must now inform Mr. Clay and his fellow union members anytime more than 50 jobs will be threatened by moving work outside the company. The workers can make a counterproposal to keep the work in-house. And if the jobs do go, the workers who lost them must be retrained for another job -- though perhaps one with lower wages. They can be laid off only if a job cannot be found for them after retraining.
To some the Boeing agreement is a model of how unions can press for real commitments to retraining. But the strike ended without an answer to a fundamental question: Is Boeing's first loyalty to the employment of Americans, as it has long claimed? Or does the company serve the country better by maximizing its profits worldwide so that ultimately it can hire more workers, even if the price of global expansion is shipping some jobs abroad?
"This issue of loyalty has become very important," said Michael Sandel, a political philosophy professor at Harvard and author of "Democracy's Discontent," a forthcoming book. "When the economy was defined by a national market, and corporations had a national purpose, there was a sense that companies had a certain obligation to the nation. When they begin to redefine themselves as citizens of a global economy, the loyalty, the sense of citizenship and obligation, falls away."
 
Rethinking Attitudes
Abroad, especially in Japan and Europe, many companies see their obligations to employees very differently. If Kunio Motodate had been born American, he would almost certainly have been put out of work when competitive pressures forced his company, Nippon Steel, to close the blast furnace in Kamaishi where he once managed energy usage. Today he still works for Nippon Steel; only now he runs a factory making artificial meat out of soybeans.
That business "was set up to create job opportunities," the 59-year-old Mr. Motodate said. "Whether it was profitable or not was not the issue." Indeed, the food factory has never turned a profit.
Japanese executives are now quick to admit what they denied in the 1980's: that many of their employees are unnecessary. Often, they create unrelated businesses simply to keep workers on a payroll. And in other cases, companies keep on workers with largely ceremonial responsibilities, like the many department-store clerks who bow and shout polite greetings to customers.
These companies are willing to pay the price -- in lower profits, lower stock prices, even slower recoveries from a four-year recession -- because of a cultural expectation that they are there to provide jobs.
If that sounds odd to American ears, the downsizing craze in America sounds just as odd to Japanese. "We would be outcasts if we did what many American firms do," the head of one of Japan's major trading companies said recently.
And in fact, American companies once felt similar obligations. During the Great Depression, companies like Kellogg and Sears took steps that seem mind-boggling by the standards of corporate behavior today. They cut the length of the workweek by 25 percent so that they could keep as many employees as possible. Such moves reflected a different sense of national priorities, a recognition that sacrifice had to be distributed -- and that loyalty cut both ways.
Today, the Japanese example is not one that American executives, many of whom adoringly studied Japanese management in the 1980's, say they are interested in following. In the last few years, they say, Japan's full-employment practices have exacted a painful toll on the Japanese economy: low growth and continued high prices. Americans, they say, would not tolerate it.
And even in Japan, the Nippon Steel approach is becoming harder to find. More Japanese companies are quietly pressuring workers, particularly older ones, to "retire" early, denying them the lifetime security they thought they earned.
In fact, Mr. Motodate's food factory is now feeling pressure from Nippon Steel to become self-supporting. Employment in the factory, once as high as 125 people, is down to 90 workers and will be cut to about 70. But it is still all done by attrition. Layoffs would be a sign of corporate failure.
In Europe, too, businesses are feeling pressure to downsize like their American competitors. But like the Japanese, they face a cultural stigma. "You still cannot think about downsizing," said Carlo De Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti, the Italian electronics maker. "There is a cultural jump that needs to be made. Only the Germans are making it," he said, citing layoffs at Daimler Benz and elsewhere.
 
How Much to Pay the Boss
In Japan and many other nations, social pressure also restrains what top executives are paid. Chief executives at the biggest American companies are paid nearly six times their counterparts in Japan, and four times as much as German top executives, estimates Graef Crystal, a compensation consultant. In the United States, more than elsewhere, executives receive bonuses and stock options that become more valuable if a company's stock price rises.
Many people contend that American executives are overpaid -- and that they should share the pain in bad times, or when layoffs are made. "I'm sure the C.E.O.'s who lay off thousands feel remorse until they pull into their million-dollar homes or fly to Scotland to play golf," said Richard Meyer of White Plains in an electronic-mail comment on downsizing that was typical of many received by The New York Times this week.
Often cited is Robert E. Allen, chief executive of AT&T. Since 1986, AT&T has cut its work force by 125,000 people, but Mr. Allen's salary and bonus have increased fourfold, to $3.3 million. His salary and bonus was trimmed by $200,000 last year, but he was also awarded options worth $9.7 million.
AT&T's board says Mr. Allen is the best man to lead AT&T in the new era of deregulated telecommunications. But his critics point out that he also headed AT&T in 1990, when it bought the big computer company NCR for $7.5 billion. The NCR acquisition, AT&T eventually conceded, was all but a complete failure.
In such cases, critics say, the executives responsible should see their paychecks reduced sharply, not just a nominal 5 or 10 percent. "If you are going to lay off a lot of people, you should at least have the decency to cut your pay and cut it way down," Mr. Crystal said. "Be a man and bleed. Lead by example."
 
A Government Role
When Robert B. Reich began preaching several months ago about the need for "corporate responsibility," many in the Administration groaned. Several key members of the Cabinet, from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the National Economic Council, feared that he would be seen as vilifying corporations with his calls for "some soul searching." When he proposed that the tax code be rewritten to reward companies that promise to avoid layoffs in profitable times and give their employees a stake in the company, good medical coverage and broad retraining opportunities, Mr. Rubin's office quickly responded that Mr. Reich was talking about blue-sky ideas, not tax policy.
But in the Oval Office, Mr. Reich may be getting a hearing. Eager for ideas that both answer and capitalize on the anti-corporate chord that has propelled Patrick J. Buchanan's campaign for the Republican nomination, President Clinton has several times in recent days echoed his old friend's themes, even while stopping short of embracing his solutions.
"People are moving past the stage of denying that there is a problem," Mr. Reich said the other day. "We have a lot of people stranded in the old economy, and the transition costs of getting them into the new economy are too high. So who pays? Clearly, the government is constrained. The question is how we allocate these costs -- to the companies, to the workers, to the rest of us."
Some Republicans say the solution is simply more economic growth spurred by lower taxes and the end of Federal budget deficits. Steve Forbes's campaign is based on the notion that a rising tide will lift all workers. But the evidence of that during the most recent economic expansion has been scarce.
Mr. Buchanan has taken a radically different route, proposing tariffs on all Asian imports to encourage Americans to buy goods made here and to discourage American companies from moving their manufacturing abroad.
But these proposals all carry consequences. The tariffs invite retaliation on goods American companies export. And Mr. Reich's tax proposal raises the other questions. Who should judge what constitutes "good" corporate behavior? And should the Government, through its tax policy, be subsidizing companies that save jobs at the cost of national economic competitiveness?
Similar questions of standard-setting resonate through the debate over education. Few question that a better-educated workforce is critical if workers are to adjust to the modern economy, and today a college education seems the prerequisite for a growing income that a high school diploma was decades ago.
But that is the end of the common ground. Most discussion about how to change the nation's education system to make it more responsive to the modern economy -- setting far higher standards in math and science, lengthening the school year, and improving students' technological literacy -- gets bogged down in arguments over who should be setting the rules. During his campaign, Mr. Buchanan got some of his biggest cheers when he denounced "Goals 2000," the Clinton Administration's effort to create Federal education standards. And the White House has opposed even experimental efforts to provide vouchers to families that want help paying for education outside the public schools, fearing they could undercut public education.
A few executives, led by Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., have called for business to help force change by locating their operations in towns where states and local school districts institute high standards; presumably the rest of the country would then pour resources into education in hopes of attracting investment. But most executives say education is the province of the government, not the private sector.
 
Early Initiatives
Still, there are glimmers of political agreement. While Democrats and Republicans agree that most government-led worker retraining programs have been hopelessly out of touch with the needs of the market, there is growing applause for programs like the North Tennessee Private Industry Council, which turned a failing job-skills training effort into one that has found jobs for hundreds of women who were depending solely on welfare. Of 212 people retraining in the past several months, 166 now have jobs. Many were unemployed women or downsized textile workers, preparing for new jobs as receptionists or medical technicians.
There are also signs of movement in managing what Mr. Reich calls the "transition costs." Congress seems increasingly likely to pass legislation that would for the first time assure that workers losing their jobs do not also lose their health insurance. One bill, co-authored by Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, would require insurance companies to sell individual policies to workers who lost their group health coverage.
Then there is a potpourri of initiatives to make sure that workers propelled out of corporate America can take their assets with them. President Clinton has repeatedly called for "portable pensions" that would accompany workers through layoffs or job-switches. Typically, this would require companies to turn over a worker's pension as a lump sum for reinvestment.
But there is skepticism about the ability or will of government to find a solution. "The truth is that the big initiatives are going to have to start in the business world, and no one wants to face up to that," said Mr. Garten, the Yale dean. "They are hoping that this is some sort of cyclical problem that will go away. And it won't."
Mr. Garten questions whether, by their inaction, companies are courting a political backlash, one analogous to the political upheaval of the 1890's that forced the "robber barons" to break up their powerful trusts and submit to regulation.
"In the chaos of the 1890's it was impossible for anyone to foresee the big push for regulation of business, for education to make sure that people were literate, and other measures," said Brad DeLong, an associate professor at the University of California at Berkeley and formerly a senior Treasury Department official. "And yet that's what happened very quickly."
The debate about how American society can respond to the era of downsizing is just beginning. No one can say whether downsizing will remain an issue in the campaign, or whether Congress may act.
An easy way to dismiss the problem is that the number of jobs created last month reached its highest level since late 1983. But the new jobs more often than not do not pay as well as the ones that were lost.
Meanwhile, the odometer keeps clicking. On Monday, Fieldcrest Cannon, a textile maker, announced a plant closing that will cost 500 jobs. On Tuesday, Ralphs Grocery Store, a chain in Southern California, terminated 1,000 jobs. On Wednesday, the Ford Motor Company confirmed it would eliminate 6,000 engineering positions. On Thursday, Harley-Davidson, known for its export successes, said it would lay off 255 workers.
Counting only the layoffs prominent enough to show up in newspapers around the country, the consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported 15,962 workers have been cast out of their jobs in just the week since this series began.

HEADLINE: The Education Of an Insufferable Food Dilettante

BYLINE: By James Gorman; James Gorman is deputy science editor of The New York Times and author of "Ocean Enough and Time."

 BODY:
The first dish that I ever prepared from start to finish, not counting eggs over easy, was navarin printanier (lamb stew with spring vegetables) from Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking." I don't remember very well what it tasted like, but I do recall the thrill of reading a serious book about food. I had thought all recipes were written on index cards by my mother or her friends and stored in a little box in our kitchen.
I was amazed at the depth of knowledge and sense of history displayed in the book, and I was delighted by the discovery that there was intellectual as well as nutritional content to food. Consider, for instance, the gloss that "Ragout, navarin, and haricot all mean stew. Haricot according to most linguists is a corruption of halicoter, to cut up. It does not therefore mean a lamb stew with beans." Linguists, no less. 
 There is no snob like a young snob. "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" suggested to me that I might be able to invade the family kitchen and at the same time strike a blow for independence, not to say superiority. Stew, after all, in our house was made with beef, without benefit of linguistics. As to the pots and pans that were left in the wake of the navarin, my mother cleaned them up. All I have to say in my defense is that I was 19.
I have since discovered that in the world of food, the text is always the necessary companion to the meal -- least of all for the recipes. The real reason is that the literal taste of food in the mouth is only part of the pleasure of eating. There is taste in the broader sense, as it applies to style and class. Certainly one can have food without a social context, but not cuisine -- or conversation. I've always thought the main point of eating is not so much whether you know what you like but whether you can successfully argue for the superiority of your taste.
As my career as an insufferable food dilettante progressed, I did learn to clean up my own mess. I even learned to saute -- from Julia Child. Her tarragon chicken was my signature dish. From Marcella Hazan I learned to make vitello tonnato, which I love not only because of the way it tastes but because if you say it in English -- veal in tuna sauce -- no one will eat it.
I also dipped into food writing beyond cookbooks to help invent myself as a Manhattan restaurantgoer. From Seymour Britchky's reviews I developed the snobbery of being beyond snobbery. "During the first decade or so of its existence," he wrote, "the kitchen at Lutece turned out the best restaurant food obtainable in New York. At the same time, certain members of the dining room staff . . . did what they could to keep people from enjoying it." So that was why the captain sneered when I asked him about potage St.-Germain, and grunted, "Pea soup."
Calvin Trillin gave me another way of thinking about food by inventing the barbecue beat. With Trillin under my belt I could trump an intimidating haute cuisine fetishist with aggressive lowbrow talk of catfish, ribs and chili dogs. The role of reverse food snob, a sophisticate in redneck's clothing, was irresistible. I would insist, when I served ribs that I had cooked, with sauce that I had made, that the Stag's Leap chardonnay my guests had brought was nice, but if it was all the same to them I'd have a cold beer, a Labatt's Blue.
Only one writer could have rescued an eater this shallow. (Speaking of shallow, I am told that the French have no word for it. Peu profond, or "not very deep," is the closest they come.)
He is Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, whose 1825 book, "The Physiology of Taste," is an investigation of and a meditation on what he describes as the art and science of gastronomy. He says, correctly, that "the discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a star." He argues that gastronomy is part of natural history, physics, chemistry, cookery, business and political economy. "It rules over our whole life; for the cries of the newborn babe beg for his wet nurse's breast; and the dying man still receives with some pleasure his final potion, which, alas, it is too late for him ever to digest."
He writes of gobbling little birds whole, of his troublesome paunch, of the pleasure of watching a beautiful woman eating a beautiful meal. And he tells a good tale, like the story of the vicar of Bregnier, who, after the soup and boiled beef, ate a whole leg of mutton, a capon, a salad and a wedge of cheese, which he washed down with a bottle of wine and a carafe of water. All this in a noon meal that lasted about 45 minutes.
About the only thing Brillat-Savarin missed was the way kids eat. Little ones put the vicar of Bregnier to shame. When they hit adolescence they make Seymour Britchky seem warmhearted. I doubt Brillat-Savarin ever persuaded a child to eat an egg over easy. That's right. I can not only cook, I can cook for children. Yo! Jean Anthelme! Eat your heart out!
So Brillat-Savarin did not save me from shallowness. One can't expect miracles. "The Physiology of Taste" can still lift food snobs, dilettantes, even, God help them, wine bores (yes, I was one of those too) to a higher plane, or plate. As Brillat-Savarin writes, in a simple and true rebuke to anyone who doubts the value of attention paid to food, "Good living is an act of intelligence, by which we choose things which have an agreeable taste rather than those which do not."

Do Computers Eat Our Paychecks?

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
UNTIL JUST THE other day, I thought the computer had greatly enhanced my life and income and, despite some obvious dislocations, those of most other Americans as well. I'm no longer so sure. Computers may also be exacerbating our social problems by depressing most wages. I wish the politicians and the media would devote some of this year's election debate to examining that possibility.
For nearly two decades, computers have let me set my own type, cutting out the linotypists, proofreaders and compositors who used to turn my words into lead impressions. These congenial colleagues gradually retired and I assumed that the money the company saved was shared with the surviving work force, me included, and with readers, advertisers and shareholders. 
Computers have also let me charge my telephone calls from anywhere with no more interruptions by insistent operators demanding unpredictable amounts of coins at inconvenient stages of the conversation. I've assumed that their transformation into digitized voices has greatly reduced the cost of everyone's phone calls and that the former operators now operate profitable answering services in the comfort of their Nebraska homes.
Computers have been depositing my paychecks directly in the bank and enabling me to extract $20 bills from armless ATM bandits on street corners. The disappearance of paymasters and tellers, I assume, has held down the cost of my banking.
And now I have learned to deliver all my tedious tax compilations to a computer instead of an accountant. I've assumed that the accountant is happily rid of my boring business and doing twice as well with the accounts of computer companies.
You get the picture: I'm no Luddite. All my life, I have been convinced that technology makes life not only easier but also more productive. And I've been sure that greater productivity meant greater wealth that would be fairly spread among all of us. I knew, of course, that computers, like other new machines, would kill jobs, but I assumed they would turn right around and create more and better jobs in the next business cycle. No reason to fear computers, except maybe if you were a chess champion.
Well, I'm having some second thoughts. In the grand millennial sweep of things, my faith in technology will probably be vindicated. But for living generations of Americans, the combination of computing power and market freedom seems to be yielding a toxic result: an undesirable maldistribution of wealth. As even politicians have begun to notice, wage earners have been getting poorer for 20-odd years while the incomes of top executives and big-time investors have soared.
For a time, Democrats blamed the oil cartel and Ronald Reagan's tilted tax reduction; Republicans blamed Government spending and welfare cheats. More recently, union leaders and radical nativists have blamed low wages on cheap foreign labor and illegal immigrants. Moderate conservatives blame the Federal debt. Moderate liberals blame corporate greed. Everybody prays for faster economic growth -- and the tax cuts that are alleged to produce it. But significant growth in recent years has failed to reverse the trend. A 10 percent increase in the productivity of private business since 1990 has not helped wage earners. Alan Greenspan, the hardly radical chairman of the Federal Reserve, warns that income inequality could become a "major threat" to American society.
THERE IS PROBABLY NO SINGLE explanation for this wage depression. But I am impressed by suggestions that computers are partly to blame. Computers have enriched a small class of technological wizards and management consultants who streamline production, merging and "downsizing" and "re-engineering" the companies of America to the great benefit of managements and stockholders. But those same computers have eliminated many jobs and significantly reduced the skills needed in the jobs that survive, thereby weakening the bargaining power and income of most wage earners.
The evidence of this trend, in both manufacturing and service industries, was provocatively summarized last month in The New York Review of Books by Simon Head, a dispassionate British economic analyst. He challenged not only the conventional political scapegoating but also my blind faith that the computer will quickly bestow its blessings upon us without any significant Government intervention.
Head argues that the computer has so simplified production that manufacturers are continuing to dispense with many categories of skilled labor, reducing the wages of the workers they retain and increasingly "contracting out" production to independent, lower-wage companies. Once-powerful unions like the United Auto Workers have been left virtually helpless to resist the trend or share in its benefits.
An analogous tendency can now been seen in the service industries, which employ 80 percent of America's wage earners. The tellers and loan officers at my bank, the middle-management accountants at the office, the expert buyers at department stores and the experienced assistant managers at hotels are being laid off or having their jobs dumbed down. Workers once valued, and paid, for their skills, judgment and experience are being replaced by computers or computerized functions.
Computers are creating more wealth all right, but it is shared mainly by stockholders, top managers and what Felix Rohatyn calls a "new technological aristocracy" -- including the media moguls who dominate political conversation. Of course, even if they contribute to a deplorable re-allocation of wealth, computers don't ordain it. But the market alone seems unable to correct the distortion.
Some union leaders have recognized their impotence and called on government to help restore the balance of power between employers and employees, as it did in the 1930's. But unions are also politically weak, not least because many service workers don't think of themselves as a laboring class. And paradoxically, the workers now being hired for relatively simple computing skills think of themselves as technologically empowered at the very moment they are being economically enfeebled. E-mail won't pay the rent.
Having just awakened to the complexity of this phenomenon, I don't pretend to know the answer, or even the right questions. Neither does the Government. As Simon Head observes, the "retraining" of workers that President Clinton advocates can help some people find new jobs, but it won't raise the income of the incoming labor force. The maldistribution of wealth might be mitigated if companies were required, at the least, to pay the cost of making workers' pensions and health insurance portable, or to pay the taxes that enable government to bear the cost.
First, however, the serious media have to focus on the problem and track down its causes. Then maybe we can feed better data into the computers and use them to allay the unhappiness they seem to be causing.

HEADLINE: Amigo Cantisano's Organic Dream

BYLINE: By Verlyn Klinkenborg; Verlyn Klinkenborg writes frequently about agriculture. His last article for the Magazine, "A Farm Farewell," appeared in June.

 BODY:
IT'S EARLY JANUARY, AND TODAY, NEAR Auburn, Calif., in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the sun is too warm to be seasonable, the blue sky washed by remnants of early-morning fog. Three weeks ago, after a dry autumn, a major winter storm blew across the north-central section of the state. As the storm moved eastward, its force began to wane, but not before it visited this small grove of olive trees 120 miles northeast of San Francisco, harvesting them with uncanny and unwelcome thoroughness. The ground here is purple with ripe olives unprofitably leaching their oil onto the roots of last year's olive seedlings.
"Nature bats first and last," Amigo Bob Cantisano says. He is kneeling in cool shade, his bare knees and fingers stained purple. He raises his triangle hoe, a kind of hand adz, and drives it into the earth beside a seedling with smooth opposed leaves. The soil within this canopied garden is light and friable and falls away readily as Amigo -- it seems inamicable to call him by anything but his nickname -- lifts the seedling and sets it in a small plastic pot on a flat full of pots. A few yards away, Scot Woodland, Amigo's business partner, digs at a faster pace, gathering seedlings that will be bedded for another year, then planted in other groves. Amigo is talking as well as transplanting, and when thoughts begin to crowd about him, his arms grow still. "So much work just to have it all fall on the ground," he says, dislodging another shoot. "Agriculture!" he exclaims, in mock apostrophe to that bountiful but fickle deity. 
 Amigo Cantisano is 44 and bluffly built, the result, genetics aside, of 23 years of farming. His appearance and manner are disarming only if you think you know what a farmer should look like and how he should behave. Long black hair falls down Amigo's back, and he tends to animate, in a pliant, husky voice, the stories he tells. In conversation he can be openly skeptical, but he's a pragmatically cheerful man. By almost invisible stages he has become one of the most important figures in California organic agriculture. He has had an enormous impact on wine grape growers in the Napa Valley, at wineries like Sutter Home and Frog's Leap and E. & J. Gallo, helping them adopt organic practices. It is among the farmers who seek Amigo's advice, who worry over soils and crops and marketing with him, that the future of American agriculture is being deciphered.
In 1973 Amigo became one of the founding members of California Certified Organic Farmers. He helped start the Committee for Sustainable Agriculture, which sponsors the Ecological Farming Conference held every January in Pacific Grove, Calif., one of the most important annual events in the world of organic farming. In the late 1980's he created a company called Organic Ag Advisors and began consulting with farmers, large and small, all along the West Coast and in Arizona, Central America and Hawaii, sometimes helping them convert entirely from conventional agriculture to organic farming, sometimes helping them add organic practices to otherwise conventional operations. "I get paid to get educated," Amigo says. "We set up trials, do research on farms, try out new ideas. My main job is to get my clients to rethink the problem of soil fertility. How are we going to get to fertility without buying fertilizer? How are we going to get to pest control without buying pesticides? We've forgotten that fertility is inherent and just needs managing."
There's something, too, in the shape of Amigo's career -- in his transformation from consumer to farmer to adviser -- that reflects a broader shift, still being painfully negotiated, in the consciousness of Americans, a growing awareness of the social, cultural and environmental dimensions of every item in the market basket. When I was growing up in the late 50's and early 60's, food seemed to be merely about the nutrient load it was capable of carrying. It was an atomic vision of food -- storehoused, canned, vacuum-sealed, archived for the day the bombs went off and it came in handy.
But Americans are looking for different kinds of essences these days. Although the number of certified organic growers nationwide is very small -- about 0.2 percent of farms, according to the Department of Agriculture -- the organic food market is one of the fastest-growing sectors of American agriculture. In the last eight years the number of organic growers in California has nearly doubled, while the certified organic acreage planted with field crops and fruits and nuts in California more than doubled between 1990 and 1994. According to Natural Foods Merchandiser, a trade journal for natural foods stores, the organic market has grown "well over 20 percent annually since 1989." Some of the largest increases have been in sales of produce, especially in supermarket-format stores, and in exports -- largely to Japan -- which were up some 80 percent from 1993 to 1994.
One major reason for this rapid growth is, of course, a concern for health. But the other major reason is quality. Food is no longer solely about its nutrient cargo. It is about the place food comes from, about what growing, harvesting and eating it are like, and about what else is nourished in the process. The industrial food my generation grew up eating (still available at your local supermarket!) may have been mechanically complex at every stage -- sowing, cultivating, harvesting, processing, packaging, shipping -- but it was grown in a palette of soils that are becoming, under the burden of modern farm chemicals, biologically simple, dangerously deprived. Amigo's life work has been to help recover the complexity of farming, the complexity of the earth itself.
"EVEN THOUGH THIS GROVE DOESN'T YIELD very well, and the olives fall on the ground, I love this place," Amigo says, as his hoe bites again, unearthing another seedling. "The other groves we harvest have an economic potential. This one has a passion potential. This is the romantic one." What makes it romantic is the taste of its oil -- what Amigo calls "this intense green flavor, new-mown lawn."
"There are 600 named varieties of olives around the world, but a lot of the names are synonyms," Amigo says. "It's hard to tell how many varieties there really are." He calls the type littering the ground here Saracena, though at least one of the people he has shown it to thinks it may be a Nicoise. They're small olives, scarcely bigger than the pit of a large variety like the Sevillano, and they sprout well from seed. They yield about half as much oil as other olives do, and their oil contains more wax. It clouds readily in cool temperatures, and its flavor seems especially responsive to climatic shifts.
The Gold Hill Orchard, where these olives grow, lies not far from the site of the first gold-mining settlement in Placer County, and its trees were planted sometime between 1905 and 1915. It is one of six historic olive orchards being managed by the small Aeolia Organic Olive Company, whose only full-time employee is Scot Woodland and whose spiritual and technical director is Amigo Cantisano. Like all the orchards they lease, this one was badly overgrown, just another vestige of a moribund industry in the foothills northeast of Sacramento, a region that was abandoning agriculture and rapidly subdividing.
"In Placer County in the 30's there were six operating oil mills," Amigo says. "By the 70's there was one, and it closed in 1974 or '75." Because of higher labor costs, California olive producers couldn't compete on the international bulk oil market with Italy and Spain or Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia, whose oils are often sold under Italian and Spanish trademarks. "But we saw that there was a niche coming for specialty oils," Amigo says, "and organic oil is one part of that niche." Its value has only been enhanced by recent medical reports stressing the health benefits of a Mediterranean diet, a main component of which is olive oil.
The word Amigo has used most often in my presence is "inspired," a word I'm not accustomed to hearing in farmers' mouths. And when Amigo talks about being inspired, he's likely to be talking about Felix Gillet, a Frenchman who arrived in Nevada City, Calif., 30 miles north of the Gold Hill Orchard, in 1859, when he was 24. There Gillet, who came from a family of nurserymen, opened a barbershop and began importing plants.
"One of his visions," Amigo says, "was that the foothills" -- where gold was the ruling passion -- "could become productive orchard lands. He imported the first almonds, the first walnuts, the first plums, the first chestnuts. He got the Willamette Valley in Oregon started on filberts." Gillet, who died in 1908, also helped start a silk industry in the foothills by promoting the planting of 170,000 mulberry trees, whose leaves are the sole food of silkworms, in Nevada and Placer Counties.
Amigo has continued some of Gillet's work. Ten years ago he began a census of chestnut trees in the Sierra Nevada foothills. He and his friends collected nut samples from 275 trees, most of them nearly a century old. During three successive harvests, they sampled nuts for taste, peelability and size. Then they selected the five best varieties, propagated them and gave saplings to 60 people, who altogether planted more than 4,000 trees, which at maturity will each yield 200 to 300 pounds of nuts, with virtually no care.
In this story there are two things worth noticing. One is Amigo's almost uncanny ability to find a business where no one suspected a business was hiding. The other is the cooperative, community-based nature of his work. These have been hallmarks of his career from its inception -- Earth Day 1970. "I realized we could talk a lot about the environment, but really what the environment needed was care," he says. "Agriculture seemed like a way to be involved in the environment and do positive things and also potentially make a living, raise a family." The next year Amigo walked into a health food store in Tahoe City, Calif. "I kinda went, 'You know, this isn't exactly what I would think of as the most direct way to buy food from farmers.' " So he began a food-buying club, which before long became a storefront food co-op called We the People on the north shore of Lake Tahoe. That, in turn, spawned a natural foods bakery and a wholesale distribution business.
IN 1973 AMIGO, WHO GREW UP IN SAN Francisco and had never farmed, got the chance, with his future wife, Kalita Todd, to raise organic vegetables on six acres owned by friends near Yuba City. "So we started planting," he says. "Learned how to drive a tractor. Made some horrendous mistakes. I liked the challenge. I loved getting out and growing stuff. It was like a rebirth. It was amazing to be able to grow something and get it to a finished, harvestable stage and put it into a box and put our label on it and send it to the food co-op."
It so happened that Amigo began looking for organic solutions to a pest called the walnut-husk fly at the same time that entomologists from the University of California at Davis were looking for an organic test plot, still a rarity in the mid70's. "So I became a test plot," Amigo says -- a metaphor that describes his working life almost perfectly. "At the time, most people thought of organic farming as just letting nature take its course. I learned that there were proactive things you could do that were environmentally responsible but were also successful. We tried traps using ammonium carbonate and molasses. We became one of the first test plots to use beneficial nematodes. We actually made it work. We took that orchard from 90 percent infestation to like a 10 percent infestation in one year."
Amigo began to gather the missing information base for California's organic farmers. "I became a vacuum cleaner for that kind of stuff. I walked into every office in the university's entomology department and introduced myself and asked them, 'What kind of alternative work are you doing?' " After moving up to the foothills in 1976 he opened a small organic-farm-supply business in the back of his barn. That grew into Peaceful Valley Farm Supply, which Amigo sold in 1989. Today Peaceful Valley publishes a 128-page catalogue -- still mostly written by Amigo -- full of tools, beneficial insects, natural pest-management products and, especially, natural fertilizers, many of which he first developed.
At Peaceful Valley, Amigo realized that what he enjoyed most was the time he spent visiting farms. The solution was Organic Ag Advisors.
"It's not like I went out to become a farm adviser," he says. "It's that there was virtually nobody else doing this. The reason farmers hire me is that I might cut six months or a year off the learning curve and help them save money at the same time. One of my goals is to minimize the use of off-farm inputs, organic or chemical, as much as possible. So a lot of the work I do with people is figuring out how to make composts, how to do it inexpensively so they don't have to buy as much fertility from off the farm. I'm just thrilled to hang around with the group of farmers I hang around with. These are some of the most brilliant people I know. They could be rocket scientists if they chose to be. They love the work, they love being outside, they love the plants, they love feeding people. They redefine the image of farming."
Jack Pandol Jr. is the undersecretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, and he works with Pandol & Sons, the family farm near Delano, Calif., where Amigo has been a consultant since 1989. Pandol & Sons primarily grows table grapes, using conventional and organic practices.
"Amigo doesn't have a college degree," Pandol says. "I have a degree in viticulture from UC Davis, one of the best ag schools in the country, and I learn from him all the time. He's self-taught, and he's a tremendous observer. He's bridged over to the conventional farm community to help conventional farmers reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizer. We learned a lot from Amigo about soil nutrition, cover-cropping, composting and about the relation between the balance of minerals and nutrients in the soil and plant health, a plant's ability to resist pests and disease. From what he taught us, we found that there's an economic return. We didn't spend less on materials -- we spent more, at first -- but we improved the quality of our products."
IT'S AFTERNOON, AND WE'VE MOVED TO A GROVE of olives called the Golden Bear Orchard because it rises from the banks of the Bear River, a tributary of the Sacramento. This is rolling, dry pasture studded with olive trees, and in the distance, the high, pale ridge of the Sierra Nevada is visible. In the mid-19th century this land was part of the Johnson Rancho, one of the first places settlers chanced upon as they descended from the mountains. The olive trees in this orchard were once evenly planted, but many of them were dug up and moved to Sacramento housing developments during the 60's and 70's -- a historically null fate for these historic trees. Red-tail hawks circle above us, and bluebirds cluster on a power line over the highway. We cross a barbed-wire fence. The trees around us are dark with olives: Missions, Sevillanos, Frantoios, Nevadillos. The Nevadillos, especially, seem to have been dredged in some purple dust until they look almost like giant Concord grapes. "Hey, we got a crop here!" Amigo shouts. A small herd of cattle begins to drift away. These olives will go to the press within days.
Spending the morning amid a ruined olive harvest made me wonder why this man grows olives. "I'm really committed to having fun in life," Amigo says. "Nobody makes enough money in agriculture just to do it for that. It's too hard a work to be sour. I was just dying to get back to growing things. I like to get my fingers dirty. I still like doing farm advising, but I'd rather be a grunt any day." It's a simple answer, a joke and a truth at once. But I had also been presented with answers to that question all day long, in the taste of the oil, in the sight of Amigo and Scot Woodland performing the most basic of agricultural tasks, kneeling in an orchard, parting the earth with their hand tools.
The complexity of olive oil becomes more evident the more simply it is presented. Olive oil is like wine in that regard: you are consuming the place, the microclimate, the character of the soil and, too, the character of the human who has produced it, the care with which it has been handled and pressed. And something of the same relation prevails in farming. The simplest methods often reveal the greatest complexity. The word "organic" still seems to imply, falsely, that something has been left out of the growing process, that a farmer merely surrenders to nature in order to produce a crop whose virtue is the absence of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. "The best of organic farmers have to be highly skilled," Amigo says as we drive back across the foothills. "I mean this is not a low-tech system. You have to plan for things, you have to take actions way in advance of what the guys with the chemicals do."
While we were walking through the Gold Hill Orchard that morning, slipping on the olives underfoot, it occurred to me to ask Amigo -- who is producing, after all, an expensive specialty-food product -- how we were going to feed the world. Amigo put down his hand hoe. "We're not going to feed the rest of the world, I'll say that. I think we can only feed the group that we can feed economically. Where the rest of the world can get fed, though, is with foods that are being produced conventionally but can be farmed organically at virtually the same cost. The other place where people can keep costs down is by dealing direct -- at farmers' markets. You see a lot of lower-income people shopping at farmers' markets because that gives them an opportunity to get quality, freshness and a reasonable price."
As I listened to Amigo, I realized that my question had contained a false, half-hidden assumption -- that the world can be fed only with processed food, Government cheese -- and that it was based on the wrong syntactical model. The question isn't how do we feed the world, but how do we all feed ourselves. The vision of agriculture that will sustain a world is necessarily a complex one. It includes, as it has for millenniums, oil pressed from olives grown organically in small groves, and it includes, for the moment, tank cars filled with corn oil moving in trainloads across horizon-wide, chemically fertilized cornfields. Both crops are staples. The conflict between the way they are grown may one day turn out to be nothing more than a historic anomaly, though it often takes a person of Amigo's persistent cheerfulness to believe that agriculture is headed in the right direction.

HEADLINE: The Theory Of Supermarkets

BYLINE: By Jack Hitt; Jack Hitt is a contributing editor of Harper's Magazine. His last article for this Magazine, "How a Pilgrim Progresses," recounting a personal pilgrimage in Spain, appeared in August 1994.

 BODY:
Is it possible even to describe the otherworldly rush and animal wonder one feels on entering the modern supermarket? The journey is transforming, beginning with that blast of unnatural wind -- the chilly zephyr in summer, the dragon's breath in winter -- that conducts us through the automatic portals into this highly ordered yet voluptuous realm. It is, on some level, our greatest achievement. The painted cinder blocks of the average Food Lion are the true heirs to the walls of Jericho, built to protect the earliest stores of wheat and strike the first blow for post-nomadic culture.
At the height of his power, Charlemagne would have been hard pressed to stock even one middling Piggly Wiggly, and in just the last 10 years, the stock at the average supermarket has almost doubled to 30,000 products. To lay out a store these days that isn't baffling, graduate schools now produce a hybrid architect -- the supermarket designer -- whose sole task is to shape these items into a landscape that lures us in at the beginning, moves us about in some mysterious way and sends us back out the door. Not long ago, I spent an afternoon in the just-completed Super Stop & Shop in Hamden, Conn., struggling to discern the contours of this new narrative journey. 
 I confess to a supermarket jones. I go to them. I stand in them. I wander around in that singular alpha state triggered by those automatic doors and sustained by a hallucinogenic sea of primary colors. I like to fondle fruits and examine vegetables. I admit to a savannas-of-Africa high upon seeing slabs of meat along the length of a wall. I like to stare down dead fish nested in ice. I contemplate new offerings of foodlike substances. Frozen spicy popcorn shrimp, for example, lofted me into a state of pure Zen abstraction. But for this trip, I approached my supermarket with an open mind, note pad in hand, as clear of my culture's prejudices as an anthropologist on safari.
The doors open.
The vision at first reveals a cornucopia: tables of bright fruit and vegetables spilling out into a lascivious spread. Most supermarkets begin with produce; others open with flowers. The idea is to introduce the consumer into a realm of freshness and crispness, of color and beauty.
The array of tables and stalls leading around the perimeter means to transport the visitor to a European open market. In one counter headlined "Fresh From Around the World" there is a bewildering choice of produce: coquito, quince pear, gold tamarillo, cherimoya, carambola, horned melon, monstera and pepino melon. The mushroom bins are filled with portobello, cimini, button, oyster and shiitake. A rack of oils and vinegars features every combination of flavoring with dill or rosemary or tarragon. Cheerful clerks amble to and fro in color-coordinated aprons -- yellow for pantry, blue for seafood, classic white for meat.
But if one stands still long enough, the sensual experience begins to ebb and feel hollow. Why is it that the butchers have no blood on their white aprons? They stand behind their cases trimming tidy bits of fat from presliced meats before sealing them in plastic trays. A little rubbernecking reveals that the more rugged butchery is going on in the back, far behind this public staging area.
The same can be said for the fishmongers. There is not a single wayward scale on their sea blue aprons. And here is something especially weird: the fishmongers' stall doesn't stink. In fact, the entire store lacks an aroma. Every piece of meat and fish is hermetically sealed. The presliced pepperonis are spread on a piece of cardboard like a winning poker hand, then vacuumed in a skin of plastic. Back at produce, there is another sign, dangling between the "Fresh" and "Organic," advising that all the fruits and vegetables are dipped in a prophylactic of "Food grade vegetable-petroleum-beeswax or Lac-Resin-based Wax or Resin to maintain freshness." I plant my face in a tilted table of red apples. It smells like wood.
Only occasionally, when the pantry department opens the door to the rotating broiled chickens, is one corner of the store perfumed with anything reminiscent of food. Otherwise, the aroma is of containers. In an age of safe sex, this is safe food. Perhaps the designers suspect that a common olfactory experience would be perceived as too threatening, too ethnic, too political. Better to keep each single piece of fruit, each cut of sirloin, each fillet of mahi-mahi individually wrapped.
Another revelation becomes clear if you stand long enough. The great show of choice is mostly show. From time to time, I notice a few folks that marketers know as "innovators" -- bohemians in black, a gourmand with attitude -- considering the cherimoya or quince pear and then actually buying one. But most people passed on by and simply grabbed the five-pound bag of Florida navels or the discount sack of Macintosh apples.
Despite the colored aprons and bright awnings, the supermarket still pushes the majority toward some very familiar victuals. The folks who sailed past the charming displays of forest mushrooms, mountain coffees and foreign spices appeared happy to see them. But the luxury of feeling consumed by that blizzard of choice only gained its pleasure from the security of not having to make one. Sure, here is a cooler overflowing with cheeses from every valley. But around the corner is a monster display of the old standards -- cheddar, American, Swiss, mozzarella -- hung in handy packets. I counted about 75 hooks with different cheese options, mostly permutations in size, all pregrated and treated to maintain "freshness."
THE SUPERMARKET LAYOUT IS A CHAOTIC opera of flattery, designed to make you feel that you are a chef picking over the finest in meats, the most delicate in fresh leafy greens, the best in imported condiments. But the theorists behind this design know your heart. You are tired, or melancholy with your career, or grumpy with piles. You are dazed and confused. The displays soothe you with a wealth of options even as your cart fills with hamburger meat and iceberg lettuce, prepared cake mixes and, well, O.K., maybe that new popcorn shrimp appetizer you've heard about.
The mission of the supermarket, like everything in our culture, is supposedly dedicated to one end: choice. But it is not your choice; rather it is the retailer's. It turns out that each inch of space is scientifically calibrated to hold only what you will buy at the highest possible margin. I went back to find out what the supermarket designers know. Instead of coming upon a Frank Lloyd Wright of the A.&P. set imagining new palaces of food, I found that the supermarket has been subjected to an absurd level of scientific inquiry: complex experiments regarding display, observational studies of human movement and intricate work on the effects of lighting, color and music. The reason NASA is troubled these days may be that our Einsteins are occupied with the follow-up research to "Asymmetric Cannibalism in Retail Assortments." I read that article to prepare for this one, although it wasn't nearly as informative as "Shelf Management and Space Elasticity."
Perhaps you thought, as I did, there was only one postulate in the wide, wide world of supermarket theory: put milk at one end and bread at the other to force the shopper to trek the length of the place. Friend, that was eons ago. For you to comprehend supermarket theory, first know how well supermarket theory comprehends you.
You are probably female, although increasingly male. You shop 2.2 times per week in a supermarket (according to one of shopping's many think tanks -- the Coca-Cola Research Council). A mere 31 percent of you arrive at the supermarket with a list. But it doesn't matter: only one-third of your purchases are planned. The others, which are nearly as predictable, are sometimes called "splurchases." As such, the supermarket fills those long shelves, or "gondolas," with its 30,000 items (handsomely known in the jargon as "stock keeping units," or S.K.U.'s).
Other experiments show that if the layout encourages you to turn your cart one direction, you will look the other way, into the "strong side"of the turn. There, a cunning grocer will place what seems to be a good deal (but is not). The entire motive of the layout is to "push" you into making approaches or "shots" at a display or "facing." Other notorious locations in the supermarket landscape include the "in-aisle gondolas" (chances are you are being robbed there) or "endcaps" (same chances, because sales there are five times what they are on normal shelves).
If background music is slowed from a lively allegro of 108 beats per minute to a simple adagio of, say, 60 beats, then the speed of the average buggy slows, more shots are taken and purchases soar. Sales have been measured to increase by 38.2 percent -- a truth that, as any ambitious bag boy would know, is found in R. E. Milliman's groundbreaking study, "Using Background Music to Affect the Behavior of Supermarket Shoppers."
Typically you blink 32 times a minute. But after wafting through those automatic doors, science shows that you really do slip into a druglike narcosis, a groggy 14 blinks a minute -- fairly constant -- until you get in line at the cash register, when your mind resumes its fully conscious tempo. Blinkage may vary, however, depending on the "need state" that possesses you when you enter. According to one study, there are four of these: dieting, economizing, indulging and impressing guests.
Consumer attention is "malleable," according to the researchers who investigated "space elasticity," and whose study sought to "parameterize a model that allows us to compute an upward bound on the returns that might accrue to an 'optimal' shelf set."
What does that mean? I'm not sure. But in the course of parameterizing, the authors learned that you buy more soup if it is shelved out of alphabetical order. How much? If alphabetized, sales drop exactly 6 percent. Toothbrushes, if placed at eye level, will increase in sales by 8 percent -- no more, no less. Apparently, "shoppers process store schemas in spatial as opposed to analytical form."
According to this research, cereal arranged by type (flakes, brans) rather than brand will fall 5 percent in sales. With roughly 150 brands competing for shelf space, cereal is a rugged neighborhood. One common strategy deployed by retailers is the use of "flankers." These are simple variations of the highly profitable name brands -- either outsize box shapes or slightly altered flavors, created by preceding the named brand with words like "Apple Cinnamon" or "Honey Nut." The "new" products are dispatched to stand at the shoulders of the name brand. Their mission is to sop up precious shelf space and complicate any effort on your part to make a visible price comparison with the competing companies' flagship brands.
Other research shows that for each single minute beyond the 107.8 minutes averaged in a supermarket, you will spend an extra $1.89, not a penny more or less. As many as 95 percent of the shoppers who sample a product in the store will then buy it. The average "eye height" of a woman is 59 inches; a man's is 64 inches. And because the best viewing angle is 15 degrees below the horizontal (discovered by Eastman Kodak's think tank), the choicest elevation on any aisle has been measured at 51 to 53 inches off the floor. On average, when you examine a shelf, you like to stand four feet away.
Obviously, every wholesaler is interested in locating the best and worst position ("the maxima and minima of the polynome over-the-shelf domain"), unless you are talking about refrigerated juice counters. That's practically a separate polynome kingdom because juice is located in "a special horizontal bin at the bottom of refrigeration cases, about two feet above floor level, where consumers must lift the product up rather than pull it off the shelf."
Lift rather than pull. There's an entire shelf management Ph.D. thesis in those words.
The reason we have much of this raw data is a new technology noted by most Americans in the early 80's when it became widespread and by George Bush some five years later. "The Universal Price Code scanner put the retailer in charge," said Richard Rauch, a supermarket theorist and designer at Long Island University. "That device tells the retailer what customers are buying, when they are buying, at what price they are buying."
And, in the near future, the data collection will become even more sophisticated: not long ago, the shopping-cart company Unarco announced that some of its carts would feature "promotronics" -- a computerized screen that ostensibly will alert shoppers of nearby deals or new products. But it will also generate a map of each cart's journey, collecting data about which shot at what facing yielded which S.K.U. purchase.
BEFORE SCANNERS, THE POWER IN A STORE was held by the wholesaler, say, Campbell's Soup. Such brand-name companies were the only ones who knew what sold and moved, judging upon shifts in warehouse inventory. So Campbell's Soup could tell the retailer that Turkey With Noodle was hot this month, and relying on trust alone, the retailers responded. Now the power to know has been delivered into the hands of the grocers. An Age of Reason has overtaken the Days of Faith.
With such knowledge and given that 17,000 new products compete for space every year, retailers have found another source of profits. A typical store chain now routinely charges wholesalers "slotting allowances" -- ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 -- to locate one new product in a good facing on a popular shelf in a hip neighborhood at the right height. (The Federal Trade Commission is currently considering whether these fees constitute anti-trust violations and require formal regulation.)
Some of the more powerful wholesalers boast that they won't even consider paying slotting allowances. But almost everyone introducing a new product must do so. Some store chains have reportedly gone the way of petty tyrants, charging the old-timers "pay to stay" fees just to hang on to their positions. Otherwise, they might be exiled to floor level to be kicked around by adults and pawed by children, or dispatched to the ethereal realm of the top of the shelf where products sit like totems until dust requires their replacement. The cigarette manufacturers have surrendered completely and signed what are described as "long term 'rent' agreements" for their squalid tenement racks at the cash register.
At the end of the day, any store manager can employ software programs with names like "Spaceman" to crunch this information toward one end: to create a landscape intended to wring the most splurchases from each shopper. The plans that emerge from this warehouse of data range from inexplicable buzzwords to fully developed schemes. One peppy theory calls for reimagining the supermarket as a "servicescape." Meanwhile, the doctrine of "category management" comes with manuals, graduate schools full of tenured adherents and algorithms that will generate architectural specifics.
But not everything can be reduced to U.P.C. quantifiables. There are matters of taste involved, especially in lighting. You may have missed the 1995 Retail Store of the Year Awards presented by Chain Store Age Executive magazine, but in the competition for Best Supermarket, the winner was (cue the timpani) Kessel Premier from Flint, Mich. What really swung the judges, apparently, was the contemporary color scheme: "Teal and mauve accents against vanilla-colored walls lend an upscale touch to Kessel's traditional value price image. The subdued colors are dramatically contrasted with patterned tile floors set with bold borders. Lighted highway billboard-styled graphics complete the American ambiance."
Still, science is making discoveries even here. One esthetic theory holds that East Coast stores should dabble in "gray, turquoise and salmon" because "the sun rises over the water, giving the environmental colors a soft hue." Western stores should play with "hot pink and purple," because "the sun rises over the desert, giving the environmental colors a hot look." All of these hues are meant to transport you into a place of chromatic familiarity, a "high comfort level," for the same reason that the music is slowed down: rather than try to rouse us from our coma, the soothing pastels and assuaging complexion seek to keep us in our drowsy 14-blink, 60-beat state. Slowly. More slowly. More time. More purchases. Slowly, now. Frozen spicy popcorn shrimp. Sleepy, now. More slowly.
COMPARE SUCH CALCULATED SOMNOLENCE with the typical frenzy found in a real European market, say, La Boqueria in Barcelona. The size of several supermarkets, it is a wrought-iron structure jammed with open stalls. Everything for sale is truly fresh, doomed to spoil in a few days. Nothing is wrapped in plastic or dipped in beeswax. La Boqueria can risk it because, via the subway system, it serves almost two million customers. A good supermarket is lucky to have several thousand.
The true cause of this condition can be seen right back through those automatic doors -- the car. According to the boys in the lab, the average distance traveled to any suburban supermarket is 1.8 miles. So my Super Stop & Shop is competing with another one just down the road. Worse, there is the industry's notoriously evanescent profit margin. The longtime average of 75 cents per $100 climbed to $1.14 in 1995. The Grand Wizard of U.P.C. and all the scientific analysis that comes with it is widely credited for this meager blessing. So, what supermarket could risk selling a true variety of fresh food?
Despite these brutal constraints, the tightly packed shelf of preordained purchases can be smashed. Whatever one might think of Starbucks and the recent coffee revival, freshly ground coffee beans and a tasty cup of joe are now nearly as common here as in Europe. So it could be that we are on the verge of revolting against the supermarket, product by product, the way Starbucks crashed through a reinforced facing of freeze-dried crystals and canned grounds. But that revolution took almost a decade. By and large, the supermarket remains a fortress of plastic, vacuum seals and resin dips -- the best world in the best of all possible profit margins.
"Too often," admitted Robert Blattberg, a professor of retailing at Northwestern University, "when I am in a supermarket, my only thought is, 'Why am I in this store and how soon can I get out of it?' " Unlike many supermarket theorists, Blattberg doesn't try to muster a public-relations agent's "genuine excitement" at what he sees. If anything, he's depressed that the presentation of food -- an appetite as powerful as sex -- has employed so much science and research to create a place that is unforgivably dull.
"I think of the turn-of-the-century department stores, like Wanamaker's," he said. "They staged full-scale operas. They created incredible plate-glass windows and pioneered the notion of window shopping." But that wafer-thin profit margin continually scares off any potential Phineas T. Barnum or Walt Disney.
Our supermarkets still have the power to attract us. There will always be that first moment of walking in the door, but then how quickly our enthusiasm is tamed as we are pushed from facing to facing. The store managers claim that these new layouts are designed to improve customer convenience (even as they unalphabetize the soup cans and, to this day, locate milk and bread on diagonally opposing corners). But if convenience is the only end to food shopping, according to Blattberg, then it must end in paradox.
"If it becomes purely transactional," he said, "then someone figures out how to do it all on the Internet and deliver."
And supermarkets disappear. Which would bring grocery shopping full circle -- to a place not far from where it was before the first King Kullen opened on Long Island in 1930, before the convenience of self-service set us on the sterile path toward longer shelf life and locked-in freshness. Back to a day when most families sent a young child to the grocer with a list. Late in the afternoon, a delivery man arrived with sacks of ingredients, with the result that (instead of devoting 107.8 minutes each week groggy and alone in a supermarket) folks spent time in the kitchen, at full blinkage and with family and friends, cooking a fresh, tasty dinner.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Color! Action! Sixty percent of all supermarkets begin with produce; the others begin with flowers. The idea is to tantalize the customer, to draw you in with eye-catching displays and the promise of bounty and freshness -- as if you were entering a true open-air market. After that, the layout is designed toward one end: encouraging as many unplanned purchases -- "splurchases" -- as possible. Get the Kids Involved The premise of cereal theory, as explained by Richard Rauch, a supermarket designer, is simple: put the boxes on the lower shelves -- where kids can see them. Says Rauch, the man who discovered that ice-cream specialties sell much better if placed in front of the long checkout line: "Kids say, 'I want that,' and the mothers and fathers are happy to give it to them to keep them quiet." (pg. 57); Forget the Alphabet Turns out you will buy more soup if it's shelved out of alphabetical order. How much? When soup is alphabetized, sales drop exactly 6 percent. Another big soup issue is shelf space, always a problem because the consumer perceives soup to be a winter product. Soup companies now heavily market summer soups or push the use of various soups in summer sauces, hoping to retain precious shelf space until the leaves start to turn and they can breathe more easily. Keep It Clean The meat counter, like the bountiful produce display, aims to please the ocular senses. But real blood is anathema: the clean-aproned butchers trim tidy bits of fat from presliced meats before sealing them in plastic trays. A little rubbernecking reveals that the more rugged butchery is going on in the back, far behind this public staging area. Look Left Experts suggest locating store labels precisely to the left of the heavily advertised national product. The theory is that after seeing the name brand, the eye -- habituated by a lifetime of reading -- will automatically move left (as it would on a new page) to compare prices. There it will find the store brand, a bit cheaper but looking just as good. Thus ends the search. (pg. 58); Just Give It Away The sample table is its own sub-art in the supermarket game. No wonder: as many as 95 percent of customers who sample go on to buy. The most impressive sampling effort took place a few years ago when the folks behind Nacho Cheese-Flavored Doritos marched out six million bags in 10,000 supermarkets in a single day. Multiply the Options The supermarket is designed to make you feel omnipotent by astounding you with options. But it's mostly show. Dazzled by a plethora of international cheeses, most customers retreat to the familiar -- American, Swiss, mozzarella, hung in handy packets, treated to maintain "freshness." Eyes Front Because the best viewing angle is 15 degrees below the horizontal, the choicest elevation on any aisle has been measured at 51 to 53 inches off the floor. Studies have shown that toothbrushes, if placed at eye level, will increase in sales by 8 percent. Lift, Don't Pull Intent on locating the best and worst position for products -- "the maxima and minima of the polynome over-the-shelf domain" -- experts in shelf management have determined that juice is best located in a special horizontal bin at the bottom of refrigeration cases, about two feet above floor level, where consumers can more easily remove it. No doubt more research will be needed to refine this axiom. (pg. 59); Cover the Scent How is it that the modern supermarket -- the Western world's lascivious monument to appetite -- has no discernible aroma? Vacuum-packed meats, wax-dipped fruit: in an age of safe sex, this is safe food. (Fred R. Conrad/for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL VIEW;
How Talented Composers Become Useless

BYLINE: By Richard Taruskin; Richard Taruskin teaches music history at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
The nice thing about anism, someone once observed, is how quickly it becomes a wasm. Some musical wasms -- academic-wasm, for example, and its dependent varieties of modern-wasm and Serial-wasm -- continue to linger on artificial life support, though, and continue to threaten the increasingly fragile classical ecosystem. A pair of new Albany CD's of music by Donald Martino, now the Walter Bigelow Rosen Professor of Music Emeritus at Harvard, have recently come my way like a gust of musty air. They prompt me to throw open a window on the miseducation of musicians in America.
One disk, consisting entirely of piano music, is especially dispiriting, precisely because the performances, by David Holtzman, are so superfluously good. The other contains two reissues of Nonesuch LP's ("Notturno," Mr. Martino's best-known piece, recorded in 1974, and Triple Concerto for three clarinets and chamber ensemble, recorded in 1978). There is also a brilliant performance by Mr. Holtzman of "Pianississimo," a virtuoso piano sonata composed in 1970 and hailed in its time by Andrew Porter as "a peak of 20th-century piano music." That such a critic could say such a thing of such a work is indeed a sign of times gone by, but there is still something that needs saying about this music. 
 Once, a long time ago, in a famous article that ever since has served as a bible of academic arrogance, Milton Babbitt tried to laugh the audience's claims on 20th-century music right out of court. "Imagine a layman chancing upon a lecture on 'Pointwise Periodic Homeomorphisms,' he wrote. "At the conclusion, he announces, 'I didn't like it.' " Leaving the snobbery to one side, the analogy did make a philosophical point worth pondering.
By comparing "serious" or "original" contemporary music to mathematics (and appropriating concepts like seriousness and originality to one kind of music was where the arrogance lay), Mr. Babbitt was saying, in effect, that such music was to be valued and judged not for the pleasure it gave but for the truth it contained. Truth, in music as in math, lay in accountability to basic principles of relatedness. In the case of math, these were axioms and theorems: basic truth assumptions and the proofs they enabled. In the case of music, truth lay in the relationship of all its details to a basic axiomatic premise called the 12-tone row.
Again, Mr. Babbitt's implied contempt and his claims of exclusivity apart, the point could be viewed as valid. Why not allow that there could be the musical equivalent of an audience of math professors? It was a harmless enough concept in itself -- although when the math professors went on to claim funds and resources that would otherwise go to the maintenance of the "lay" repertory, it was clear that the concept did not really exist "in itself"; it inescapably impinged on social and economic concerns. Yet calling his work the equivalent of a math lecture did at least make the composer's intentions and expectations clear. You could take them or leave them. Honestly asserted, they had a certain authenticity, and so did the music.
But now imagine that one engaged Claire Bloom to read "Pointwise Periodic Homeomorphisms" with all the expressive resources of voice and gesture she would bring to the role of Ophelia or Desdemona. Her performance would add nothing to the paper so far as the math professors were concerned. The "layman" would find something to admire in the beauty of her rendition (as anyone listening to Mr. Holtzman's performances of Mr. Martino's compositions on these Albany CD's will surely admire his sterling qualities of touch, timing and tone).
And yet the lack of connection between the content of the utterance and the manner of its delivery would be a constant irritant both for the professors and for the layman. Both would find the performance somehow silly and gratuitous, though their reasons would vary, and though they might both be reluctant to say so. The incongruity would be equally manifest, moreover, whether Ms. Bloom read the paper in the seminar room or on the Stratford stage.
That is the problem with Mr. Martino's piano music, which strives for conventional expressivity while trying to maintain all the privileged and prestigious truth claims of academic modernism. Because there is no structural connection between the expressive gestures and the 12-tone harmonic language, the gestures are not supported by the musical content (the way they are in Schumann, for example, music Mr. Martino professes to admire and emulate). And while the persistent academic claim is that music like Mr. Martino's is too complex and advanced for lay listeners to comprehend, in fact the expressive gestures, unsupported by the music's syntax or semantics, are primitive and simplistic in the extreme.
Insofar as he seeks to be expressive, the composer is forced to do without language altogether. Where Schumann could make his most telling expressive points by means of subtle gradations of harmony, Mr. Martino can be expressive only in essentially inarticulate ways, the way one might communicate one's grossest needs and moods through grunts and body language. Huge contrasts in loudness and register, being the only means available, are constant. The combination of gross expressive gestures for the layman and arcane pitch relationships for the math professors is a perpetual contradiction. It fatally undermines the esthetic integrity of the music.
The only harmonic support the composer can give the expressive surface is the occasional (and by now, old and tired) device of finagling some intermittent consonant harmony out of his Serial procedures. Composers who do this call it "tonal implication" or "tonal reference," but it is really nothing of the kind, because tonality is a syntax, not just a vocabulary. Invoking consonance is just another gross distinction, another primitive and largely meaningless gesture.
THESE ARE HARSH judgments but necessary ones. Academic composers still maintain a smug front. In a 60th-birthday interview Mr. Martino was still blaming everyone but himself for the lack of headway his music had made despite all his prizes and plum academic posts. He was still heaping Babbittian scorn on "laymen," lobbying, as he put it, for a "potty-trained audience" and contending that "what we need are concert hall bouncers." And, of course, he was still simultaneously bragging that audiences disliked "Notturno," his Pulitzer Prize-winning sextet, and whining that his works were not more regularly performed before such audiences.
The reason it is still necessary to expose these hypocrisies, even after the vaunted "post-modern" demise of Serialism, is that the old-fashioned modernist position still thrives in its old bastion, the academy. Composers like Mr. Martino are still miseducating their pupils just as he was miseducated himself, dooming them to uselessness. Critics and "theorists," many of them similarly miseducated, are still propagandizing for Pointwise Periodic Homeomorphisms in the concert hall, offering their blandishments as consolation for the loss of a musical language and decrying the attempts of younger composers to find a new one. Excellent performers like Mr. Holtzman, whose recordings of Stefan Wolpe show that his talents can be put to much better use, are still content to seek cozy academic approbation instead of seeking to establish a viable role for new music in the public sphere.
It is not reinforcement in their contempt of audiences, or protection from them, that young composers and performers need, but encouragement in the risky business of establishing a new symbiosis with them. Mr. Martino and his music set an entirely negative example. The only constructive purpose the circulation of these records could serve today would be a cautionary one.

A MODERN HISTORY OF THE KURDS
By David McDowall.
472 pp. New York:
I. B. Tauris/
St. Martin's Press. $35.
 In 1976, according to David McDowall, the Select Intelligence Committe of the House of Representatives, headed by Representative Otis Pike of New York, reported to the House on the situation of the Iraqi Kurds: "Both Iran and the U.S. hope to benefit from an unresolvable situation in which Iraq is intrinsically weakened by the Kurds' refusal to give up their semiautonomy. Neither Iran nor the U.S. would like to see the situation resolved either way." Twenty years later, it would appear, the United States has replicated that same situation with the Kurds' so-called "exclusionary zone" in northern Iraq. Fearful of the consequences likely to follow the overthrow of Saddam Hussein -- the dismemberment of Iraq and wider regional instability -- Washington refuses to give the Kurds sufficient succor or aid to help them establish an independent homeland. But equally fearful of a powerful Iraq under the leadership of Mr. Hussein -- who is likely to return his country to its past policies of military and imperial aggrandizement -- the United States prefers to maintain the Kurds in the north as semi-independent of Baghdad. A weak but unified Iraq appears very much the goal of our present policy. 
 Of course, America pays only a slight price for this state of indefinite paralysis. The Kurds and the rest of the Iraqi people pay dearly. It is with the price paid by the Kurds and others in the countries where they live that "A Modern History of the Kurds," a work of impressive traditional scholarship, is concerned.
 The Kurds now number more than 25 million, inhabiting an area the size of France that stretches across the common borders of Turkey, Iraq and Iran. According to Mr. McDowall's calculations, they constitute more than 23 percent of the populations of Turkey and Iraq and some 10 percent of the population of Iran. The price they have paid at the hands of these three states has been truly staggering. Very clearly, throughout the 20th century, both Turkey and Iraq have pursued policies tantamount to genocide, seeking to destroy the Kurds as a people. Turkey has been the most resolute and vicious.
 The Ottomans used the Kurds, who were willing accomplices, to be sure, in the genocide against the Armenians. By April 1915, some one million Armenians had been killed by the Kurds in eastern Turkey. Almost immediately thereafter, the Ottomans turned their might on the Kurds themselves. By the end of 1917, forcible resettlements, famine and disease had killed off as many as half the Kurds in the east. Sulaimaniya, a major Kurdish center, for example, had a prewar population of 20,000. By 1918, it numbered 2,500.
 But the worst was yet to come. By 1923 Britain abandoned any pretense of supporting either an Armenian or a Kurdish state in eastern Turkey. (Long before, by 1919, the United States had returned to its prewar isolation.) With the withdrawal of the great powers, the Turks, according to Mr. McDowall, "sought to hammer the Kurdish people." And hammer they did. First, the Turks banned the public use of the Kurdish language. Then they turned the Turkish army on the Kurds. In 1934, the Turks adopted new legislation: Kurds were henceforth to be dispersed across the country so they never constituted more than 5 percent of the population in any place they inhabited. The military was to force the resettlements. By 1937, none of this had worked to the satisfaction of the Turkish Government, and military operations began in earnest. Aerial bombardment, poison gas and artillery shelling were systematically directed at Kurdish strongholds. In the spring of 1938, for example, at the massacre at Dersim, the Turkish military slaughtered some 40,000 Kurds.
 Similar Turkish policies continue to this day. The formation of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (P.K.K.) in 1984 brought new violence to Kurdistan as the P.K.K. targeted Kurds who were members of either the political or economic establishment and whom the P.K.K. saw as serving the Turkish state. The Government responded with characteristic heavy-handedness, culminating by 1992 in a full-scale war against its Kurdish citizens. The war continues, costing the state some $10 billion per year; it has also cost the Kurds more than 20,000 casualties and two million refugees. (The Kurds flee the southeast for the relative safety of the cities, where they then can be mobilized into a fuller expression of their Kurdish identity.)
 Iraq has pursued essentially similar policies, with even more devastating results. As early as 1932, the King of Iraq was able to call on the British air forces to bomb Kurdish villages. But the fullness of Iraqi genocide toward the Kurds awaited Saddam Hussein. Beginning in 1982, at the height of his eight-year war with Iran, Mr. Hussein began the destruction of the Kurds. In that year, his troops rounded up every male over 13 of the Barzani clan, the traditional leaders of the Kurdish struggle against the state; the Iraqis seized some 8,000 people, paraded them through the streets of Baghdad and then executed every one of them. That was only the prelude. The culmination was reached in the "Anfal" operations of 1988, when Mr. Hussein combined poison gas attacks with the roundup and execution of Kurds, "with a brutality reminiscent of Nazi death camps," according to Mr. McDowall. About 200,000 were killed in that year alone, with more violence to continue in the years up to the establishment of the exclusionary zone.
 Iran manipulated the Kurds living there, seeking to focus their efforts against Iraq instead of Teheran. The Shah, in concert with Israel and the United States, supplied the Kurds with modern weapons to use against the Iraqis in a full-scale war in the early 1970's. But when the Shah achieved his diplomatic goals, he signed an accord with Mr. Hussein in 1975 and ended all aid to the Kurds. With the border sealed, the Iraqi Army was able to devastate the Kurds, who had no access to new munitions.
 The 1979 victory of the Islamic Republic in Iran brought no respite. Military campaigns against the Kurds resulted in more than 50,000 deaths within the first years of clerical rule. Moreover, the regime mounted an assassination campaign against Kurdish leaders, just as it did against non-Kurdish opposition politicians. Abd al-Rahman Qasimlu, head of a major left-wing Kurdish party, was killed by regime-sponsored assassins in Vienna in 1989. His successor, Sadiq Sharafkindi, was murdered in a Berlin restaurant by Iranian agents in 1992. Other leaders of left-wing Kurdish groups were killed elsewhere in Europe and in Cyprus.
 The systematic destruction of the Kurds continues. Turkey -- with its recent admission to the Council of Europe, its NATO membership, its democracy and human rights -- deserves special condemnation. (The European Parliament recently awarded the Sakharov Peace Prize to Leyla Zana, one of eight Kurdish members of the Turkish Parliament who were stripped of their immunity and sentenced to lengthy jail terms in 1988 for "relations with a terrorist organization," the P.K.K.) But Iraq and Iran deserve vigorous condemnation as well.
 Condemning the perpetrators of genocide is the easy part, however. A more challenging question -- which Mr. McDowall largely answers -- is to account for the extraordinary failure of the Kurds to build a national movement that succeeded in bringing them security and the formulation and achievement of some set of coherent national aspirations. In the end, it is the Kurds who bear the most responsibility for their own horrible sufferings. The Kurdish people have been consistently ill-served by their leaders, whose barbarity, treachery, venality and stupidity have been every bit the equal of the rulers whom they confronted.
 Mr. McDowall's extraordinary account helps explain why. Although "Kurdistan" was used as a geographical term as early as the 12th century, Kurds did not begin "to think and act as an ethnic community" until after World War I. But, most significantly, the Kurds have not been able to create meaningful ethnic unity or coherent national organizations. In the 1992 Kurdish elections in their "safe haven" in northern Iraq, the Kurdish Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ended in a dead heat. By May of 1994 they had fallen into fratricidal violence. In April of 1995, Kurds established a parliament in exile in The Hague, but its operation has been no more successful, only less violent.
 The Kurds have failed to achieve unity for many reasons: They do not share common ancestry. They speak two different Kurdish languages. They are divided into numerous Muslim sects. They are spread across a number of independent countries and divided further into competing tribes and clans as well as into groups of nontribal peasants and now city dwellers.
 Other peoples have surmounted such handicaps. But not the Kurds. Until there are Kurdish intellectuals who can fashion a coherent national Kurdish identity, and political leaders who can translate that identity into achievable goals, the Kurds will remain victims of the more powerful states in which they live.
 They will never be rescued by foreign states, no matter how much they might long for intervention. Foreign states cannot build a coherent Kurdish political movement. But even more to the point is a telling comment of Mr. McDowall's about an earlier and much-romanticized Kurdish leader: "Mulla Mustafa committed the fundamental error of believing that the external players, the U.S. and Iran, would help him defeat Iraq, rather than use him for their own purposes" Until the Kurds are in a position to take their destiny into their own hands, the genocide is likely to continue.

DRAGON ASCENDING
Vietnam and the Vietnamese.
By Henry Kamm.
Illustrated. 304 pp. New York:
Arcade Publishing. $24.95.
 THIRTY-FIVE years ago we blustered into Vietnam full of blind certainty and can-do optimism, not only oblivious of thousands of years of history but downright uncaring about such trifles. What did all that matter? The fate of the Free World was at stake. 
 Now we are re-entering the place. This time we are going as capitalists eager for profit, and once again we are almost giddy at the prospect. But will we be any better prepared? There is an unforgettable scene in Graham Greene's wonderful novel "The Quiet American" in which the jaded British antihero tries to explain the title character to a puzzled Vietnamese: "He belongs to the American Economic Mission. You know the kind of thing -- electrical sewing machines for starving seamstresses."
 "Are there any?"
 "I don't know."
 "But they don't use sewing machines. There wouldn't be any electricity where they live."
 Near the end of "Dragon Ascending: Vietnam and the Vietnamese," Henry Kamm relates a similar cautionary tale: In 1993 the village of Xuan Dang got electricity, but few of the houses were plugged in. "Too expensive," one of Mr. Kamm's many Vietnamese friends tells him. This village is just 40 miles from Hanoi.
 "Dragon Ascending" should be kit-bag reading for the old troopers revisiting the grown-over battlegrounds of their youth and for the young troopers on their dreamy bicycle tours along Highway 1. It should especially be read by the businessmen gearing up for a new invasion of Saigon. Unfortunately, the businessmen probably won't read it, because Mr. Kamm, who was for many years a foreign correspondent for The New York Times, offers no advice for cutting through the red tape of one of the last of the old-line Communist bureaucracies.
 Instead, he fills his pages with conversations -- with farmers, poets, dissidents, disenchanted revolutionaries and revolutionaries fearful that they will become disenchanted as the free market arrives. Theirs are mostly sad stories about lives never allowed to flow, lives interrupted by the Japanese, the French, the Americans and then their own home-grown Stalins -- men and women who, after fighting so long for their country's freedom, chose as their icon a man already in the dustbin, and chose a political system headed quickly into it, too.
 As Mr. Kamm shows through his somewhat disconnected tales, there is not much joy in Vietnam today. The place is dirt poor and backward. In one of his most poignant scenes, he watches youngsters at sidewalk cafes gathering up the empties, no longer for older brothers to make into beer-can grenades but for smiths to pound into crude tools. Meanwhile, the Government employs old Iron Curtain authoritarianism while reaching out to the West to deal with its debt problems.
 Mr. Kamm has spent more than 25 years watching the Vietnamese. If his book is uneven, so is the story he wants to tell. He opens by revisiting My Lai, where in 1969 he had interviewed survivors of the village slaughter. Their numbers have been diminished by time, but Mr. Kamm's new interviews quickly reveal one of his subthemes: The Vietnamese, even those with the deepest physical and psychological scars, are better able than Americans to forgive -- or at least to let the war drift into the past. A local author notes the irony in a Vietnamese mother working for a United States search team, sifting through the earth for bone shards from a long-dead American flyer. She had lost three sons of her own, and their bodies were never found; they are statistics among the 200,000 Vietnamese M.I.A's. She needs the work.
 There is something almost neurotic about America's obsession with Vietnam. We can't shake the haunt. Mr. Kamm writes, not originally but appropriately, that to Americans this war meant "the death of an illusion . . . the self-flattering illusion that their country fought only just wars -- and won them." That is one of the reasons that books like "Dragon Ascending" still have a niche in the marketplace.
 But now, as Americans go back, there is another reason for such books. Perhaps this time we can learn from them, and take with us both less romanticism and more knowledge, not only about the Vietnamese but about ourselves as well.

HEADLINE: Living, and Buying, in the North End of Boston

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
THE North End is a residential and commercial waterfront neighborhood accustomed over the centuries to periodic reinvigoration by waves of immigrants. The latest wave is of domestic origin, however -- droves of Boston-area residents who find they can live in the North End while earning rental income from residential or commercial tenants that subsidize their own housing costs.
First settled by English colonists in the 1630's, the neighborhood is a place of narrow streets bordered by skinny four-story, red-brick walkups. It is one of the nation's largest Italian-American commercial districts, with roughly 125 Italian food stores, restaurants and cafes within a quarter of a square mile. 
 Tucked into the eastern corner of downtown, the North End is a short walk from the Financial District, the theater district and the Government Center. Indeed, as the site of Boston's first British settlements, the rest of the city has grown up around it, according to the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
The newcomers are providing yet another spurt of rejuvenation. The area has about 900 multifamily buildings with roughly 5,000 apartments, and recent sale prices make them more affordable than they were in the late 80's.
In 1989, for instance, the median price for a 2,500- to 3,000-square-foot building with four 600-square-foot apartments was $425,000, according to Richard H. Carlson, chief of valuations for the city assessor. But then, only 10 buildings changed hands.
By 1990, the median had dropped to $172,500. And last year, about two dozen buildings were sold or put under sales agreements at a median price in the mid-to-high $200,000 range, Mr. Carlson estimates.
Furthermore, while building prices are now more affordable, rents are rising because demand for apartments is getting stronger. Also, with only a few scattered infill sites available for new construction, there is a relatively fixed supply of these properties.
As a result, property values in this neighborhood appreciated an average of 8 percent in 1995, compared to about 4 percent for the city as a whole, Mr. Carlson said.
"Downtown is hot," he said. "These buildings are doing well because they're adjacent to downtown, where the economy is picking up, rents have increased dramatically and there is renewed demand for residential property.
"When this happens, investors become interested in the cash flow from these buildings," he said. "And owner-occupants like them because the rental income can cover their own housing costs."
Then there are the life-style and emotional factors. Many who grew up in the North End, or whose parents grew up there before moving to the suburbs, are being tugged back by what they consider a tight-knit community with immaculate streets, a virtual absence of street crime and excellent views of Boston Harbor.
Joanne Anzalone, a local realtor who sold 11 of these buildings in 1995, none in 1994 and one in 1993 said, "This is the first time in the 18 years I've been here that I've seen kids who want to stay here and older people who want to move back from the suburbs."
In some ways, Mrs. Anzalone reflects the Old World touch for which the North End is known. In addition to being a realtor, she is a justice of the peace.
"If the couple rents from me, I give them a discount on the wedding ceremony," she said matter-of-factly. "If they buy, the ceremony is free."
Last year, Mrs. Anzalone, who owns several residential properties in the North End, purchased a nine-unit building for $500,000. She will invest about $300,000 on a gut renovation and then charge $1,000 to $2,000 a month rent for one- to three-bedroom apartments, she said.
IN general, owners who renovate these small buildings can expect to increase the property's cash flow by more than 50 percent. Within 12 years, given a stable economy, they would likely see its value double, said James V. Zarella, a broker at Hunneman & Company, a large real estate firm here.
For instance, one of his clients purchased a four-unit building for $240,000 in the second quarter of last year and invested $30,000 to remodel and refurbish it. Rents then rose enough to produce a 68 percent increase in cash flow, Mr. Zarella said.
Christine M. Corey, 26, and her brother Donald, 30, are hoping for a similar performance from the four-unit building on Henchman Street that they bought for $230,000 last spring. They spent about $5,000 to renovate one apartment for Donald and a second brother, John, and to refurbish the hallway and staircase.
Ms. Corey, a saleswoman for Fidelity Investments, and her brothers occupy separate apartments. Donald and Christine Corey pay themselves rent and deposit it in their account to build up equity, and raised the rent on the other two units to $700 from $550 and to $800 from $600. As first-time buyers, they passed up the suburbs where they were raised to invest here.
Ms. Corey can walk to work, and in the evening the pair melds into the crowds of tourists and other residents who frequent the cafes. Since they are of Italian ancestry -- the family name was Corigliano -- and have several relatives living in the neighborhood, they feel at home. And they are confident that the cash flow from the building will rise steadily.
"This is our first real estate project and at some point we'll buy another place, move out and get the rent and appreciation," Ms. Corey said. "It's a fantastic investment and there's a real sense of community here. I know the grocer, the tailor, we play Keno with our neighbors. The people have been so nice."
Other recent buyers are unabashedly sentimental about the North End.
Christine M. Luongo, 41, was raised here, and most of her family still lives in the neighborhood. When she married George Hadaya, also 41, 18 years ago they rented an apartment in the nearby city of Somerville. But Ms. Luongo never cut the apron strings, spending every day in the North End and sending her two sons to a parochial school there.
"Practically everybody I meet on the street, I'm related to," she said. "We're all very close and look after each other. I like that. I moved out but I never really left."
In the 80's, the couple tried to buy in the North End but found the high prices and short supply insurmountable. Then, in 1994, they found a four-unit building on North Bennet Street with two empty apartments for $215,0000.
So far, they have spent about $70,000 on a gut renovation of the two upper floors, which they will occupy shortly. They ripped out walls to make a large kitchen and dinning area; exposed brick on remaining walls; installed a stairway to unite the two apartments; removed another stairway and installed central heat, air-conditioning and a modern master bath.
They expect to spend $70,000 more to renovate the other two units, which they intend to rent to family members.
"Eventually, we want this to be a family building," Mr. Hadaya said. "We already know the people who bought next door."
Such communal spirit in the heart of a city is a rare find. Combine it with a profitable investment and it can be irresistible. Even Ms. Corey, who already is eyeing buildings in another part of the city, concedes that her balance sheet may not be the sole factor in determining how long she lives here.
As she said, "There's a real sense of community that it would be hard to leave."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Bronx's Beth Abraham Hospital Venturing Into Westchester;
Former Warehouse to Become a Medical Facility

 BODY:
A former industrial warehouse in Greenburgh in Westchester County is being transformed into a medical facility to house two expanding medical programs offered by Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx.
The 15,200-square-foot facility at 335 Tarrytown Road will house an adult day health care program for disabled patients 55 years old and up and a comprehensive care-management program for chronically disabled patients age 18 and older. 
 The programs mark the 520-bed Bronx hospital's first foray into Westchester County, according to Michael Bialek, vice president for real estate development. "We found that the population for these programs was being underserved in the county," he said.
Jon Parets, a hospital spokesman, said the adult health care program was "modeled after the day care concept, but its purpose will be medical, not social." Mr. Parets said the comprehensive-care program was "designed to keep nursing-home-eligible people out of nursing homes and living independently as long as possible." The hospital is opening two additional locations for its comprehensive-care management program, one across from the hospital, which is at 612 Allerton Avenue and Bronx Park East, and another at Grand and Essex Streets in lower Manhattan.
The Greenburgh warehouse was once operated by the National Cash Register Corporation. "It was a 15,000-square-foot slab-on-concrete box," Mr. Bialek said. "There'll be a new roof, new skin, plumbing and flooring." The $4 million project is expected to be ready in mid-April, he said. It was financed in part by bonds issued through the Westchester Industrial Development Agency.

At Stratford, Yet Another Plan Takes the Stage

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: STRATFORD

 BODY:
WITH a history as tortured as Hamlet's and as long as Henry IV, Parts I and II, the former Shakespeare Theater in Stratford is up for redevelopment again. It has functioned only sporadically since it closed in 1976.
On his third try, Louis S. Burke, a theatrical producer from Johannesburg, was chosen last November as developer of the 14.5-acre site by the Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the property. The state bought it in foreclosure for $1.3 million in 1983. 
 Mr. Burke has made a $1.5 million offer to buy the complex from the state, but "we asked not to pay anything for the first two years while rebuilding," he said. While negotiations continue a license was issued last month permitting a tent theater to operate on the grounds for the next two summers.
"Negotiations could take another three months," said State Senator George L. Gunther, Republican of Stratford, who is a strong supporter of Mr. Burke.
Elaborate development plans, estimated to cost $180 million over a four-year period, include renovation of the existing theater to seat 1,750 people; the addition of a 1,250-seat theater and a 350-seat experimental stage offering simultaneous productions year-round; an open-air summer theater and a children's theater.
A house on the grounds would be renovated as a graduate school of drama -- a function that the original Shakespeare Theater initiated under the stewardship of John Houseman, the late actor-director-producer, and The Theater Guild of New York.
A museum, seven restaurants, parking for more than 1,600 cars, jogging paths, tennis courts, fishing, an "Anne Hathaway's Cottage," and "Kate's Cottage" (a Katharine Hepburn Museum) are also envisioned. Ms. Hepburn, Maurice Evans and Helen Hayes were among the stars who appeared at the nonprofit theater during its heyday from 1954 to the early 70's.
An additional 25 acres of the surrounding residential neighborhood would contain an inn and a hotel accommodating more than 500 guests. To realize this, Mr. Burke says that he has options to purchase 30 houses that would be converted into shops, art galleries, restaurants and bed-and-breakfast establishments.
Mr. Burke said that Coopers & Lybrand estimates that $2 million in state income and unemployment taxes and $5 million in state sales taxes would be realized annually and that the complex would generate a $15 million annual payroll.
LAST month the Stratford Zoning Commission amended its regulations to create an entertainment district with as yet undetermined boundaries around the theater property.
"It allows uses that compliment the theater," said Susan Youngquist, commission chairman. Underlying residential, commercial, and industrial zones remain, protecting properties from becoming nonconforming.
Naming himself as president of the Stratford venture, Mr. Burke has identified John Barton, a founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and Michael Langham, former director of the Juilliard School's Drama School, as artistic advisers, and Brakeley, John Price Jones of Stamford as fund-raising consultants.
E & F Construction, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Morganti Group of Danbury, has provided preliminary construction figures. Joan Brickhill, Mr. Burke's wife, is co-director with her husband of Brickhill-Burke Productions, a theatrical production company and the proposed developer of the Stratford Theater. She remains in South Africa pursuing her own acting career.
As producer of lavish musical revivals in South Africa, Mr. Burke has accumulated an attache case full of testimonial letters and expressions of encouragement from numerous well-known theatrical personalities. His only American production, "Meet Me in St. Louis," got unfavorable reviews and ran for seven months on Broadway in 1989-90.
Senator Gunther said he made inquiries about Mr. Burke while on a legislative visit to South Africa.
"He was legitimate, but they don't pay big money down there," he said. "His theater was torn down for redevelopment, that's why he's trying here. I don't know who his people are since I'm not close to his operation, but I don't think there's any problem about the sale going through. He has sources for money -- not for publication."
State Representative Vincent J. Chase, a Stratford Republican, is not so certain.
"If Burke doesn't have the funding I'm prepared to go to the attorney general and ask for an investigation," he said. "Burke approached Gunther for a $15 million low interest loan for development, but I don't think it will pass in these economic times." The bill is currently before the Joint Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
In 1992, the proposal by Mr. Burke, in association with Robert M. DelBuono Jr., a Stratford developer, and Scott Wilson, a Boston architect, was rejected, as was a more modest proposal by David D. Reed of New Haven, a director of development at the Shakespeare Theater from 1968 to 1973.
In 1993 Mr. DelBuono and Mr. Scott broke off their relationship with Mr. Burke because of "doubts about his financial acumen," said Mr. DelBuono. He and Mr. Scott formed Stratford Upon the Housatonic (Suthi) with Steven A. Wolff, a Fairfield arts consultant, bid against Mr. Burke and Mr. Reed, and won.
Their 10-year, $95 million plan proposed a $7.5 million grant and a lease from the state. It would have included two theaters, 300 hotel rooms and limited ancillary development. Financing was to be handled by the Tishman Corporation of Manhattan, currently involved in the refurbishing of 42d Street, and the artistic director was to have been Ron Daniels, associate director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.
Contending that the selection process was unfair and that Suthi had stolen his ideas, Mr. Burke filed a complaint with the state's Department of Economic Development, which then controlled the site. A seven-month investigation by state auditors and the State Attorney General's office resulted in an 80-page report in June 1994 that "was not conclusive," said Robert Jaekle, the auditor who worked on it. "We did not find unfair or dishonest procedures."
When the state administration changed hands in 1995, the property was removed from the Department of Development to the Department of Environmental Protection and the General Assembly voted to sell off the Shakespeare property rather than lease it, generating a new round of bids.
T HE same three bidders participated and Mr. Burke won when he agreed to buy the property, while Suthi stuck to its lease proposal.
"Nonprofits cannot bear the burden of capital costs," said Mr. DelBuono. "We do not think the project is viable without the state's participation."
With his partnership intact, Mr. DelBuono is waiting to see if Mr. Burke can produce, he said.
"It was clear in the Attorney General's investigation that we were chosen on merit," he said, "but we were not prepared for the political maneuvering that could derail it."
If Mr. Burke cannot raise the money, the property reverts to the Town of Stratford, to remain a park in perpetuity with or without a theater.
Some residents, including James Connolly, a lawyer, think that the town should own the property. "Twenty years is no guarantee," he said, referring to the period in which a private developer must operate a theater under the legislation.
While competition is generally welcomed by Connecticut's established theater companies, some are critical of elements in the Burke proposal. Embattled by widespread cutbacks in public funds for the arts, Edgar Rosenblum, director of the prestigious Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, said, "If Stratford gets a $15 million loan I will be on the Governor's doorstep the next morning."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Year-Old State Housing Plan Starts Up 2,600 Units

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A YEAR ago New Jersey unveiled its first comprehensive housing plan -- a broad blueprint designed to funnel $700 million by the turn of the century into the production of low- and moderate-income residences while increasing home ownership in the state's cities and rental housing in its suburbs.
So far $100 million has been pumped into the plan, known as H-EASY 2000 for Housing and Economic Assistance Strategy. It has primed the development of 2,600 units for people earning 50 to 80 percent of the median income in the area they live. 
 Below-market rate mortgages are being given to some 500 urban home buyers and 3,300 jobs have been created, data from the state's Department of Community Affairs show.
"We're on target and on schedule," said Harriet Derman, Commissioner of the department, which is charged with implementing the plan. Next month $200 million more is to be released, most for the plan's keystone program to produce mixed-income for-sale housing in cities. That would bring the plan by early 1997 half way through its implementation, she said.
The reaction from housing groups, local officials and developers to the plan's maiden year has been mixed. Some say the release of money is not fast enough in a state that needs 86,308 low- to moderate-income units by 1999. The plan is expected to meet a quarter of that need.
Others say it has not gone far enough for rentals and in the suburbs. "It is better than nothing, but it is limited in scope," said Diane Sterner, executive director of the Affordable Housing Network, of Trenton, which represents private and nonprofit builders. Her group and others continue to call for more affordable rentals and subsidies.
Ms. Sterner's organization is leading a campaign to get a $290 million bond issue on the ballot in November to fill those gaps among others. "Then," said Ms. Sterner, "a dent can be made in meeting the state's affordable housing needs."
The consensus of local officials, housing advocates and developers, however, is that so far the plan's big success has been blending the workings of the state's three housing agencies -- the semi-autonomous Council on Affordable Housing, the Division of Housing and the New Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance Agency. That has made it easier to navigate the application process and by extension to provide access to funds.
"It's a plus because the state is concentrating its funds on projects likely to be built, resulting in more housing," said Raymond Codey, director of development at New Community Corporation, a large nonprofit developer based in Newark.
The goal to streamline the regulatory process, which builders and others have long said is dysfunctional, did not move ahead, all those involved in housing say. "The plan's spending elements could of their own momentum create affordable housing, but absent permit reform the impact will be inhibited," said Patrick O'Keefe, executive vice president of the New Jersey Builders Association.
Mrs. Derman voiced optimism that a bill addressing the issue would be introduced this legislative session.
To some observers H-EASY also has not yet advanced new programs or financing pools, a contention its proponents dispute. The plan's supporters say it creates more money by expanding the bonding capacity of the finance agency and combines it with agency surpluses, private investments and funds from existing state and Federal programs. "We are putting new money on the street without adding debt to taxpayers or to the state," said Timothy J. Touhey, the agency's executive director.
By packaging the state's resources with incentives like below-market-rate construction financing, below-market-rate mortgages to buyers and subsidies to builders the plan, in theory, would help boost production levels. Estimates are that the state last year issued 7 percent fewer permits than 1994's total of 26,986.
MANY consider the 2,600 units generated by H-EASY in its first year a decent amount but say most were produced under two long-established programs.The $13 million in Federal housing tax credits allocated to the state for low-income rentals was crucial. Builders use credits to raise construction money by selling them to investors, who use the credits to reduce taxes over 10 years.
Mrs. Derman said the state last year made the selection process for credits more competitive to stress projects that, among other things, drew more private capital. The resulting 2,400 units, she said, represent a 50 percent rise over 1994's total.
Suburban projects include two in Morris County. One is a 100-unit rental for the elderly in Wharton being developed by the nonprofit Wharton Senior Citizen Housing Corporation; Affordable Housing Developers, of Livingston, is the builder. Monthly rents for the 560- to 820-square-foot units will be $400 to $600, said Leonard Solandz, a partner with Roger Gore in the company.
The other is a 122-unit, one- and two-bedroom rental in Roxbury, with 20 percent of the units for battered women, said M. Brad Ingerman, a partner in Riverpark Village Associates, the developer. He said the units would rent for $445 to $755 a month.
In response to concerns from some housing groups, Mrs. Derman said that further changes had been made in the credit-selection process, including its approach to cities. At least another 2,400 units are expected to be generated under the program this year, she said.
H-EASY also released $40 million in 30-year, zero-percent-down mortgages at 5 percent interest, the lowest ever offered. The first $15 million produced 183 loans, including one to Dennis and Cecilia Cassidy who purchased a home in Elizabeth. "It's an unbelievable deal," said Mrs. Cassidy. "There was no other way we could have bought a house."
No one disputes the mortgage program's success. But critics said it was only for buyers in Trenton, Elizabeth, Asbury Park and Camden, the focus of the administration's Urban Initiative, which emphasizes coordination of services to help cities.
An additional 300 loans should result from the $25 million more released last December, said Mr. Touhey. He said the administration would continue the program, committing $10 million more this summer and expanding it to other cities.
Mayor J. Christian Bollwage of Elizabeth said the loans get people in homes, but he wonders how they will stay in them if nothing is done to help cities reduce taxes. "New housing would help add ratables and spur economic development," he said.
To that end $1.5 million was released to rebuild rentals above downtown stores and revive commercial areas, said Robert W. Friant, spokesman for the city's Community Affairs Department. Three other programs totaling $30 million, which were delayed awaiting legislative approval, also will be in place next month. The money, he said, will go to make homes available to tenants with an option to buy, offer credits to urban home buyers who help renovate their houses and provide construction-loan guarantees for the development of rental projects of up to 25 units.
On the urban side the test is the $200 million to be released next month. Of that, $150 million will go to construction loans to builders to mix market-rate and affordable units. The homes then will serve as equity for $150 million in state-guaranteed mortgages to buyers of the homes. An additional $30 million will help subsidize low- and moderate-income units.
BUT urban housing officials felt that putting market-rate units in every city was unrealistic and pressed for flexibility in the program, which was done because "it's better to get the affordable units built than none at all," said Mr. Friant, of Elizabeth.
Annemarie C. Uebbing, director of Jersey City's Division of Affordable Housing, said flexibility was crucial to homeownership projects in parts of her city. She said she hoped that a development of 27 two-family homes -- proposed by Minority Contractors and Coalition of Trade Workers, of Jersey City -- on Wilkinson and Bayview Avenues in her city would benefit from the funds.
Trenton also hopes to tap the program for two projects. One involves 17 rowhouses on Reservoir Street, a joint venture of Eldon Affordable Housing of Cheltenham, Pa., and Roy Realty and Isles Inc., both of Trenton. The other is for 40 town houses that would be built by Affordable Housing Developers and Isles Inc. on Broad Street across from the Trenton Battle Monument, where Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced the housing plan last year.
"We want to do more homeownership projects, but we want to do more rentals, too," said Alan Mallach, Trenton's director of housing and development. "It cannot be either/or."

HEADLINE: SPEAK SOFTLY, CARRY A VEILED THREAT

 BODY:
Beijing must be delighted with Fareed Zakaria's recommendation that the United States, in its policy toward China, forget about "the problems of neglected orphans, brave dissidents and cheap labor" ("Speak Softly, Carry a Veiled Threat," Feb. 18).
Even apart from the ethical imperative not to forget these abuses, political and economic factors warrant more, not less, attention to human rights. The "cheap labor" is a potential source of major unrest. The "brave dissidents" may be a source of future leadership and are certainly a wellspring of creative thinking about China's problems. The "neglected orphans," overwhelmingly girls, raise the specter of a sexual imbalance that China ignores at its peril. 
 Moreover, if the U.S. should sit and wait for 10 years, as Zakaria suggests, while China is allowed to ignore international law in the field of human rights, how, by the time China becomes a true superpower, are we to expect that it will honor economic rules or political treaties? Assuming that Zakaria's scenario is correct and that China is on its way to becoming a superpower, the policy of indulgence could create a monster.
Demanding adherence to international human rights will set the only acceptable foundation for future relations between the world and China.

TRAIL LECTURE
There are many Appalachian Trail hikes, but the ultimate is the Appalachian Trail through-hike, 2,200 miles from Georgia to Maine, completed by about 3,000 intrepid souls since the hikes began in the 1940's. 
 Larry Luxenberg, author of "Walking the Appalachian Trail," published in 1994 by Stackpole Books in Mechanicsville, Pa., will talk today at 3 P.M. at the Desmond-Fish Library in Garrison about the experiences of many trekkers described in his book. Featured with him as co- lecturer will be Mike Warren, who illustrated the book with 150 photographs.
Some people apparently take the hike after a divorce, job loss or personal tragedy, and it is usually a life-altering experience, Mr. Luxenberg said. The first through-hike was completed in 1948 by Earl Shaffer. A woman known as Grandma Gatewood began the first of her three through-hikes at 67.
Information on food, equipment and life readjustment will be discussed.
The library is at the intersection of Routes 9D and 403. Admission is free. For more information, call 424-3020.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
A Postwar Message For the Millennium

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: TEANECK

 BODY:
IF economic terror and moral indifference were ever presaged by a playwright, the handwriting on the wall belonged to Arthur Miller.
No contemporary dramatist has had a deeper grasp of the corrupting power of the dollar bill. By intuiting an emotional through-line between the idolization of materialism and the toppling of the family, Mr. Miller was foreshadowing the erosion of the middle class. 
 Given the modern overtones of a country in free-floating crisis, it is sobering to come upon "All My Sons," the breakthrough play of a prophetic voice, in what is essentially a 50th-anniversary production by the American Stage Company. But there won't be trumpets to herald the occasion, for Mr. Miller, who turned 80 last year -- another milestone dutifully commemorated, if not celebrated, in this country -- is revered in London but disregarded by America's commercial theater.
One reason may be that the cosmically involved concerns of his searing early dramas gave way to the inner-directed conflicts and pretensions of his later ones. Still, "All My Sons," in revival, was a commercial failure on Broadway in 1987, as was Miller's last effort, the muddled "Broken Glass" in 1994.
Mr. Miller's importance as a playwright of conscience flowered with "All My Sons" and positively peaked with his next play, "Death of a Salesman." A 1950's retelling of Ibsen ("An Enemy Of The People") seemed inevitable. An investigation of accusatory madness ("The Crucible," now being filmed in a star-filled Hollywood version) remains his work most widely produced nationwide.
That the best of Miller still reverberates in small theaters was startlingly evident on a recent trip to California, where "All My Sons" has been selling out (and was extended) in a highly praised professional production, directed by Elina DeSantos, produced by the Odyssey Theater Ensemble in West Los Angeles.
A T American Stage, the director, Sondra Lee, once a well-known musical-comedy performer, builds a sense of the ominous from the very first lines: "There's always bad news." "What's today's calamity?" Ms. Lee shapes the elements of a tragedy as if it were a mystery. Evasions dart in and out, tantalizingly. Truths surface and withdraw, until the house of Keller caves in, inexorably. Even the play's symbolic allusions (the appearance of the light once a dead son's tree has fallen; stars going out when another son's idealism dies) are naturally fused into a transcendent overview of a play that can be narrowly perceived as a primer on ethics in the postwar marketplace.
In a fine ensemble, Don Peoples (Joe Keller) is the very model of a double-talking businessman for whom compromise is second nature but double-dealing comes first. All too convincingly, he says, "I ignore what I got to ignore," before the foulness of his misdeeds and the rationalizations of his cover-ups erupt. Having "ignored" the shipment of defective planes to the Air Force that resulted in the deaths of 21 pilots, Joe says he was building the business for his sons. "I did it for you" is his excuse.
Then there's Lee Bryant's crafty display of charm-as-camouflage in the role of Kate, delusional wife and monster mother, who knows that what keeps her family together is a necessary lie. Both Joe and his unseen partner, the fall guy, represent the other side of "the little man," Miller's oft-repeated phrase that would reach a classic consummation in Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman."
As neighboring supporting players, Susan Aston seethes (also charmingly) with the resentment of Sue, the good doctor's acquisitive wife, and Sarah Baker gives a graceful performance that won't submit to the usually overdone giggles that overtake Lydia next door. Daniel McDonald as the Kellers' idealistic son, Holly Cate as his fiancee and Brian Dykstra as her brother are in sizzling dramatic concert.
It's as if "All My Sons" were orchestrated, all sections in tune. Ms. Lee's complete interpretation, lucid and nonjudgmental, underscores Miller's themes -- retribution, purification and responsibility to the universe -- in an engrossing and powerful staging of a heartbreaking drama. If only it could be dismissed as a period piece from which we could turn away, untouched, unbothered and removed from the inconvenience of reflection.

HEADLINE: Learning How to Be a Full-Time Mother

BYLINE: By DARICE BAILER 

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER

 BODY:
LIZ FOREST of New Rochelle was an economist with an economics consulting firm. She hired a nanny and continued to work after her first child, Jocelyn, was born. During her second pregnancy, Ms. Forest panicked.
There were too many evening and weekend requirements. "I didn't know how I was going to pull it off, with all the demands of home," Ms. Forest said. 
 But quit work and become a full-time mother? "I was really afraid that I couldn't do it," Ms. Forest said, "that I couldn't handle both kids and find time to still be myself."
Then Ms. Forest discovered an announcement for Female, a national support group for "formerly employed mothers at the leading edge," or women making the transition from paid employment to full-time motherhood.
"I couldn't wait to get home and call," Ms. Forest said.
Ms. Forest, 32, joined the Westchester chapter. She is a member of a support group at the cutting edge of a new kind of feminist movement that advocates government and business support for women trying to balance family and work.
Female members are well educated, bright and articulate. They are former lawyers, college professors, sales managers, controllers or research scientists. They loved their careers and felt good about their work. They brought home paychecks that were a significant part of the family income. Those paychecks contributed to their feelings of independence and self-worth.
Female meets twice a month in Westchester. On the first Tuesday, there is a guest speaker or an opportunity for discussion at United Hospital Medical Center here. On the third Tuesday, there is a mother's night out.
Speakers cover such topics as part-time work, skills of being a parent, nutrition, exercise and the best time to return to full-time employment. During open discussion nights, members share advice on issues of concern. Sandie Conner, 34, of Larchmont and Valorie Luther-Mubanda, 32, of New Rochelle are the group co-leaders.
Ms. Conner was a controller of a bank subsidiary in Boston. Bedtime fears are her latest challenge. Her son Matthew, 4, keeps waking her up at night, afraid of monsters in his bedroom. How do the other women handle that? Ms. Conner wondered at the last meeting.
The women offered advice. Suzanne Page, 34, of Hastings-on-Hudson told of giving up her career as a research scientist. "I could never have predicted how sad I would feel," Ms. Page said.
As for Ms. Forest, "No one could have told me how challenging it was going to be until I was home doing it myself, how time consuming and difficult a job it was," she said.
These days, Ms. Forest takes pride in just making a trip to the post office with her daughters, Jocelyn, 20 months, and Gabrielle, 3 months.
Twenty years ago, Ellen Fried was a typical Barnard College student, a serious overachiever -- intellectual and intent on pursuing a professional career. She said she was astounded when, a few years later, a Fordham Law School classmate told her she was taking up a man's spot in law school when she would end up being supported by her husband.
Back then, Ms. Fried would have argued that she could support herself, that she didn't go to college to stay home. But in November, Ms. Fried quit work as a litigation lawyer for the State Attorney General's office. She now stays home in New Rochelle, plugging in Barney videotapes for her son, Benjamin, 1. She watches as Benjamin runs his toy train up and over the family dog and makes play dates for herself, Benjamin and the dog.
Like the other members of Female, Ms. Fried said she missed the intellectual challenges and excitement of her former job -- and the paycheck. But work can wait, she said. "Nothing is as important as being with Benjamin right now," Ms. Fried added. "I can't go back to his being this age."
Yet Ms. Fried questions her decision to be a full-time mother, especially when bills show up or Benjamin drives her to distraction. "I question if I made the right decision every time I talk to somebody at work and they tell me about something they did that's exciting, and all I've done is watch Barney for the millionth time," she said.
Ms. Forest has her up and down days, too. "I have days when I think I cannot absolutely do this another day," she said. "And there are days when I think I cannot imagine leaving these kids at home." She is jealous of her husband. "He goes out into the adult world," Ms. Forest said. "He takes a lunch and converses with other adults. At this stage, a big day for me is going out to the mall or going to the grocery store."
Ms. Conner worked while her children -- Brian, 6, and Matthew -- were younger. It is easier for her to be home right now. "I find that the quality of our family time is clearly much better because on the weekends all we do is stuff for the four of us," Ms. Conner said -- for example, going with her husband and her boys on skating outings or to a children's play.
Childhood is fleeting, and Ms. Conner treasures her time with her boys. And yet, she loved her former job.
Ms. Luther-Mubanda did, too. She misses the excitement of sales, but she relishes her time at home with Jerelyn, 1. She puts her former career talents to work leading Female, and networks for the future with her new community of friends.
Like other members, Ms. Luther-Mubanda said she planned one day to return to work.
Whereas women once wanted to have it all, juggling motherhood and careers, Ms. Luther-Mubanda may be echoing the sentiments of a new generation. "I will have it all," Ms. Luther-Mubanda said with a smile, "just at separate times."
More information about Female may be obtained by calling Ms. Conner at 833-0943 or Ms. Luther-Mubanda at 633-1513.

HEADLINE: Anti-Smoking Code Faces Legal Hurdle

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER'S tough anti-smoking ordinance, adopted less than two weeks ago by the County Board of Health, is already facing a legal challenge from restaurateurs and tavern owners. And even if it clears that hurdle, the amendment to the Health Code -- considered one of the strictest in the state -- may be quickly superseded by a weaker bill out of Albany intended, in part, to ease the economic impact of no-smoking policies on the tourism and hospitality industries.
But those who support Westchester's stricter stance are also wasting little time. They are mounting an intense lobbying campaign in the State Legislature to quash the pending bill, which would undo the efforts of many local jurisdictions to curb smoking. 
 In particular, the anti-smoking groups have taken issue with language in the proposed state law that says "the hospitality and tourism industries are vital to New York's economy" and adds that restrictions put into effect by localities are "confusing, burdensome and costly."
"It may be a money issue for some groups, but it's a health issue for us," said Lillian R. Jones, a spokeswoman for the Westchester division of the American Cancer Society, one of the groups fighting passage of the state proposal.
She said the Federal Food and Drug Administration has labeled tobacco a Class A carcinogen, equal to asbestos and radon. And the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has reported that tobacco kills more Americans each year than alcohol, cocaine, crack, heroin, car accidents, homicide, suicide, fires and AIDS combined.
Smarting under the suggestion that financial concerns should dictate how public health issues are addressed, Dr. Douglas G. Aspros, president of the county's Board of Health, said last week, "We're not the Board of Economics, we're the Board of Health."
Just before the Board of Health voted 9 to 1 to adopt the newest restrictions, Dr. Aspros spurned a request from County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke to wait until passage of the statewide regulation.
The state proposal, which has gained the support of the tobacco industry, is also backed by State Senator Nicholas A. Spano and State Senator Guy J. Velella, both Republicans from Yonkers.
Dr. Aspros said the increasing trend nationwide is to restrict smoking in public places and Westchester is following suit. He said that in most cases, New York's health laws set minimum standards and counties have been allowed to enact stricter codes. Among other things, the Board of Health is opposed to the pre-emptive nature of the state's anti-smoking proposal.
By contrast, many who criticize the county's tough restrictions and similar ordinances adopted in New York City and Nassau County, argue that the smoking issue extends far beyond health concerns.
"If everyone is so worried about secondhand smoke, then why not ban it in the home?" said Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, which represents 5,000 eating and drinking establishments.
Restaurant owners say they will challenge the County Board of Health's new ordinance in court.
Albert J. Pirro, a White Plains lawyer hired to represent the restaurateurs and tavern owners, contended that the board had violated open-meeting laws and failed to draw up an environmental assessment of the ordinance's impact. He also said the County Board of Legislators and not the Board of Health should have voted on the new restriction.
On all three points, Dr. Aspros disagreed, saying that his board "followed the letter of the law and more."
The suit is being prepared for filing in State Supreme Court in White Plains.
Besides the arguments offered in the suit, restaurant and tavern owners say their industry should be left alone to regulate itself and respond to marketplace demands. The owners contend that they are being subjected to undue interference by government.
A placard carried by a picket outside Health Department headquarters in Hawthorne before the county's Board of Health voted on Feb. 29 read: "Mind your own business. Let us mind ours!"
The restaurateurs estimate that about 25 percent of diners want to smoke, and they say that by law most eating establishments already have separate sections to accommodate smokers and nonsmokers. New York State's Clean Indoor Air Act limits smoking in most public places, including stores, schools, taxis, work sites and most restaurants. Smoking is allowed only in private homes, bars, some hotel rooms, tobacco businesses, limousines under private hire, some box seats in indoor arenas and restaurants with 51 or fewer seats. It is also permitted at private social functions.
Those opposing the new county law also say that many owners of small restaurants are struggling to get by and that the law puts Westchester's restaurateurs at a disadvantage.
"It makes it harder for us when the smoking laws in nearby counties aren't as strict," said Brian Silverman, the owner of the Louisiana Cajun Cafe in Dobbs Ferry.
"What's next?" he said. "Are health officials here going to ban red meat too? They're making it impossible for us to compete."
The new code passed by the County Board of Health, which is to go into effect on July 1, bans smoking in all eating areas of restaurants, regardless of the size of the establishment. In that respect the law is stricter than one passed in New York City, which does not prohibit smoking in restaurants with fewer than 35 seats.
On Long Island, anti-smoking laws permit restaurants to set up smoking sections.
The Westchester code says that smoking may be allowed in a bar area so long as customers are not waiting there to be seated. Food can also be served in the bar so long as the food service constitutes less than 40 percent of the bar's gross sales.
The board is also considering an outright ban on smoking in bars and taverns.
The bill pending in committee in the State Legislature to set uniform standards for smoking in restaurants and taverns statewide says the owner of a food-service establishment must designate a contiguous nonsmoking area "sufficient to meet customer demand and may not determine that no demand exists."
It says that if 75 percent of the establishment's indoor seating is designated nonsmoking, then customer demand is considered to be met. But it also says that a designation of less than 75 percent does not "create the presumption of noncompliance."
Senator Spano said the proposal for a uniform law was "not designed to put tourism and hospitality before the health and welfare of the state" but rather to balance both sides' needs.
He predicted that the Legislature would eventually adopt a measure that was more restrictive than the current proposal. "This is just a starting point," he said. "We're willing to negotiate."
At the New York City offices of the cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris, a spokeswoman, Mary E. Coughlin, said the company was in favor of a statewide law.
"Our position is that business owners should determine their own policies, based on customer preferences," she said.
Representing the other side, a spokesman for the Coalition on Smoking or Health, which represents the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association, said the Washington-based organization would lobby against the State Legislature's proposal.
"Given New York's prominence in taking the lead in tobacco control, we will work very hard to see that those efforts are not weakened in any way," said Peter Fisher, the spokesman.
He added that similar pre-emptive state measures have overturned local smoking ordinances in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
But last year, pre-emptive legislation introduced in 30 state legislatures passed in only 4 states.
"We've begun to see a turnaround, some successes," Mr. Fisher said. "But the problem is that we have to spend all of our efforts in blocking preemptive bills, and that diverts our attention from developing stronger measures."

Charging Late Fees In a Co-op

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
OF all the duties that befall a co-op's board of directors -- from deciding when to redecorate the lobby to determining how to refinance the underlying mortgage -- one of the most frustrating is also the most mundane: making sure the maintenance gets collected.
Indeed, co-op lawyers and managers say they frequently get anguished calls from boards in buildings with maintenance arrears rapidly approaching critical mass. In many cases, they say, a board in such a predicament wants to adopt drastic measures -- like imposing penalties on delinquent shareholders. 
 "That just happened in one of our buildings," said Ronni Lynn Arougheti, president of Heron Ltd., a Manhattan real estate management company. "The board wanted to charge shareholders $50 a month if they were late with their maintenance payments. But when I looked at the proprietary lease, I discovered they couldn't do it."
In fact, the situation described by Mrs. Arougheti is more the exception than the rule. The exception is not with respect to the unpaid maintenance -- that is more common than many boards wish. What was unusual is that the board asked before it acted. All too often, co-op lawyers say, boards adopt resolutions imposing late fees even though the proprietary lease gives them no authority to do so.
"The issue revolves around the question of when and if the co-op board can act on its own," said Stanley E. Margolies, a Manhattan co-op lawyer.
Mr. Margolies said that most proprietary leases contain language that sets the penalty that may be imposed on shareholders who fail to pay their maintenance charges. Some establish a set interest rate on the overdue amount while others refer to the maximum interest rate allowable. That, however, raises two issues: first, with the matter having been addressed in the proprietary lease, it is doubtful that the board would have any legal authority to impose a different penalty without amending the proprietary lease itself.
And second, it seems there is significant confusion regarding just what the maximum legal rate of interest is. For example, in a case decided last November, no fewer than four different "legal interest rates" were discussed.
After a court-appointed referee imposed an annual interest rate of 19.56 percent on maintenance-charge arrearages, the lawyer for the defendant in the case insisted that the maximum rate permitted by statute was only 9 percent.
The judge hearing the case, however, after noting that the civil usury limit of 16 percent would be inapplicable because civil usury applied only to loans, ruled that the highest legal rate would be 25 percent, the limit under the criminal usury law.
The decision is being appealed.
"We advise most co-ops that what they should do is amend their proprietary lease so they can charge whatever interest rate is the highest possible rate at the time," Mr. Margolies said.
Some lawyers, however, say that imposing interest on unpaid maintenance charges is little more than a slap on the wrist. In most cases, they say, more persuasive measures are warranted.
"Even if you charge 25 percent a year, that's only about 2 percent a month," said James Samson, a Manhattan co-op lawyer. "Two percent on a $1,000-a-month maintenance charge is 20 bucks. You think 20 bucks is going to make a deadbeat shareholder pay on time?"
Mr. Samson said he advised co-op boards that want to charge late-payment penalties to do so in a way permitted by the proprietary lease -- even if that means amending the lease. Moreover, he said, the late-payment penalty should be significant enough to compel compliance while flexible enough to account for the occasional check lost in the mail.
"You've got to fit the penalty to the crime," he said. "Maybe what you do when somebody's one month in arrears is not the same as what you do when they're six months behind."
Herb Rose, a co-op consultant in Mount Vernon, N.Y., agreed.
"I've found that if the penalty is too low, shareholders have a tendency to ignore it," Mr. Rose said. "But if it's too high, they have a tendency to challenge it in court."
Mr. Rose said that a monthly late-payment penalty of $40 to $50 seems to be a good compromise for most buildings.
Arnie Zabinsky, president of Elm Management Associates Inc., said that another way to encourage shareholders to keep their maintenance payments current was to hit them where it hurts most -- not in their pockets, but in their parking spaces.
"Yank the cars," Mr. Zabinsky said. "The mere threat to terminate a parking license is one of the most effective collection strategies I've ever seen."
In many co-ops, he said, the right to a parking space is governed by a separate agreement. Often, he said, the agreement contains a clause that permits the board to revoke the shareholder's right to use the parking space if maintenance payments are not kept current.
"I've seen shareholders who would think nothing of a dispossess notice run to get their checkbook if they think they're going to lose their parking space," Mr. Zabinsky said. "It's sad but true -- an unexplained phenomenon."
At the other end, Mr. Zabinsky said, lies a more benign strategy -- reminding shareholders that they are cooperators.
"The common denominator in buildings that have no problem is a sense of community," Mr. Zabinsky said. "The board makes shareholders feel that they're part of the community and that they all have a stake in the community running efficiently."
There are times, however, when threats fail or altruism backfires. In such cases more drastic measures are in order.
"All too often co-ops allow people to go into arrears as a political favor," said Mr. Rose. "But if a board is serious about collecting maintenance, they have to be diligent, send out their notices on time, and be willing to put up with some unpleasantness and take people to eviction after a period of time."
Generally, Mr. Rose said, he advises boards to send a delinquency notice when a payment is 10 days late, then another 10-day notice when the second month's payment is late, and, after 45 days, to refer the matter to a lawyer for eviction.
"Shareholders talk to each other," Mr. Rose said. "If one person gets away without paying, you soon find you have eight or nine people who aren't paying. But if you play hardball with the first one, the others fall into line."
While such a management philosophy might sound harsh, Mr. Rose said, such is the reality of community living.
"It's like everybody is going out to dinner together," he said. "If you don't pay your part of the check, is it right that somebody else picks up the tab?"

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Eichner Begins $40 Million Conversion at Park Central;
On 7th Ave., Half Hotel, Half Time-Share Condo

 BODY:
Construction began last week on a $40 million conversion of half the 26-story Park Central Hotel into New York City's first time-share condominium. Ian Bruce Eichner, the developer, said he plans to keep the eastern half of the building as a "lower-end hotel" with its entrance on Seventh Avenue. The western half will be a 360-unit time-share operation called the Manhattan Club, with a new entrance on 56th Street.
Mr. Eichner said the initial price for seven days' use a year of a 650-square-foot one-bedroom would be $15,000; a two-bedroom will be $23,000. Annual fees would average $575, including real estate taxes. 
 Mr. Eichner, the developer of the Cityspire building on West 56th Street and what is now the Bertelsmann Building at 1540 Broadway, both taken over by other owners in the wake of the real-estate recession, is now also developing 121 apartments in a former warehouse at 80th Street and Third Avenue. A plan for a Toys 'R' Us store in the Third Avenue building has been the subject of continuing legal controversy.
The Sheraton hotel chain, which held the first mortgage for a syndicate that failed in the early 90's, agreed to hold the mortgage for the time-share project for Mr. Eichner, who agreed to pay $60 million -- $20 million more than the next highest bidder, he said. Sales are targeted to begin May 15, after a $2 million transformation of the lobby (from 1980's Egyptian to 1990's beige marble), the construction of two model apartments and a cleaning of the 1925 Tuscan Renaissance facade -- a striking melange of arches, bas relief squirrels, deer and pelicans and Corinthian half columns that, until last week, was hidden by gold-colored aluminum panels.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Sales Help Other Boroughs

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
IT is a script to delight home sellers, buyers wobbling on the fence and, of course, brokers: The residential real-estate engine that is Manhattan will churn up a wave that ripples through the other boroughs.
Right now, industry analysts say, it's just a wavelet, with sales of smaller Manhattan co-ops and condominiums creating a bit of a swell for the first time this decade. And whether and when the entire script plays out remains open to debate, subject as the real-estate scene always is to such pivotal and unpredictable performers as mortgage rates and job creation. 
 But even if the wave does rise, there are those who see worrisome counter-currents on the far horizon -- global forces like the computer-driven diffusion of office jobs from the core of central cities.
"Right now there are companies in Manhattan using data processors in the Caribbean," said Dr. George Sternlieb, the retired founder of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. "This is decentralization, 21st-century style, and in time it will have serious consequences for the real estate market."
For the near term, at least, there is optimism. "Everything in Manhattan is picking up," said Arthur Zabarkes, dean of the Real Estate Institute at New York University. "The big stuff, large apartments, special apartments, those were in demand even in '91, when people said the sky was falling. There were so few of them, and rich people were still rich.
"But now the rental market is as strong as ever," Dean Zabarkes said, "and there's starting to be movement in studios and one-bedrooms. In my view, it's going to be a straightforward ripple, with the major wave created in Manhattan."
Evidence of strengthening in the boroughs outside of Manhattan already exists. Prices of single-family homes, an indicator of demand, rose through most of the Bronx and Queens last year, with particularly potent performances in Riverdale and Eastchester and in southeast Queens. In Brooklyn and on Staten Island, however, prices slackened.
At the same time, condominiums -- which represent about 29 percent of the Manhattan sales market -- held their ground last year with sales increasing slightly and prices dropping a bit.
"The fact that Manhattan is coming back, we all agree to," said Jacques Gordon, an economist with LaSalle Partners, a commercial real estate investment and management firm. "The question is if and when it will trickle out to the boroughs."
The wave theory, naturally, is endorsed by other industry representatives, but also supported by data. "The market is driven from the top down, and there is still strong demand for large apartments," said Alan J. Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, a brokerage company in Manhattan. "At the lower end, studios and one-bedrooms, it's essentially a buyer's market, and there are a number of factors contributing to an increase in sales." The key factor, Mr. Rogers said, is a mortgage interest rate hovering in the favorable 7 percent range.
Another potent factor, said Lawrence Sicular, director of the appraisal division at Brown, Harris, Stevens, has been the tight rental market. "The smaller one-bedroom and two-bedrooms in the $100,000 to $200,000 range were hurt badly in the early 90's," Mr. Sicular said. "But now, with rents so high, those apartments are cheaper to own -- sometimes nearly equivalent before taxes, and certainly cheaper after tax deductions. Buyers need to analyze that on an apartment-by-apartment basis."
The tightness in the high end of the co-op market can be attributed, at least in part, to a squeeze between a stock market that has climbed from below 4,000 to over 5,500 in just the last year and proposals for a drop in the capital gains tax. "With the stock market so strong," said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, a brokerage firm, "we're flooded with buyers from the financial community with their fistfuls of cash, spending their bonuses on larger apartments."
Meanwhile, she said, talk in Washington of lowering the capital gains tax to 20 percent "is discouraging large-apartment owners from listing their apartments now, which makes the current shortage worse."
According to the 1995 Manhattan Cooperative Sales Report of the New York Board of Realtors, which includes data from more than 20 brokerage firms, 1,923 co-op sales were reported to the board last year, up from 1,703 in 1994. Board officials said those sales represent about a third of all transactions in Manhattan and almost two-thirds of the sales between 57th and 110th Streets, where most co-ops are located.
Most sales were in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range -- meaning smaller apartments -- which had the effect of lowering the median price for all co-ops. "It has been historically true that price per room for studios and one-bedrooms is significantly less than the price per room for three-bedroom and larger," said Deborah Beck, executive vice president of the Board of Realtors, because the rooms are often smaller and the apartments have fewer amenities. The median price per room for apartments sold in Manhattan during 1995 was $72,143, compared with $81,250 in 1994.
A T the same time, only 5 percent of the sales reported to the board in 1995 involved apartments selling for $1 million or more, while those apartments constituted 16 percent of all transactions in 1994. That reflected a buyer's market at the low end and a continuing seller's market at the top.
An advantage for sellers on the low end was a more rapid sale. "In 1993, the first year of our report," Ms. Beck said, "these smaller apartments took 9.8 months from first listing to closing. In 1995, the average was down to 6.5 months for smaller units." Average time on the market for all size units in 1995 was 6.9 months, compared to 7.8 months in 1994.
Divining real estate trends by the numbers is a murky exercise, at best. To begin with, co-op sales are not officially recorded because, technically, they are securities transactions involving the selling of shares, and not transfers of title. Condominium sales, however, are officially recorded. As a result, studies of co-op data compiled by the Real Estate Board and by appraisal concerns and brokerage houses do not claim to include all transactions in the market.
Sales of single-family homes are reported by local realty boards, based on numbers from their multiple-listing services. But not all real estate agents are members of the boards, and not all sales in a given area are recorded. And one board may use median prices -- meaning that half of the sales are above that figure and half below -- while others calculate an average. Still, the numbers, along with anecdotal impressions, provide indications of market patterns.
In its Manhattan Market Report for 1995, Douglas Elliman surveyed sales of co-ops between the Battery and 96th Street. The Douglas Elliman report, prepared by the appraisal concern Miller Samuel Inc. based on its own data and Douglas Elliman listings, surveyed sales of co-ops between the Battery and 96th Street. Purchase prices below $75,000 were not included in the sample; unlike in the other boroughs, there are few apartments available in Manhattan for less than that figure.
Like the Board of Realtors report, the Elliman survey showed an increase in sales over 1994 and a decrease in prices. There were 2,981 apartments sold in 1995, up from 2,274 the year before, the report said. The average price, however, dropped significantly, to $436,825 from $537,530 in 1994.
The Elliman report also indicated that the decrease in average prices can be attributed to increased studio and one-bedroom sales. For 1995 the Elliman report recorded 215 studio sales, compared with 115 in 1994. The report noted 961 one-bedroom apartment purchases for 1995, compared with 562 the year before. Sales of apartments with four or more bedrooms, however, dropped to 116 from 150 in 1994. The average price per room in 1995 was $80,100, down from $90,115 the year before, the survey said.
The same pattern was apparent in data contained in the Corcoran Report, a survey of sales over $75,000 below 96th Street in Manhattan, taken from deals brokered by the Corcoran Group and other concerns as well as appraisals by Mitchell, Maxwell & Jackson Inc. The report tracked 5,651 sales in 1995, up from 4,364 in 1994, and found that average prices dropped to $420,000 from $437,000 the year before.
In 1995, the Corcoran Report recorded the sales of 2,692 studio and one-bedroom apartments, a marked increase from 1,867 in 1994, while sales of apartments with four or more bedrooms rose slightly, from 133 in 1994 to 141 last year.
Condominium sales in Manhattan, according to Yale Robbins Inc., a real estate research firm, rose slightly last year, to 2,455 from 2,424 in 1994, while the average price dropped to $337,871 from $354,786. There are approximately 53,000 condominium apartments in Manhattan and about 180,000 co-ops.
Tales of two transactions paint a picture of a strengthening current market. One involves a couple who upped their bid by $125,000 without even knowing whether they needed to; the other is about a 60-cent bidding margin.
On Feb. 8, a four-bedroom townhouse on West 19th Street went on the market for $1.1 million. "A couple walked in and immediately bid the full asking price" on the day it the house was listed, a Thursday, Ms. Corcoran said. The seller accepted, issued a contract later that day and "the buyers, aware that it was a hot market, signed the contract right away," Ms. Corcoran said. "Friday, they heard nothing, despite several calls through their broker."
On Saturday, when they revisited the townhouse, they encountered another couple inspecting the place. "They panicked," Ms. Corcoran said, "didn't get any sleep Saturday and Sunday night." On Monday, they instructed their broker to raise their bid by $125,000 -- to $1.25 million -- "without even knowing whether there were any other bids." Four hours later, they found out that, in fact, their higher bid had been matched, so they raised again, to $1,250,000, "and received the signed contract that afternoon," Ms. Corcoran said.
Another transaction, Ms. Corcoran said, involved "a beautifully renovated one-bedroom on East 79th Street." To determine an asking price, the broker surveyed sales in the building during the last year, including one the previous week, "and there had not been a sale of a one-bedroom for over $200,000, ever." The broker listed the apartment at $195,000. Four offers came in the first day, all over the asking price.
"When the broker consulted with the seller on the happy dilemma, the seller instructed the broker to ask each person for a financial statement, a list of references and a written bid with a 10 percent deposit," Ms. Corcoran said. The apartment sold for $235,000.60. "The 60 cents was added on because the buyer was fearful that someone else might bid the same price.
"It points to the fact that mint-condition apartments are commanding an extreme premium," Ms. Corcoran said, "and that smaller units are catching up to the upper end. It's trickling down into the less expensive segments of the market."
WHETHER the trickle has crossed rivers is difficult to gauge.
There are hints of movement in Queens, where there were 4,280 sales of single-family homes last year, said Randy Kaplan, an official of the Long Island Board of Realtors, slightly up from 4,212 in 1994. Median prices of single-family homes remained at $165,000.
Co-op sales in Queens -- where about 120,000 units have been converted since 1982 -- also rose, while prices slipped. There were 376 co-op sales reported to the board in 1995, up from 322 in 1994, while the median price dropped to $45,000 from $50,000.
There are in Queens, in the words of Dean Zabarkes at N.Y.U., "micro-pockets that are booming, like Flushing, mostly with immigrants, renting, buying, buying commercial, bringing in very hard-working people who are succeeding." And, as Dr. Sternlieb said, "There are enclaves that are strong: Astoria, a powerhouse, and Forest Hills, somewhat."
Indeed, by an entirely different method of measuring the market, "Queens, actually, is looking pretty strong," said Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University and a founder of Case Shiller Weiss, a real estate statistics firm in Cambridge, Mass.
Case Shiller Weiss has devised a repeat-sale index to track fluctuations in prices. The survey is based on a table showing the average price of all single-family homes sold in zip code areas year by year. To determine price fluctuations in 1995, for example, the survey took the purchase price of each home sold in each zip code area during the year just ended, compared it to the price that the house brought the last time it was sold and then, using the annual index, adjusted the earlier purchase price to what it likely would have been had it sold in 1994. The survey does not cover Manhattan, where there are few single-family homes.
Of 57 zip codes in Queens, only two showed price declines of 2 percent or more, with 12 showing increases of 4 percent or more, including nine in Jamaica, the survey showed. The nine in Jamaica included several areas with large minority populations. "Price increases show no color barriers," Professor Shiller said.
"Flushing and Long Island City performed much better than in 1994," he said, "when there were a lot of declines of more than 2 percent in those areas." Last year, in Flushing, 21 zip codes demonstrated price appreciation, although only one experienced an increase of over 4 percent.
If Queens performed well, the Bronx held its own. Of the 25 zip codes in the Bronx, only one showed a decline of more than 2 percent last year; three showed increases of 4 percent or more. The Bronx Board of Realtors reported 615 single-family home sales last year, at an average of $156,660. But 1995 was the first year the Bronx board compiled data, so there were no comparison figures.
In Brooklyn, where there is no local board to compile data, the Case Shiller Weiss survey showed that 27 of 36 zip codes experienced price drops of more than 2 percent last year, and none demonstrated price increases. "The thing about Brooklyn that strikes me is that it was also relatively weak in 1994," Professor Shiller said, "so it's a consistent picture of weakness."
Statistics for Staten Island were somewhat contraditory, underscoring the lack of precision among various techniques used to calculate housing data. According to Charles Staro, executive vice president of the New York State Association of Realtors, 857 homes were sold on Staten Island in 1995, a drop from 887 in 1994, while the average sale price was $159,680, compared with $155,980 in 1994. According to the Case Shiller Weiss survey, however, Staten Island experienced what would appear to be widespread depreciation in 1995, with 11 of 12 zip code areas showing price decreases of more than 2 percent.
Professor Shiller pointed out that Staten Island "did well the year before," with seven of 12 areas showing price increases in the 2 to 4 percent range. "They had a strong year in 1994, so this looks like a market correction, and may not be of any long-run consequence."
"I wouldn't get alarmist about these numbers," Professor Shiller said. "We've seen areas where prices have gone down 10 percent a year. These are not big declines."
But why would virtually an entire borough experience price decreases? "I can only guess," the professor said. "Nobody understands these things. If you look at the boom in the Northeast in the mid-80's, there were regions where prices doubled in a few years, and really nobody knows why. I think it's mass psychology. Recessions, booms -- you'll see a million reasons."
Dean Zabarkes holds to his Manhattan-as-engine model. "You get a boom in Manhattan and it gets so hot it moves to the boroughs," he said. "But then when it declines it goes back to the real estate maxim: 'location, location, location.'
"Meaning, if I've got a converted building in Flushing and one on the East Side, I expect my East Side studio to get $200,000 and my Flushing studio to get $100,000," the dean said. "But when the market collapses, and there's a lot of stuff available, the buyer will say, 'I'd rather be in Manhattan for $90,000 than Flushing for $65,000.' And that's what happens every time there's a market collapse -- the secondary locations get destroyed."
IF the labor force in Manhattan grows slowly, "it could be another four years before you see a genuine tightness in the borough market," Dean Zabarkes said. "We're still burning up the inventory in Manhattan, but it's just a matter of speed."
Dr. Sternlieb is not so sure. Long-term factors may come into play.
Given the global computer revolution, he said, "there are questions about whether we need the scale of the paperwork factories that we call offices."
The professor is also concerned about cutbacks in the health-service industry, which became the employer of last resort for the city's lower-paid workers after the manufacturing sector withered, and about the effects of corporate downsizing. "We're still waiting for the cutbacks from the Chase-Chemical Bank merger," he said, in which approximately 12,000 jobs are to be eliminated.
So, despite the upturn in the real estate market, Dr. Sternlieb wonders whether the economy has "caught cold, or is this a wasting disease?" And he worries that city officials and planners are not taking long-term factors into account, given that "the future has no votes."
With that stew of immediate prospects and future uncertainties, Dr. Sternlieb sees "a new dynamism operating, so that the real estate market, as always, is stuck between greed and fear, and never more so than this coming year."

 BODY:
Arthur J. Rocque Jr. of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection was being overly kind in his assessment that some of the opponents to the United States Navy dredging of the Thames River were "extremely economical with the truth." ("Navy Facing Criticism in Toxic Dumping," Feb. 4). Sadly, the article appears afflicted with a similar parsimony. 
Reading the article, one might think that the states of New York and Connecticut and the five Federal agencies involved in the project evaluation and authorization wanted to destroy the Eastern Long Island and Fishers Island Sound ecosystem. I assure you, that is not true.
For more than 20 years the public has been aware that if the Seawolf class of submarines was built the channel between the construction site and the submarine base would require deepening. A decade ago the channel was deepened for the Trident class of submarines. Uncertainty about the actual construction date and dimensions of the Seawolf class led the Navy to postpone full deepening and settle for what was needed at that time.
More than five years ago planning for berthing the Seawolf class began. A National Environmental Policy Act evaluation was performed. The process included public meetings, extensive impact analyses and documentation. The products of those efforts reside in the public libraries of all the involved towns.
A few of the article's inaccuracies merit comment: The project began in October, 1995, not 1994.
The Thames River Basin has never merited the description "heavily industrialized." With the exception of the submarine activities and ship building, now largely defunct, the major employers are a pharmaceutical company and gambling. However, the river supports valuable fishery resources.
The cap designed for this project is at least a half-meter thick. Monitoring of the cap placement occurs in-situ during its creation. The ratio of cap to capped material placed is about 2-to-1.
The river basin's interim sediment rating system is for dredged material disposal in Long Island Sound. Mercury testing determines the presence of virtually all mercury in a sample. Mercury is routinely found as a component of native, uncontaminated sediments in Long Island Sound. Geological mercury is not easily taken up by living things. The "moderate" level of the rating system ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 parts per million. With the geological mercury considered, the "available" level can be viewed as low. All these facts are accessible, thanks to the N.E.P.A. process, and were used in the authorization evaluations.
The Navy, in recognition of the unique biological value of the Thames estuary, imposed upon itself a construction window of Oct. 1 to Jan. 31 to perform the work. Its effort was directed at avoiding disturbance of spawning winter flounder. Bad weather and mechanical difficulties jeopardized the schedule. The Navy brought in more dredges to finish the work. That action was fully coordinated and approved.
A tugboat with a 300-foot-long barge in tow, traveling downriver past the United States Coast Guard Academy beneath the Interstate 95 and Amtrak bridges and past the New London downtown areas, even at night, when traveling with the required running lights, does not invoke thoughts of a nefarious activity. Incidentally, each barge has an independent, certified inspector on every trip to insure correct disposal.
Dioxin is a group of compounds that occur naturally as well as from human activity. A thorough analysis of the Thames River Basin was performed, seeking potential human sources. Finding none, a decision was made to forego dioxin testing. I appreciate John H. Thatcher Jr.'s verification of the appropriateness that that decision.
Perhaps Judge Thomas C. Platt "got it right." The project, as designed and implemented, will not cause "irreparable harm" to the public trust resources in the project area.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SUNSET PARK;
Awaiting Hong Kong Exodus

BYLINE: By MARK FRANCIS COHEN 

 BODY:
On a recent rain-rattled afternoon, Shiu Kam Leung was walking down busy Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park, passing the prickly durians that hang in market doorways. For Mr. Leung, the bad-smelling yet sweet-tasting fruit popular in Asia is a harbinger of what he believes will be an economic boom in the neighborhood.
Mr. Leung, a business owner and president of an Eighth Avenue merchants association, left Hong Kong 15 years ago in anticipation of next year's government changeover. Today, he predicts that immigrants from Hong Kong will stream into the neighborhood in the next 500 days. 
 "Oh, 1997 is coming soon, people will see the changes," Mr. Leung said as he strolled by UEE, a video store featuring films from Hong Kong that opened on the shopping strip three months ago. "They come here and they have to pay more. And they will pay in cash."
Residents and business owners of the riot of bakeries and restaurants, markets and video stores rambling down Eighth Avenue often talk about June 1, 1997, when Britain will cede control of Hong Kong to China. Some business owners, anticipating a sudden surge in Cantonese-speaking immigrants this year, have been buying buildings and apartment houses. But many of these investments have gone unrewarded because the influx of immigrants with mounds of cash predicted in some circles has not happened. Some doubt that it ever will.
"People don't understand this community," said Paul Mak, president of the Brooklyn Chinese-American Association, from his office overlooking Eighth Avenue. "The people coming here are low income and if they're going to come from Hong Kong, they already have."
According to city Planning Department statistics, the number of immigrants from Hong Kong peaked in 1991, when 2,042 arrived in the city, and dropped to 1,140 in 1994, the most recent year for which figures are available. And according to Chinese-American community leaders, like Mr. Mak, wealthy immigrants from Hong Kong would be more likely to settle in Manhattan or upscale suburban towns rather than Sunset Park.
Still, that has not halted a rise in real estate prices here. Apartments in Sunset Park that rent for $1,200 a month were half that price five years ago, Mr. Mak said. Other community leaders said it will be years before newcomers begin to make enough money to move into these expensive apartments.
"We anticipate to see more immigrants from now until 1997," said Chang Xie, the Brooklyn branch director of the Chinese American Council. "People keep moving in. But the property value in Sunset Park is going up so fast, it is not affordable for many families."
Real estate agents said rentals are moving, but not at the frenetic pace landlords had anticipated. Many cling to the notion that Hong Kong immigrants are on their way.
"The impact has not started yet," said an agent, Paul K. Yuan, whose office window was shrouded in apartment rental signs. MARK FRANCIS COHEN

HEADLINE: VOICES: FROM THE DESK OF;
A Capitalist Camp in Siberia

BYLINE: By GARY J. JAKACKY; Gary J. Jakacky now teaches economics and statistics to United States military personnel in Iwakuni, Japan, through the Asian division of the University of Maryland.

 BODY:
"Given the international diversification of this company, its enviable record of increasing earnings and the quality of its products, we feel a premium multiple to that of the market makes some sense. But at a 22 multiple of current earnings and projected E.P.S. for 1995 of $2.25 a share, the current $53 price of International Flavors and Fragrances fully reflects its growth potential for the next few years. We recommend investors defer purchase at this time."
(May 20, 1995)
 An analyst's presentation to a group of mutual fund managers? A research report culled from the pages of the Value Line Investment Survey? No, this is an evaluation by Max Bezyradin, a senior business major at Irkutsk State University in Irkutsk, Siberia, on his final examination in the finance course I taught there last spring.
Savvy investors, of course, are no strangers to the concept of international diversification and the triumph of free-market ideology that has been sweeping the globe. Still, the idea of undergraduate students in Russia issuing investment advice -- well, even I was taken aback by the sophistication they had acquired so quickly. 
 During the academic years 1993-94 and 1994-95, I was a professor of economics and statistics at Irkutsk State University, near the world's deepest freshwater lake, Lake Baikal. The trappings of financial civilization seemed worlds away; the nearest stock exchange is in Vladivostok, 2,000 miles east.
But as is the case with much of Russia these days, there is more here than meets the casual eye. In the building housing the joint Siberian-American management program, nearly 200 Russian students -- most of them conversant in English, many also knowledgeable in German or French -- study accounting, international business, finance, literature and American history. And in the computer center, they pore over Lotus spreadsheets, play computer games, send E-mail or surf the Internet -- wired to the world, even in Siberia.
The arrangement is the brainchild of Alexander Diagenov, an energetic professor of mathematics who is now dean of the program. Several years ago he struck a deal between Irkutsk State University and the University of Maryland under which students would mix study of Russian courses, English as a second language and business. They would be rewarded after five years with an undergraduate degree from both universities. Bilingual, educated and with marketable business skills, the students have bright futures in Russia's emerging economy.
"There is no program like it anywhere else in Russia," Mr. Diagenov said.
Ah, but there is the rub. Will the Russian economy emerge? While there are some substantial obstacles that must be overcome, the students express a cautious optimism and want to be ready.
"Since there will be shares in Russian companies that we might want to buy in the near future, can you show us how investment decisions are made in the West?" Larissa Motsenko, a fourth-year student, asked one day last winter.
What followed was a three-week crash course in growth-stock investing that included a real-time investment decision on International Flavors and Fragrances, the New York-based manufacturer. The students were provided with a 15-year chart of price and financial data on the company that came from the Value Line Investment Survey. I provided them with economic data upon which to frame their forecasts. Then they were given an earnings estimate for 1995 and asked to calculate a price-to-earnings ratio they saw as appropriate and to come up with a proper price for the company's shares. From this, they could determine whether it was a suitable investment.
As might be expected, the debate focused on whether the price-to-earnings ratio, then at a lofty 22, was justified in light of the company's earnings stability and product mix. Most students, like Max above, believed that it was not. Pavel Davydenko agreed: "I think the P-E ratio is too high. It's not as if this company writes software or is a computer firm," he said, showing that Russians are as enamored of technology as Americans are.
"And the P-E traditionally has been in the high teens, not the low 20's," said Zena Blinninkova, pointing to the historical data below the price chart. "I would say a P-E of 19 at most" would make it fully valued.
At that level, the price of International Flavors and Fragrances would be about $45 a share, considerably lower than its price of $53 on the day the exam was given. Not a bad call, given that the stock languished for most of last year while the rest of the market advanced more than 30 percent: the shares remain mired around $50.
Like students elsewhere, the Russians in the program worry about their futures in the job market. Most are sponsored in the program by private businesses, who chip in $5,000 a year -- not chicken feed in a country where a family's wage may be a few hundred dollars a month. In exchange, the students agree to work for their sponsor for three years upon graduation.
Perhaps the greatest enemy to Russia and these students' futures is crime. In all Russian cities, Irkutsk included, criminal gangs brazenly and openly shake down businesses and private organizations.
As an assignment, one of my faculty colleagues asked her students to submit proposals for businesses they would like to operate in the Irkutsk region. Students responded with a variety of ideas, from travel agencies to hair salons, from butcher shops to bakeries. In the business plans, though, along with the "costs of goods sold" and "labor costs" and "advertising expenses," nearly all the students had a simple line for "Russian mafia."
One hears all kinds of estimates of the burden that crime places on business, although one of my best third-year students, who carried a loaded pistol in his backpack, was quite knowledgeable and honest about the cost. "Fifty percent of all the profits below one million rubles, and 30 percent of all profits beyond that," he said, as cool and calm as an I.R.S. agent at an audit. In a country still in the throes of a cash economy (every month I received my 750,000-ruble stipend in cash, a pile that required its own drawer in my desk), such extortion is easy to hide.
For all that, most Russians are calmly optimistic that their country will plod through its current difficulties and become, in a few years, another example of a rapidly growing emerging market. It is this challenging, if dangerous, future that the students must soon face head on. Fortunately, if their investment acumen is any guide, they will be well prepared to meet it.

Factory Now a 'Jewel' in the Zone's Crown

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON 

 BODY:
The abandoned Washburn Wire factory, which sprawls for three blocks along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in East Harlem, has become a hot property since the creation of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone.
Representative Charles B. Rangel calls it the zone's "crown jewel." It is also one of its earliest battlegrounds. 
 "You can go out on any street and bump into someone who has been promised that site," said Community Board 11's chairman, Eddie Baca.
On Friday, the Federal Government, which holds a $2.6 million judgment against the property's former owners, tried to auction it off, a move opposed by Mr. Rangel, Assemblyman Francisco Diaz Jr. and just about every East Harlem official and community leader.
After a brief bidding skirmish between a local nonprofit housing group, Hope Community, and a Long Island company, Bloomenfeld Development Group, the Government rejected the high bid, $465,000 from Bloomenfeld. The company said it would continue to pursue the property, possibly for retail development. Its president, Edward Bloomenfeld, said he has met with City University officials about sharing the site but declined to be more specific. Hope Community said it would firm up proposals to use the site for affordable housing.
The city, which holds a $2 million lien on the property, favors a sale to a private developer and opposes turning it over to the Empowerment Zone Development Corporation.
"We thought we should let the marketplace determine what happened with the site," said Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter. "I felt even more strongly about it when I heard there was serious development interest." J.A.

Some Lessons From the 1930's

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
Investors looking for protection in today's volatile market might find refuge in the Dodge & Cox funds, says Susan Paluch, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in Chicago. Dodge & Cox began managing money in the Depression, and the lessons of that era were not lost on the firm.
Its three funds -- Dodge & Cox Balanced, Income and Stock -- are bear market stalwarts, Ms. Paluch said. The stock fund gained 12 percent in 1987, when domestic diversified equity funds rose only 1 percent, on average. Similarly, the income fund lost half as much as the average bond fund in 1994. 
 That doesn't mean that Dodge & Cox investors lose when times are good. All three funds land in the top 20 percent for their objectives for the 3, 5 and 10 years ended Jan. 31.
The secret of the funds, which are team managed, is a value style of investing. The funds favor big, name-brand companies with temporarily depressed stocks. Low-priced financial and cyclical stocks are among the managers' favorites. On the bond side, they look for undervalued issues using an approach that does not involve forecasting interest rates, Ms. Paluch said.
 
New Funds
Keystone Small Company Growth II aims for long-term appreciation by investing in emerging companies with market capitalizations of less than $1 billion. The fund's sales charge is 5.75 percent.
T. Rowe Price Health Sciences invests primarily in companies involved in health care, medicine and life sciences, and it seeks to manage risk by diversifying around the world and in various sectors.
Strong Funds started five funds intended for people saving for retirement: Strong Growth and Income, Equity Income, Small Cap, High Yield Bond and Value.
First American Health Sciences aims for long-term growth by buying stocks of companies that develop, produce or distribute products or services connected with health care or medicine.
 
Getting Dizzy? How to Rebalance
Financial advisers talk about the importance of rebalancing fund portfolios, but many investors have little idea how to do it.
To get people started, Jonathan Pond, a financial planner in Watertown, Mass., has prepared a step-by-step guide and advice.
First, review your target allocation -- that's how much you want in various types of stock funds, bond funds and cash -- and make any desired changes in the percentages. Then summarize the cash value and the percentage of your holdings in each category, like small-company, growth and international funds. If you have three international stock funds, for example, be sure to add them together.
Calculate how much money would have to be added to or subtracted from each investment to bring it back to the target level.
But before making those changes, analyze the tax consequences For example, try to avoid selling securities that would generate a taxable gain, Mr. Pond advised. Look for alternatives, like selling some holdings in a retirement account, that will have few if any tax effects.
You should also consider transaction costs, which can offset any benefits of rebalancing. No-load funds are a good option, as are fund groups that allow switches within the group at no cost.
Rebalancing among several funds is often easier if done in a single fund group or in a brokerage account that combines several groups. Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab & Company, among others, offer such brokerage services.
Most important, don't go overboard, Mr. Pond advises. Rebalancing may involve such a small amount of money that it's not worth your time and effort. If your current allocation is very close to the target, you may not want to bother, Mr. Pond says. For example, if your target for growth funds is 30 percent and your current allocation is 28 percent, you might skip rebalancing. But if your current allocation is 24 percent, you should do it, he says.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Is There a Matisse in Your Future? How to Invest in Aesthetics

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
WILLIAM M. B. BERGER -- like three generations of his family before him -- has done a lot of investing in his time. He began managing money in 1950, earned a reputation as an aggressive-growth investor, and for 20 years served as president of the $3 billion family of mutual funds that bear his name.
Now, at age 70 and still a Berger Funds director, Mr. Berger has discovered a new market: art. In the last several months, "I've bought everything from antiques to an Oriental carpet to furniture to paintings by mostly American artists," he said. 
 What led Mr. Berger to his art-buying spree was a look at the alternatives -- a stock market in the stratosphere and a real estate market likely to suffer as corporate and residential needs shrink. "There's an immense amount of money out there, and it has to go somewhere," he said. After noticing several high prices fetched at a few recent auctions, he concluded that the money was starting to feed the art market. That means there is time to buy while the market is gathering steam but before it overheats.
"I'm an outsider," Mr. Berger said, "but these are the observations of a very old market watcher. This is a very good time to buy art, pricewise."
Art rookie though he is, Mr. Berger appears to be gaining company in the art enthusiasts' camp. Dealers and auction houses that have weathered several lean years -- including a 1991 crash that sent auction sales plummeting by more than 80 percent -- are starting to see good times, if not exactly great ones.
"The market is slowly increasing," said James Goodman, a dealer in 19th- and 20th-century art and president of the Art Dealers Association of America.
Results from the association's Art Show, held this year from Feb. 23 through Feb. 26 at New York's Park Avenue Armory, bear him out. Attendance was flat, and sales of big-ticket items were slow, but dealers said they sold more pieces than they had in five years. Some were more enthusiastic. "It was phenomenal," said Richard York, an American art dealer who in those five days sold four paintings worth $1.2 million.
In their galleries, many dealers say business is up there, too. "We are as busy now as we have been since 1989," said James Berry Hill of Berry-Hill Galleries. Mr. Hill just sold at a profit a Childe Hassam flag painting, once owned by Frank Sinatra, that Berry-Hill bought at auction in 1989 for $3.3 million. Until now, the painting had fetched interest only at lower prices.
In the auction houses, the signs also bode well. Last Tuesday, Sotheby's announced that its net income climbed 61 percent in 1995, to $32.6 million, thanks largely to a 25 percent increase in auction sales, to $1.67 billion -- the best since 1990. Christie's auction sales rose 17 percent in 1995, to $1.47 billion, and its profits, due to be announced this week, are also expected to rise.
Figures for the auctioneers' bellwether semiannual sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, held in New York for two weeks each May and two weeks each November, show even more impressive gains. In 1995 the total jumped to $571.8 million. That is nearly double 1994's $308.3 million, though still a far cry from the peak $1.57 billion of 1989.
Overall prices are starting to rise, too. Although prices are notoriously difficult to determine, because each work of art is unique and because so many transactions are carried out privately, the Daily Telegraph Art 100 index is one indicator. Compiled by Robin Duthy of Art Market Research in London, it tracks auction prices for 100 artists. With inflation adjustments, the index peaked in 1990 at 10,607, crashed and eventually fell to 3,864 in 1994. In January -- the most recent figure -- the index had risen to 4,178.
Investing in art is always dicey. Although several studies show that paintings, sculpture and antiques increase in value over the long term, an individual work may never show a gain. Even Mr. Berger noted, "I'm not doing it to make money, but I don't feel I'm being imprudent to be buying at this point." He believes that he will, at the least, preserve his capital as well as reap aesthetic rewards.
And art does seem to follow fairly predictable cycles, typically lasting about seven years. The rebound is taking a little longer this time, Christopher J. Burge, chairman of Christie's Inc., believes, because the 1989-90 peak was an aberration, fueled by frenetic Japanese buying that stopped completely when the Japanese economic bubble burst.
"We fell further, and it has taken us longer to right the ship," Mr. Burge said. "But we were pulling out nicely by the end of 1995." The recovery looks especially good because the buying is now diversified, coming from Europe, Latin America, the Mideast and Asia. In the down years, most buying came from the United States.
These factors add up to a market that is hearty enough to entice fresh material but is not prohibitively expensive. And that is an open invitation to would-be collectors.
No one is predicting a return to the 1980's, when buying was indiscriminate, any number of bad works fetched good prices and paintings could be bought and sold for a profit in a matter of months. "People are not just throwing tons of money at things," Mr. Burge said. "They're looking hard at quality and getting good advice. They may be paying a bit more to get what they want, but not pie-in-the sky prices."
The art market is really a collection of interrelated markets, and the categories -- Impressionist or Latin American works, for example -- tend to attract separate constituencies and move at their own pace. Right now, the most down-to-earth prices are in contemporary art.
"It's in the doldrums," said Roland Augustine, of the Luhring Augustine Gallery. He didn't sell anything at the Art Show, though he expects to seal a few deals from contacts made there. "It's a great time to buy because you can take your time and negotiate deals," Mr. Augustine said. "Prices are stable, at the same level as a year ago."
Many quality works are selling well in the category. At a recent Gerhard Richter show, Mr. Augustine said, "we had five paintings for sale, and we sold three, each for more than $500,000. That to me is very healthy." He's about to sell another, for $135,000 -- though the last, at $750,000, is still in the gallery's back room.
Many contemporary artists who made their reputations from the postwar years to the 1970's are faring better than later artists. These works by artists of the 1980's and 90's are like initial public offerings. The artists' place in history will not be known for years to come.
Art experts say that the market for Old Masters -- whose decline came later and was shallower than other categories -- is just now beginning to recover. And they forecast continued slow improvement in Latin American art.
Much stronger are the markets for 19th-century European paintings, by artists like Tissot, and for American art, by artists like Prendergast, whose "Figures on the Beach" watercolor is available at Berry-Hill for $325,000. Earlier in the 1990's, "People had the feeling they could walk in and offer a third of what you were asking for something," Mr. York said. "That's not happening anymore. We are selling at, or very close to, what we're asking for paintings."
And the market for top works by Impressionists and 20th-century artists through World War II is strong. On offer at Christie's is a Matisse still life, estimated at $1.5 million to $2.5 million. Another Christie's highlight is a Giacometti sculpture, estimated at $1.2 million to $1.6 million.
Buyers can take heart from a prediction by Mr. Burge. The market "won't go crazy this year, he said. "There'll be strength in the markets that are strong, and improvement in those that have been flat or wobbly. It's a good place for the market to be."

GRAPHIC: Photos: The market is strong for some Impressionist and early 20th-century works. On offer at Christie's is this 1926 Matisse still life, "Les Citrons au Plat d'Etain," estimated at $1.5 million to $2.5 million. "Femme de Venise IX," by the Swiss-born sculptor Alberto Giacometti, is expected to fetch from $1.2 million to $1.6 million. Interest in contemporary art is lagging behind other categories, but some artists are in demand. Gerhard Richter's 1987 painting "Feldweg" is priced at $750,000 at the Luhring Augustine Gallery. American art is doing very well. This 1896-97 watercolor by Maurice Prendergast, "Figures on Beach," carries a $325,000 price tag. Berry-Hill Galleries just sold at a profit Childe Hassam's 1916 painting "The Fourth of July," which it bought at auction in 1989 for $3.3 million. Until now, the painting, which was once owned by Frank Sinatra, had fetched interest only at lower prices.

For Bonds, Notes From the Silver-Lining Crowd

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
BOND fund investors wondering if any air remained in the bubble from last year's rally got their answer on Friday. Prices plunged, erasing six months of gains, and long-term yields topped 6.7 percent, their highest level since August.
The needle that deflated the market was the Government's report that American businesses added twice as many jobs as expected last month. To bond traders, such signs of brisk growth fuel fears that inflation will accelerate. 
 But some bond fund managers say that, just as too many market forecasters were too optimistic at the end of 1995, investors are expressing too much gloom now. And a pair of them -- William Gross of Pacific Investment Management and Fred Quirsfeld of American Express Financial Advisors -- say they continue to find good buys, particularly among mortgage-backed securities and in selected overseas markets.
"We've hit a little bump in the road," Mr. Quirsfeld said. He predicts the current market is in a slight correction similar to that experienced last summer, when rates jumped from 6.5 percent to 7 percent. It is not, he says, the beginning of a protracted slump like that of 1994, when long-term rates rose 2 points, to more than 8 percent.
At the end of Friday's market shake-up, the yield on 30-year Treasuries stood at about 6.72 percent, up from 5.95 percent at the beginning of the year. That left general Government bond funds with an average loss so far this year of 1.93 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund research firm in Chicago. Corporate bonds have recorded similar losses, with general corporate bond funds showing a median loss of 1.86 percent this year.
The returns are no doubt disappointing to investors who recall predictions from market strategists at the end of 1995 that interest rates would continue lower this year. Bond market seers, perhaps more so than their stock market compatriots, tend to use whatever has happened most recently as their guide to the future.
"You have to consider that 1995 was an exceptional year in the bond market -- when everything that could go right did," said Mr. Quirsfeld, who manages the IDS Bond fund, with $3.5 billion in assets. "That was capped by a strong rally at the end of the year, which caused a lot of people to capitulate and go long, even if they didn't feel strongly about it. That kind of set the market up for disappointment."
In the last month, the bond market frowned on several developments. First, the surprising strength of Patrick J. Buchanan, candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, shifted the political debate from a balanced budget to populist topics more dear to the heart of the average American, like growth in wages. Mr. Buchanan's calls for protectionist tariffs also spooked bond investors, who saw in it the seeds of inflation. Surges in commodity prices -- particularly oil -- and signs of economic growth in Japan did not comfort bond traders either.
Even the small interest-rate increases so far have wreaked great damage on holders of the Benham Target Maturity funds, which, not coincidentally, were the biggest gainers among bond funds last year. The Target funds, which invest solely in long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds, are the most volatile bond funds, gaining or losing value in multiple points of return for each percentage-point change in interest rates. This year's losses have wiped out about a third of last year's gains.
Less volatile funds have fared better, however, and in general, bond fund investors should not panic, the fund managers said. "A backup in yields of half a percentage point or so is a normal correction in any kind of bull market," said Mr. Gross, whose firm oversees $76 billion in bond fund assets, including the Pimco funds. "But I can say with extreme conviction that we are not going to resume or mimic the bear market of 1994. A return to 8 percent yields is not in the cards," and total returns for the full year of about 10 percent are still possible.
Both managers say they have revamped several parts of their portfolios in recent weeks, as prices have fallen. Mr. Gross says he has pared his intermediate-term Treasuries since the beginning of the year and picked up a fair amount of Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds.
"In this kind of market, where we don't expect things to change very much, the risk of prepayment diminishes," he said, dismissing the idea that home owners will refinance at lower rates in waves. "Mortgage bonds will probably continue to outperform about everything except high yields."
High-yield and convertible bonds, both of which often track the equity market more closely than the fixed-income sector, are among the few categories of bond funds to have shown much strength this year. High-yield funds, also known as junk-bond funds, have risen an average of about 3 percent.
The sector has been helped this year by continued merger-and-acquisition activity, some of which will allow highly leveraged companies to improve their balance sheets. U S West's bid last month to acquire Continental Cablevision, for example, gave a boost to the junk bonds of several other cable television companies.
And both managers see bargains overseas. "We still like Germany," Mr. Gross said. While German Government bonds fell last week as United States Treasuries declined, Mr. Gross said continued sluggish economic growth in Germany and low inflation made German bonds more attractive than their American counterparts.
Ten-year German Government bonds yielded about 6.51 percent at the end of last week, compared with 6.37 percent for the comparable United States Treasuries.
"Foreign rates are going to be coming down," Mr. Quirsfeld said. And at home, he expects rates to begin to do the same soon. "The fundamentals are positive," he said. Last week's sudden surge in rates, "will be a temporary phenomenon."

Israeli Stocks Hang On Despite Bomb Attacks

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
BOMBS scarcely seem to scare stock markets anymore. Investors appear to calmly go about their business as long as they remain confident that a country's economy will remain strong.
That was certainly the lesson from Dublin, which shrugged off the renewed Irish Republican Army bombing in London last month. The Israeli stock market was not quite so blase about the four Hamas bombings that killed 61 people in the last two weeks, but there was no panicked sell-off as some had feared. 
 The Mishtanim index of the top 100 blue-chip stocks has fallen 1.1 percent, to 206.11, since the bombings began on Feb. 25. And part of that decline reflected not fears for the future of the Middle East peace process but disappointing results from Agan Chemicals, whose shares tumbled 7.25 percent in a day. In the United States, the American Stock Exchange/Oscar Gruss Israel Index of 11 stocks has fallen 3.7 percent, to 158.33, since Feb. 25, although the index did hit its 52-week high a few days after the first two bombings.
It is easy to see why the market took the bombing campaign mostly in its stride. Israel's economic performance remains encouraging. And its export-oriented high-technology companies are already profiting from that famous handshake on the White House lawn three years ago. The Arab boycott is crumbling, and the fast-growing markets of Asia and the Far East are opening to Israeli goods. Exports now account for 30 percent of Israeli corporate profits.
Analysts said that not only would the growing economy help push the Mishtanim index higher this year, but that stocks appeared cheap when compared with the projected earnings of Israeli companies. Some analysts even said peace was no longer an economic issue.
"Israel has already got the main economic benefits of peace" said Robert Goldman, an analyst specializing in Israeli stocks at Josephthal Lyon & Ross in Washington. He expects the Mishtanim index to rise 15 to 20 percent this year. "Peace with Syria and withdrawal from the occupied territories have negligible significance for the economy," he said.
Not everyone goes quite that far. "The peace process is not as important as it was," said Joel Bailey, managing editor of the Giza Investment Letter, a Tel Aviv-based investment guide. "But agreement with Syria and a settlement in the occupied territories would have some incremental value."
Joel Maryles of Furman Selz, a New York brokerage firm specializing in Israeli stocks, added: "The health of the economy is very strong. But there is always some benefit from peace with your neighbors."
Public outrage at the bombings may have made Prime Minister Shimon Peres regret his decision to move up the general election after the assassination of his predecessor, Yitzhak Rabin. But the outcome of that contest is unlikely to affect Israel's rosy economic prospects. The Likud, the conservative opposition party to the Labor Government, "might speed up privatization and cut some research and development grants, but that's it," Mr. Goldman said.
After growing by almost 7 percent last year, the Israeli economy is expected to expand by 6 percent in 1996, helped by a continuing influx of well-educated immigrants and growing trade overseas. Inflation is in single digits, and the Government's budget deficit is likely to be about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product this year.
Not all the news is good. Israel is running a big current account deficit, which swelled to $5.1 billion last year from $2.4 billion in 1994. "It's the main weakness of the economy," Mr Goldman said.
Israel was one of the best-performing emerging markets last year, with a 17 percent rise in dollar terms. At current levels, the Mishtanim index is still below its February 1994 peak of 257.08, though well above the trough of 145.17 it hit in March 1995. Moreover, with average earnings forecast to rise 16 percent this year, the market appears cheap, trading at just 11 times prospective earnings. The comparable figure for the European Union is 14.7.
Americans have a variety of ways to invest in Israel. The closed-end First Israel fund is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, and 70 Israeli or United States companies that do most of their business in Israel are listed on exchanges here. Most trade as regular stocks, but some are American depository receipts.
Mr. Goldman has a list of eight buy recommendations, including Aladdin Knowledge Systems, ECI Telecom and Teva Pharmaceutical. Marcel Houtzager, an analyst with Wanger Asset Management in Chicago who specializes in smaller Israeli companies, likes PEC Israel Economic, a holding company that he said was trading at a discount of more than 30 percent to assets.
Mr Bailey recommends Opal, a semiconductor company, and Elron Electronic Industries, a holding company with investments in high-technology companies that are likely to go public this year. Mr. Maryles favors Gilat Satellite Networks, which makes satellite terminal equipment, and Mercury Interactive, a manufacturer of software testing equipment.

Anybody Want To Buy A Bond?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Sometimes, it matters who has been doing the buying.
Never has that been more important than in the Treasury bond market, circa 1996. The buyers of late have been foreign central banks and a bunch of international speculators who have been seeking a sure thing through a clever trade involving Japanese yen. (More on that later.) 
 Notably absent from the mix have been genuine investors. Mutual funds that invest primarily in Treasuries have not seen net cash inflows since late 1993, notwithstanding last year's rally in bond prices.
It was after the markets closed on Thursday that the Federal Reserve provided the evidence of just how big that swing had been. It said foreign central banks had purchased a record $17.7 billion in Treasuries in the week ended Wednesday. That brought their holdings to $547 billion, also a record.
Then on Friday came the worst day for the bond market in at least 10 years, after a report showing that more people were working than had been expected. In the upside-down world of bonds, that was bad news because it reduces the probability that the Fed will push down short-term rates. But that hardly explains the brutality of the bond plunge, which drove the yield on 30-year Treasuries up a quarter of a percentage point in a single day, to above 6.7 percent.
"This is what happens when the lenders of last resort and the speculators get long the same thing," observed Mike Rouzee, a money manager at the Friends Vilas Fischer Trust Company.
The central bank buying, says James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, has largely been a case of the Bank of Japan buying bucks to keep the yen from rising. It then invests the dollars in Treasury securities.
The Japanese central bank has been trying to keep the yen from rising to avoid injuring Japanese exporters. It has also tried to jump-start the ailing economy by keeping short-term rates very low, at about one-half of 1 percent.
That is where the speculators came in. They borrowed billions of yen, paying that low rate, and put the money into Treasuries. It was a sure thing, so long as the yen did not rise or Treasuries crash.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, where they have been trading bond futures for almost 20 years, Friday was the worst day ever. Prices fell so far that the exchange wouldn't let trading go on. It will resume tonight, and it will be interesting to see if buying materializes. Mutual fund investors have a history of buying stock funds on weakness, but of selling bond funds when they plunge. And highly leveraged speculators may have to sell Treasuries, putting more pressure on prices.
There is no good reason for the bond market's woes to have clipped 171 points off the Dow Jones industrial average. A strong economy is not bad for corporate profits, which is what stock prices are supposed to be about. But it would be easier to be confident if stock prices were not so high, and valuations so extended.
In 1987, mutual fund investors ran for the hills after the first-ever 100-point down day for the Dow, on Friday, Oct. 16. Fidelity Investments dumped American shares in London Monday morning, and the rout was on. That selling was not the only reason the Dow fell 508 points that day, but it helped.
But since 1987, mutual fund investors have regarded every 100-point down day as a buying opportunity, and the market has quickly rebounded. Tomorrow morning, a lot of traders will be watching to see what Fidelity is doing.

The Year Is 2010. Do You Know Where Your Bull Is?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
IS the high-flying stock market, buoyed by a seemingly limitless tide of pension money, heading for a fall? No, not on the order of last Friday's 171-point drop, but something potentially far more disturbing two or three decades down the road -- when the baby boomers retire and begin to trade in their securities for Winnebagos, visits to the periodontist and trips to Disney World with the grandchildren?
"Don't bother me with this one -- too much can happen between now and then," responded Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, reflecting the understandable impatience of Wall Streeters preoccupied with the more immediate questions of where inflation, G.D.P. and Alan Greenspan are heading. 
 But the issue, being raised quietly by the handful of specialists who study the links between demography and economics, is not the blue sky it might seem. With the population aging and Social Security drifting toward the political equivalent of Chapter 11, financial gurus are begging, pleading, cajoling Americans to save more for their own retirement. And the numbers suggest that the message has gotten through: investors have poured nearly half a trillion dollars into stock mutual funds over the last four years -- $50 billion in the first two months of this year alone.
Leaving aside Friday's 3 percent plunge, many of these new investors have known the market only to rise, and expect that to be the case right through their golden years. But economists taking the long view worry that the very process of cashing in the boomers' vast holdings of mutual funds could transform the most energetic of bulls into a sluggish beast.
"The difference between 7 percent and 3 percent real annual return is night and day," said James Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Nobody is suggesting that Rip Van Investor is going to wake up one day to discover that no one wants to buy his shares of Netscape Communications. But John Shoven, an economist at Stanford, does imagine "1970's-like stagnation in stock prices," which would extinguish many a dream of Mediterranean cruises and lazy mornings on the golf course. To protect that dream, Rip may have to save a lot more than he expected.
Start with some basics. Most personal wealth other than housing is accumulated through employer-based pensions. Mr. Shoven and Sylvester Schieber, an economist with Watson Wyatt Worldwide pension consultants, have projected future savings in both "defined benefit" pension plans, which promise a specific monthly pension, and "defined contribution" plans, which simply serve as tax-sheltered savings vehicles.
Based on plausible assumptions about the numbers of covered workers, their wages and their life expectancy as retirees, they expect real net inflows into pension plans -- contributions and investment earnings, less benefits paid -- to rise gradually from $102 billion in 1995 to $149 billion in 2010. That is the year before boomers start to turn 65.
By the second decade of the 21st century, though, increases in pension assets tail off -- and may decline even sooner if the continuing downsizing of the corporate work force pushes more Americans into premature retirement. Adjusted for inflation, the value of the national nest egg actually begins to fall in 2025.
Mr. Shoven and Mr. Schieber estimate that real pension savings will slip from about 3.6 percent of total wages today to zero in 2024 and to a negative 3.5 percent in 2040. With the flood of baby boom pensioners cashing in, total pension assets are expected to fall to $15 trillion in 2065 from $28 trillion in 2040. The total capitalization of listed domestic stocks today, by the way, is about $6 trillion.
The magnitude of this projected drop in the middle of the next century has led Mr. Schieber to refer jocularly to the research as the "market meltdown paper." This joke hits uncomfortably close to the bone.
There has long been evidence that the age profile of the population helps to determine the way people hold their savings. In a 1973 study, John Bossons of the National Bureau of Economic Research found that half the wealth owned by Americans between 25 and 44 was in housing. This percentage fell with age, reaching 36 percent for those 55 to 64 and just 31 percent for people over 65.
It should not be surprising, then, that in 1989 Greg Mankiw of Harvard and David Weil of Brown found a strong statistical relationship between housing prices and the numbers of house-needy new families over very long periods. When the adult population is growing rapidly, housing prices follow. And what worked going up in the 1970's, when the oldest boomers were hitting their mid-20's, has worked on the way down since the late 80's, when those people hit their 40's. Prices have stagnated in recent years, trailing the rise in the cost of living. And in the housing markets that were hottest in the previous decade -- Boston, Southern California, metropolitan New York -- they have actually fallen.
Gurdip Bakshi of the University of New Orleans and Zhiwu Chen at the Ohio State College of Business refined the analysis. They predicted that the baby boomers -- the roughly 80 million people born from 1946 through 1964 -- would drive the relative demand for housing and stocks as this population bulge moved through the demographic "snake."
Stocks did rise and housing prices were stable in the first two decades after World War II; the boomers' young parents, it seems, were saving for their children's education. But when those children came of age, the cost of a college education rose as demand for it rose, and priorities shifted, as a large swath of the population began favoring real estate over financial assets. By virtue of their numbers, that set off a housing boom and a stock market bust. Now, with the boomers graying, the stock market is pulling in most of their savings.
Sometime in the future, though, what goes around will presumably come around. If the boomers cash in assets when they retire, the overall decline in savings may well act as a drag on values in all financial markets. And if, as Mr. Bakshi and Mr. Chen found, investors also grow more conservative as they age, they will want to shift their portfolios from stocks to lower-risk financial assets like bank deposits and short-term bonds, even before they begin drawing down those assets.
That, however, is hardly the last word on this subject. In broad terms, opinions about the market meltdown hypothesis fit into three very different scripts:
 
Apocalypse Later
The pessimistic view, presented in full regalia, is not a pretty sight. Household savings, buoyed by the baby boomers' late rush to prepare for old age, will crest around 2010. A few years later, Washington's on-again, off-again battle to eliminate budget deficits will be lost definitively when outlays for Social Security pensions first exceed, and then rapidly outpace, revenues from the payroll tax.
With private savings declining as a percentage of national income, and with Washington slurping up much of the savings that is available by running deficits, a shortage of capital will cause real interest rates to rise. It is hard to say by how much. But research by Thomas Helbling and Robert Wescott, economists at the International Monetary Fund, provides a benchmark.
They estimate that every increase of seven percentage points in the ratio of national debt to national output increases interest rates by about one point. The run-up of public debt in the 1981-93 period thus added about 1.4 percentage points to long-term rates. The returns needed to get increasingly risk-shy 70-something investors to hold stocks would presumably have to rise by more than the change in the interest rate -- thereby reducing stock values.
Mr. Shoven of Stanford offers a back-of-the-envelope guesstimate of how much stock prices would be depressed. The boomers, he suggests, will have to induce younger Americans to buy their stock portfolios. And if this younger generation, which is about two-thirds as large, has roughly the same standard of living and the same inclination to save for retirement as its elders, it will be willing to put up only enough cash to buy the boomers' stocks for two-thirds as much as the boomers anticipated they would be worth.
Mr. Shoven notes, however, that such a decline in stock values, driven by a scarcity of new saving, is unlikely to happen overnight. The aging of the savings-prone population is a "glacially slow" and highly predictable process. Hence the securities markets would have years to understand the shift in the demand for stocks, and adjust accordingly. That, he argues, makes stagnation of equity prices far more plausible than a sudden drop.
But determined pessimists will still be able to find reasons to take the meltdown notion literally. "Naive expectations better characterize the housing market than does perfect foresight," wrote Mr. Mankiw and Mr. Weil. That translates into the language of the masses as, "Investors sometimes follow the herd, even when it is headed for a cliff."
In Southern California, housing prices continued to rise long after the demand for housing had tailed off in the 1980's. It is possible that stock prices will similarly outlast rational considerations -- and then crash.
Whether the stock market stagnates or crashes, the boomers would be in for a leaner old age than the 20th-century performance of the market would suggest.
 
China to the Rescue
Alert readers may have already noticed that the doom-and-gloom outlook echoes forecasts of a mid-1980's capital shortage in America as huge Federal deficits siphoned trillions of dollars in private savings. Interest rates did rise. But more dire predictions did not come true because foreigners -- notably Europeans, Japanese and Taiwanese -- saved much of their surging export earnings in American stocks and bonds. In effect, they replaced most of the private domestic savings that Washington was busy passing out to pensioners and military contractors.
It is not likely that these thrifty friends in need will again ride to the rescue by purchasing the stocks that the baby boomers need to sell. "They are aging more rapidly and have even lower birth rates than we do," explains David Hale, chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments in Chicago. And while lifelong habits may brake the overall decline in their savings rates, these investors can hardly be expected to fill a new hole in American savings.
But the equally thrifty Chinese -- and perhaps citizens of the other big, high-saving emerging economies in Asia -- just might. Mr. Wescott of the International Monetary Fund calculates that rising ratios of workers to total population will increase saving rates in the third world by 3 percentage points during the next two decades. If these economies grow rapidly enough (and declines in savings rates in Europe and Japan don't offset the impact by drawing investment there), he estimates that this will be sufficient to bail out the boomers.
Living on the financial good will of Asia, however, would be a problem. For one thing, it assumes that demands for capital within the third world will not absorb the lion's share of Asian savings. Some emerging economies -- India, Brazil and Mexico -- will almost certainly need external financing if they are to grow rapidly.
Note, too, that, as in the 1980's, the flip side to importing savings is running a trade deficit. If foreigners buy the financial assets of the baby boomers, the transactions will inevitably be reflected in higher American imports. And while trade protectionism has more or less been held at bay for two decades, the surprising vigor of the Presidential candidacy of Patrick J. Buchanan suggests that it will be much more difficult to sustain wide-open markets in the future.
 
No Bang, No Whimper
The aging of America, it is agreed, will reduce household savings rates. But commensurably low birth rates, which will lead to a stable or even a shrinking work force by the second decade of the 21st century, may also reduce the demand for goods, and therefore for capital. This shift in demand could fully offset the impact of the shift in the supply of savings, and thus leave interest rates and securities prices unaffected.
Indeed, if current population projections hold, it will take no net savings to maintain a constant amount of capital per worker. Such a low-savings world would even allow for rising living standards, because continuing technological change would permit the same number of workers using the same amount of capital to produce more.
"There's light at the beginning of this tunnel," explained David M. Cutler, an economist at Harvard. "Declining fertility brings good news up front."
If there are fewer savers around, who would buy the financial assets that the retired baby boomers would need to sell? Not all capital consists of long-lived assets like buildings or power plants, Mr. Shoven said. Much of it depreciates rapidly and is normally replaced, but money designated for that kind of internal investment can be converted into cash dividends if management prefers to spend it that way. A company like General Electric, for example, currently reinvests billions of dollars for depreciation refurbishment each year. But it always has the option of shrinking by failing to replace worn-out or obsolete equipment.
This process would presumably take place automatically, driven only by the invisible hand of market incentives. With shrinking investment opportunities, more companies would simply find that the best way to sustain the value of their shares would be to buy back stock with the cash flow from the business.
How plausible is what Mr. Shoven calls the "slow growth, high consumption" outlook? Probably no more -- or less -- than the market meltdown.
Economists have never excelled at projecting long-term trends because too much depends on subtle interactions that can be safely ignored in the short run. For example, the "new growth theory," pioneered by Paul Romer of the University of California at Berkeley, suggests that the pace of technological change may depend on continuing high levels of investment. If he is right, a low-savings, low-investment world would slow technological change, retarding the growth of living standards and reducing equity values.
The life odyssey of the huge baby boom generation, most economists agree, will have enormous economic consequences. Trouble is, said Mr. Hale of Zurich Kemper, "we are only beginning to guess what they will be."

HEADLINE: Cocaine Daze;
Deborah Cantie Knows Guns, Drugs and Rikers Island. Now She Is Seeking Help. Can a Life Change?

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LEDUFF 

 BODY:
IT used to be that Deborah Cantie wouldn't know where she'd wake up. Life for a addict is like that, she said. Instead of a two-minute egg, she would start with a two-dollar bottle. But that was another day.
This morning, the sun cracked through the blinds of Ms. Cantie's bedroom window. The day was fresh and she had things to do. It's good to have a schedule, she said; she hasn't kept one for a very long time. After her morning toilet, Ms. Cantie emerged smelling of cocoa butter, looking composed and crisp. 
 In the kitchen, she prepared a breakfast of sweet coffee and glazed doughnuts for herself and her 78-year-old father, who sat with his hands on the radiator, smoking, looking out on the cold New York morning. They made small talk and joked about the little fat girl who lives down the block from their apartment in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. "She's gonna be 800 pounds one day," Mr. Cantie said, laughing.
In his younger days, Alexander Cantie was a something of a hell raiser and a playboy. "I was wild when I was younger," he said, his body stooped now, his eyes full with the recollections. Mr. Cantie was a railroad worker in Oregon and an upholsterer in the Buick plant in Flint, Mich. "I just went where I had to, wherever the work was at," he said.
He was gone a lot and wasn't much of a father, he admitted, but now he and Dee have a second chance to know each other.
Ms. Cantie recently moved in after she was released from Rikers Island nearly three months ago. They like each other, he said, watching his cigarette smoke mesh with the yellow morning sunlight. He hoped there would be no more snow this season. His daughter agreed, glancing at her watch. Nine o'clock. She had to go.
When Dee Cantie used to wake up, she'd oftentimes be wearing the same stale clothes from the night before and the night before that. Battered and breathing off the lingering effects of the crack pipe, the first thing Ms. Cantie would do is put her shoes on; the second was to go down to the corner store and get a can of malt liquor. That's how the work day began. Armed with a .38-caliber revolver, Ms. Cantie would work the "spots," selling dope on the corners of Bedford-Stuyvesant. What she wasn't carrying she could get -- for a price.
"I was a con, a dope fiend and a brilliant hustler," the dark, smooth-skinned 39-year-old said, surveying her new neighborhood on the way to the A train. "I thought I was always going to get away with it."
As Ms. Cantie talked about her past, she stared blankly down a row of brownstones that line her street. A group of young men occupied the corner in front of the Wyckoff Gardens housing project, where she lives, peddling small packets to passersby.
Ms. Cantie crossed the street, diverting her eyes. She is still shaky, she has drug hallucinations; the taste is still palpable. She goes to rehabilitation. It is helping, she said. Today, she is going to visit her children.
A severe woman with arching eyebrows, a pugnacious jaw and a flat-top, she is not ashamed to discuss her history. She did what she did, and there can be no regrets. She talks because it may help someone. It may help her, she thinks.
Hers is a common story. In 1994, there were more than 4,000 arrests of women in New York City for felony narcotics possession. They sit in the Rose E. Singer Center for women on Rikers Island, awaiting trial. Ms. Cantie has been there, twice.
"I once seen these girls at Rikers, and six years later when I went back, I seen the same exact women sitting there. I said, 'What? You do this for a career?' And, yeah, that's what they do. Out in the summer and in for the winter. They like it, because they can't take care of themselves and the system does it for them."
On the subway platform, Ms. Cantie recognized a woman she knew from jail. She look malnourished, with dark rings under her eyes. They smiled at each other. The woman was missing her front teeth.
"You all right?" the woman said.
"Yeah, Stephanie, I'm all right. What you up to?"
"Me?" Stephanie winked. "I just got out, gonna go visit some people."
Ms. Cantie shook her head. "You know, it's really hard for me sometimes. But when I see something like that . . . That was me."

 
 
THE EARLY DAYS
 With her eyes closed, Ms. Cantie can recall the scent of crack as oily candles, damp, musty basements and sour garbage. There were many dark nights spent on soiled couches with other wild-eyed addicts waiting for their blow, for that exalted state of numbness, for the inevitable crash. She hears the snapping of lighters, the greedy sucking sounds, the occasional argument about someone holding back on someone else. She feels the tingle of paranoia: the police were always on the other side of the door. She sees the embers of cigarettes and the glowing stems of crack pipes. Deborah Cantie can taste it like it was yesterday. Getting high was her life. It's been that way since she was a girl.
Growing up, the 10 children in Ms. Cantie's family were like chickens scratching for crumbs of attention. Mom was a party girl, holding all-night poker games, staying out for days at a time.
Ms. Cantie's grandmother, Millie Plummer, took her daughter's first three babies, and soon she would have Dee and two more. As Mrs. Plummer explained it: "My daughter was young and wild. She was out living a hard life." Mrs. Plummer is a religious woman, with beginnings in South Carolina. There was no way she would allow her blood to be warehoused in foster care, she said; the good Lord and her principles wouldn't allow it. So when a social worker walked up her steps with three more infants, Dee among them, she was glad to take them. It would be the most normal home they would know. They lived in a well-kept home in west Bedford-Stuyvesant. Mrs. Plummer ran a beauty parlor out of her house. Her husband worked. "We wasn't about to take welfare," Mrs. Plummer said.
It was in her household that the children learned all they need to know: restaurant manners, how to tie their shoes, their phone number and how to pray to God. They called their grandmother Mama. They still do.
Six years after arriving, the children returned to their mother. "I felt it was time for them to know her, and for her to take responsibility for her kids," she said. Mrs. Plummer bought the family a two-story house on Cooper Street in Bushwick. "I felt like I was giving myself away when I brought them back." She held her tears that day until she was far away.
Things hadn't changed much with the children's mother. She stayed out; the kids raised each other. Their fathers were long gone. The youngsters ran wild. The house became unstitched. The floorboards came up; the doors fell off their mountings. Dee became unhinged and unmanageable.
As her older sisters moved on, Dee, not even a teen-ager, had to care for her three younger siblings. The anxiety made her angry. She needed attention herself. "I was always defending someone, but nobody defended me," she said. Once in an argument over the size of her forehead, she tried to staple her brother's eye closed.
Mrs. Plummer did what she could. She spied on the children, pretending to be in the neighborhood window shopping. In the mornings, she would park down the block, peeping out her car window, making sure the children went to school. She came over on Saturdays and fried fish. She did the children's hair. It wasn't enough.
The family moved around, eventually ending up on the corner of Madison Street and Throop Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The apartment was borderline squalid: no heat, rats and missing steps. The children shared beds and cooked what they could buy from the corner store. Unsupervised, Dee began to drink. She had her first swallow at 12 and by 14 she was sneaking into night clubs. She ran away for hundred-day stretches and dropped out of school.
As she grew older, Dee was drawn to the glow of drugs. Regularly, she and her mother drank wine and smoked marijuana together. She found that they were a way of self-medicating ingrown sores, a quick slice of joy. Then cocaine hit hard on the scene. Ms. Cantie, then 18, snorted; it was a favorite candy of hers and she liked to have it. By 21, she was free-basing. She started tagging along with an older crowd. She needed people, and the people she found got high.
"I was a groupie, a follower," she said. "They used me, and I let myself be used. It's a problem of mine, being people's furniture."
The older crowd did teach her how to get legitimate jobs while turning on. She lied about having a high school diploma and found work in a pharmaceutical factory in New Jersey. She stole diet pills and sold them to drug dealers who used them to dilute their cocaine. She made money. By 31, she owned two cars and a house in New Brunswick. Everything was sweet.
Then the sugar pot cracked. She was hit by a motorcyclist who was high on PCP. Her leg shattered and she could not work. She moved back with relatives in the old neighborhood in Brooklyn. But the Demerol she was taking for pain and the $25,000 insurance settlement got the party train rolling.
"Everybody was my friend -- you should have seen it," she said, wringing her hands with the memories. "But everything I had, the money, the cars, the house -- all of it was gone in less than a year."

 
 
BAD MEMORIES
 Stepping off the A train at the Kingston-Throop station, Ms. Cantie emerged from the subway with a show of uncertainty, like an unsure child at the edge of the ocean. The midday streets were bustling, and the voice of Minister Farrakhan blasted from a loudspeaker somewhere. The father of Ms. Cantie's first child drove by in a black car. He ignored her. Ms. Cantie lit a cigarette, appearing a little shaken.
These streets are stained with memories; they were her wrecking yard.
She pointed out corners she would work, places she would get high, stopping at a sagging, boarded-up hotel. She recognized the man across the street. He didn't recognize her.
"You don't remember me?" she laughed.
"Dee?" The man smiled.
"Yeah, you old fool, Dee." She became animated now, her confidence back. Dee was happy to see Mitch. He's an old friend. A straight friend.
"Girl, I didn't hardly recognize you," he said. "Last time I saw you was across the street in that hotel there getting high. You was nothing but a raisin with legs."
"It's been a while, boy." She hugged the older man.
"You look good, girl. Just don't forget where you come from," he said.
Gilbert Mitchell is a recovering alcoholic . He used to stay at the hotel, having more than once stepped over her, incoherent and splayed across the stoop.
"I'm done with that," she told him.
"No baby. One day at a time. You never know what's going to happen tomorrow."
The sun shone bright, and the day was brittle cold. Walking down Tompkins Avenue, Ms. Cantie waved to a score of people. She was clean and she carried herself erect.
"That was me," she said, pointing to an underdressed woman with tattered shoes rummaging through a garbage can. The woman waved.
"Dee, I miss you, baby."
"Keep on missing me then," she bellowed.
Deborah Cantie shook her head. "Man, I did whatever it took. I was always looking to get over. Not much of a career."

 
 
'IT WAS SLAVERY'
 Dee Cantie, 31, broke and unemployed, found odd jobs in the old neighborhood, none of them good, she said. Among other things she was a dealer in stolen merchandise, a burglar and a con artist. She worked as a counter girl in a bodega.
But things had changed in the neighborhood. This storefront dealt in illicit brands of confections and powders. A cartel of crack dealers took over the property, welded an iron gate across the entrance and padlocked Ms. Cantie inside with three grand in crack rock. She would be imprisoned for days on end, selling nickel and dime pieces of crack through a sliding window. The boss brought her warm buckets of water to bathe, candles to count by and junk food to wash down the alcohol. She slept on the countertop.
"It was slavery, but I didn't care," she said in a husky voice. "I was addicted to the hustle, I would get a rush off it."
She used the gun once. A man tried to steal. She blew his kneecap off on the fly. She shot him from the basement window of the bodega. He crawled away.
As she told that story, she laughed, "You don't have to shoot to kill." Deborah Cantie is tough, and she's got a mean streak.
She made $25 for every $100 she sold while working at the bodega and had to pay for her own crack. Once she smoked too much, and when the boss came back, she was $30 short. Dee Cantie took a good beating, and when it was done, she was chained in, forced to work for a straight week.
Like most pushers who dip into their product, she got sloppy. Sallow and sunken eyed, she didn't see it coming. The cops broke the door down and found her hiding in the basement with $3,000 worth of crack, a handgun and $1,200 in cash. She got six months in Rikers and five years on probation. Her bosses got away. She went through a drug treatment program. The rehab didn't stick, and she stopped visiting her probation officer. A warrant was issued in 1990.
She ran for nearly six years. Dee Cantie spun out of control, living on welfare and sugar cookies, bouncing from one couch to the next. She sold dope to get dope. Her clothes stank, her hair was matted, her skin was blotchy. Her feet hurt when she wore shoes because she never bothered to trim her toenails. "I remember kids would see me in the hallways and say 'Yo, nasty butt, go head somewhere.' I felt ashamed about it, but I didn't care as long as I could cop the stuff." She had no one to talk to, "so I'd talk to the bottle about it," she said.
She never realized how down she was, until she tried to help an old lady with her groceries.
The old woman looked like her grandmother, Ms. Cantie recalled. What the old woman saw was a dried-up crack hag, a mugger, and she backed away, pleading not to be hurt.
"I just wanted to help," Ms. Cantie said.
She skulked off in a stupor of self-pity, crying. She went and got high.
Deborah Cantie couldn't see things clearly, she was sick. One day, on the way to the bootlegger's to buy a bottle of bathtub booze,
she collapsed in a diabetic episode. "I just thought I needed a drink to take the edge off," she said. "When I woke up in Kings County the next day, I checked myself out and got that drink."
She bought it with the subway tokens the hospital gave her to get home.
Deborah Cantie gave birth to a baby boy in 1994 with cocaine in his blood. It didn't stop her. Four months later, she was pregnant again.
She dismissed the fathers as flings; she was married to the pipe. Her second boy was born premature, he, too, with narcotics in his blood. She cried in the delivery room, realizing the addiction was no longer just her problem. The devil was on her back.
"It was like a snowball," she said. "I had guilt, and I would use more. The more I used, the more I had to have." Officials threatened to take her children, so she checked herself into detox.
Her new family meant everything to her. It was all she had. "It's about the kids, man," she said as she walked through the streets of her childhood. "Without their mother, what are they going to do? Die?" Her new family is important to her. Her other family was so messed up.
The rehabilitation was good for Ms. Cantie. She stayed clean and sober for seven months, her longest stretch ever. She wanted to go right, she said, for her children. But with just three months left to complete the program, the warrant from six years ago caught up to her. The police showed up last December after she pummeled her girlfriend in a domestic dispute. Dee Cantie was sent back to Rikers, her children wentto her grandmother. She had the drugs under control; her anger was the problem now.
Dee Cantie sat in jail wondering if she could ever get it together. But then she got a break. She was released from jail after 15 days because she had demonstrated improvement with her drug problems. She was remanded to Crossroads, a day treatment program designed to help women with felony narcotics arrests get clean and put their lives in order.
It seems to be working for Ms. Cantie, said Bryn King, her case manager at Crossroads. "Most of Dee's legal history has been with drugs and assault," she said. "But now, instead of acting out in really destructive ways, she shows up every day and deals with her anger." Ms. Cantie is a leader, her counselor said. The other women voted her community president.
But the sober life, a "normal" life, is a strange existence for Deborah Cantie. She's never known it. She goes to "clean" parties and sometimes doesn't know what to do with her hands. "It's boring sometimes," she said, "but I can live with it. It's better than dying."
It can be scary to turn your life around, she said. A family and a home and a job, they are good goals, but how to reach them? Who wants a recovering addict with a prison record? She fell silent. Sometimes the big questions are overwhelming. But you can't look at life that way. Start with the little things.
It was near dusk, and Ms. Cantie returned home after spending the day with her children. She was angry and she slammed the door. As it happens, she said, the children may be taken away from her grandmother over a technicality. It seems to Ms. Cantie that no matter how hard she tries or how fair she plays, an obstacle always stands in her way.
Her father was in the kitchen making curried chicken for dinner. She steered her anger toward him and they quarreled over peas. Who was going to get them? She stopped herself, choking down the anger that's got her into so much trouble before and gathered up her coat.
"I'm going to get some peas, Daddy," she said on her way out.
"Black-eyed peas," he called.
The old man stood over the stove, whistling. "It's nice to have her back," he said.
 
Rehabilitation at Rikers: The Promise, the Limits
DEE CANTIE saw a flier while sitting in a holding cell at the Rose M. Singer Center at Rikers Island awaiting trial. "We got out of jail and into treatment where we belong," the flier said. Ms. Cantie called collect.
Case workers from the Crossroads program reviewed her record: drug abuse and felony arrests for narcotics possession, no prior record of robbery and a strong desire to turn her life around. They said they could help. After Ms. Cantie served 15 days, a judge placed her in their care.
Established in 1993, Crossroads, a nonprofit organization, serves as an alternative to jail for women who have a history of drug use. The program was created by the New York City Office of the Criminal Justice Coordinator to relieve the overcrowding in the prison system.
Ken Bloomfield, the program's director, said it was the only out-patient drug treatment program for incarcerated women in the city. "Women with drug and alcohol problems have different issues that the male-based treatment model doesn't address," he said. Most of the women in the program have children, most have been sexually abused, and their medical concerns are different.
The first phase in the year of treatment is getting clean; the second is setting goals. Finally the women start to visualize life on their own. There are Narcotics Anonymous meetings, survivors of rape and incest groups and acupuncture. The women are tested daily for drugs. After nearly three months in the program, Ms. Cantie is clean and hopeful. "I'm getting my vision together here," she said. "You need to see the goal before you step to it. I see that now."
The National Development and Research Institutes is doing a five-year follow-up study on the women of Crossroads, but until it is completed, the center relies on word-of-mouth accounts. Of the 41 graduates, perhaps 20 percent have jobs, Mr. Bloomfield said.
There are pitfalls. The women live at home, often in the neighborhoods where they had sold drugs, and many can't afford to move. They are not allowed to work until the final stage of the program.
Crossroads offers no job training because of budget constraints, Mr. Bloomfield said, but the program does help them navigate the social-service bureaucracy.
It doesn't work for everybody. Eight of the 107 women who have come through Crossroads have walked off. Warrants have been issued for their arrests.

THE ECONOMY
 
More Good News About Growth. Uh-Oh.
A stronger-than-expected employment report showing that 705,000 jobs had been created in February dashed hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates any time soon. And that sent the bond market into a remarkable nose dive, as the 30-year Treasury fell 3 points on the news and ended there, its worst day in more than five years. And with it went the stock market: the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 3 percent, or 171.24 points.
 
MERGERS
 
A Swiss Surprise
In one of the largest corporate mergers ever, the Swiss pharmaceutical giants Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy announced they would merge, hoping that joint research, a much larger pocketbook and cost-cutting would revive their lackluster product lines. The resulting company, to be known as Novartis, will be the second largest in its field after Glaxo Wellcome. Part of the strategy is to eliminate 13,500 jobs, 10 percent of the companies' combined work force.
 
COST-CUTTING
 
Getting Little Things Right
The Ford Motor Company began an aggressive campaign to lower its costs, planning to reduce its product engineering and product development staffs by a total of 12,000. Among the product changes: one cigarette lighter will have to make do where Ford now uses 14 different models; the insides of ashtrays will no longer be painted on the Explorer; one carpet fabric will be used in trunks instead of seven.
 
ADVERTISING
 
Pulling the Plug
Tired of analgesics makers raising questions about the safety of each other's products, the TV networks ordered a time-out. ABC, NBC and CNN said they would no longer run commercials for pain relievers that make comparative safety claims about rival products. CBS said it would no longer run the ad that started the fuss: an Advil ad that called attention to a warning on Tylenol that advises people consuming more than three alcoholic drinks a day to ask a doctor about the potential for liver damage from combining acetaminophen and alcohol.
 
ON LINE
 
Apple Tries a New Tack
After shutting its own on-line service, eWorld, Apple Computer announced that its computers would provide access to America Online and that it would publish on the service. In other attempts to regain traction, Apple named a turnaround specialist, Fred Anderson, as its chief financial officer and announced an Internet technology alliance with Netscape Communications and Silicon Graphics.
 
TRADE
 
Bridge Across the Americas
Secretary of State Warren Christopher called on Brazil to help the United States forge a free-trade zone spanning the Americas by 2005. Mr. Christopher's proposal came as Brazil moved to strengthen its patent law, which has been a major obstacle to trade relations with Washington. But how Brazil will react is uncertain. It helped organize the Mercosur trade pact with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, and Mercosur has now opened talks with the European Union about establishing a free-trade zone. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil was cool to a recent Mexican proposal to discuss a trade alliance.
 
MORTGAGES
 
A 'Unique Housing Market'
Fannie Mae, the nation's largest provider of residential mortgages, is making $8 billion available for New York City residents -- and changing its rules so that middle-income and even wealthy families can apply. The goal: to raise the historically low level of home ownership in New York. Some parts of the program will also be extended to the close-in suburbs.
 
COUNTERPUNCHING
 
RJR Nabisco Raises Dividend
Continuing its proxy battle with Bennett S. LeBow and Carl C. Icahn, RJR Nabisco raised its dividend 23 percent, to 46.25 cents a quarter. The company also said it would buy back 10 million shares. The plans were announced the day after Mr. LeBow's Brooke Group mailed shareholders its proposal for higher dividends and other changes.
 
REJECTIONS
 
A 'No Thanks' From Grace
W. R. Grace, the troubled chemicals and health care conglomerate, rejected a merger offer from Hercules Inc., another chemical manufacturer. Grace also said Thomas L. Gossage, chairman of Hercules, had resigned from Grace's board, which led to speculation that Hercules might be planning a hostile offer. Then Peter Lynch, vice chairman of Fidelity Investments and former manager of its Magellan Fund, said he would resign as a Grace director. A Grace spokeswoman said the two departures were unrelated.
 
LABOR
 
Strike Hampers G.M.
Strikes at two brake-parts factories in Dayton, Ohio, disrupted General Motors' production of Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac cars. While only 3,000 of G.M.'s hundreds of thousands of workers were on strike, nearly all the brakes used at 29 assembly plants in North America are made in Dayton. The dispute involves safety and job-security issues.

Guns: One Nation Bars, The Other Requires

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: MORGES, Switzerland

 BODY:
Relaxing at a firing range where the thunder of a dozen submachine guns threatens to set off avalanches in the snow-capped Alps above, Frederic Oguey comes across as just another 13-year-old with sandy hair, a toothy grin and his own assault rifle.
"Dad gave it to me when I was 11 years old," Frederic said shyly, beaming as he spoke of his Swiss Army gun with a 20-bullet clip. "I shoot about once or twice a month." 
 This is a country, after all, where the Government issues a machine gun and bullets to most men in their late teens. The puzzle is that the Swiss have guns galore and yet, in contrast to Americans, they shoot at targets, not at each other.
Japan is the opposite extreme. It comes as close as any industrialized country to being a gun-free society. No one may keep a handgun at home, not even police officers, and illegal possession of a gun and ammunition is punishable by 15 years in prison.
As Americans fret about crime and debate gun control, these two countries stand out as intriguing models. What is striking about them is that they have crime rates that are among the lowest in the industrialized world, and yet they have diametrically opposite gun policies.
Interviews across a swath of Switzerland and Japan suggest that, to Americans of all political complexions, the experiences of the two countries can be troubling.
For Americans who favor gun control, Switzerland offers a discomforting reminder that ubiquitous guns do not necessarily mean soaring crime. Instead, social factors -- such as the presence of an economically frustrated underclass -- may be more important in explaining crime levels.
To gun enthusiasts, the contrasts are also troubling. The spread of guns may not always affect overall crime levels, but they do seem to mean significantly more suicides and more killings within families.
Switzerland issues guns because it has no real standing army and instead relies on a militia consisting of most Swiss adult men, who serve from their late teens until age 42. Each enlisted man keeps a machine gun at home, with ammunition, and when he is discharged he can keep the gun or sell it to someone else.
 
 
 
Swiss Respect for Weapons
 About a quarter of Swiss households have a gun, mostly Army firearms. While that is high by international standards, it is much lower than in the United States, where roughly half of the households report having a gun. In explaining why Swiss gun crime is relatively rare, the Swiss sometimes note that that although machine guns are ubiquitous, their country has stricter controls for purchasing handguns than most parts of America -- although even their controls pale next to Japan's. A Swiss buyer of a handgun from a shop needs a Government license, which is normally issued within a few weeks to anyone without a criminal record.
Some Swiss also explain the difference in crime rates by saying that they have a much more sober attitude than Americans, whose heritage combines hunting, machismo and the Wild West. While the Swiss have the right to stroll through the capital of Bern with a loaded machine gun, no one would think of doing so. The Swiss shoot overwhelmingly just at firing ranges, and the police say they would arrest anyone caught "plinking" at tin cans on a fence post.
"A gun is sacred," said Jean-Rene Zobrist, a financier from Morges, in the French-speaking part of western Switzerland, as he took seven guns out of an unlocked closet and cleaned them reverently. "You don't like to lend your guns to other people. You wouldn't lend your guns out any more than you'd lend out your wife."
Japan is the opposite end of the gun-owning spectrum from Switzerland and the United States. Only about 50 private citizens -- all expert marksmen -- are allowed to own handguns, and they must leave them at the shooting ranges. Last year, there were only 32 gun murders reported in Japan, compared to 15,456 in the United States in 1994, the last year for which a figure is available.
"There's no question that the current prohibition on guns has contributed to public safety in Japan," said Shigeru Yotoriyama, a senior police official.
One of the most basic questions about guns is whether more of them means more killings.
Martin Killias, dean of the law school at the University of Lausanne, analyzed murder rates in 18 countries around the world and found a link, albeit only a moderate one, with gun ownership levels. Although Switzerland has few murders, it probably has more than it should, given its overall extremely low crime rates. The country ranks as one of the safest in Europe, 11th among 12 countries for assaults and threats, for example. Yet its murder rate ranks it sixth, and about half the murders are gun related.
"Violence in Switzerland seems to be unusually fatal," Mr. Killias said.
Mr. Killias found a much stronger correlation between gun ownership and suicide than between gun ownership and murder. Although gun owners sometimes argue that people who shoot themselves would kill themselves in other ways if guns were not around, that does not always seem to be the case. Mr. Killias found an overall increase in the number of suicides -- more suicides by guns did not mean fewer suicides by other means. The German-speaking part of Switzerland, for example, has a non-gun suicide rate almost the same as the non-gun suicide rate in Germany. But the German Swiss are four times more likely than the Germans to kill themselves with guns.
This is significant because although people tend to worry about being murdered by a stranger, they are more likely to kill themselves. The average American is 65 percent more likely to commit suicide than to be murdered, and so anything that boosts the rate of suicide may have more of an impact on numbers of violent deaths than a crime rampage.
 
 
 
Tough Controls in Japan
 Still, one common argument made by the American gun lobby -- that if guns are restricted, criminals will still have them -- does find a measure of support in foreign countries. Japan, as an island country, is in an unusually good position to control illegal gun imports. Yet gangsters still have guns, and a robber can easily buy a Chinese-made military handgun for the equivalent of $1,500.
If Japan, despite the toughest gun laws in any democracy, cannot stop guns from being available and affordable, it is possible that no country can.
Gun restrictions may not keep firearms out of the hands of criminals, but abroad they do appear to work in curbing suicides and murders within families, and in reducing gun crimes by teen-agers and petty crooks. These incidents together account for the greatest portion of violent deaths all over the world.
Another possible lesson from other countries is that although many Americans have put a good deal of effort into restricting assault rifles, those weapons may be less threatening than their image. They are almost never used in robberies in Switzerland, police say. Such rifles, though far more lethal than handguns, are not easily concealed. Swiss criminals, with access to both kinds of weapons, choose convenience over firepower every time.
Another intriguing suggestion from abroad is that in some circumstances bullet control can work as well as gun control. Many Swiss say few shootings occur in their country in part because they are less likely to own ammunition than guns. The overwhelming majority of them buy Government-subsidized ammunition at shooting ranges, and they are supposed to buy only what they use on the spot. Except for militia members, many Swiss gun owners do not keep ammunition at home.
Although there appears to be a link between national gun ownership and violent death, social factors are also at work. Despite different gun policies, Japan and Switzerland share many features that help explain their similarly low crime rates. Police and scholars say that one of the most important is that, unlike the United States, neither has an underclass that feels excluded from society. Yet the groups in both countries that come closest to an underclass are responsible for a disproportionate share of crime.
In Japan ethnic Koreans and the hereditary outcasts known as burakumin are discriminated against and form the shadow of an underclass, and they dominate the criminal gangs known as Yakuza. In Switzerland foreign laborers also make up a frustrated subculture, and many play a major role in the country's drug trade and commit just over half of the murders there.
Japan and Switzerland also have in common strong social and family traditions. People often live in the same area for much of their lives and they care what their neighbors think.
"Our biggest city by far is Zurich, and it's got 350,000 people," said Rudolf Wyss, vice director of the Federal Office of Police. "That's nothing on an international scale. Most of Switzerland is still small towns, where the social network is strong and where people don't feel as anonymous or as lonely as in big foreign cities."

For Stocks, Good News Is Bad

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

 BODY:
What's up? Doesn't the stock market want Americans to have jobs?
Well, up to a point. What it truly wants is people getting jobs, but not too fast. Otherwise, demon inflation might rear its ugly head. And companies will have to pay more to borrow money. 
 On Friday, the Labor Department reported that more than twice the expected jobs were created in February. That would seem marvelous news amid all the talk of layoffs, yet the stock market, which has been defying gravity lately, heard just one message: If things go too well, the Federal Reserve might not cut interest rates. The response: The Dow Jones industrial average, the main yardstick for the market, plunged 171 points, to 5,470. Scary indeed, for it was one of the Dow's biggest point drops ever. But here's some statistical perspective: While the 1987 crash was a 22 percent drop, this was a mere 3 percent. HUBERT B. HERRING

Between a Rock and an Olympic Place

BYLINE: By MARCIA CHAMBERS; Marcia Chambers is the author of "The Unplayable Lie: The Untold Story of Women and Discrimination in American Golf" (Golf Digest/Pocket Books, 1995).

 BODY:
As the Atlanta Games approach, the item that looms largest on the Olympic agenda is establishing a fair and consistent drug policy.
The effort to sanction athletes who use banned drugs has produced a mountain of political and legal controversy, bewildering decisions by amateur sports regulators and the possibility of disruptive and costly lawsuits. 
 And no wonder. With 170 National Olympic Committees, a federation for each sport in each country, and international sport federations held loosely together by the International Olympic Committee, the regulation and enforcement of a uniform drug policy is nothing short of a bureaucratic nightmare.
The stakes are high both for the athlete trained to compete in a quadrennial Olympic event and the sports governing bodies that must maintain level playing fields for all competitors.
One of the Olympic movement's greatest fears is being hauled into an American court by an athlete who believes his or her rights have been trampled upon. Butch Reynolds, a world-class sprinter, did it after he flunked a drug test in Monte Carlo, Monaco, was suspended and ultimately barred from the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Several years ago, a Federal district court judge in Ohio awarded him $27.3 million, but an appeals court subsequently held that the judge had no jurisdiction over the European-based international track federation that had banned Reynolds. Still, it was a dramatic example of how an American court could interfere with the rules and authority of a private international organization.
The case of Jessica Foschi, a 15-year-old world class swimmer from Old Brookville, L.I., is the latest to raise fundamental questions about drug-enforcement policies and the Olympics. After months of uncertainty, Foschi finally made it to the Olympic swimming trials in Indiana last week after weeks of legal turmoil over an anabolic steroid found in her system last August.
At issue was her punishment. First, she was placed on probation, then on suspension, then on probation again. Her attorney, Mark Levinstein, said that regardless of what action FINA, the international swimming federation, may take this week, "U.S. Swimming controls its own Olympic trials and has stipulated she may compete." Foschi believes that she was sabotaged, perhaps when somebody spiked her soft drink, or that the lab got it wrong.
If Foschi does qualify for the Olympic team, then the worst-case scenario may occur if the international organization says she can't represent the United States in Atlanta, while United States Swimming says she can. Meanwhile, Levinstein has covered all the bases, taking the Foschi case both to arbitration and to court in New York.
Foschi missed her first attempts at qualifying when she failed to make the final in the women's 200-meter freestyle on Thursday and finished fifth in the 400 freestyle final on Friday. Her last chance will come today in the 800 freestyle.
There are now as many as 3,000 drug substances that are banned; they run the gamut from drugs everyone views as right to ban, the classic anabolic performance-enhancing steroids, to substances that are not performance enhancing at all and may be found in cold and headache tablets. There are further complications: athletes required to take medicines that are on the banned list.
The vacillation in the Foschi case was due in part to another ruling regarding a swimmer in Australia. Last month, only a week after United States Swimming, in a contentious midnight meeting, had banned Foschi for two years, FINA gave only a light penalty, a warning, to Samantha Riley, a champion Australian swimmer, for ingesting a headache pill containing a narcotic analgesic. Although not considered a performance-enhancing drug, the pill carried the same two-year penalty.
Believing that FINA's position had changed, so did United States Swimming's. Lawyers for the Foschis and United States Swimming hammered it out by conference call and the probation was reinstated. FINA is now reviewing her status.
The Foschi and Riley cases are not alone.
In Finland, Petteri Lehtinen, a 200- and 400-meter individual medley swimmer, has a long medical history of asthma, and his doctor prescribed the use of salbutamol, a stimulant taken by inhaler that aids breathing. He was given a surprise late-night, out-of-competition urine test at the Helsinki airport, but he forgot to mark his use of the drug on a routine form. FINA rejected an appeal by the Finnish swimming authorities and suspended him for two years. He appealed FINA's decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which first stayed the suspension and then on Feb. 16, three days after Foschi was banned, reversed FINA's decision.
In yet another asthma-related case, the I.O.C. this week again denied Rick DeMont's petition to reinstate the gold medal he won in the 400-meter freestyle swimming event in the 1972 Munich Games. DeMont, then 16, was disqualified after a drug test showed traces of a banned drug, ephedrine, which he was required to take for his asthma. He cited the Riley case in his appeal.
Improbably, a drug case has arisen in the sport of sailing. Kevin Hall of Ventura, Calif., who suffers from testicular cancer, needs testosterone to maintain normal levels of the male hormone in his body. Despite his having three operations, he has persevered and last year won a gold medal at the United States Olympic Festival. He has the backing of the United States Sailing Association and of the United States Olympic Committee, but he is facing international opposition. To the I.O.C., a banned performance-enhancing drug is a banned performance-enhancing drug, regardless of the circumstances.
At the heart of these cases is the legal concept of strict liability. Ordinarily, courts or hearing officers apply sanctions only when the wrongdoer is guilty either intentionally or at least recklessly. But strict liability means absolute legal responsibility. It requires no proof of carelessness or fault to be imposed upon the wrongdoer. If the swimmer did not hold onto her soft-drink bottle, then she takes the consequences.
Under a standard of strict liability, if the drug is found in an athlete's blood or urine, the presumption is that harm to other competitors and the concept of a level playing field is so great that the athlete must pay, regardless of the circumstances. Claims of ignorance, test error or sabotage are not accepted.
Although the strict-liability standard appears to be the aim of many amateur drug regulations, it may not be the reality. Under FINA's rules, for example, asserting a lack of knowledge that the substance was banned, or that it was present in a drink, food or medicine, or that a doctor or coach gave it to the athlete, "are unlikely to be accepted." The word "unlikely" implies there are some circumstances that might qualify, thereby challenging strict liability.
And the doors open wider when due-process claims are raised in the methods used to collect, transport and analyze urine samples, as well as to make them available for independent testing. The hearing process is based on the athlete's presumption of guilt, yet often the athlete can overcome that presumption, particularly if the athlete's family is willing to pay for investigators and good lawyers.
A two-year suspension can end an athlete's Olympic hopes. Given the effort, time, training and sheer will it takes to compete at the highest international levels, to have an athlete disqualified through no wrongdoing of his or her own seems unconscionable. The moral and psychological cost to the athlete is huge, and there may be related economic costs through lost endorsement and marketing revenue.
The Court of Arbitration of Sport, a sort of Supreme Court for amateur athletic competition, has emerged as the potential solution to prevent athletes from taking private federations to a public court.
The C.A.S. is an international court located at I.O.C. headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, and supported by the I.O.C., which intends it to be the supreme arbiter of Olympic sports conflicts. A majority of its cases center on drugs. All athletes competing in the Atlanta Games will be required to sign a statement to allow disputes to be resolved by arbitration. On-site C.A.S. arbitration will be provided, an Olympic official said.
Through its opinions, the Court of Arbitration of Sport is now providing strong and specific guidance to international federations in the writing of drug policies. In an 18-page decision handed down in May 1995, the court found that the international skeeting organization had adopted poorly drafted, inconsistent rules regarding drug policies for its athletes.
The case involved an American skeet shooter, George M. Quigley Jr., a member of the United States team, who competed at the World Cup in Cairo on April 6 and 7, 1994. Quigley, ill for several days, took a turn for the worse one night at 3 A.M. He had coughing fits and was hallucinating when he called his coach, who, in turn, summoned the hotel physician. The coach showed the physician a card listing the banned substances, and the physician, who spoke English well, appeared to understand. Quigley took the cough medicine from an unlabeled bottle. The writing on the box of the medicine appeared to be Arabic, Quigley said.
The next day, Quigley won the gold medal as well as a spot on the Olympic team. He was then tested and traces of the banned substance ephedrine, an ingredient in the cough medicine, were found. The executive committee of the international federation annulled his scores, recalled his gold medal and eliminated his spot on the Olympic team.
In reversing the ban, returning his gold medal and restoring his spot on the team, the C.A.S. observed a conflict between the federation's rule, which required a showing of culpability, and the substance of the federation's decision, which stated that Quigley "had no intention to use forbidden medication in order to improve his performance."
In a judgment clearly meant to address not only the shooter's case, the C.A.S. said: "Athletes and officials should not be confronted with a thicket of mutually qualifying or even contradictory rules that can be understood only on the basis of the de facto practice over the course of many years of a small group of insiders." Poorly drafted and inconsistent rules must be eradicated, the C.A.S. said.
The I.O.C. may have difficulty getting uniform standards among the international federations, but if it fails to do so, it will face continuing litigation from Olympic nations with a well-developed sense of due process, especially America, land of the litigant and home of the injunction.

HEADLINE: North Carolina High Court Backs Tax Money to Aid Businesses

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 9

 BODY:
Conservative groups seeking to limit the role of government and curb the uses of public money were dealt a setback on Friday when North Carolina's highest court upheld the constitutionality of a host of tax-financed incentives that communities and the state could use to aid businesses.
The decision overturned a lower court ruling last August that found Winston-Salem and surrounding Forsyth County had violated the state constitution's prohibition of using tax dollars to aid private interests and conferred an unfair benefit on some businesses at the expense of others. The city and county had backed the expenditure of $13 million to assist about 24 companies in the hopes of generating 5,000 jobs and $200 million in tax revenue. 
 The North Carolina Supreme Court, voting 5 to 2, found that such expenditures, "while providing incidental private benefit, serve a primary public goal." That over-arching public purpose, the court said, justifies efforts by localities to shore-up their job pool and tax base by doing such things as purchasing land for industrial concerns, providing training and giving money for training to new or existing businesses.
Indeed, said the court, the adoption of such programs merely to keep businesses from moving to other states that do offer incentives was public purpose enough to justify them. The court noted in its ruling that about 46 states had such laws that had withstood legal challenges.
The North Carolina lawsuit was originally brought by William Maready, a Winston-Salem trial lawyer, but attracted the support of such conservative public interest groups as North Carolina's John Locke Foundation and the Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation.
Matt Glavin, executive director of the legal foundation, said that the suit represented an attack on "corporate welfare" and an effort to force government to look at recent studies that he said suggested that such incentive programs rarely produced what they promised.
Mr. Maready said that the issue was not a partisan one, but conceded that the party-line vote of the high court's justices -- five Democrats to two Republicans -- would cause it to be perceived as such.
Indeed, his suit attracted support from several liberal groups. But unlike Mr. Maready, they argued in briefs as friends of the court that the law could be made constitutional. To do so, they said, the law should include mechanisms for stiff accountability in order to adequately serve a public purpose.
Kary L. Moss, a lawyer with the Michigan-based Maurice and Jane Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice, who filed briefs on behalf of a half-dozen public-interest groups, said that the incentive laws like those in North Carolina and other states should have penalties and ways of recovering public money when a business's promises of new public bounty did not materialize.
Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina, a Democrat, applauded the ruling, noting that the lower court decision had temporarily muddied the waters and chilled some state and local economic development efforts.
"North Carolina is back in business," he said. "Now with the endorsement of the State Supreme Court, we can continue to use modest financial incentives as an economic development tool."
Mr. Glavin is not giving up his fight against what he calls the conveying of public property to a private business merely for the projected increased tax revenue. "We wouldn't characterize this as a setback," he said, "and we are now looking at a potential challenge of a similar law in Florida. At some point we will reach a breakthrough state."

HEADLINE: Downsizing and Its Discontents

 BODY:
Modern capitalism has always dealt its cards unevenly, but over time prosperity and freedom have flowed to almost everyone living under the system. The United States, moreover, is the envy of other industrial democracies because of its recent success in creating jobs and subduing inflation. Why, then, are so many Americans anxious about the future? If you have any doubt that such anxiety exists, read the meticulously reported series of articles in The Times last week, with their portrayal of lives, families, workplaces and communities disrupted by the downsizing in corporate America.
Granted, the series has concentrated on the people who lost jobs, not the many more who have gained jobs in a growing economy. There is also nothing new in churning economic cycles that, over time, have forced Americans from farm to factory, from country to city. As the economist Joseph Schumpeter observed long ago, capitalism embodies a process of "creative destruction" in which outdated enterprises must give way. 
 But there is something new and disturbing about current economic afflictions.
The middle and upper classes -- the very groups benefiting most from the education and training that have for decades been a path upward -- are experiencing massive losses of jobs for the first time. Most of these victims have to accept diminished pay and benefits in less secure jobs.
The spread of layoffs in relatively good times and among companies with strong profits has created a searing climate of insecurity as employees accept less, contributing to the leveling off and even decline of wages in the last two decades, the longest period of stagnation since the Civil War.
The anxiety among Americans has become a powerful fact of life in the current election campaign. Although President Clinton has a comparable record on job creation to that of President Ronald Reagan when Mr. Reagan ran for re-election in 1984, it is hard to imagine Mr. Clinton convincing anyone that a new "morning in America" is dawning.
Patrick Buchanan has roiled the scene with his proposals to curb immigration, imports and the ability of corporations to invest overseas. Fortunately, his prescription seems to have been rejected. But there is an emerging political consensus around a few key points that can show the way forward for voters, Presidential candidates, members of Congress and corporations that are smart enough to avoid the backlash whipped up by the unrestrained profit taking of the past 15 years.
There is, for example, a clear national demand for portable health insurance that follows workers from job to job or into unemployment. Fixing that problem does not have to wait for a 1993-style health care reform effort. Congress should adopt the legislation sponsored by Senators Edward Kennedy and Nancy Kassebaum to preserve health insurance for workers who lose their employer-based coverage and are then turned away by other insurers. The bill commands bipartisan support and Senator Bob Dole can make it happen by allowing a quick vote.
Corporations and financiers must recognize that they cannot forever placate the anxiety of white-collar Americans by saying they are casualties of a righteous effort to squeeze out the last penny of profit for shareholders. American history demonstrates few patterns more clearly than that in which flamboyant corporate callousness leads to Government regulation.
When the middle class starts feeling aggrieved, the political system has to respond, as demonstrated by the speed with which Mr. Dole picked up Mr. Buchanan's attack on corporate downsizers. Smart boards of directors will begin to question multimillion-dollar bonuses for C.E.O.'s whose main managerial skill is the ability to inflict maximum suffering on senior employees. By the same token, the days of company paternalism are over and skilled workers will have to learn how to save their jobs by navigating in a newly competitive environment.
The point is that neither business nor Government lacks the tools to deal with the problems explored in the Times's series. But it is important to remember that, for all the concern about downsizing, the families suffering the most right now are those at the bottom end of the scale, and that the distribution of wealth in the United States is growing increasingly inequitable. This is no time, as this page has said repeatedly, to think that prosperity can be achieved by budget cuts and tax reductions that disproportionately hurt the poor. Washington can play an additional role in investing in more training and education, perhaps through tax breaks, and working hard to open overseas markets for goods and services produced by the highest-paid workers.
However painful the trends of recent years, there is a sinking feeling that they could get worse. The forces of automation and technology, of companies looking for cheaper ways to make products overseas, of immigrants searching for opportunity on our shores, and of consumer demand for less expensive imported goods -- these are trends that are almost certain to grow rather than diminish. The United States can no more stop them than it can build up steel and concrete walls along its borders.
Because economic change has always brought dislocation, there are some who feel that the United States should simply accept the current American anxiety as its inevitable lot. That would be a mistake. Exaggerated reverence for the raw justice of the market should not serve as an excuse for inaction. Americans want their leaders to talk sense about their problems. An election year is an excellent place to start. Presidential and Congressional candidates who ignore the frozen incomes of the poor and the chilling anxiety of the middle class will have a cold November.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
The Unmaking of a Primary

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
Senator Al D'Amato, that born-again political reformer, has come to a sudden realization that in a democracy, elections should involve more than one name on the ballot. "I think the process is served better when we have competition," he told voters after his candidate, Senator Bob Dole, handily won the Republican primary in New York.
Since Mr. D'Amato struggled so long and hard to keep competition out of this year's primary, New Yorkers may wonder whether this about-face means the state could lose its standing as the American electoral system's answer to North Korea. The embarrassment over this year's election will probably lead to some reform. History suggests, however, that any change will be modest unless the public shows an unprecedented level of interest in the issue of ballot access. Four years from now the state may once again be awash in court suits, while national commentators note that half of all election litigation in the country takes place in New York. 
 New York elections are based on what was originally a reform theory -- that candidates should qualify for a spot on the ballot by collecting a given number of signatures of eligible voters. But the perversity of the system lies in the myriad ways this simple requirement can be turned into an impassable hurdle. Signatures have been tossed out by the courts because the supporter added a superfluous "Mrs." in front of her name. Entire volumes of names were declared invalid because of a mistake on the cover sheet. Infant political careers have been destroyed because of incorrect information about signers' Assembly districts. One upstate town clerk lost a large volume of signatures submitted for Steve Forbes in last week's primary, and the courts ruled that a photocopied substitute was inadmissible.
The State Legislature has actually been in the process of reforming New York's Presidential primary system for 20 years now, usually in teeny-tiny steps. In a breakthrough change, Democrats in 1976 decided to actually indicate on the ballot which Presidential candidate each delegate was pledged to. It was a reform restricted to one party. In 1980 fans of George Bush managed to get his delegate slate on the ballot in some parts of the state. But the party declined to include any hint as to which delegates were actually pledged to Mr. Bush and not Ronald Reagan. An outcry ensued, followed by another tad of reform. In 1988 Republicans could finally figure out which Presidential candidate they were voting for without the help of reference materials.
That breakthrough was felt, however, in only about half the state. Until Steve Forbes spent $1 million to get on the ballot this year, Republicans had never had a Presidential primary in which more than one candidate was running in every Congressional district. The primary elections are actually 31 little district primaries, and candidates must qualify separately for each one, usually by collecting signatures of 1,250 registered Republicans who live in the district.
In the New York tradition, every single step along this road is a land mine. For instance, to get "quality" signatures less likely to be tossed out in court, collectors must go door-to-door, using a list of registered Republicans. In 1992, when Larry Rockefeller tried to wage a primary battle against Senator D'Amato, towns in Nassau and Suffolk Counties were so reluctant to tell Mr. Rockefeller where the Republicans lived that the candidate had to file a request under the Freedom of Information Law to see the voter registration lists.
The signatures also must be collected by registered Republicans who live in the district. This year Steve Forbes got around the problem in many deeply Democratic parts of New York City by rounding up unemployed young people who have never voted and registering them as Republicans. The workers -- often teen-age moms and young men in gang beads -- made $10 an hour and qualified their candidate. It was, the organizers said, a sort of G.O.P. version of "Stand and Deliver."
When Democrats last held a Presidential primary in 1992, the party's main requirement was a simple 10,000 signatures statewide. By New York standards, that was the equivalent of a walk in the park. But candidates from gentler environs still found the going tough. Paul Tsongas failed to come up with enough names to make his petitions challenge-proof in court. Mr. Tsongas's Democratic opponents agreed to look the other way. But the New Alliance Party, angry because its candidate was being barred from the Democratic primary debates, sued. In a masterstroke of New York-style election-law thinking, the court threw out the case, contending that the local delegates who had agreed to allow their names to be used on the Tsongas slates should have been named as parties to the suit.
The Democrats have since lowered the bar to 5,000 signatures. So far neither party has seriously considered the obvious solution -- automatically qualifying candidates whose standings in the Presidential campaign make it clear they have a right to be included. Then, the focus of the New York primary would be on the voters rather than the election law. GAIL COLLINS

HEADLINE: Survival Instinct;
Alone or Not, Israel Strikes Back

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
AFTER the fourth human bomb, this one in the heart of Tel Aviv, brought to 61 the toll in tattered victims, the anger and grief turned to despair. Many Israelis who had put their faith in the peace with Palestinians felt betrayed -- by Yasir Arafat, by Shimon Peres, by all the foreign leaders who had insisted that peace would bring them security. Once again, many seemed to feel, in their immediate anguish, that Israel was waging "total war" and was alone.
Radio stations shifted to patriotic songs from the early days of the Israeli state, when survivors of the Holocaust defiantly plowed fields with rifles on their backs and the national slogan was, "All the nation is an army." The Government's crisis measures revived the old dream of totally separating Jews from Arabs. Soldiers sealed off Palestinian towns and villages and bulldozers began raising walls along the "green line" between Israel and the West Bank. Capturing the public mood, Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the conservative Likud, declared, "the idea that Arafat will be our subcontractor to fight terrorism won't work." 
 A Government official, watching messages of support and condolence pour in from around the world, growled: "They're always sorry for us when we're victims. Where we want their support is when we strike back. It'll be ugly, and I hope they don't start squealing then."
Yes, ugly events seem inevitable. Israeli tanks stand watch at the West Bank frontier. There is talk of deportations, of destruction of houses, of hardship for Palestinians barred from working in Israel. But this is not the whole story, for by week's end the outside pressure on Israel wasn't so much to restrain its attacks against Islamic militants, but to restrain its impulse to act alone. American intelligence agents were urging Israelis and Palestinians to share information for the crackdown on Hamas; President Clinton said he would attend a regional strategy meeting in Egypt this week to confront terror.
To fear being alone again was a natural reaction for Israel's Jews. From their history, they have long taken the lesson that in the end they can depend only on themselves. They had staved off hostile Arab armies alone, and more than once. And even if the Lebanon invasion of 1982 and the Palestinian "intifada" in ensuing years showed the limits of raw force, there remains among Israelis an enduring sense that goes beyond security or revenge: that their country, whatever the cost, can never allow itself to appear weak to the Arabs by abandoning the option of force.
And now there seems a new danger. "Israel now stands at the front line of what threatens to become a world war between Islamic fanaticism and the humanistic world," the writer Amos Oz, a prominent advocate of peace, wrote in Yediot Ahronot. Arrest every Hamas and Islamic Holy War operative, urged the conservative newspaper Maariv in an editorial; confiscate their possessions, if necessary pursue them into Palestinian territories, give them no respite. "All this is a clear-minded opinion, without hysteria, with the knowledge that it is us, or them."
Yet as the days passed, some people began to ask what this meant. "Them" was no longer the massed hostility of all the Arab states and their supporters in the Communist and "non-aligned" bloc. The Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Egypt and many other Arab states joined in condemning the Islamic fundamentalists (who threaten them no less than Israel), and the United States rushed to reassure Israel.
Even as he ordered harsh reprisals against the Palestinians, Prime Minister Shimon Peres repeatedly asked whether there was any realistic alternative to the process of making peace with the Palestinians that he began with secret meetings in Oslo in 1983.
"If it was not for Oslo, there would still be intifada, there would be war in Lebanon, there would be people with knives," he said. And Israel would once again be alone, he might have added.
Many people also began to notice that despite the great anguish everyone felt, there had been no mass demonstrations as in the past and no attacks on Arab neighborhoods. Mr. Peres sank in the public opinion polls, but only to levels that prevailed before the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin created a wave of sympathy.
People here also know that the Israel of 1996 is far different from that of 1948. Its army is the strongest in the Middle East, its economy is larger than those of its neighbors combined, and booming. It has successfully absorbed 700,000 new immigrants in five years. Kings, presidents and prime ministers are almost weekly visitors to Jerusalem.
And Israel's enemies are no longer "the Arabs" who sought to wipe Israel out of the Middle East, but a small clutch of violent zealots who can hurt, but not destroy, the Jewish homeland.
To be sure, the dangers raised by the bombings are far from over, and there is no telling who will win the May 29 election or whether the Israeli-Palestine peace will survive. The massive Israeli crackdown is fomenting new tensions in the Palestinian lands, making Mr. Arafat's standing increasingly tenuous. Above all, there remains the chance of more bombings.
But already some things are clear. "The refraining from hysteria and the subdued internalized tears -- these are the two components of the Israeli citizen's language of mourning in the middle of the 1990's," wrote the popular Yediot Ahronot in an editorial. "It is an Israeli who has witnessed a change in his standard of living in the last 10 years, in expectations, in a feeling of the strength, security and stability of the country in which he lives, where he is now proud to live.
"These are very fundamental things that endow all of us with the feeling that the country is not 'finished,' no matter how many buses will explode and how many beastly acts will occur. This is where the Israeli silence comes from."

HEADLINE: U.S. Barbs Are Biggest Blow to Colombia Ties, Its Leader Says

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, March 9

 BODY:
President Ernesto Samper, riding out Colombia's recent loss of backing from Washington as a full partner in the fight against drugs, says that recent statements by American officials criticizing his presidency are more damaging to the two countries' relations than decertification itself.
"I think that to resort to these types of arguments is even more serious than decertification," Mr. Samper said in an interview Thursday night, repeating an earlier threat to review the terms for American agencies operating in Colombia. 
 During the interview in the Presidential Palace, Mr. Samper chose to interpret Colombia's decertification by the United States as an effort to downplay his country's efforts to fight drug trafficking, rather than as a result of American distrust of Mr. Samper and his administration.
From virtually the moment of Mr. Samper's election in 1994, allegations that top drug traffickers from the city of Cali bankrolled his campaign have dogged him, and the charges have featured prominently in statements by American officials since the decertification on March 1.
Decertification ends most United States aid and withdraws American-backed loan guarantees, a serious blow to the Colombian economy. It does not, however, automatically cut off any funding or manpower for programs to fight the drug trade.
"Perhaps this difficult situation will allow us to communicate more sincerely in our relationship with the United States," Mr. Samper said.
But for Mr. Samper, cooperation with the United States in the fight against drugs has been problematic. Robert S. Gelbard, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, said on the day Colombia was decertified that American officials had confronted Mr. Samper twice with their belief that he had accepted money from drug traffickers. Mr. Samper denied the charges.
Behind the scenes, American officials were able to use their distrust to pressure Mr. Samper, to prove himself, in a sense, with results. In a stunning sweep of arrests between June and August of last year, the Colombian police arrested six of the top seven drug exporters in Cali, which supplies 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches the United States.
But the United States' suspicions came to the surface with the decision to decertify Colombia. Mr. Gelbard credited the chief of the national police and the country's chief prosecutor for much of the progress. But he criticized Mr. Samper's role.
"During 1995, the Samper administration lacked commitment to support the efforts of Colombian law enforcement entities and to strengthen the nation's institutions to combat the destructive effects of narcotics traffickers," Mr. Gelbard said, adding that the arrested "Cali leadership continues to manage its criminal empire from prison."
One sticking point in Mr. Samper's relations with the United States is the absence of a body within Colombia to judge the President that carries credibility with Washington.
Constitutionally, that job falls to Colombia's Congress, but its Committee of Accusations, which received four charges against the President last month, had decided once before not to send a related accusation to the full house.
Some Congressional leaders have been discussing a "punto final," named for the law that granted amnesty to Argentina's military, that would provide amnesty to lawmakers for drug-related corruption in exchange for a lifetime pledge to withdraw from public office. The proposal originated with Mr. Samper's supporters to allow lawmakers to examine -- and perhaps eventually clear -- the President while avoiding prosecution themselves. Scores of members of Congress are also suspected of taking money from drug dealers. Mr. Samper suggested a broader version of the amnesty -- one that, implicitly, might embrace himself.
"We don't need a law so much as a policy of punto final, a policy that will allow us to liberate ourselves from this entire problem," Mr. Samper said. "Not only in politics, but in other activities -- in social activities, in economic activities."
Though in the past, Mr. Samper has said he would consider national elections should his "conditions of governability" prove untenable, he gave no sign that he is currently considering that course.
Asked whether, guilty or innocent, his remaining in office were not damaging the country, Mr. Samper cited an unpublished poll, which his office did not have on hand, indicating that his support had risen to 56 percent, "perhaps thanks to decertification."

Davey Johnson Tries to Make Peace With the Past

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
A look at Davey Johnson's won-lost record as a major league manager would not lead to the conclusion that this is a man who cannot get or hold a job. A look at his employment record would indicate otherwise.
Johnson, 17 years removed from his playing career, is in his third job as a manager. But before they hired him last October, the Orioles had bypassed him a year earlier. And he was available for the job this season only because the Reds dismissed him even though he managed them to the National League Central championship last season. 
 That he became Cincinnati's manager at all was a delayed development. He spent five days short of three years between managing jobs, having been fired by the Mets after he performed managerial deeds with them that no one else has in their history and no one else has in National League history.
Does this guy have a severe case of bad breath or what?
"This is the culmination of it for me," Johnson said, wearing the uniform of the team with which he began his playing career. "This is the supreme challenge. It's almost scary how things have worked out. There's something special here. I thank my lucky stars."
Through his nine-year managerial career, Johnson has had little luck but a load of talent. His first Mets team, in 1984, leaped from sixth place to second with 22 more victories. The 1986 team won the World Series, and the 1988 team just missed making the Series. The team in between was undermined by a pitching staff decimated by injuries. For six years, he finished first or second and averaged 96 victories a season.
The most successful manager in Mets history, he remains the only N.L. manager, and one of two in the majors, who managed teams to 90 or more victories in each of his first five seasons. The Mets' record during his six full seasons was the best in the majors during that period. His overall winning percentage of .576 (799-589) is 18 points better than any other current manager.
So just what has been the problem with Johnson anyway?
 
Rebuffing Suggestions From Front Office
 With nearly two years left on his contract, the Mets fired Johnson on May 29, 1990, when the team had a 20-22 record.
"Frank wanted a lot of things done," Johnson said, recalling his demise under General Manager Frank Cashen. "He wanted me to move HoJo to first," he said in a reference to Howard Johnson, who for the most part played third. "I wanted to establish Gregg Jefferies at second. I thought that was his best position. If not there, first base, but not HoJo. His psyche was such that you start moving him, you lose him, which they eventually did.
"So I fought some of the suggestions that came out of the front office. I let them have junk food in the clubhouse; I let them play cards or whatever, to relax. We had real strict phone rules. I kept telling them if they want to eat junk food, I can't stop them; they'll go in the bathroom, Frank. If they want to make a phone call, they'll get a cell phone. You're asking me to do things that I know I can't enforce. Well, I want you to do it, he said. I said it ain't going to work. I said we've been successful, now you're going to change things. Anyway, he found someone that would do it. But I know they were eating cheeseburgers in the bathroom and everyone had a cell phone."
Cashen, now a Mets consultant, chuckled when that series of disagreements was related to him. "Junk food had nothing to do with his being let go," he said. "My decision was made because he had lost control of the ball club and didn't have the same intensity. He kind of lost the fire in his belly at that point."
Joe McIlvaine, the Mets' general manager now and an assistant to Cashen then, said the decision to fire Johnson was Cashen's, but he added: "I think the difference with Davey was his personal problems with his wife began to affect the job he was doing as manager. Before the game would start, the door was shut; after the game would end, the door was shut. Before, he always had been out in the clubhouse. He always had the open door. He changed."
The Mets never publicly said why they dismissed Johnson, leaving a void that was filled by a raft of rumors, many involving his life style.
"I heard, 'He drank too much,' " Johnson said, "and I admit I probably drank too much. But I never was drunk. I was never like a lot of people I could mention. My health never interfered. I never drank before a game or anything. I'd have a couple of drinks after a ball game. I did get high blood pressure in New York. As soon as I got fired, my blood pressure went back to normal. I didn't have to take any medication and I didn't have a drink or a chew for three years."
Another rumor had Cashen upset because Johnson often had women with him on the road. "I was separated from my wife, living in another house," Johnson said. "I had one girlfriend. I didn't run around. I didn't go out carousing. Frank didn't like it when I would take her on road trips. He knew my first wife. I know that aggravated Frank."
Cashen denied some of the stories concerning his knowledge of Johnson's alleged escapades. "I don't know him to be promiscuous," Cashen said. "But when he was married he had a girl on the road."
Unemployed, Johnson seemed to be an untouchable. Again, rumors: The Mets were blackballing him. People who know Johnson believe that; an owner of another team basically confirmed it. But Cashen denied having any knowledge of a blackball effort.
"Nothing could be further from the truth," he said. "I personally made some phone calls trying to get him a job. Davey Johnson is a winner, and he'll win in Baltimore. I'm rooting for him to do well."
For what it's worth, Johnson himself has not accused the Mets of trying to prevent him from getting another job.
"I'm not as good a Christian as I should be; I'd like to be better," said Johnson, 53. "But I believe things happened for the best for me because I have strong faith and I think He wanted me to rest. I got paid through '91, and I had investments that gave me more time to be with my kids, work on my golf game, straighten out my yard, and it worked out great for me. I was at the point of doing something in the college ranks and forgetting about it."
John McMullen, then the owner of the Houston Astros, was prepared to ignore the rumors and hire Johnson in 1992, but he was in the process of selling the team and decided not to make any changes.
"I talked to him every other day for two, three weeks," Johnson said. "He was so gracious that when it didn't work out he sent me a letter saying he was sorry and a check for $10,000 as a consultant's fee. What a class man. I would've sent it back, but I felt like I had a job in baseball. I consulted."
 
Reds Come Calling After Perez Is Ousted
 Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, was the man who ultimately snatched Johnson from the scrap heap. First he hired him as a scout and adviser, then named him manager May 24, 1993, to replace Tony Perez. "I tried to talk him out of firing Tony," Johnson said. "I said, let me come in and talk to him and try to smooth it out."
Johnson instead wound up smoothing out the Reds, who were in first place when the strike ended the 1994 season and first again when last season ended. But neither the division championship nor a three-game sweep of Los Angeles Dodgers was enough to save Johnson's job. It had been preordained by Marge Schott, the owner, that Ray Knight, Johnson's first lieutenant, would replace him. In fact, Schott, at Bowden's urging, had already given Johnson a one-year reprieve.
Schott never has spoken publicly about her reason for dismissing Johnson, but again it was believed to have involved a woman. This time the woman was Susan Allen, who is now Johnson's wife. The problem, as Schott apparently saw it, was Johnson was living with Allen when they weren't married.
Johnson said he had heard that reason and, asked if he thought it was true, said, "Possibly."
Ironically, it was Johnson who urged Knight, the man who replaced Pete Rose as the Reds' third baseman, to leave his sportscasting job and join his coaching staff, putting him in position to replace him.
But Knight seemed to turn on his benefactor when he was named manager himself, making comments that were viewed as being critical of Johnson and his style of managing. Johnson, who has not spoken with Knight since, suspects Knight was reacting to something Johnson said about him. "I was asked if Ray would be a good manager," Johnson related. "I said he's a good baseball man, he works hard, he studies lots of things, knows the game of baseball. The only thing he has to do is be a little more patient at times. I think he took that as a knock. Ray is not patient. Ray's got a hair temper. When it goes, he can't function. I told him to his face."
At Knight's news conference, Johnson added: "There were some things he said that bothered me, but I didn't want to comment on it so I kind of just tried to forget about it.
"I wish him nothing but the best. When the thing was over, I called him and left messages a couple times. He didn't return my calls so I figured he was too overwhelmed."
Because Schott wanted to get rid of Johnson, she readily gave the Orioles permission to speak with him a year earlier, after the 1994 season when they were replacing Johnny Oates. Johnson arrived for the interview with a major concern about the Orioles' front-office setup.
When he began managing the Mets, Johnson reported directly to Cashen and developed a good working relationship with him. Johnson believes firmly in that kind of arrangement, feeling it's crucial for the manager and general manager to talk frequently and operate on the same wavelength.
But soon, Cashen began developing McIlvaine and Al Harazin as prospective general managers, and they became what Johnson called a triumvirate. More often than not, Johnson said, he was talking with McIlvaine or Harazin and not Cashen.
The Orioles, Johnson said, had a similar triumvirate in General Manager Roland Hemond and a pair of general managers-in-waiting, Doug Melvin and Frank Robinson.
"I was worried about that," Johnson said. "I told them at the interview it probably was my fault, but with the triumvirate in New York, I couldn't get on the same wavelength with the general manager and you can't have that. That's my opinion."
Johnson said he probably should not have raised that issue with the Orioles. But he always has said what he thinks. "I'm a firm believer in being on the same page from jump street," he said. "I learned from experience that I wanted to identify the power structure, who was going to be my boss, who was going to be pulling the trigger. Was it going to be three guys or one?"
 
With One Question, Job May Have Been Lost
 Robinson, who had been a teammate of Johnson in Baltimore, asked him a question that prompted an answer that Johnson suspects cost him the job.
"He asked me," Johnson said, "if he was the general manager and he came down and told me he wanted to play so and so for no other reason than to play so and so, what would I do. I said: 'Frank, I hope the general manager and the manager communicate on a daily basis so there are no surprises ever. We're all going to be discussing these things on a daily basis so nothing should come out of the clear blue.' I said: 'I'll tell you this. You come down and manage and let me be the general manager and then see what kind of respect the players give you.' The players know when all of a sudden somebody is telling you do this, do that. You build a respect with the players. That's all you have. I have nothing if I don't get their respect. If I don't stand up for what I know is right and they know is right, I lose their respect."
All Johnson probably lost in this instance was a chance for the job he coveted.
"They told me there was going to be a second round and I would be in the second round," he said. "So I didn't feel like I needed to hug and kiss everybody the first round. The huggin' and kissin' would come later."
But the second round for Johnson didn't come until a year later, last October. "This time went better," he said. "Peter Angelos called Marge and asked permission to talk to me. I flew up there, my agent went up with me and it pretty much got done."
This time no triumvirate interviewed Johnson. No general manager even interviewed him because the Orioles hadn't hired one to replace Hemond. In a reversal of procedure, Johnson was instrumental in hiring the general manager, helping to lure Pat Gillick out of retirement.
"Nothing has been close to this," Johnson said. After winding his way through a treacherous managerial maze, he has reached managerial heaven.

HEADLINE: Pursuing a Theme, Clinton Helps Schools Go On-Line

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: CONCORD, Calif., March 9

 BODY:
With a length of electrical cable and a nod to the American traditions of barn-raisings, quilting-bees and victory gardens, President Clinton helped wire classrooms in a California high school to the Internet today in a first step toward his goal of connecting every school in the nation by the turn of the century.
In public ceremonies across the state today, more than 20,000 volunteers were helping lay about six million feet of cable in a project sponsored and organized by private technology companies, dubbed Net Day. It was unclear how many schools would be wired today but the hope is to wire 20 percent of California's schools by the end of the current school year. 
 "We are putting the future at the fingertips of your children, and we are doing it together in the best American tradition," Mr. Clinton told students, parents and teachers at an outdoor rally at Ygnacio Valley High School east of San Francisco Bay. "We must not send our children into a 21st century unprepared for the world they will inhabit and the jobs they will have to fill."
Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore first announced the project in San Francisco last fall, and the President has since made it a staple of his campaign appearances around the country as he seeks to portray himself as the candidate of the future. Mr. Clinton's emphasis on computerizing schools is part of his continuing effort to speak out in favor of popular, nonpartisan ideas that do not require new Federal money or regulations.
About 200 private companies and volunteers coordinated by Sun Microsystems organized today's event. The President has proposed shifting $2 billion in planned education spending over the five years into a fund to help match state and local government and private sector efforts around the nation, though it is far from clear that the Republican-controlled Congress will approve his plan.
Mr. Clinton highlighted the goal in his State of the Union address in January, and today Mr. Gore joined the President on the platform and likened the effort to President John F. Kennedy's commitment in the early 1960's to send a man to the moon by the end of the decade. Of course, that program entailed vast outlays of public funds in a major race with the Soviet Union, while the current effort is overwhelmingly voluntary.
Corporate sponsors of the effort include MCI, Netcom and America On-Line. In all, more than 3,000 Net Day kits were mailed to schools around the state, each worth about $500, and including 2,000 feet of cable and enough plugs to wire the school library and six classrooms. The wire is brought to a central point, and the spread down the hallways through ceilings and heat ducts to hook up as many a dozen computers.
In some schools, corporations donated computer hardware as well, and the Government has also contributed some surplus computers to individual schools. Mr. Gore said the next step is to try and connect schools in the six impoverished urban areas covered by the Federal Empowerment Zone program, which offers tax incentives and other aid to communities that organize economic redevelopment plans.
The most recent figures from the Department of Education show that half of the nation's schools now have access to the Internet, up from 35 percent in 1994, and well ahead of the estimated 6 percent of the general public with either Internet or on-line access. The number of individual classrooms connected have increased to 9 percent from 3 in the past two years.
Connections are most common at high schools, with 65 percent connected, up from 49 percent a year earlier.
What to make of the connections is another question. Proponents say the effort will give students access to an incredible array of research and learning tools, but critics say the flood of new technology could promote a hodge-podge teaching and learning style, instead of disciplined curriculum. In addition, many public school buildings are old enough that they will have problems simply accommodating the new wiring needs.
Addressing criticisms that the President should not be promoting high-technology when many schools remain in disrepair and lack basic necessities. Mr. Clinton said that if students have high-tech skills, "our school districts will be wealthier and better." He said that the same volunteers who are laying cable today could volunteer to do fix-up work as well.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore's appearance here was augmented by Education Secretary Richard Riley in San Diego, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown in Sacramento and the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Reed Hundt in Los Angeles, and all were linked to the festivities here electronically.

HEADLINE: WELFARE REVAMP, HALTED IN CAPITAL, PROCEEDS ANYWAY

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 9

 BODY:
Although Congress and President Clinton remain deadlocked on landmark legislation overhauling the nation's welfare system, states around the country, with conservative governors and legislators in the lead, have already cut billions of dollars from welfare programs and have won waivers from Washington enabling them to experiment with ways of cutting billions more.
As a result of these initiatives, some of the most significant welfare changes contemplated by Congress -- limiting the length of time in which a beneficiary can receive assistance, for instance, and imposing work requirements on most recipients -- are already being tested at the state level. 
 The net effect of the various efforts, either adopted or pending, will have been to remove millions of people from the welfare rolls and slash the benefits of those remaining.
"Even though Washington has not been able to produce a new welfare system, welfare as we know it is already disappearing," said Steven D. Gold, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.
Nowhere are the changes more evident than in California, where even a county government has been led to undertake welfare-cutting: last week Los Angeles County reduced general assistance -- a program of cash payments that aids able-bodied adults without children and has 90,000 local beneficiaries -- by 25 percent.
In Sacramento, meanwhile, the Republican majority in the State Assembly recently won passage of a measure that would impose a statewide two-year limit on benefits to a general-assistance recipient. Among a number of other Assembly-passed provisions is one that would eliminate welfare entirely for people who are disabled because of alcoholism or drug abuse. And Gov. Pete Wilson is trying to nudge welfare recipients into the job market with his proposals not only for time limits but also for a reduction in the size of benefits.
If California's efforts at changing welfare have been aggressive, they are by no means uniquely so. In the last year alone, half a dozen states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, have followed an example set by Michigan and eliminated general assistance altogether.
In the same period, 11 states, Connecticut among them, have asked the Government for waivers from Federal law so that they can limit the duration of the assistance that they dispense under the main, $23-billion-a-year Federal welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. In all, 37 states, including New York and New Jersey, have now won such waivers, either to adopt time limits or to impose other restrictions, including stringent work requirements and a denial of additional benefits to women who have more children while on welfare.
These drives, and others, coincide with continuing efforts by the Republican Congressional majority to write a vast transformation of welfare policy into Federal law. Legislation passed by Congress late last year would have ended the Government's six-decade-old guarantee of cash assistance to poor children, instead giving states block grants to use for relief programs, with relatively few Federal strings attached. President Clinton, who had initially supported a Senate version of the bill, vetoed the measure that emerged from Congress, declaring that it could impoverish hundreds of thousands of children.
Despite the current stalemate in Washington, few state officials doubt the inevitability of a huge shift in responsibilty for welfare, from the Federal Government to the states, an approach that has the backing of the nation's governors. Given that prospect, state officeholders say, what better time than now to design their own, less expensive welfare operations?
That sentiment has only added to an impetus for changes that stems from a variety of factors: Mr. Clinton's own 1992 campaign promise to revamp welfare thoroughly, a shift to the right not only in Congress but also in statehouses around the country, popular support for the concept of government downsizing and general acceptance of the notion that welfare as it has existed since the New Deal has done more to promote a cycle of dependency than anything else.
"Between the President's rhetoric of 'ending welfare as we know it,' which moved the public sharply to the right; his use of the waiver to let states experiment, and the Republicans' taking control of Congress, a torrent of new thinking has been unleashed on welfare," said Douglas J. Besharov, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research.
"Am I happy with 100 percent of it?" Mr. Besharov said. "No. But for too many years we were on autopilot. What California needed was not what Michigan needed. We need looser joints. And the waiver program is letting us do that."
Agreement comes from Michael Dubke, executive director of the Ripon Society, a national organization of moderate Republicans, who says time limits on welfare benefits are particularly welcome. "Individuals who are on welfare," Mr. Dubke said, "use a lot of the creative energy that could be used in the workplace on ways to stay on welfare and how to stay trapped into this system of dependency. So I think that having a cutoff point from benefits is good. I don't think a two-year time limit is too draconian."
On the other hand, advocates for the poor now see gaping holes in the social safety net woven by the Government 60 years ago to rescue the destitute. They contend that governors and state legislators are trying to solve fiscal problems at the expense of the least politically powerful.
"If the trend continues," said Henry A. Freedman, executive director of the Center on Social Welfare Policy and Law, "we're going to see a massive social dislocation within the country at the same time when the labor market is not offering opportunity. We're going to have more and more people competing for the worst-paying jobs in the country. It's a very troubling future."
Mark Greenberg of the Center for Law and Social Policy agreed, and said, "It is increasingly clear that if there are not minimum Federal standards, a group of states will sharply reduce the availability of assistance for poor families with children."
Of all the nation's officials who have embraced the welfare-revamping issue, perhaps no other has been so active as John Engler, Michigan's second-term Republican Governor, who has played a central role in Federal lawmakers' own efforts to dismantle the current system. One of Mr. Engler's first successes after taking office in 1991 was winning the State Legislature's approval to eliminate Michigan's general assistance program, which had paid $147 a month to each of 83,000 adults. The state has also cut the average monthly benefit of those who remain on welfare, to $422 from $445 in October 1992.
More recently, Governor Engler has proposed a variety of rules intended to move all beneficiaries into jobs and eventually off relief. The proposals generally combine the carrot of more generous benefits -- poor people who worked would receive services like child care and transportation, for example -- with the stick of none: beneficiaries who could not find jobs in the private sector would be required to perform community service and, upon refusal, would lose all assistance.
Other governors too have been busy in the movement. Last month Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey proposed a measure that would limit all benefits to five years and mandate that teen-age beneficiaries stay in school and live with a parent or another adult. Governor Whitman's proposal would offer job training, day care and incentives for teen-age parents to finish their education.
In Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland recently proposed withholding welfare payments from parents whose children have had too many unexcused absences from school. Last year Mr. Rowland, having won a Federal waiver and legislative approval, imposed the nation's strictest time limit, 21 months, on benefits for welfare families.
Both the school-absence sanction and time limits were first tried by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, chairman of the National Governors' Association, who is a leader among elected Republicans in the drive to overhaul welfare. With those and other new rules, Wisconsin's caseload has dropped 27 percent, to about 71,000, since Mr. Thompson took office in 1987.
In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed time limits both in the general assistance program, what the state calls Home Relief, and in Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Home Relief beneficiaries would face a 60-day limit on aid during each 12-month period, while Aid to Families recipients would be limited to five years' benefits for their lifetimes.
Mr. Pataki would also make deep cuts in the size of benefits, a step that he maintains is necessary to discourage the poor elsewhere from moving to New York in search of greater assistance. For a family of three, the monthly check would be reduced to $424 from $577, or 26 percent.
In at least one case, though, the welfare-cutting has been undertaken without great enthusiasm. Officials of Los Angeles County say the 25 percent reduction that they imposed last week in general assistance was due largely to California's worst recession in half a century, a 1992 state law that has diverted close to $1 billion in property tax revenue from the county's general fund to public schools and a continuing influx of illegal immigrants, who place additional burdens on health, welfare and other services.
Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the county's Board of Supervisors, said of the cut, "This is not something we relish but is something we have to do, given what's happening in Washington and Sacramento." The board says the reduction, to $212 from $285 in each beneficiary's monthy check, will save the county $25 million in the current fiscal year.
Whatever the reasons for the cutback, it is fair to say that beneficiaries are not looking forward to it. At the run-down Figueroa Hotel in South-Central Los Angeles, which has a clientele that for the most part is only one step ahead of homelessness, several residents spoke bitterly the other day.
Roy Shultz, a 37-year-old carpenter who is in a methadone drug-treatment program, said he feared that the cut would force him and his friends back onto the streets. "Some will go out and break the law," he said, "and that is not what I want to see."
Lynn Page, 43, a former drug addict who now works as a custodian at a nearby elementary school and shares a cramped, unadorned room at the hotel with a friend, said that even with a job and a roommate, "quite frankly, I can't pay the $240-a-month rent here."
"I'm going to pray that the owner is sensitive until something comes through," she said. "What can you do with $212 a month? Nothing."

HEADLINE: Bruno Stein, 65, N.Y.U. Professor

 BODY:
Bruno Stein, a professor of economics at New York University who wrote extensively on labor relations, mediation and pension systems, died last Sunday of pancreatic cancer at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 65.
Professor Stein, whose association with N.Y.U. dated to his days there as a freshman, started his career as an instructor in 1956. Beyond his teaching, he was director of the Institute of Labor Relations and director of graduate studies in the Department of Economics, where he oversaw the M.A. program. 
 He wrote and edited books about labor economics, labor relations, retirement-income policy and the history of economic thought. They included "Work and Welfare in Britain and the U.S.A.," published in 1976, and and "Social Security and Pensions in Transition: Understanding the American Retirement System," in 1980. From 1990 until last year, he edited "Contemporary Problems in Labor and Employment Law."
He often served on state and national panels as a labor arbitrator, mediator and fact-finder.
Professor Stein was born in Vienna. He graduated from N.Y.U. in 1950 and received a master's degree from its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences two years later. He received his Ph.D. in 1959 and was appointed professor of economics in 1968.

HEADLINE: Returned Refugees Say Cuba, Defying Pact, Retaliates

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CAMAGUEY, Cuba, March 4

 BODY:
One day after Washington and Havana agreed last May that "boat people" fleeing Cuba would no longer be guaranteed political asylum in the United States, 13 men were picked up aboard two rafts adrift in the Caribbean. Assured by the American and Cuban Governments that there would be no retribution against them, they were forcibly returned to their homes here.
Ten months later, however, members of the group, the first to be handed over to the Cuban authorities under the agreement, contend that neither Government has lived up to its obligations. The Cuban Government, they complain, has from the day of their return carried out a campaign of reprisals, intimidation and harassment against them, while the United States has failed to prevent continued violations of the immigration accord the two nations had signed. 
 In six hours of interviews in this industrial city 350 miles southeast of Havana, the returnees said they and several of their relatives had been systematically threatened by State Security agents, arrested on trumped-up charges or accused of working for the C.I.A. All but two are now without jobs because of their political status, they said, and the pair still employed are regularly harassed by co-workers, bosses or State Security officials.
"For the two Governments, this agreement has been marvelous," said Ulises Cabale, 29, an electrician who has been assigned to a temporary work-training program to repair electrical meters. "But for us, it has been a disaster that leaves us in a worse position than ever."
It was not possible to corroborate independently all the accusations the returnees made. But they offered specific details about actions taken against them, including dates and the names and ranks of the security officials said to be involved.
All those interviewed said they were interested in making their situation known because they still wished to leave Cuba and hope eventually to be admitted to the United States.
Under the May agreement, the Cuban Government promised to "insure that no action is taken against those migrants returned to Cuba as a consequence of their attempt to emigrate illegally." In return, the United States ended its 30-year policy of treating virtually all Cubans who reached American shores as political refugees, and was authorized to send diplomats from the American Interests Section, its quasi-embassy in Havana, to interview returning raft refugees to insure that the accord was being properly carried out.
 
'Illegal Departure' Is Still a Crime
But the agreement does not "preclude the obligation of the Cuban authorities or society to act against such a person for other reasons or crimes committed before or after the attempt" to leave Cuba, Ricardo Alarcon, the Cuban official who negotiated the accord, noted a week after it was announced. Nor did Cuba revoke an "illegal departure" statute on its books, which the rafters here said has recently been used to detain and question several of them.
The returnees said they had repeatedly told the American diplomats who are monitoring the accord of those and other reprisals being taken against them. But American officials have simply brushed aside their complaints, they said, and urged them to apply to a program that selects 20,000 Cubans each year for entry to the United States.
"Every time the people from the American Interests Section come, they tell us we do not meet the requirements to be political refugees," said Felix Ivan Rodriguez, a 29-year-old cook. "They tell us we have no priority, that our best chance is to try our luck in the lottery, like everyone else."
Human rights groups suggest that it is no accident that American officials are reluctant to pursue claims that the accord is being violated. Despite a recent heightening of tensions between Washington and Havana, they say, the Clinton Administration has a vested interest in preventing another flood of Cuban refugees toward Florida.
"There is a conspiracy of self-interest and silence going on between two contending parties, the United States and Cuba, that victimizes these innocent asylum seekers," said Arthur Helton, director of the Forced Migration Projects of the Open Society Institute, a New York-based human rights group. "The last thing either Government wants to do is raise the question of the viability of the migration accords."
Officials at the American Interests Section in Havana declined to discuss how the immigration accord is carried out, referring all questions to the State Department in Washington. [A spokesman there said on Friday that the returnees appeared to be subject to the same type of surveillance and ostracism as any other disaffected Cuban, but that there was "no proof they are being persecuted" as a direct result of their effort to leave Cuba.]
In a letter to the Open Society Institute last month, Peter Tarnoff, the State Department official who negotiated the agreement, said the United States was "generally satisfied that the Cuban Government has fulfilled its commitment." While there have been "individual instances of concern," he added, "we have engaged the Cuban Government vigorously on each of these."
For its part, the Cuban Government has consistently rejected any suggestion that it has taken reprisals against returnees.
"In all cases, Cuba has received them in accordance with the agreement," Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, a Foreign Ministry official who specializes in relations with the United States, said at a news conference in Havana on Feb. 29.
Since the agreement was signed in May, just over 300 Cuban asylum-seekers have been forcibly returned to their homeland by the United States. Though it is not clear how the experience of later groups compares with that of the first 13 returnees, human rights observers say it is likely that they have also been subjected to acts of official reprisals, harassment and intimidation.
Indeed, the Open Society Institute has documented several instances in which returnees from other groups have apparently been victims of official reprisals. In one case, a university professor lost his job because he was considered a "dangerous example" to his students, and in another a returnee was beaten by the police shortly after his return and the doctor who treated him was dismissed.
In testimony to Congress last year, Mr. Tarnoff said the United States would regard the inability of returnees to get a job as a reprisal "if it results from an attempt to leave Cuba without authorization." He also said any threat against relatives of repatriated refugees would be considered a reprisal "if it is officially sanctioned and is in response to the attempt to leave Cuba without authorization."
Interviewed at the small house he shares with his brother and fellow returnee Cesar and their mother and wives, Ulises Cabale said that only he and one other member of the first group that returned under the agreement were still employed. All of the others, he said, have been dismissed or are unable to get jobs because their files identify them as politically "unreliable."
 
One Is Accused Of Being a Spy
One of these others, Julian Avalo, 32, an automobile mechanic, said: "The only kind of work I've been offered is forced labor, harvesting sugar cane in a work brigade. Everyone knows that we were deported, so do you think they are going to give me a job over a party member, especially when unemployment is so high here? No way."
Denied employment as a Government cook, Mr. Rodriguez found a job at one of the new private restaurants the Government has allowed to open. But after he was visited by American diplomats late last year, he said, State Security agents turned up at the restaurant and accused him of being an American spy.
"They told the owner that I am cooperating with the C.I.A. and need to be put under constant vigilance," Mr. Rodriguez said. "Now I am worried I am going to lose this job because my boss doesn't like the idea of having to report on my activities all the time."
Both Mr. Avalo and the Cabale brothers said they too had been warned that they might be arrested for spying for the United States as a result of their contacts with the American Interests Section. Because they are returned refugees, they said, their telephone is tapped, and they are under increased surveillance by State Security, the police and the neighborhood watchdog group known as the Committee to Defend the Revolution.
"I've been thinking lately that it might be better to tell the American diplomats not to come anymore," Mr. Avalo said.
 
A Wife, Too, Finds She Is Unemployable
Mr. Rodriguez's wife, Giselda, who lost her job at the telephone company shortly before her husband set off from Cuba, has also discovered that she is unemployable. "Everywhere I go, they tell me I can't work for any state enterprise because my husband tried to leave the country, and that makes me an unreliable person," she said.
On the other hand, another returnee, Victor Aballe, 43, spent six months in jail on what he says was a fabricated charge that he had embezzled money at his former job. While imprisoned, he said, State Security "insinuated that I was in this fix for having left the country, and that they were using this other case to cover that up."
Mr. Aballe, a lawyer, said that since his release last month, he and another returnee, Augusto Trinidad Ochoa, a 41-year-old electronic technician, had been formally accused of espionage. The charges have for the moment been dropped, he said, but "the way things work here, you can never tell what will come up."
Ulises Cabale said that as a result of the reprisals the returnees "feel like there is a hand on our necks, squeezing, and that we can't continue to live under this yoke." In the face of American indifference, he said, he fears that the Cuban Government will be emboldened to take even harsher reprisals.
"It seems like the migration agreement was signed between the authorities in Washington and Havana," he said. "But we live in Camaguey, not Havana, and we have no one here to protect us."

HEADLINE: The Geograpy of Taste

BYLINE: By Florence Fabricant

 BODY:
IT USED TO BE THTA THE FOOD YOU chose to put in your mouth revealed your roots as readily as the accent that came out of it. Now food preferences linked to region alone are beginning to fade. People move around. Food companies market nationally. Nonetheless, the quirks and wrinkles of particular tastes continue to faintly mark the culinary landscape. High sales of Nilla Wafers in the South, for example, or of chunky peanut butter in the West reflect endemic, though frequently inexplicable, affinities that have existed for generations. here are some of the things we like to eat, and where we like to eat them.

Babecue The number of barbecue restaurants in the country jumped from 5,947 in 1985 to 6,670 in 1992, the last time they were counted. What was originally a regional food is becoming national as the country's palate heats up - spice consumption, espeically of the hot peppers that go into barbecue sauce, has skyrocketed. Preferences remain regional, however, when it comes to the meat. Port is prefered east of the Mississippi, with vinegar in the sauce; beef in cattle country and in the West, where the sauce is tricked up with tomato paste.
 
Beef Consumptionw was up to 67.1 pounds per person last year, compared with 65.1 pounds in 1993, reversing an 18-year decline, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. More people are ordering beef in restaurants (up 3.2 percent), especially in steakhouses, where business is up 24.5 percent. According to Morton's of Chicago, a chain of 31 restuarants, a 24-ounce porterhouse sells well in New York. The biggest seller in Palm Beach is the New York strip sirloin. Dallas likes its filet mignon rare; in Atlanta the preference is for medium and in the Deep South, well done. In 1994 there was an incrase of 11 percent in the servings of large hamburgers, 6 percent for large cheeseburgers and 18 percent for bacon cheeseburgers. Three-quarters of all beef eaten in the U.S. is in the form of hamburger, and burger consumption was up 2.7 percent in 1994. Eighty-seven percent of Americans ordered a hamburger or a cheeseburger in the past year, which translates to five billion hamburgers a year, 14 million a day.
 
Butter In the Northeast 72 percent of families use butter, compared with 39 percent in the South, where they use margarine. Economics drove that choice, from the time when margarine was a cheaper substitute, and habit has taken over. Salted is preferred to sweet all over the country.
 
Cheese White cheddar is preferred in New York and New England, yellow in the rest of the country. The color-coding started more than 100 years ago, when Wisconsin began mass-marketing cheese and wanted to differentiate theirs from everyone else's. In 1970 the per capita consumption of mozzarella was 1.19 pounds. IN 1995 it was 8.27 pounds, virtually all of it consumed on pizza.
 
Chicken Forty-six percent of folks in the South eat fried chicken, compared with about one-third of the residents in other regions. Seventy-three percent of those in the Northeast eat chicken baked or roasted. Americans spent $25 billion on chicken last year and at 70.5 pounds per person. Consumption is expected to increase to 74 pounds per person this year. In the past, when chicken-eating went up, beef-eating went down, but now both are gaining.
 
Chocolate Seventy-one percent of Americans prefer milk over dark chocolate. More milk chocolate lovers than dark chocolate lovers did not graduate from high school. People who prefer dark devoted chocoholics. The tend to buy it 30 percent more of it. Candy bars with peanuts are the nationwide favorites and most popular in the South. Goo Goo Clusters, a favorite in Tennessee, are not sold anywhere else. Snickers is the No.1 - selling candy bar.
 
Cookies In general, people who live in the mountain states eat 30 percent more cookies than those in other parts of the country. Mallamars are sold in the Northeast in fall and winter. (The dark chocolate can't be sold in war weather - it melts too quickly - and anyway it doesn't tempt the rest of the country.) Sixty percent of all Nilla Wafers sold end up in the South and the Southwest, often make the banana pudding pie recipe on the box. More people (35 percent) eat Oreos by twisting them open than by any other method, especially in Topeka, Kan.; Waco, Tex., and Birmingham, Ala. In New York, 39 percent twist, 29 percent dunk, 156 percent nibble and 16 percent freestyle. The top dunking city is Hagerstown, Md.
 
Hot Dogs Nobody seems to know for sure why they eat them the way they do in different parts of the country. But during the Depression, the Vienna Beef company of Chicago, the major purveyor in that city, collaborated with vendors on the Chicago dog: yellow mustard, chopped raw onion, sweet relish, dill pickles, tomato and celery salt on a poppy-seed bun. In New York hot dogs are topped with steamed onions and yellow mustard. In Kansas City sauerkraut and melted Swiss go on top, and coleslaw is popular in the South. People in the East and Middle West are more partial to hot dogs than residents of other regions because, according to the National Park Producers Council, more of them are descendants of Germans and Eastern Europeans.
 
Ice Cream Americans east an average of 13 quarts of ice cream a year and spend $3 billion on it. More ice cream is consumed in the South than in any other part of the country. But people spend more money on ice cream on the coasts, where the superpremium brands like Haagen-Dazs and Ben & Jerry's originated. Frozen yogurt is more popular in the East than in any other part of the country, perhaps because more yogurt is eaten there than anywhere else. Frozen yogurt sales have never encroached on ice-cream sales, which in any case are on the increase, resulting from an influx of low-fat and no-fat products in many ice-cream brands. Haagen-Dazs says vanilla is the top flavor nationwide. Chocolate is second. In the West, espeically Los Angeles, they prefer their chocolate with stuff in it, like chocolate chocolate chip. In the East, they like butter pecan, in New York, coffee.
 
Mayonnaise On the West Coast they treasure Best Foods mayonnaise. Always have. On the East Coast, Hellmann's. The Middle West clings to Miracle Whip, that Depression-era invention bulked up with starchy extenders to replace some of the fat. Mayo is king in New Orleans, where they eat 2.4 times as much as anywhere else. For the past 10 years, America's most popular sandwich has been ham with mayonnaise. The least amount of mayonnaise is consumed in Omaha.
 
Orange Juice Over the las tyear Americans drank 743 million gallons of orange juice, according to Florida Department of Citrus. New York is the city with the highest consumption, at more than 64 million gallons; in Los Angeles, consumption was 34 million gallons. Fewer people in the South use frozen O.J., which is used the most in the West.
 
Peanut Butter Average per capita consumption is 3 pounds a year, 9,120 calories. By brand, Skippy is the choice in the East and the West, Jif in the Middle West and Peter Pan in the South, the regions where these brands were originally produced. Red Wing is a cult favorite in New York. Creamy tops chunky by almost two to one, except in the West, where chunky gains. The manufacturers of Skippy speculate this is because chunky is perceived to be more "natural," and "natural" products play well in that part of the country. Thirty-three percent of all the peanut butter consumed on the West Coast is Skippy Super Chunk.
 
Pizza There are approximately 60,580 pizzerias in the United States, as of Jan. 31, 1996, up from 39,937 10 years ago. In New York State there is one pizzeria for every 3,525 people. Mississippi has only one per 9,777. Twice as many pies and slices are ordered with cheese no meat, in the Northeast, where restaurant pizza is also most popular. Frozen pizza, especially with meat (sausage, etc.), has the biggest following in the North Central region, where total consumption is highest. On the West Coast they like pizza with vegetables.
 
Potatoes French fries are the most popular form, and the Middle West eats the most of them. Fries are eaten mainly in restaurants, especially fast-food restaurants, and especially to go.
 
Salad Dressing Tastes run to Russian and Thousand Island in the South, French (the orange-colored kind) in the Middle West, Italian - especially Wish-Bone - in the East and ranch in West. Newman's Own Caesar dressing sells best in the West, where the Caesar was invented.
 
Salsa With salsa sales at $734.5 million, up 6.4 percent, and unit sales at $366.8 million, up 1.7 percent, as of Dec. 3, 1995, salsa is playing catch-up with ketchup. During the same period, ketchup sales reach $420.7 million, up 1.7 percent, with unit sales at $293.2 million, down 1.7 percent. Salsa is preferred hot, and often green, in the West and mild in the East. But Vermont is the exception, a salsa-loving corner where no fewer than a dozen brands - mild and hot, green and red - are produced.
 
Soup Some soup flavor preferences are easier to understand. Philadelphia is partial to pepper pot, which is said to have been created for Washington's cold, hungry troops at nearby Valley Forge in 1777-78. And Philadephia is the only city where the soup is now sold. And if they like French onion soup better in New Orleans than elsewhere, the demographics, with so many residents with French roots, are the reason. Campbell's chicken noodle? Cincinnati. But in Miami, chicken broth. Albany prefers Manhattan clam chowder; New York likes green pea. Indianapolis, chili beef; El Paso, chicken with rice; St. Louis, New England clam chowder and cheddar cheese in Memphis. A third of a billion cans of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup are consumed annually; Grand Rapids, Mich., is the city that likes it the most.
 
Tea The South is the iced tea capital, where it is made with tea bags, the cheapest way. That's how they can afford to give it away, as they do in most restaurants. Herbal tea is most popular in the West, where Celestial Seasonings is based. Instant hot tea is particular to the Central States; the East is where the most hot tea is drunk.
 
Tuna More than 90 percent of all the tuna consumed in America is canned, with highest consumption in the East, especially in Harfrod and New York. New York is No. 1 when it comes to white albacore tuna, with 25 percent of the total national consumption. Annual consumption of canned tuna (3 1/2 pounds per person) is higher than it is for peanut butter.

HEADLINE: Did Yeltsin Get a Sweetheart Deal on I.M.F. Loans?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
Poor countries usually do a bit of groveling and a lot of kicking and screaming when they negotiate with the International Monetary Fund, needing the loans the organization provides but resenting the demands for austerity that accompany its help.
The pattern seemed different, though, as the fund negotiated and then reached agreement on a three-year, $10.2 billion loan package with Russia last month, raising questions about whether Moscow was getting special treatment. 
 President Boris N. Yeltsin bragged to Russian voters that he had used his influence with Western leaders to make sure that the I.M.F. treated his country right.
Far from steeling the country for further budget cuts, Mr. Yeltsin announced that some of the cash would be used to help with huge unpaid wage bills the Government owed workers, one of the Russian leader's most sensitive political problems.
Then, last week and the week before, in moves that were hard not to interpret as Russia thumbing its nose at the monetary fund, Mr. Yeltsin's Government proposed raising tariffs on many imports, a step that would run counter to the spirit if not the letter of the loan agreement.
With Mr. Yeltsin trailing in his bid for re-election in June, his bluster toward the fund was no doubt shaped in part by a desire to be seen at home as the man who can wring aid and concessions from the West.
But the loan deal, and Moscow's reaction to it, have left some analysts wondering whether the I.M.F. tacitly put aside its avowedly apolitical approach to economic development by giving Mr. Yeltsin a sweetheart deal -- or at least a good deal at a very propitious time.
Officials at the fund's headquarters here strongly denied any political favoritism, saying that if anything the terms, which include detailed monthly assessments of Russia's economic policy and peformance, were especially tough.
And while they said it would be naive to suggest that their programs did not have political consequences, they said their lending decisions in Russia, as elsewhere, continued to be based only on economic factors.
"Our treament of Russia on this occasion is the same as our treatment of other member countries," said John Odling-Smee, the director who oversees the fund's dealings with Russia. "We're not supporting Yeltsin or his Government. We're supporting the economic program which they are pursuing."
In the United States and in Europe, though, some foreign policy analysts saw the loan agreement as motivated in part by a desire to support Mr. Yeltsin against Communist and nationalist rivals who are hostile to market-oriented economic reform.
Some even suggested that the fund was effectively helping to finance the war in Chechnya by giving economic succor to Mr. Yeltsin at a time when the military bill was biting deeply into the budget.
Saying the loan was "an implicit vote in favor of candidate Yeltsin," the French newspaper Le Monde editorialized that "the West is playing a dangerous game" and that there was "neither the urgency nor the necessity for a gesture so spectacular."
Officials outside the monetary fund who deal with international economic assistance programs said any deal with Russia would necessarily be a special case, especially given the country's strategic importance to the United States and the other big industrialized democracies that provide most of the fund's money.
American officials said they did not seek to use the fund to conduct foreign policy. Yet while officials of the fund were still negotiating with Moscow early this year, President Clinton stated publicly that the United States, the fund's biggest contributor, wanted the deal to happen -- undermining the I.M.F.'s bargaining power with Russia in the process, officials outside the fund said.
"I believe the loan will go through, and I believe that it should," Mr. Clinton said during a visit by the Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, to Washington in January.
During the negotiations, Russia said at different times that it wanted as little as $9 billion and as much as $12 billion. At $10.2 billion, the three-year credit finally agreed on was large by monetary fund standards, but not unprecedented.
The general guideline is that countries can borrow annually up to 100 percent of the amount they have contributed to the fund over the years -- in Russia's case, about $6 billion a year.
The guideline is occasionally put aside, as it was for Mexico in late 1994 when an economic crisis there led officials to agree to a $7.8 billion loan that was nearly 700 percent of Mexico's quota, or theoretical credit limit, under the fund's guidelines.
Among all countries with three-year agreements similar to Russia's, the average loan amount is 42 percent of the national quota per year, according to figures provided by the I.M.F. Russia's loan averages 53 percent of its quota a year over the three years.
Russia's first big loan from the fund, a one-year agreement reached last March, was 100 percent of its quota.
The fund's decision to grant the new loan, officials said, reflected Russia's success in meeting all of the targets for economic performance set out in last year's loan agreement. In particular, Russia succeeded in bringing down its inflation rate and budget deficits, and it began the process of establishing workable tax and financial systems.
"Last year's program was viewed by most observers as quite successful, perhaps surprisingly successful," said Jack T. Boorman, the director of policy development and review at the fund and the official in charge of insuring that all countries are treated equally.
"The institutions and the political policy makers had proven themselves capable of instituting this and holding themselves together," Mr. Boorman said, "Now it's time to get on with a three-year arrangement with a more aggressive transformation program."
The timing of the loan, Mr. Boorman said, was dictated largely by Russia's budgetary cycle, and not by the schedule for the presidential election.
Recognizing that there could be a change in government after the election, the fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, met in Moscow last month with some members of opposition parties in Parliament, although he did not make a concerted effort to see all the opposition party leaders, Mr. Boorman said.
Russia, fund officials said, is just one example of how the fund, without wading directly into domestic politics, increasingly gives explicit recognition to the interplay between purely economic issues and social welfare issues that have great political sensitivity.
It would be bad policy, they said, to pretend that fiscal belt-tightening and conservative economic management of the kind the fund insists on can succeed if they do not provide for social welfare and stability.
In that sense, they said, Mr. Yeltsin's use of money from the fund to pay workers what they are owed, or to increase pension payments or finance social welfare improvements generally, are not just acceptable, but desirable.
In recent years, the fund has helped introduce an unemployment insurance program in Albania, urban job creation programs in Senegal, financing schemes for young entrepreneurs in the Ivory Coast and better pension plans in Kazakhstan and Moldova.
"There are mechanisms -- not paying civil servants, for example -- that give reform programs a bad name," Mr. Boorman said. "We don't want to be associated with that kind of program. We want to encourage countries to be more forthcoming on safety net issues."

HEADLINE: Sudan Holding Election That Some Call a Charade

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, March 10

 BODY:
The Islamic military Government in the Sudan is pressing ahead with an election this week, asserting that the polling will transform this country into a modern democracy.
But the leaders of opposition parties have dismissed the election as an elaborate and meaningless show intended to legitimize an unpopular Government. 
 Several candidates with ties to banned opposition groups have tried without success to withdraw their names from the contest, complaining that voter registration lists are incomplete and that a ban on political parties has crippled their chances.
The elections, as Khartoum faces crises at home and abroad, mark the first balloting of any kind in this desperately poor country since 1986. It is the first time the Sudanese have voted directly for president.
The vote comes at a critical time. The economy here is in tatters, the 30-year-old rebellion in the south continues unabated, and relations with the country's nine nearest neighbors range from tense to bellicose.
At the same time, the United States has cut off aid and last month pulled out its diplomats from Khartoum, citing security worries and saying the Sudan supports Islamic terrorists. Moreover, the United Nations threatened last month to impose sanctions unless the Sudan turns over three men wanted in the assassination attempt on President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Ethiopia.
Since a coup in 1989, the country has been ruled by a military Government under Lieut. Gen. Omar Ahmed al-Bashir. The Government is controlled by the National Islamic Front, a fundamentalist party led by Dr. Hassan al-Turabi, which was a minority party before the military takeover.
General Bashir badly needs the election to succeed to gain respectability for his increasingly isolated Government. The two largest parties in the previous Government, the Umma Party and the Democratic Unionist, have called on him to resign and to form a national unity government, which would organize new elections under a multi-party system. Most of their supporters are boycotting the election.
As the voting entered a fifth day today, turnout at polling places in the dusty, furnace-hot capital continued to be low. Many people said they were boycotting the balloting because they believe General Bashir's victory was a foregone conclusion.
"Each new government is just as bad as the last one," said a 28-year-old lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity. "People know the game, you know.'
Government officials brushed aside opposition complaints about campaigning restrictions and continued to predict that a majority of registered voters would cast ballots before the polls close on March 18.
In an interview, Dr. Turabi, who is a candidate for Parliament, said the restrictions on campaigning were intended to rid the elections of the influences of money. He defended the ban on political party activity, saying it was intended to divorce the Sudan from its history of sectarian and tribal politics.
"The idea here is to teach the Europeans another lesson," he said. "Elections there are distorted completely by financial power. If you are rich, you can beat the poor. Our moral life, ultimately, is against parties."
But some candidates said the measures the Government described as intended to level the playing field were in reality tailored to favor General Bashir and the governing party.
The dizzying number of candidates and the short campaign make it almost impossible for the candidates to educate 1.3 million registered voters about their positions. About 900 people are running for 275 seats in Parliament.
There are 42 candidates for president, most of whom were relative unknowns before this contest. They were given only 12 days to campaign in the country a quarter of the size of the United States. The Government paid for and printed one piece of campaign literature for each candidate. Each also received one 15-minute spot on the state-owned television and radio station to explain his platforms.
Arguing that the country has too many illiterate people to allow words on the ballots, the Government printed ballots sporting a list of symbols rather than names. Officials in polling places are allowed to "help" voters tick off the right symbol if they are confused, election officials said.
In a raffle last week, General Bashir picked a symbol of a fan, while Abdel Rahman Farah, a former member of the Umma Party who is seen as the only realistic challenger for the presidency, picked a table. Other candidates are represented by signs including an elephant, a rifle and a razor blade.
Dr. Turabi, who is seen by most diplomats as the de facto leader of the Government, tried to put the best face on the isolation the Sudan is suffering. He said, "Every new rise in civilization is encircled."
Dr. Turabi has argued that being cut off from United States aid and other foreign assistance will force the Sudanese to become self-reliant and develop industries like oil refining.
"I don't think the Sudan is close to collapse, though other people may like that," he said. "This country is self-sufficient in oil, arms, culture, food, everything you like."
"I don't care about the world," he added. "For me this is an act of religion."

The Great Disconnect

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A company announces layoffs that will make its products cost less and its profits rise. This is greeted as good news by investors, and the stock goes up.
But the Reich-Buchanan popu-libs -- their philosophy deeply mired in the 1930's -- treat "downsizing" as a sign of rampant greed by plutocrats at the expense of exploited workers. 
 The nation announces the good news that our rate of unemployment is making new lows, that job-creation is booming. Because this is treated as bad news by investors fixated on interest rates, the stock market falls out of bed.
Ah-hah! cry the popu-libs -- this logical disconnect goes to show that what's good for Main Street lumpen-proletariat is bad for Wall Street stuffed shirts.
On the campaign trail, Bob Dole cannot decide whether to identify with the resentment crowd or to admit that under Clinton, business is good. In the White House, Bill Clinton is equally torn, not knowing whether to share our joy or feel our pain.
Time for a half-dozen home truths.
1. You can't make a prosperity omelet without breaking eggs. Downsizing -- making a bloated, high-cost enterprise lean and green by laying off layers of supervisors -- provides the greatest good for the greatest number.
Overstaffed companies in Germany and Japan are playing catch-up because the U.S. has shown how slimmed-down producers deliver more value for consumers, more profits for investors and -- because only the fittest companies survive -- more security for workers.
2. Low unemployment is good for the economy. High employment's upward pressure on wages, which might reduce profits, is more than offset by increased aggregate demand for products, which adds to profits.
When the rate of unemployment was 8 percent, blue-collar workers bore the brunt of joblessness; today Joe and Josie Sixpack are back at work by the millions, but with middle managers getting the squeeze, you never heard such popu-lib anguish.
3. What is good for the economy is good for the stock market. Contrary to the current market mantra, good news is not bad news. Away with the notion that sweet are the uses of inversity. Try this for long-term insight: Only good news is good news.
Only bad news -- unemployment, recession, red ink, bankruptcies, plunging earnings multiples -- is bad news. If the day ever comes that Alan Greenspan's Fed gives away toasters to get us to borrow at no percent, that easy money would not disguise hard times.
4. Main Street is Wall Street. Who do you suppose profits most when stocks go up? Pension funds, which are the employees' assets, and mutual funds, which are owned by marvelous hordes of workers and consumers. Many union funds are putting heat on companies whose stock they own to maximize profits and increase the value of workers' investments.
Soon our Social Security Fund will invest in broad indexes of companies, seeking far higher historic returns than available from government bonds, thereby reducing the tax take from workers. The owners of America are the American people.
5. The devil should not take the hindmost, but the tail should not wag the dog. Sure it's humiliating to be laid off before retirement age. The human impact of staying competitive is undeniable, though smart managements seeking the value of loyalty ameliorate it. And new law to make health insurance portable will help.
But the sacrifice of the relative few in these prosperous times benefits the many. The alternative -- government meddling -- would interfere with job creation. Rather than join the popu-libs in whipping up the fear of getting fired and urging government-backed vengeance for the supposedly victimized, free-enterprisers should exhort each other to act as individual survivalists -- improving our performance, finding security in making our services more valuable as we get older.
6. Success is to be emulated, not envied. Professional resenters on the right and left are demonizing good executives and making achievement a dirty word. Owners, employees and consumers should want their companies to attract the best managers, the better to compete with other enterprises here and abroad, and competitive compensation tied to performance is often a wise investment. No salary is "obscene" that turns around a failing enterprise.
(Boy, will I get mail on this one.)

HEADLINE: U.S. to Fight Magazine Ad Tax by Ottawa

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is about to put its trade weaponry to work against Canada on behalf of American magazine publishers, and in particular, Sports Illustrated.
Administration officials said today that they planned to take formal action on Monday that could lead to the United States' imposing trade sanctions against Canada over tax policies that, they argue, form a barrier against the American magazine industry. 
 Fighting for the right to bring sports news and swimsuit-clad supermodels to Canadian readers may not rival prying open the Japanese auto-parts market in economic or political significance, but the action would be the latest in a particularly sensitive area of trade disputes -- those involving national culture.
It comes as the Clinton Administration is under criticism from Republicans, including Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the likely Presidential nominee of his party, for not acting tougher toward the nation's trading partners.
Canada has had laws since 1965 to protect its publishers. But this dispute concerns an 80 percent excise tax imposed in December on revenue from Canadian advertisers taken in by foreign companies publishing magazines in Canada.
The officials said the United States would act through the World Trade Organization, charging that Canada was unfairly keeping American magazines -- at this point mostly Sports Illustrated, a Time Warner publication, and a Canadian edition of Sports Illustrated it started two years ago -- out of its market.
To the American Government, it is a clear case of protectionism in entertainment and information, areas in which the United States is the world leader and that have drawn increased attention from Administration officials. The recent world trade pact, for instance, was held up for a time in 1994 over France's demand for protection against imported American movies.
To Canada, it is a matter of trying to safeguard its culture in the face of an onslaught of movies, television shows, books and magazines from the behemoth to the south.
The process would start with formal consultations between the two nations and then proceed to an international dispute panel. If no compromise was reached and the American position was upheld, the process could end with the United States' imposing unspecified retaliatory sanctions in about 18 months.
The Americans said they would act under rules of the World Trade Organization rather than provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico. That agreement exempts some cultural categories.
Many American magazines are sold in Canada, but only a few publish Canadian editions that compete for advertising from Canadian companies, in part because of other longstanding restrictions on foreign publications.
In this case, the obvious target of the new tax was Sports Illustrated, which for the previous two years had been publishing a Canadian edition seven times a year and was considering making it a weekly. The Canadian edition, which was printed outside Toronto, had some articles just for the Canadian market, but was otherwise largely the same as the American edition.
Although Sports Illustrated's Canadian circulation of 125,000 was considered modest and had no direct competitor in Canada, the Government in Ottawa acted under pressure from the Canadian Magazine Publishers Association. The association feared that if Sports Illustrated was successful, it would lead more American publications to enter the market and compete for advertising.
Sports Illustrated subsequently halted publication in Canada. Although the magazine remains available by mail and on newsstands, and has maintained its circulation, it is the American edition, and it no longer contains stories specifically for Canadian readers. Sports Illustrated no longer solicits advertising from Canadian companies.
"We felt the Canadian position on this should be challenged," said Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Sports Illustrated. "We commend what the U.S. trade representative and the U.S. Government are doing."
Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, said that Canada knows it is violating trade agreements but is acting "on commitments to protect its domestic industry."
"This is part of a broader and more disturbing picture regarding so-called cultural issues," Mr. Kantor said, adding that Canada had been acting to block free access to its market in the distribution of movies by direct satellite broadcasting and access to cable systems for the American-owned Country Music Television.
"Other countries will be watching the situation with Canada to see how we react," Mr. Kantor said.
Canadian officials said they had not yet been informed of the American decision to act on the dispute, but would defend their position before the World Trade Organization.
"We are of the view that we have a right to insure than Canadian culture is protected, certainly when dealing with a trading partner 10 times its size," said Ariel Delouya, a Government spokesman on trade issues in Ottawa.
The economic justification behind Canada's policy has always been that American publishers cover all or most of the cost of their editorial product by selling ads in the American market, and that they therefore can undercut Canadian publishers by offering more attractive advertising rates -- in effect, dumping their products on the Canadian market.
Alvaro Saralegui, Sports Illustrated's general manager, said that argument did not hold up with his publication because its advertising rates were about 8 percent higher than Canada's biggest general-interest magazine, Maclean's, on the basis of advertising cost for each 1,000 readers.
A handful of American magazines, like Time, have been exempt from the longstanding publishing laws of Canada on the basis they were competing there before the laws took effect. But they, too, have complained of unfair treatment.
For Sports Illustrated, which does not sell any other international editions, Canada seemed a natural opportunity, Mr. Saralegui said. Not only was there no national sports magazine, but the sports overlap between the United States and Canada was considerable and growing; indeed, the Toronto Blue Jays' winning the 1992 World Series was one reason the publication decided the time was right to begin a Canadian edition.

For 10 years, the Black Patriots Foundation has tried to raise $6.5 million to build a memorial honoring the 5,000 black soldiers who fought in the American Revolution. Now the group is racing to beat an October deadline. That is when legislation approving the location for the monument will expire. 
 New life was breathed into the project last month when the General Motors Corporation pledged $1.1 million, generating some fund-raising momentum. All the contributions must be private, since no Federal money is being used in construction of the memorial.
"The pledge from General Motors was critical," said Wayne F. Smith, the executive director of the Patriots Foundation. "Like many other memorials before us, we have struggled. Although many people think this is a great idea, donations have not been particularly strong. Over the years, we have written everybody to join our cause."
Also last month, the foundation asked Congress to approve the sale of a commemorative coin for the monument. A portion of the proceeds would be given to the fund.
The foundation has created a task force to broaden its grass-roots campaign and hopes to use the General Motors contribution to attract more corporate support. Early in the campaign the Coca-Cola Company and the Du Pont Company made small contributions. Last month the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People joined the campaign for the first time and stood alongside supporters from the Congressional Black Caucus at a Washington news conference.
The foundation is still $5 million short of its goal. Foundation officials said potential contributors could call (202) 452-1776.
Like organizations responsible for raising the money for the Vietnam and Korean War memorials, the foundation has traveled a long and often difficult road during its 10-year history. The project's co-founder, Maurice Barboza, a Virginia lawyer, was abruptly removed in 1992 by the foundation's board.
During Mr. Barboza's tenure, the group managed to raise only $1 million, and much of that has now been used up just keeping the group going.
Foundation members blame a sluggish economy and the emergence of competing projects, principally the monument to women who served in Vietnam.
When asked what might happen to the project if the fund raising falls short, Mr. Smith said, "We don't think America will fail us."
The monument would be built between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The design features two curved walls and a 90-foot bronze sculpture. One wall is devoted to a narrative describing the contributions of the many slaves and freed African-American men who elected to fight against the British for the independence of the Colonies.
Mr. Smith hopes the project will do more than memorialize patriotic African-Americans.
"It is important young people see a reminder that both black and white people helped found this nation," he said. "It is also important that blacks see that their ancestors have made an investment in this country."

HEADLINE: The Jobs Immigrants Take

BYLINE: By Roger Waldinger; Roger Waldinger, professor of sociology at U.C.L.A., is the author of the forthcoming "Still the Promised City? New Immigrants and African-Americans in Post-Industrial New York."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
America is in the throes of another debate over legal immigration, and this time those that would close the country's doors seem to have the upper hand. While an unhealthy nativism lies behind today's backlash, there are real reasons to worry about immigration. The most important: its negative effects on low-skilled African-Americans.
Until recently, the argument that legal immigration hurts blacks has found little scholarly support. 
 For one thing, immigrants often have a hard time winning the jobs filled by African-Americans. In New York City, for instance, more than one-third of African-Americans in 1990 worked in government. These jobs are among the most difficult for immigrants to get. Paradoxically, immigration spurs black employment in government, because immigrants need public services like street cleaning and public education.
But for low-skilled blacks, immigration is a different story. Stuck in the inner city at a time when immigration has significantly expanded, they are finding increased competition for jobs.
From World War II until 1965, the number of low-skilled people in New York City dwindled even faster than the supply of low-skilled jobs. But the 1965 immigration bill changed that. Since then, the number of people chasing low-skilled jobs has been increasing.
And in cities with large numbers of immigrants, these jobs increasingly belong to the foreign-born. In 1990, immigrants made up two-thirds of employed Los Angelenos with less than a high school education, and 90 percent of the employed with only an elementary school education.
Why do immigrants win these jobs? First, immigrant groups are very good at creating their own job niches and networking. And economists and sociologists have repeatedly demonstrated that personal contacts are important, especially among blue-collar workers.
Everyone knows about Korean-owned groceries and Indian-owned newsstands. But large industries also hire through the immigrant network. In 1990, Mexican immigrants were heavily overrepresented in 53 of Los Angeles's 82 largest manufacturing industries. A supervisor in a printing plant told me: "The referrals occur before the vacancy appears. Everybody out there knows about it before we do."
Secondly, employers play a role in immigrant hiring. Many, if not most, believe, however falsely, that immigrants will be more productive than blacks.
Recruiting through the immigrant network cuts off the workplace from the open job market. The result: African-Americans are often a very small minority in manufacturing industries. In New York's garment industry, for instance, only 3 percent of workers are black.
This disadvantage is likely to become worse in the future. Blacks have had the best of economic times when a vigorous economy has encouraged employers to pull in workers whom they previously had excluded. In 1970, for example, 81 percent of African-American men were employed. But the immigrant influx makes it unlikely that African-Americans would reap dividends even in a period of full employment.
That said, closing the immigration door even partly may not help. Legislation in Congress would cut the flow to 500,000 to 600,000 immigrants a year. At that level, New York, Los Angeles and other cities with huge immigration populations can still expect to receive a large and disproportionate share of newcomers, who tend to settle where their contacts are.
Alleviating the economic distress of low-skilled blacks requires attacking two problems: the unwillingness of employers to hire them and the lack of meaningful training. Putting roadblocks in the paths of immigrants simply won't do the trick.

HEADLINE: U.N. Agencies Feeling the Pain as the U.S. Lags on Payments

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 8

 BODY:
Congressional reluctance to provide money for international organizations combined with Clinton Administration delays in allocating the scarce funds that are available have begun to cut into a wide range of United Nations programs, many of which serve the world's poorest countries.
At the World Health Organization, the failure of the United States to pay any of its 1995 assessment has forced reductions in global surveillance systems tracking epidemic diseases and in programs to provide expert assistance to vulnerable countries. 
 The United States owes the W.H.O. $104 million for 1995, a quarter of the organization's budget, and another $107 million for 1996.
The United States pays the United Nations in two ways. Certain payments are assessed by international agreement -- for the organization's regular operating budget, peacekeeping missions and autonomous bodies like the World Health Organization, World Bank or International Civil Aviation Organization. The United States is now more than $1.5 billion dollars behind in those.
Other payments are "voluntary," in that the United States decides how much to contribute. For this year, the Clinton Administration had asked for $425 million for contributions to such agencies as the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Development Program, the Environment Program, the Population Fund and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Congress appropriated $285 million, down from $374 million in 1995.
The smaller amount of money available this year has already led to competition among United Nations programs and to lobbying at the White House and State Department by American officials assigned to the United Nations, who are fearful of losing both projects and influence.
"This is only the beginning of what could become an increasingly bitter struggle over a shrinking pie," an American official said. "The unwillingness of Congress to provide minimum levels of funds for our efforts to support development around the world makes it harder and harder to argue for a leadership role in the organizations that carry out these tasks."
Although final figures on allocation of voluntary contributions have not been made public, the agency likely to be hit hardest will be the United Nations Development Program. Its allocation may be more than halved, to about $52 million from $113 million in 1995.
The Development Program's administrator is James Gustave Speth, who, with the rank of Under Secretary General, is the highest-ranking American in the United Nations and the overall coordinator of development projects. With the reduced allocation, the United States will drop from the program's top donor to sixth place or lower, opening the way for a European bid for the top job when Mr. Speth's contract comes up for renewal in July 1997.
Last year, European nations lobbied hard for the directorship of Unicef, saying that the European Union donated more to the organization for children than the United States did. Only intense pressure from the Clinton Administration saved the job for an American. Carol Bellamy, the former Peace Corps director and once a New York City Council president, was appointed executive director.
Unicef, which enjoys popular support in the United States, will probably do better than other voluntary organizations, receiving about $100 million, the same as last year.
Administration officials say delays in making the allocations are caused by the difficulty of making fair decisions with diminished resources.

Another Frill: Giving the Poor Good Lawyers

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
ONE day last winter, Mitchell D. was accused of robbing a midtown deli. He said he didn't do it, but his court-appointed lawyer said he had a bad case and advised him to plead guilty. He refused.
A relative got him another lawyer, who learned that Mitchell D.'s fingerprints did not match the prints found in the deli and noted that while the police report said the eyewitness described the robber as dark-skinned, the defendant was light-skinned. That case went to trial, and the 29-year-old unemployed street cleaner was acquitted. 
 He credits his lawyer, who was provided at public cost. The lawyer works for Neighborhood Defenders Service of Harlem, a pilot project created as an alternative to conventional Legal Aid. The concept was to give some indigent defendants the kind of legal help that the more affluent can buy.
The program, which began almost six years ago, is scheduled to end this spring. The city will allow it to expire because it is considered a luxury. Beneficence to the poor is not a popular concept these days.
"Who likes lawyers, poor people, or people who are lawyers for poor people?" asked Daniel L. Greenberg, executive director of the Legal Aid Society. "It's part of the general climate that we live in -- anti-defendant and even anti-judge, and that's a shame. It's so shortsighted."
THE idea behind the service was to provide indigent defendants with comprehensive legal help, more than most get now from Legal Aid or lawyers in private practice who are assigned by the courts to poor defendants.
Poor defendants, by law, have a right to a lawyer, but the courts are swamped. Legal Aid lawyers usually meet their clients for the first time in court and can rarely do what the Defenders Service did in the deli case: investigate and look for inconsistencies.
Had he pleaded guilty, Mitchell D., whose lawyer insisted that his last name not be used, would most likely have served six years in prison. That would probably have been all right with the eyewitness, who still thinks he is guilty, Mr. D. said. It probably would have been fine with most Americans, who have little patience with defendants' getting off because they have good lawyers. But the law still considers people innocent until proven guilty.
"N.D.S. is a way of taking the integrity of the criminal justice system seriously for a community that we all know, after the O. J. mess, is incredibly alienated from the system," said Christopher E. Stone, president of the Vera Institute of Justice, which devised the program. The service's record shows that clients get more time, attention and service from Neighborhood Defenders, based on 125th Street, than from Legal Aid, whose office is near the courts downtown.
Its lawyers have a reputation for being well prepared, which reduces court delays. But the program is expensive.
"WE weren't saving anything in terms of municipal dollars," explained Paul A. Crotty, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Corporation Counsel. "We wouldn't mind paying more if more people got out on bail or got through the system faster. But we didn't find that."
The Harlem program, which is financed by the city, serves 2,500 clients on $3.8 million a year, while Legal Aid has 250,000 clients and a budget of $79 million. So, the service's per-client cost is about five times Legal Aid's. But the Harlem program's supporters say the comparison is misleading, because it provides more than just lawyers.
"The traditional formula used -- the cost-per-case analysis -- is an inappropriate measure here," said Robin Steinberg, the Neighborhood Defenders' deputy director. "We provide pre-arrest work, after-care services, and those fall outside those traditional measures. You can't cost it out."
What, for instance, is the cost of keeping someone out of the court system? Geraldine Scott, an unemployed railroad clerk, said she was about to be arrested for writing bad checks when she turned to the Defenders Service. A lawyer worked out a repayment schedule for her, and Ms. Scott, 51, has paid back all but the last few dollars. "I would have been arrested and taken through the system, would have had a record," she said.
In one way, the program does save money -- but it's state money. One study by Vera shows that Defenders Service clients serve 100 fewer days in prison, on average, at an estimated saving of $24 million a year in prison costs. "Crotty may say most of that is state savings, but most people are the same people -- taxpayers," Ms. Steinberg said.
The program might have grown instead of facing extinction. When the Mayor sought competition to Legal Aid, the Defenders submitted a bid to cover all Manhattan. Because it was too expensive, it lost to Legal Aid. "We never wanted to grow that much," said Leonard Noisette, the director. "But it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to completely eliminate us."
The program is scheduled to close its doors on June 30. It was always just a pilot project, Mr. Crotty points out.

HEADLINE: Students Looking to Unions for Careers in Social Change

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, Conn.

 BODY:
With large-scale layoffs and falling wages creating many of the same anxieties felt in the 1930's, Lazar Treschan, like hundreds of other idealistic college students, is planning to do what many of the best and the brightest did after college in the Depression: become union organizers.
Disillusioned by an economy in which corporate profits are soaring while millions of workers are being squeezed or discarded, Mr. Treschan, a history major at Wesleyan University here whose parents belong to a teachers' union, says the labor movement is the place to be for young people who want to set things right. 
 "I want to use some of what I learned to work for social justice," said Mr. Treschan, who is from Washington Heights in Manhattan. "I want a job where I can make a difference."
Since October, 400 students have applied to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to be organizers, and federation officials predict that the number will reach 1,000 by graduation time -- more than twice last year's total of 450. Of that number, about two-thirds will be selected for an intensive three-day training program that is the first step toward a career as an organizer. The influx of graduates, union officials say, will be the largest since the heyday of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers in the 1970's, and perhaps the largest since the Depression.
While some of the heightened interest could stem from the lackluster job market, it also results in part from a stepped-up recruitment drive by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has sent 22 recruiters to more than 100 campuses. The aim is to fulfill two goals of the federation's new president, John J. Sweeney: to train 1,000 new organizers and to reverse the decline in union membership.
Explaining why they want to become organizers, many students say the labor movement conjures up not the disquieting images of Jimmy Hoffa and corrupt, beer-bellied bureaucrats, but inspiring visions of aggressive, defy-the-odds organizers seeking to unionize $4.25-an-hour hospital aides or conducting sit-ins to raise janitors' wages.
"This is the best opportunity that I've seen for a college student to have a real job while working for change," said Celia Mosca, a government major at Cornell University who has applied to be an organizer. "Obviously a lot of companies are into downsizing, into getting people to work at the lowest possible price. The union movement is trying to create a better balance of power between companies and workers."
Chris Woods, who runs the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s efforts to recruit organizers, said she had been surprised by the upswing in applications from campuses. When recruiters visited Swarthmore last week, 30 students applied to be full-time organizers after graduation or to work as interns this summer. At Wesleyan, a dozen seniors have applied to be full-time organizers, while there were 13 at Rutgers, 6 at Cornell, 15 at Oberlin, 23 at the University of Wisconsin and 24 at the University of Oregon.
"It's phenomenal," Ms. Woods said. "We've never seen numbers like this. These students realize they're the first generation that will have a lower standard of living than their parents. These things are causing them to think what they should do in terms of trying to create some change."
To strengthen ties to campuses, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is also setting up "Union Summer," a new program in which about 1,000 young people will spend three weeks as interns doing organizing or political work.
Richard Bensinger, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s organizing director, said the spread of corporate layoffs was spurring student interest. "There's a tremendous concentration of economic power in the hands of corporate America," he said, "and on the other hand, there are very vulnerable, insecure employees, many of whom are the parents of these students and are having problems paying tuition. There's a sense of hopelessness permeating society, and college campuses. These are the sons and daughters of people being downsized, and they want to do something about it."
Union leaders and many professors, many of them veterans of the civil rights and antiwar movements, are delighted to see these students sign on with labor. But business executives are unhappy to see the students dedicating themselves to battling management.
Bruce Josten, the American Chamber of Commerce official in charge of countering the labor movement's lobbying and organizing efforts, said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was using fear and falsehoods to lure the impressionable.
"Sweeney is trying to sell them fear to sell his cause," Mr. Josten said. "Fear is a powerful motivator. I'm not sure how much it helps. His people talk a lot about downsizing and corporate layoffs, which have been and will be a fact of life in an economy that's dynamic. But do they tell these young people about the 70 million jobs that have been created since 1979?"
Some union leaders are also less than enthusiastic, questioning whether students can move smoothly from their ivied halls, their squash courts and wine-and-cheese parties to organizing poultry workers in Mississippi or sweatshop seamstresses in New York's Chinatown.
"I think basically it's a good idea," said Stefan Orza, president of the Central Labor Council in Middletown. "But these young adults will have a lot of obstacles to overcome. These jobs aren't going to provide them with six-figure incomes. They'll go into situations that are uncomfortable. I don't know whether they possess that kind of intestinal fortitude."
While many of their classmates are taking jobs at banks or consulting companies for salaries of $35,000 to $50,000 a year, these would-be organizers insist that they do not mind starting at $20,000.
Many students say they are eager for the commitment, confrontation and hardship that are an organizer's life. Some say they look forward to spending a month of 16-hour days organizing textile workers in North Carolina, or hopping to Los Angeles for a month of organizing janitors.
"Some of my friends say, 'Oh, my gosh, why does she want to take a job for $20,000?' " said Anna Davidson, a University of Colorado senior from Manhattan. "I think they've grown to respect what I'm doing. I tell them that people's voices in this country are going unheard, and that means we have to do grass-roots organizing."
Cedric de Leon, a Yale senior from Toronto, said his father, a cook, and his mother, a clerical worker, sent him to Yale with the hope that it would be a springboard to corporate success.
"There was a cultural and financial expectation for me to do well, and sending me to Yale was part of the plan," said Mr. de Leon, a sociology major. "But I couldn't reconcile my ambition to be a corporate executive with what I see has to be done in the world."
Having helped organize a United Farm Workers support group at Yale, he says he is willing to forgo a large salary because he wants to fight corporate flight and improve the lot of workers.
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials say an important criterion when they select applicants is how well they can communicate with workers. Those who spout polysyllables and quote Hegel are less likely to be accepted than students who have done community organizing or set up workshops on the problems of Hispanic, Asian and black women.
Last week at Sarah Lawrence, two recruiters, Maria Wickstrom and Kate Shaughnessy, interviewed Ciara Wilson, a senior with the type of resume the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is hungry for. Ms. Wilson has counseled poor New Yorkers about government benefits and has worked in Brazil counseling low-income families on AIDS prevention.
Ms. Wilson, a tall, assertive woman from Los Angeles, said she was not deterred by some people's perception of the labor movement as lethargic and hostile to minorities.
"In order for it to turn around," she said, "I want to be involved -- as a black woman and as a vigorous woman who is not lethargic."
After students have been accepted into the three-day training program run by the federation's Organizing Institute, 60 percent are chosen for the next step: a three-week internship in an organizing drive. The next step is to spend three months apprenticed to an organizer. After that, these fledgling Joe Hills are usually hired by one of the federation's 79 affiliate unions as full-time organizers.
Federation officials say they have spots for about 300 young people to complete the organizers' training program this year, double last year's number, with the number rising to 400 to 500 next year. About half the trainees come directly from colleges, while half are union staff members sent by their unions.
"We're looking for people who have a passion for change, a commitment to social justice," said Ms. Shaughnessy, one of the recruiters at Sarah "We're looking for people with a spark in their eye, people who not only can listen and understand working people, but can also inspire them."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL POWER LIKELY TO SHIELD SHIPS' SUBSIDIES

SERIES: SPECIAL PLEADERS -- A periodic look at lobbying.

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
In 1993, a task force advising Vice President Al Gore on "reinventing government" recommended the elimination of subsidies for the fading maritime industry, which it described as "a cancer eating away" at the Federal Treasury.
Soon after the Republicans took over Congress last year, the House Budget Committee put the maritime payments high on its hit list of dubious "corporate welfare" programs. 
 But now, the White House and Republican leaders are pushing a new plan for $1 billion in subsidies over 10 years for the country's private merchant-marine fleet, which has been dwindling for decades despite large amounts of Federal support.
After intense lobbying by maritime unions, shipping lines and powerful politicians from coastal states, the House passed the new program in December. And the Senate Republican whip -- Trent Lott of Mississippi, the son of a shipyard pipefitter -- is pressing the Senate to approve the bill this month, even though critics complain that there has been practically no debate on the issue.
Indeed, at a time when a vast array of corporate subsidies is under scrutiny, maritime programs are sitting snugly in an unusual political haven, backed as forcefully by labor unions as by industry.
The unions have shrewdly curried favor with influential Republicans as well as Democrats, dispensing more than $14 million in campaign contributions in the last decade.
The result is that while workers in other troubled businesses fear that they have nowhere to turn, the Federal Government seems on the verge of tossing the maritime industry another lifeline.
The industry's backers say, however, that one person's pork is another's salvation. The American maritime fleet has been badly hurt by subsidized foreign competition, and its backers say it deserves help because it could be needed in a war. The Secretary of Transportation, Federico F. Pena, has warned that without the new program, "in all likelihood our U.S.-flag presence in international trade will vanish."
To be sure, the aid would be much smaller than under the Depression-era program set to expire next year. The new bill would cut direct subsidies to ocean-shipping lines to $100 million a year from $200 million. It would also prod them to compete more with cheaper foreign shippers, and it would give the military more flexibility in calling on the civilian ships and terminals in wartime.
But even some shipping companies complain that other types of Federal aid, including a loan guarantee program for building ships, are flowing too freely into the industry.
A Houston shipping company recently filed a lawsuit that accuses Transportation's Maritime Administration of bending over backward to approve a shipbuilding deal involving Tenneco that hinged on $215 million in Federal loan guarantees. The suit says such cheap credit could encourage too much shipbuilding in the fragile United States coastal shipping trade and destroy some of the shipping companies.
A bigger version of the program did just that in the 1980's, costing the Government $2 billion in defaults. But the Clinton Administration, backed by Republican leaders, revived the program in 1993, saying the guarantees were vital to save America's shipyards.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said the maritime programs, which have cost taxpayers $10 billion in direct subsidies since 1936, "are not really making any sense." He said he might try to block Senator Lott's effort to bring the subsidy bill to a vote unless substantial debate was allowed.
Thomas A. Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonprofit group, wrote last week to Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, denouncing the bill as "entrenched corporate political pork."
But Mr. Grassley said the maritime unions had "tremendous clout." He said he was trying to convince fellow Republicans that a "good chunk" of the subsidies helped pay union workers who contributed to efforts to unseat some Republicans.
As foreign ships with lower operating costs have siphoned off cargoes, and as more goods are moved on fewer ships, thanks to improved technology, America's oceangoing merchant fleet has shrunk. It went from more than 2,000 ships in the late 1940's to about 850 in 1970 and is approximately 320 today. The number of seafaring jobs has dropped to 8,500 today from 100,000 in 1960. Tens of thousands of others work on ships that stay in domestic waters or at docks and shipping terminals.
To hold on to the Government aid, maritime political action committees, supported by both labor and corporations, have donated $17 million to Federal candidates in the last decade. The unions, ranging from the Seafarers International Union of North America to the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, have given the bulk of it, $14.2 million, according to Common Cause, the government watchdog group.
On average, union members earn more than $60,000 a year, and they fear that their jobs are at stake. The two largest shipping lines, Sea-Land Services and American President Lines, have registered some of their vessels under foreign flags and have threatened to make more use of cheaper foreign crews if the legislation is not passed.
Political action committees at American President and at Sea-Land's parent, the CSX Corporation, have accounted for $700,000 of the $2.8 million donated by industry in the last decade, Common Cause said.
The unions are also credited with persuading the Clinton Administration to drop the Gore task force's criticism of the subsidies. But while they backed Bill Clinton in 1992, "we're not like other unions that have kept an eye out for one party," said Daniel Duncan, the communications director of the Seafarers International, who keeps an old bumper sticker that says "Maritime for Nixon" in his office.
Albert J. Herberger, the Maritime Administrator, said the new bill aimed to offset some of the cost advantages of foreign shipping lines. But he said it would also revamp the subsidy system, cutting the number of subsidized ships to 47 from 75 and pressuring American lines to modernize and cut costs.
Currently, the Government calculates the annual subsidy for each ship, which averages about $3 million, an estimate of how much more it costs to operate the ship under American labor and safety regulations instead of under foreign rules. The new bill would limit the subsidy to a little more than $2 million a year. The bill would also define it as compensation for ship owners who agree to turn over their vessels and terminals at fair market rates to the Pentagon in a national emergency. Congress would have to appropriate the $100 million for subsidies each year.
Senator Grassley said, however, that the bill would not limit an even bigger boon for the industry: a requirement that the Government use American vessels to ship much of its goods, like peacetime military supplies and donations of surplus farm commodities. Congressional auditors say these laws cost taxpayers an extra $500 million a year and reduce the amount of food aid.
Critics also contend that the ability to commandeer merchant ships is not so crucial as it was in the cold war. The Pentagon has built its own $6 billion cargo fleet. In the Persian Gulf war, it easily hired both foreign and domestic liners to help out, and it did not have to requisition any of the subsidized ships.
While the new bill would aid the ocean-shipping lines, the loan-guarantee program is designed to help shipyards, like Tenneco's big facility in Newport News, Va., make up for reductions in Navy work.
Having a Federal guarantee against default enables shipping companies to finance new vessels on better terms from private lenders. In the last three years, the program has helped finance more than $1 billion worth of construction of Americanbarges and ships, including the first foreign orders in 30 years.
But a furor erupted last month when the Maritime Administration agreed to guarantee a $215 million loan for building five tankers to carry refined-oil products on domestic coastal routes. Tenneco, based in Houston, and its partners, including a Dutch-owned company and a union life insurance company, plan to build the ships at the Tenneco yard in Newport News, where employment has dropped to 18,000 from 30,000.
Other ship owners and consultants say that rates for chartering coastal vessels have been so low that no one would build the ships now without the Government's help, and they doubt that rates will rise much for years.
The lawsuit, filed by the Kirby Corporation in Houston, accuses the Maritime Administration of violating economic guidelines by approving the project for "a laudatory, but improper, political goal of short-term job creation."
Documents show that the agency agreed to let Tenneco and its partners repay the loan principal at a slow enough rate to avoid projecting losses for the first several years.
But John E. Graykowski, a Deputy Maritime Administrator, defended the deal, saying the agency was "absolutely confident" that the venture would be profitable. He said another advantage was that the ships would have double hulls and would therefore be less prone to spills.
"We protected the Government against the risks," he said. "We are not Pollyannas here."

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook: Stalin's Shadow;
The Pain and Pride Of Russian History

BYLINE: By PHILIP TAUBMAN 

 BODY:
Though Josef Stalin died 43 years ago, he torments Russia to this day. As Russians prepare for a presidential election this June, a revived Communist Party is struggling with the still volatile issue of Stalin and his legacy. Gennadi Zyuganov, the party's presidential candidate, seems wary of condemning one of the founding architects of the Soviet state yet fearful of embracing him. Other Communists openly defend Stalin as a great leader.
Americans find it hard to understand how Russians could regard Stalin with respect, even admiration. He was among the most brutal dictators in history, a leader who spilled the blood of millions of his countrymen in a drive to modernize Russia and enforce ideological conformity and personal loyalty in the Communist Party. 
 But the continuing debate over Stalin, recently described by Michael Specter of The Times, reveals some important, disquieting truths about Russia that America and the world should bear in mind as Russians choose a president this spring.
One is the power of wounded pride. The disintegration of the Soviet Union has brought democracy and the makings of a market economy to Russia, but it has also left Russia a second-class power. Its empire is gone, its once-powerful military is shattered and its place in the world is no longer clear.
Stalin gave Russia power and pride. The human cost was unimaginable. As many as 20 million people died during the forced collectivization of agriculture and the party purges, but many Russians see those losses as the price of industrialization and the emergence of the Soviet Union as one of the world's two great powers. Russians also credit Stalin with the Soviet Union's survival and eventual victory in World War II.
On the surface, the Communist Party today is far removed from the party of Stalin. Mr. Zyuganov and his colleagues offer Russians a retreat from the political upheaval and economic dislocation of reform, couched in the rhetoric of moderate social democratic policy. But smoldering just below the surface is a more visceral promise to restore Russia's power and pride. The refusal to denounce Stalin underscores that intention.
The debate over Stalin also reveals resentments that linger from a long-running struggle to shape the record of Russian history. Four decades after Nikita Khrushchev attacked Stalin in a secret speech to the Communist Party leadership, and nearly a decade after Mikhail Gorbachev reopened public discussion about Stalin's crimes, Russians are still divided over whether they have a 20th-century history worth honoring, beyond their role in the defeat of Hitler.
To disown Stalin is to dismiss much of Soviet history. As terrible as Stalin was, and as much as Russians suffered under his rule -- it is hard to find a family not wounded by the terror he sanctioned -- a people cannot easily repudiate its past. If the Stalin era is written off as deformed, then little is left to justify the sacrifices that were made and the lives that were lost. Younger Russians may not care much about this issue, but for older generations, where support for Mr. Zyuganov is strongest, it matters a great deal.
A Russian I knew well in Moscow once said that despite all the revelations about Stalin's brutality, the dictator was still her hero. He had transformed Russia, she said, from a backward land into a great nation. It was her way of saying that her life, for all its misery, had been part of a greater enterprise.
Stalin's place in Russian history may not be an overt issue in the presidential campaign, but it will be an undercurrent. Boris Yeltsin is already telling voters that his re-election is the only way to prevent a return to the abuses of Communism. Mr. Zyuganov in oblique ways is is trying to exploit the hunger among many Russians for a restoration of pride and power. It will be many more years until Russia finally escapes Stalin's shadow.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS' STUMBLE: THE WAIT;
Fund Investors Hold Key To Health of Stock Market

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Each time Wall Street has panicked in the last few years, investors on Main Street have stepped in and stemmed the tide of selling. Whether that continues today will depend on the hundreds of thousands of people who have invested in mutual funds in recent years.
At mutual fund and brokerage firms around the country yesterday, the volume of calls from customers rose, but there was no sign of panic selling in the wake of Friday's nosedive in the stock and bond markets. So if recent history is a guide, the stock market should stabilize. 
 But at least two large questions are unanswered. One is whether investors can tolerate the stock and bond markets' recent volatility, with record highs for the Dow Jones industrial average and sharp plunges following on each other's heels. The other is whether the stock market will continue to be driven by interest-rate changes and the pressures of the bond market, which pulled it down on Friday, or will respond positively to corporate profits and economic growth.
Fidelity Investments, the country's largest mutual fund company and one of the biggest discount brokerage firms, said phone calls were running about 10 percent ahead of a normal weekend pace. But in contrast to Friday, when sales of mutual fund holdings increased late in the day as word spread of the plunging markets, there was no strong selloff of investments over the weekend, said Teri Kilduff, a spokeswoman.
At Charles Schwab & Company, the nation's largest discount brokerage firm, telephone traffic was a third more than normal levels. Among the firm's mutual fund investors, "we expect to see a net redemption" today, Hugo W. Quackenbush, a senior vice president at Schwab, said. Telephone volume was up even more at Twentieth Century Mutual Funds in Kansas City, Mo., rising 50 percent above normal levels on Friday afternoon, a spokeswoman said.
On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 171.24 points, or 3.04 percent. Perhaps more startling was the drop in Treasury bonds: the price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell more than three points, pushing its interest rate -- which moves in the opposite direction of price -- to 6.72 percent, its highest level in six months, from 6.46.
What started the rout was the Labor Department's report that 705,000 jobs were created in February, greatly exceeding expectations. That dashed hopes that the Federal Reserve would further cut interest rates, an expectation that had for weeks been pushing both stock and bond prices higher.
If individual investors appeared calm for the most part, professionals spent the weekend wondering if stock prices would continue to take their cues from the bond market.
"Signs that the economy might be getting a little stronger are infinitely better for stocks than for bonds," said Abby Cohen, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. A stronger economy means continued growth in corporate profits this year and next, which, she said, indicates that "at these levels the stock market has some value in it."
The bond market, where individual investors are a much less significant factor, might be in for a rougher time, some analysts said.
"Too much damage has been done to too many people too fast to have it settle out anytime soon," said John Liscio, editor of The Liscio Report, a financial newsletter in Upper Montclair, N.J. "This kind of volatile market could go on several weeks, if not longer."
For much of the weekend professional investors warily awaited last night's opening of bond futures trading at the Chicago Board of Trade. Bond futures contracts give the holder the right to buy or sell bonds at a given price at some point in the future, and prices fell slightly at the opening, and fell a bit more during the session.
Most Pacific stock and bond markets also declined in trading today, in what traders described as follow-up selling to Friday's activity in the United States. In Tokyo, stocks were lower; the Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 359.58 points or 1.78 percent, at 19,796.29. In Hong Kong, where trading has been more volatile in recent days because of Chinese pressure on Taiwan, the market closed down more than 8 percent.
That is likely to put initial pressure on the American markets this morning.
"I would expect some follow-through selling on Monday, but the stock market should then stabilize," said Byron Wien, chief domestic strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. The greater-than-expected job growth in February "is, in fact, good news for the economy," he said, adding, "I think a lot of people were expecting earnings to be disappointing this year."
The Dow's 171-point drop on Friday was the third-worst ever in points, though in percentage terms it was not among the 100 worst trading sessions.
On five previous occasions since January 1988, the Dow has fallen more than 100 points in a single day. Each time, stock prices rebounded on the next trading day, in large part because individuals did not place large orders to sell their mutual fund shares that invested in stocks and put the money in cash accounts.
But when the Dow last fell 100 points, on Dec. 18, it closed at 5,075. Before Friday's drop, the Dow had risen 11 percent from that level in less than three months.
For much of that time, bond prices had been heading lower. The yield on 30-year Treasuries had increased more than half a percentage point in that time.
That disconnection between stock and bond prices has left some analysts thinking that while bond prices face continued declines, stocks will be helped by the growing economy. Others, though, anticipate further retreats in stocks, while bond prices hold steady or rebound.
"The feeling that interest rates would go continually lower has been one of the pillars of the bull market in stocks," said Leo Melamed, chairman of Sakura Dellsher Inc., a futures trading firm. And while a strengthening economy does bode well for corporate profits, he said, "I'm afraid that good earnings have already been factored in considerably" to current stock market valuations.
By contrast, Mr. Melamed said, "I fully expect the bond market to rally after a weakening opening" today. With long-term interest rates at 6.7 percent, "that's no small number for the stock market to compete with."
Increasing the volatility of both the stock and bond markets lately has been a greater-than-usual amount of speculative activity.
Extremely low interest rates in Japan encouraged professional traders and some large institutional investors to make a complicated multimarket bet known as a carry trade, analysts said. By borrowing at rates as low as one-half of 1 percent in Japan, converting the yen into dollars and buying United States Treasuries that paid 5 percent or more, a trader could lock in easy profits. The trade worked as long as the dollar-yen relationship remained steady.
But in recent weeks, as American bond prices fell, the dollar weakened and Japanese interest rates rose, the traders all got caught racing for the door at the same time. Some of those bets remain outstanding, analysts said, and they could contribute to further sharp moves in bond prices.
In addition, investors in stock mutual funds adopted a more conservative posture in late 1995, increasing their purchases of less volatile growth-and-income funds while scaling back their interest in aggressive funds. But as stock prices accelerated upward in the new year, money again began flowing to the higher-risk funds.
Bob Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund flows, said that in the last four weeks, $2 of every $10 invested in equity funds went to the category of funds known as aggressive growth -- twice the rate of the first four weeks of the year.
By contrast, investors picked up their rate of withdrawal from bond funds in the last half of last week, as bond prices plunged, according to Charles Biderman, editor of Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a newsletter based in Santa Rosa, Calif.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Indicting China's Terrorism

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
By firing missiles into the waters off Taiwan, Communist China is committing open, deliberate international terrorism of enormous danger.
Americans count on Beijing's survival instincts to stop the terrorism short of the disaster of war with the U.S. That may happen -- this time. 
 But every day that Washington fails to bring the missile blackmail and blockade of Taiwan before the U.N. increases the chances it will happen again, or something worse, until the disaster does take place.
The Communists' rage and fear at the example of Taiwan's democracy off their shores will not let them rest unless the Taiwanese give it up.
That is not likely. If any pro-democracy majority is elected in the March 20 voting, before long there will be another round of terrorism.
That may include some Chinese military landings on Taiwan. U.S. vessels will have to move in to live up to American word and legislation that the Taiwan-China relationship will not be changed by force.
So far, the U.S. has had to act alone. The Japanese do not have the political courage to make any strong public protest against the terrorism. I have not heard our European allies warn the Chinese that if it comes to it, they will immediately line up with the U.S.
U.S. failure to bring the Chinese before the U.N. will destroy a basic purpose of the U.N. The U.N. was not created simply to end wars but to stop them before they begin. Article 34 of its charter authorizes the Security Council to take up any matter that might lead to "international friction or dispute."
Any member of the U.N. -- or the Secretary General -- can bring a threat to the peace before the Council. China's veto power cannot be used to prevent putting a threat to peace on the Council agenda.
Separately, the U.S. and any country that considers itself a friend both of peace and America can condemn Chinese terrorism. Together they can present a resolution speaking for the U.N.
China will veto that. But if Beijing is so out of control as to threaten more terrorism in the face of a U.N. condemnation prevented only by a veto, we should know it as soon as possible.
Meantime, President Clinton should consider one sentence that tells how his Administration got to this point.
"The experience of China in the past few years demonstrates that while economic growth, trade and social mobility create an improved standard of living they cannot by themselves bring about greater respect for human rights in the absence of a willingness by political authorities to abide by the fundamental international norms."
The sentence in itself is not remarkable. It sums up the message of human rights victims around the world: strengthening our oppressors empowers them to torture us further. But it comes from the latest report on human rights of the State Department. It took courage by those officials who wrote or agreed to it.
Since 1993, the Administration has based its China policy on a contrary vision of morality and history. It insisted that economic growth in China would create a willingness by the dictatorship to live up to those "fundamental international norms." Beijing would give Chinese more human rights. It would stick to agreements against selling nuclear weapon technology. It would allow the people of territories it claims as its own, such as Tibet and Taiwan, to live in peace and dignity.
China's economy certainly has grown, stimulated nicely by $40 billion more that it sells to America than it buys from America.
So: Torture and political repression have increased. And so have oppression of religion, and forced abortion. The choke-leash around Tibet tightens. The chief economic beneficiary of the trade that led to economic growth has been the Communist army, which owns vast parts of the economy, including the forced-labor camps.
The new, richer China has sold nuclear technology to Pakistan and has become the missile salesman to the world's dictatorships.
President Clinton promised to struggle for human rights in China. He did not.
Now his China policy lies adrift in the Strait of Taiwan. He owes us a new one. Its moral principle and historic reality were written for him by the meaning of that sentence in the State Department report: enrichment of dictators enchains their victims.

HEADLINE: Audrey Cohen, 64, Innovative Educator, Dies

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Audrey Cohen, an innovative educator for more than 30 years and president and founder of Audrey Cohen College, died on Sunday morning at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.
The cause was cancer, said Alida Mesrop, acting president of Audrey Cohen College. 
 Despite her diminutive and seemingly frail stature, Ms. Cohen was a powerhouse of energy when scorning the rigidity and failures of the contemporary educational system and proposing how to reform it.
Her central idea -- that education must never be abstract but must be closely linked with clearly understood purposes -- attracted wide interest, especially among individuals and institutions serving members of minority groups, immigrants and the disadvantaged seeking access to the mainstream of American society.
At present, Audrey Cohen schools enroll about 20,000 elementary and secondary school students at locations in five states (Arizona, California, Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee), and some 1,500 undergraduate and graduate students in Manhattan at 75 Varick Street.
All of these institutions practice what Ms. Cohen described in a recent interview as "purpose centered" instruction. Her theory, she explained, is that students learn best when they use their knowledge and skills to achieve a stated purpose.
In the early grades, she said, an entire class guided by a teacher may focus on a single purpose, like finding ways to work together. Older students plan and carry out individual programs aimed at purposes like "We work for safety" or "We help people through the arts."
College-level students devote each semester to a more complex purpose in classes like "Values and Ethics," in which they study history, literature and government to extract ethical ideas, and "Self and Others," for the study of arts and writing, to develop productive relationships with people of all ages and cultures.
"Instead of teaching, let's say, the works of Schopenhauer or Rousseau," she said, "our college students concentrate on a purpose such as 'Values and Ethics' in which they may read passages from the writings of Schopenhauer, Rousseau and others which are relevant to the study of values and ethics. That way, it has a deeper meaning to the students."
Asked if approaching the classics with relatively narrow and invariably positive preconceptions might distort their meaning, Ms. Cohen insisted that students at her institutions are encouraged to read more than just assigned passages. "Our approach helps students to fit things together," she said.
Her methods have attracted considerable interest and support among educators throughout the country. Since 1992, Audrey Cohen College has received substantial grants from the New American Schools Development Corporation, a private, nonprofit organization based in Arlington, Va., that supports research to find ways to revitalize teaching.
This year the college has been selected for support by the Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit organization that advises the states on education policy.
Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Ms. Cohen graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pittsburgh, and later did postgraduate work at George Washington University.
In 1958, recognizing that college-educated women restricted by child rearing needed jobs with flexible work schedules, she founded Part Time Research Associates, a social science research corporation.
In the 1960's, Ms. Cohen became aware of the nation's shift from a manufacturing to a service economy, and the lack of training to meet the new requirements. This awareness led to her founding the Women's Talent Corps, which prepared numerous women for careers in such fields as social work, mental health services, occupational therapy and paralegal work.
Soon the Talent Corps became the College for Human Services, and there Ms. Cohen developed the ideas that led in 1964 to the founding of Audrey Cohen College, with its emphasis on practicality and purpose.
Ms. Cohen is survived by her husband, Dr. Ralph Wharton of Manhattan; two daughters, Winifred Alisa Cohen-Smith of Manhattan and Dawn Jennifer Cohen Margolin of Piedmont, Calif., and a brother, Carl Cohen of North Haven, Conn.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Jumped in January

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
Despite some havoc from the blizzard, new-home sales shot up 4.2 percent in January. It was the second straight gain as mortgage rates dipped to a two-year low.
"I think that a lot of people in January decided to take advantage of mortgage rates that in many parts of country were below 7 percent," said David Berson, an economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association. 
 But sales plunged 40 percent in the Northeast, which bore the brunt of the snowstorms. It was the steepest decline there in nine years. In the South, West and Middle West, sales rose.
Over all, sales of single-family homes totaled 693,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 665,000 in December, when they rose five-tenths of a percent, the Commerce Department reported today.
The report included data for both December and January, which had been delayed by the blizzard and partial Government shutdown earlier in the year.
For all of 1995, sales slipped nine-tenths of a percent, to 664,000 from 670,000 in 1994. It was the lowest level since 610,00 new homes were sold in 1992, soon after the economy emerged from recession.
The year's decline reflected four months of declining sales from August through November. Many analysts said that the drops reflected worries over job and income growth and high levels of consumer debt, and that these concerns offset falling mortgage rates.
But in January, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.03 percent, down from more than 9 percent a year earlier and the lowest since February 1994. That meant a saving of $140 a month for home buyers as the monthly payment on a $100,000 mortgage fell from $805 to $665.
Still, rates have been edging up since then and averaged 7.38 percent last Thursday -- before the Government reported a big increase in the number of new jobs that sent long-term rates higher.
"The housing sector is extremely sensitive to upticks in mortgage rates and this can certainly inhibit activity going forward," said David Lereah an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
But Mr. Lereah was skeptical about the size of the January sales increase, noting that existing-home sales -- more than 80 percent of the total -- fell for the fourth straight month.
And David F. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, was troubled by the number of unsold new homes, which he said could cause builders to cut back or lower profit margins in an attempt to sell off the large inventories.
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of January was 381,000, representing a supply of 6.7 months at the current sales rate. It was the largest since a 390,000 backlog in January 1980.
The median price of a new home was $128,900, down from $136,000 in December but above the $127,900 price a year earlier. The median is the midpoint, meaning half of the homes cost more and half cost less.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drifts Lower as Possibility Of Rate Cut in Germany Fades

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar failed to take advantage of recoveries in American stock and bond markets yesterday, drifting lower as a strengthening German economy changed the possibility of an interest rate cut there.
The dollar fell in light trading against the German mark and the Japanese yen as investors questioned their assumptions about the dollar's prospects following the plunges in stocks and bonds on Friday. 
 A German report issued yesterday showed industrial production rising there, and that helped dispel thoughts of any imminent reduction in German rates.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar slipped to 105.41 yen from 105.72 yen on Friday. The dollar was changing hands at 1.4807 marks, down from 1.4840 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5241 from $1.5235.
Friday's selloffs in stocks and bonds came after the Labor Department reported more than 700,000 jobs were created in February. The surprisingly strong number undermined the markets' expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to cut short-term interest rates to stimulate the economy. But the assumption that the Fed would hold rates steady bolstered the dollar on Friday.
"A lot of people wondered why on Friday, when we had the kind of fireworks we had in the bond market, why the currency didn't do more," said Lisa Finstrom, senior currency analyst at Smith Barney.
A similar shift in expectations about German interest rates occurred yesterday, after a report showed that industrial production in Germany rose 1.6 percent in January from December, and was up 2.2 percent from a year earlier.
This was accompanied by comments by a German central banker who said that given the rise in German bond yields it would be hard for the Bundesbank to lower interest rates further.
In Japan, where the central bank has been supporting a stronger dollar and trying to end its four-year recession, a report showed that country had its first current account deficit in five years -- after expecting a surplus.
That kind of weakness might make Japanese companies -- in an effort to improve their results -- sell more American bonds than usual at the end of Japan's fiscal year on March 31, Ms. Finstrom of Smith Barney said.

HEADLINE: Gaming on Wall Street

BYLINE: By Martin Mayer; Martin Mayer is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Today, the one sure tip in the stock market is to buy any company that is about to be added to the Standard & Poor's 500. The market is full of mutual and pension funds and bank trust departments that must buy stock in every company on that 500. Each time a company is chosen to replace one that has merged or gone bust, there is a sizeable demand for its stock, even if it has just published a lousy earnings report.
Increasingly, the stock market itself has become just another commodity -- as its recent volatility has shown. Instead of buying the stocks of individual companies, based on earnings and performance, increasing numbers of investors buy or sell "the market." Yesterday's rise on Wall Street, like Friday's fall, shows how much the market moves on bits and pieces of information far removed from the realities of business. 
 In the old days, the Wall Street credo was to buy on the rumor and sell on the news. The winner was the guy who bucked the tide. But in commodities markets the message was the opposite: The trend is your friend. Now that the stock market has become a commodity, speculators pile on whenever some report creates excitement.
The larger players use mathematical models that mix purchases and sales of stocks, index futures contracts and options in patterns that guarantee a return as safe as the interest on Treasury bills and somewhat -- maybe considerably -- higher. One strategy involves "dynamic hedging" -- selling in the futures or options markets when prices are falling and buying when prices are rising, which exaggerates all price movements.
The commoditization of the market has also undone the traditional reverse symmetry between stock and bond prices. Historically, when economic activity was expected to increase, stocks rose in anticipation of better profits, and bonds fell in anticipation of higher interest rates. When economic activity was expected to decline, stocks fell and bonds rose.
Thus in early 1987 the optimism that propelled the stock market depressed the bond market. When that optimism vanished in October, stocks plummeted but bonds jumped. The pension funds and balanced mutual funds that held both stocks and bonds lost very little in the market crash.
But the mathematics used in trading today's index funds emphasizes interest rate changes. Thus the stock and bond markets now tend to move together. On Friday, bonds suffered even more than the stocks. Only after the bond futures market closed for the day did stocks recover some part of their losses.
John Maynard Keynes once observed that businessmen who consider themselves paragons of common sense are usually slaves to the ideas of some dead economist. Today the economist is more likely to be alive, but the dangers remain. The big players in the markets are disciples of finance economists -- and finance economics is about making money, not about producing anything.
Because stock prices and production now have so little to do with one another, the 1987 crash did not slow the growth of the real economy. The slowdown in 1995, when downsizing actually reduced productivity, spawned a bull market.
It is not clear how much harm has been done by the hypertrophy of the markets. But the fact that a rising market no longer causes Americans to think the economy is improving is a clear indication that the markets have become less effective as a stimulus to real capital creation.
An even greater problem is that we have sold more than half a trillion dollars of our national debt to foreign banks to keep the dollar strong when interest rates are low. Foreign borrowing will eventually influence all securities prices, but the computers are programmed to ignore it. Too many our most able and perceptive young analysts have moved from problem solving in the real world to gaming in the financial world.
Our markets and our political discourse focus increasingly on the immediate, reducing our ability to understand the larger forces that act on the economy. And people who don't understand what they're doing are always susceptible to panic.

HEADLINE: As West Booms, Suburbanites Ask If Wild Horses Make Good Neighbors

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: RENO

 BODY:
For longer than anyone can remember, wild horses have come down from the hills here every fall, grazing amid the sagebrush just outside this high desert city until they return to their summer range in the mountains.
The horses' winter home, Hidden Valley, has in recent years turned into a residential enclave southeast of town, by the dry Virginia Range and far from downtown Reno. Here, residents have long enjoyed the seasonal migration, some feeding carrots and apples to the animals, others counting and naming members of the herds, watching them grow, play and start their own families. 
 "They're beautiful creatures, just beautiful," said Jean Carr, as several of the dark mustangs frolicked around her in the street the other day.
But the valley is no longer so hidden. As fast as sagebrush can be bulldozed, thickets of houses are rising up and suburban instincts colliding with feral ones. Those not so enamored of the horses, which nibble at lawns and stomp on sprinklers, have chased them off the country club in golf carts, thrown rocks at them and even fired guns into the air to frighten them away. Last year, a motorist accidentally struck a stallion that had been gamboling in the street, and veterinarians had to kill it.
Tom Clark, a real estate broker who has lived in the area for 22 years, said that each year there seemed to be more horses staying longer. He worries that the dark-colored animals are a safety hazard in a neighborhood with no street lights. And he blames people who feed and pet the horses for making them too comfortable around homes and then becoming angry when other residents try to drive the mustangs off their lawns.
"I'm not saying, 'Send them to the slaughterhouse,' " he said. "But if they eventually wind up in a horse burger factory, so be it. Is it better for them to hang around a residential area and get spooked every couple of hours?"
There appears to be a concensus that the horses, which run in three bands and total about two dozen, pose a problem, but there is little agreement on a solution. No government agency claims direct responsibility for them. One group of residents wants to build a fence to keep the horses in the hills; another wants to round them up and sell them to the highest bidder.
"They're not really anyone's responsibility, and that's a problem," said Maxine Shane, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Land Management, which protects wild horses on public ranges but not on private property.
With about 35,600 wild steeds roaming the fast-growing mountain states, the problem of the Hidden Valley horses is snapshot of the changing West: a clash between the region's cowboy heritage and a booming regional economy.
No state has more wild horses than Nevada, where about 22,200 wander the hills that break up the vast desert plains here. So well have the mustangs, descendants of the beasts brought by Spanish several centuries ago, taken to the terrain that the Federal land bureau regularly thins out the population. Last year, the bureau captured 5,600 horses in Nevada and sold them people around the country at $125 a head.
But when wild horses wander onto private property, they become the problem of the the State Division of Agriculture, which takes custody of horses captured by people on their property. The state authorities hold those horses for 10 days. Unclaimed horses are sold at auction. Last year 25 such animals were sold at auction in Nevada.
"These horses generally fall through the cracks," said Steve Mahoney, the chief of the state livestock identification bureau. "Nobody wants them. More often than not they go to a commercial buyer, and they probably end up going to slaughter."
During their summer romp in the mountains, the horses are watched by the Virginia Range Wildlife Protection Association, a nonprofit group that manages the horse population on over 37,000 acres of private land within the range but has no control over the animals when they descend into lower areas like Hidden Valley.
In 1990 mustang lovers formed the Hidden Valley Wild Horse Task Force and the next year raised $16,000 to help pay for the removal and adoption of 50 horses. But more horses soon replaced them, and the community cannot agree on how to handle the animals.
Ms. Carr, a member of the task force, has suggested building a fence, which her group estimates would cost about $35,000, to keep the horses from coming into the neighborhood. The plan would also require that food and water be lugged into the hills, which task force members have done during the recent drought anyway.
"We'd lose the beauty of our horses, but at least they'd be safe, and that's what we're after," Ms. Carr said.
But Mr. Clark, the real estate broker, does not want the fence, which he said would be too expensive, take too long to build and be too hard to maintain. He said it would also keep residents from biking or hiking as easily as they do now in the hills.
"It's a residential area," Mr. Clark said. "It shouldn't have horses wandering around."
This time of year many of the ranch-style homes, each of which sits on at least a third of an acre, are tied up with ropes and makeshift fences to keep the horses away. One fence is even topped with barbed wire.
None of this seemed to bother a nine-horse band chewing on grass at the edge of the neighborhood on a bitter cold morning recently. When Bobbi Royle, who runs Wild Horse Spirit, a nonprofit organization outside Reno that tries to protect mustangs, drove up in her pick-up, she was engulfed by the horses, which quickly began munching on bales of alfalfa in the back of the truck.
A hazel foal, a month old and friendly as a puppy, gnawed on Betty Kelly's coat sleeve. "You're so beautiful," cooed Ms. Kelly, who lives in the neighborhood.
But the dulcet tones gave way to growls when the future of the horses came up.
"I'd rather get rid of the people that don't like them," Ms. Kelly said. "It would be a beautiful neighborhood then."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Regain About a Third From Selloff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved sharply higher yesterday and recouped about a third of the selloff on Friday, as buyers, sensing an oversold condition, moved back into the market looking for value.
Traders said hedge funds were buying two- and five-year notes, which had a positive effect on the long end of the market. The price of a 30-year bond rebounded almost two full points in early trading, signaling strongly that Friday's close was at least temporarily the market's price bottom. 
 The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, to a price of 91 27/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.63 percent, down nine basis points from 6.72 percent on Friday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Earlier, the bond market largely overlooked a strong housing report in the morning, which caused only a minor price dip. Some analysts regarded the market's resiliency as a return to a degree of rationality that was not displayed last week.
As early momentum for the market, Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, cited near-term short-covering by speculators who had bet that prices would continue to drop yesterday. They were forced instead to cover those bets, buying securities to repay the borrowed ones they had sold.
Mr. Dwyer said he interpreted the market's performance yesterday as indicating that investors believe "there will be a rebound in the economy, but with no clue as to how strong will that rebound be."
"And at this point," Mr. Dwyer said, "despite the large employment number, my opinion is it will be a moderate one.
"While we anticipate bond trading to remain volatile over the near term," he continued, "it will take a couple more months of data to determine a major move in either direction." Among the data to be reported are producer prices on Thursday and consumer prices and industrial production on Friday. Next week the market will also get a look at February retail sales.
Contemplating the strong market reaction Friday to an employment report that seemed to dash hopes of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, James Hale, fixed-income analyst at MMS International in San Francisco, said that "Friday's slaughter leaves many in the market wondering if any one government report is worth 25 to 40 basis points of yield in Treasury securities since Bureau of Labor statistics are often more an art form than a science."
While the employment number was strong, Mr. Hale noted, it would be wise to be cautious. A policy forecast is probably not warranted on this single report. "The selloff was so overdone on Friday that investors can probably find solid value," he said, "particularly in the short-dated notes."
Mr. Hale said that yesterday's report on single-family home sales for January, which showed a rise of 4.2 percent, was strong, but not strong enough to confirm the belief that the economy is so robust that the Fed will not be cutting rates any time soon.
"The report was received with relief since it didn't show the extraordinary deviance that Friday's employment report did," he said.
Yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills drew only lukewarm demand at an average rate of 4.95 percent for the three-month, up six basis points, from last week and 5 percent for the six-month maturity, up 20 basis points.
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, noted that investors had the weekend to think over Friday's jobs number and the market's reaction. Emotional market downdrafts like the one last week are opportunities, he added.
"Bonds will have a tough time rallying back to 6 percent, but 6.70 percent bonds and 2.75 percent inflation don't go together," he said. "We would still be bond buyers." He predicts any easing by the Fed will be delayed, but not canceled.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Transit Authority Is Planning To Cut 800 More Token Clerks

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
The Transit Authority plans to cut 800 more token booth clerks from New York City subway stations, slashing their ranks by a third, over the next two years as it goes ahead with its electronic fare collection program, officials said yesterday.
The cuts are part of a five-year plan to cut $2.4 billion from the Transit Authority's budget. Yesterday, commuters began feeling the impact of the loss of 125 token booth clerks as part of a previously planned reduction, which left some of the city's busiest stations with only one clerk at rush hour. 
 Officials said they hoped that they could carry out the future cuts painlessly with expansion of the Metrocard program, which would reduce the need for token clerks. While the Metrocard program has encountered many obstacles, transit officials say they hope to outfit all 463 subway stations with the turnstiles that accept the cards by 1997. The Metrocard is already accepted for the Transit Authority's 3,600 buses.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency, wants to broaden the Metrocard program beyond the subway and buses. Officials have been touting it as an all-purpose card that can be used to buy everything from groceries to newspapers. They hope to generate millions of dollars from those alternate uses.
Yesterday, at some of the city's busier stations, commuters were already chafing at the loss of clerks under the smaller, previously announced reductions.
"This is ridiculous," said James Thompson, 37, standing in line at the Eighth Avenue subway station at 34th Street. "Service is getting worse while we keep paying more. It simply does not make any sense."
Charles Seaton, a Transit Authority spokesman, said the reductions were part of an effort to make the transit system more efficient in the face of deep cuts in state and Federal aid. "What we're trying to do is use our resources more intelligently and we're also trying to use them more economically," Mr. Seaton said. "It's necessary that we do make cuts to meet our budget, and this is one area that we have chosen."
The reductions come in the wake of a 25-cent fare increase -- from $1.25, to $1.50 -- that was imposed last November. That increase preceded a reduction in the number of trains for 11 lines, which has meant longer waits and more crowded trains for some commuters. In addition, train maintenance and cleaning have been cut back.
Gene Russianoff, a lawyer with the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group, questioned whether the Transit Authority was being realistic in trying to cut the number of token booth clerks so deeply. He said that the Metrocard was available at only 164 of 468 subway stations and that some riders could not afford to buy tokens in large quantities, as the Transit Authority has suggested.
"It's like a let-them-eat-token attitude," Mr. Russianoff said. "We're cutting service and the solution is for you to buy more tokens, and that's not possible for a lot of people."
While transit officials are encouraging people to buy tokens in bulk to deal with the current cuts, they are also considering phasing out the 10-pack tokens next month, a move transit officials said would save $1 million. The 125 token booth clerks whose jobs were phased out yesterday are expected to save the Transit Authority $5 million a year.
Yesterday, long lines kept commuters waiting at several stations affected by the cuts. Many booths previously staffed by two clerks had one person handling several tasks, including selling tokens, giving directions and buzzing through people with special passes.
At the narrow South Ferry station, passengers were surprised to find only one clerk at the booth. "It does not make any sense to have one token booth clerk in such a heavily used area," said Aaron Bryant, who lives on Governors Island. "First a fare increase, and now this."
"It's almost impossible to get on line," said Barbara Kent, who had just come off the Staten Island ferry and was on her way to work.
Yesterday, a transit worker stood by the service gate of the South Ferry station, opening and closing the door for passengers with baby carriages and others who cannot go through the turnstiles.
But Audrey Mosley-Marcus, the station manager, said the worker was there simply to try to make sure things went smoothly on this first day without the extra clerk.
She said that yesterday she received at least 20 complaints from passengers about delays. All of last year, said Ms. Mosley-Marcus, who is also the station manager for three other stations in the area, only two people complained.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeking Tougher Sanctions To Press Nigeria for Democracy

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has circulated a proposal for strong new economic sanctions intended to force the Nigerian military Government to move toward democracy. But the proposal has received a cool reception from several European countries, according to diplomats, officials and American business representatives watching the negotiations.
The United States has asked industrial countries to join it in banning all new foreign investment in Nigeria and in freezing financial assets that the country's leaders may have in their banks. It also wants them to halt joint sporting events once this summer's Olympic Games are over and to ban Government-sponsored cultural contacts. 
 The Administration has ruled out for the time being any embargo against Nigeria's oil exports, currently running at about 1.8 million barrels a day, which provide the Government with 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings. About 40 percent of Nigeria's prized low-sulphur crude is bought by American companies. Just yesterday, Royal Dutch/Shell confirmed it had made a potentially significant oil discovery off the Nigerian coast. [Page A8.]
The proposals have not been announced by the Administration, as it gauges the willingness of its allies to cooperate. It is not clear whether the United States will carry out some of the penalties on its own if that support does not appear.
"We believe in multilateral action, but we haven't ruled anything out," one Administration official said today when asked about the possibility that the United States would proceed alone.
Administration officials say the proposed new sanctions are intended to show Nigeria's rulers that the West is serious about pressing for a rapid return to democracy. They would follow a number of measures taken against Nigeria by the United States, Europe and the Commonwealth countries last year after the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Ogoni writer and human rights activist.
"The package is supposed to establish our seriousness prior to re-engaging the military regime in order to secure a speedy passage to democracy," an Administration official said. Gen. Sani Abacha, the military leader, has promised to hand over power to civilians in 1998. But the military annulled Nigeria's last elections in 1993.
Last week the State Department listed Nigeria as a major human rights abuser in its annual human rights report.
Imposing new sanctions against Nigeria would win President Clinton praise from human rights groups and liberal black organizations that have been critical of the Nigerian Government. But it would be fiercely opposed by big business, and many companies that operate in Africa have already spoken out against the idea.
European governments, which were presented with the plan about 10 days ago, are not expected to deliver their formal replies for a week or so. But diplomats say several of them -- including Britain, France and the Netherlands, all of which have substantial business interests in Nigeria -- are not enthusiastic.
These countries contend that blocking new foreign investment, which totaled $1.95 billion in 1994, according to the World Bank, would merely deliver another blow to the crumbling economy of a deeply impoverished country where the annual average income is a mere $280.
It would not, they say, affect its notoriously corrupt military rulers, who would still have more than $10 billion a year in oil revenues.
While it is unclear how new investment would be defined under the American plan, several foreign oil and gas companies are currently engaged in major new Nigerian projects, which they declined to cancel or postpone after Mr. Saro-Wiwa's execution.
A consortium of British, Dutch, French and Italian oil companies led by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group has just signed a contract to build a $3.8 billion natural gas liquefication plant at Bonny, in eastern Nigeria. The Mobil Corporation is also engaged in a new $800 million offshore natural gas project due to start production in 1997.
And Shell confirmed yesterday that it had made a potentially significant oil discovery in deep water off the Niger Delta.
American corporations with interests in Nigeria are also campaigning hard against the Administration's sanctions plan. Last year the Corporate Council on Africa, which represents 80 firms doing business there, said "economic growth provides the best foundation for any successful transition to democratic government" and warned that "a collapsing Nigerian economy serves no one's interests, especially not the 100 million Nigerians."
The National Foreign Trade Council, which represents 500 American multinational corporations, has also come out publicly against economic sanctions on Nigeria.
And about 100 American business representatives made their views known personally to the Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business and Agricultural Affairs, Joan Spiro, at a special State Department meeting called on March 6 to discuss the Administration's use of economic sanctions, participants said.
Many European countries are also not enthusiastic about freezing Nigerian bank accounts and other financial assets. Britain, France and Germany are traditionally reluctant to take any action that might damage their position as international financial centers.
With China unlikely to allow the United Nations Security Council to impose an immediate asset freeze, blocking Nigerian funds in British banks would require a special act of Parliament. While Parliament prepared and voted on such a new law, Nigeria's leaders would have ample time to move their funds to safer havens
European diplomats contend that the American move also risks splitting the unified stand that the United States and the 15 European Union members have taken toward Nigeria recently. After Mr. Saro-Wiwa's execution, the European Union joined the United States in denying visas to prominent Nigerians, banning sales of arms and withdrawing their ambassadors from Nigeria, though these have now returned.
At the same time the Commonwealth suspended Nigeria's membership for two years and asked a multiracial group of foreign ministers to seek a firm commitment to democracy from its leaders and report back this spring.
So far, however, Nigeria's leaders have refused to receive the Commonwealth team. "If we fire all our ammunition now we won't have anything left when the Commonwealth mission reports," one diplomat said.

HEADLINE: DOW LEAPS 110.55 AS STOCKS RECOUP MUCH OF SELLOFF

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
After taking a weekend to reflect on the worst percentage decline in the Dow Jones industrial average in four years, the stock market yesterday rode a wave of buying from mutual funds and other managers of large pools of investments to its strongest gain in almost two years, retracing nearly two-thirds of the ground it lost on Friday.
Enamored of the opportunity to pick up many of their favorite stocks at deep discounts from the levels of only a week ago, investors bought stocks across the board, pushing the Dow industrials up 110.55 points, or 2 percent, to 5,581.00. Bond prices, the catalyst for Friday's sharp market declines, also rose. 
 "Friday was the day the traders acted," said Alfred Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham, a Chicago mutual fund company, referring to Wall Street professionals who try to capitalize on minute-by-minute movements in the prices of stocks and bonds. But after Friday's decline, he said, "we had a lot of money come into our mutual funds, and we made a decision to put a significant amount of it to work today."
Indeed, individual investors appeared to cling to the notion that every sharp dip in stock prices is merely another buying opportunity. Mutual fund companies across the country reported a surge in inquiries from customers over the weekend and through yesterday's trading session, and several said that buyers outweighed sellers.
But while average Americans seemed not to believe that Friday's selloff signaled the start of a bear market in stocks, a large number of them are likely to pay more attention to one factor that has not been as present in other recent sharp stock market declines -- a jump in interest rates.
Yet another sign of a strengthening economy, which caused the markets to shudder so badly on Friday, appeared yesterday when the Commerce Department reported that nationwide sales of new homes were stronger than expected in January, despite a sharp blizzard-related decrease in the Northeast.
While the financial markets shrugged off the news, consumers did not. At the midtown Manhattan office of the discount stockbroker Charles Schwab & Company, Jesse Maiurano had a single purpose in setting up a new brokerage account: selling stocks to raise money for the down payment on a new house.
"I'm trying to buy it before interest rates go up too far," said Mr. Maiurano, a 50-year-old staff director in the real estate planning department of Nynex. "I still have some money invested in stocks for the long term, but I want to hurry to make a decision before rates get out of hand."
Interest rates fell yesterday as the bond market rebounded from Friday's drubbing. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, a closely watched harbinger of consumer rates, declined to 6.63 percent from 6.72 percent on Friday.
But that did not keep home mortgage rates from jumping sharply. At the Emigrant Savings Bank on East 42d Street in Manhattan, where the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is posted each day at noon, the rate jumped to 7.625 percent yesterday from 7.5 percent on Friday.
That continues a general trend of rising consumer interest rates that has lasted for close to a month. Those interest rates have climbed because many bond market investors fear that the Federal Reserve will not lower short-term interest rates amid signs of growth in the economy.
Until Friday, there remained enough investors who thought the opposite -- that is, that a recession loomed and that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to keep the economy moving.
Now, some economists say they expect a general pickup in economic activity to continue, at least for several months, which at the least will stretch out the current period of uncertainty. Kenneth Safian of Safian Investment Research in White Plains said he did not expect interest rates to decline much, if at all, "until we see signs that this rebound is slowing up."
While Mr. Safian said he did expect such a slowing toward midyear, he added that the financial markets were churning much more violently than the underlying economy. That uncertainty is itself bad news. "I've never seen such a trading orientation on the part of institutional investors," Mr. Safian said. "I don't view that as a favorable development."
More volatility might lie ahead, as well, as additional economic data are released later in the week. On Thursday, the February Producer Price Index, a measure of the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers, will be released, followed on Friday by the Consumer Price Index, a similar measure of costs of goods and services for individuals and households.
Befitting an environment of economic growth, investors yesterday were particularly eager to buy cyclical stocks, or stocks that tend to mirror the fortunes of the economy. Automobile, airline and other transportation-related stocks in particular gained favor, and the Dow Jones transportation index rose 2.8 percent.
Yesterday's percentage gain in the Dow Jones industrial average was the best since April 5, 1994, and followed the average's worst percentage decline since Nov. 15, 1991. Yesterday's 2 percent rise in the Dow industrials, however, overstates the strength of the overall market. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.52 points, or 1.03 percent, to 640.02, while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 16.77 points, or 1.58 percent, to 1,080.50.
Some institutional investors continue to believe that yesterday's activity is a sign that what lies ahead for investors is more of what they saw before Friday's rout -- a continuing period of low interest rates and slow economic growth.
"We've seen the amount of a correction that we're going to see," said Richard Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Van Kampen/American Capital, a mutual fund and investment company. "I think the market will continue to be strong for the rest of the year."
If the economic numbers later this week give further indications of economic strength, "we might step back and take a closer look," Mr. Froehlich said. "But you don't throw out six months of analysis and economic trends showing sluggishness because of two days of data."
In that respect, institutional investors might take a lesson from smaller investors, who over the weekend gave no indication of wanting to bail out of the stock market.
"For a long-term investor, last Friday was not a big deal," said Glenn Dames, who visited the Fidelity Investments brokerage office in Rockefeller Center on his lunch hour yesterday. Mr. Dames said he was about to make his final payment on his home mortgage, and with the additional discretionary income that would provide, "I think the stock market is the best place to put my money."
Indeed, enough investors thought so yesterday to send nearly twice as many stocks to gains as declined. Among the best performers in the Dow industrials were two cyclical stocks, Alcoa and Union Carbide, whose fortunes usually track trends in the general economy and each of which rose 4.7 percent over the last two trading sessions. Yesterday, Alcoa rose 3 3/8, to 61 1/2, and Union Carbide rose 2 3/8, to 47 5/8.
Shares of automobile makers, which depend on economic growth and consumer confidence for rising sales, also climbed sharply yesterday. General Motors added 1 3/4, to 52 5/8; Ford Motor rose 1 1/8, to 32 3/8, and Chrysler gained 2 3/8, to 60 1/4.
Technology stocks were among the strongest industry groups, with shares of companies that manufacture semiconductors inching up before the release this afternoon of the industry's book-to-bill ratio, a key indicator of demand for computer chips. The statistic had been scheduled for release yesterday. Intel, the largest semiconductor maker and the most active stock in American markets yesterday, trading 9.4 million shares, rose 1 3/4, to 55 1/4, while Texas Instruments added 3/4, to 50, and Motorola moved up 3/8, to 53 3/8.

HEADLINE: Fidelity Shifts Management At 26 of Its Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
In one of the largest management shifts in its history, Fidelity Investments, the country's largest mutual fund company, is reassigning 26 of its equity-portfolio managers in an effort to improve the performance of the funds.
The Boston-based company, which manages some $560 billion in assets and is a unit of the FMR Corporation, announced the changes yesterday as part of a major overhaul of how it handles investment responsibility for its domestic and international stock funds. In addition to shuffling managers at almost a third of its stock funds on April 1, Fidelity is dividing its funds into smaller groups and assigning each one a group leader. 
 "It really is a natural evolution," said William J. Hayes, Fidelity's director of equity investments. As Fidelity attracted more assets and developed new funds, he said, it found it needed to reorganize its 87 stock funds into more workable groups linked to specific investment objectives.
While Mr. Hayes played down the notion that the changes were a response to disappointing performance among any of the company's 87 stock funds, analysts think the move reflects the insistence of Fidelity on delivering superior returns and the need to have more controls over its funds.
"Last year, it was the bond funds; this year, it is the stock funds," said Eric Kobren, the editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter in Wellesley Hills, Mass., that tracks the company's funds. "Ned Johnson is famous for stirring up the pot," he said, referring to Fidelity's chairman and chief executive, Edward C. Johnson 3d.
Fidelity is leaving Jeffrey Vinik as the portfolio manager of its $56 billion Magellan Fund. Magellan, the company's biggest fund, gained 36.8 percent last year, handily beating most of its competitors in the growth-fund sector.
Still, the managerial changes include several important shifts. Among the most significant is the removal of Robert A. Beckwitt as manager of the Fidelity Asset Manager Fund, an $11 billion fund that divides its assets among different types of stocks and bonds.
Despite Mr. Beckwitt's spectacular performance in the early 1990's, the fund stumbled badly in 1994, losing 7 percent, when Mr. Beckwitt made wrong bets on emerging markets. The fund was only an average performer in 1995, gaining 18 percent.
Under the reorganization, the responsibility for Asset Manager and two smaller asset-allocation funds that were managed by Mr. Beckwitt will now be divided among four different managers, including George Vanderheiden, the successful manager of the Destiny funds. Mr. Vanderheiden will oversee the stock portion of the funds, in addition to continuing to run his previous funds.
Mr. Beckwitt has been reassigned to Fidelity's Portfolio Advisory Services, which is geared to providing investment services to high-net-worth individuals.
Asset Manager "has not been a disaster by any stretch," Mr. Kobren said. He said that investors had a hard time understanding Mr. Beckwitt's investment strategy, which involved sometimes buying exotic securities and making bets on broad economic trends rather than simply investing in a more usual mix of stocks and bonds.
Other significant manager changes include the removal of Robert Haber as head of the Fidelity Balanced Fund, a $5 billion fund that has also had disappointing performance in the last few years. Stephen R. Petersen, the manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Fund, will also assume management of the Balanced Fund.
Mr. Haber has been named the new head of Fidelity's equity-research department. "He's been a mentor to many, many fund managers over the years," Mr. Kobren said.
In another change, Daniel R. Frank, the manager of Fidelity Advisor Strategic Opportunities, was replaced as of yesterday. Mr. Frank, who became the subject of controversy recently when he lobbied several hospitals to use a product marketed by a company in which he had invested, is the only manager who has been replaced but not reassigned to a new position yet, Mr. Hayes said. Mr. Frank remains an employee of the firm, but has been replaced by Harris Leviton, the former manager of Retirement Growth.
"There's not a lot of tolerance for mistakes," said John Rekenthaler, the publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds, the Chicago research firm, said of Fidelity. "They seem to be even less tolerant than they were a decade ago."
The firm's stock funds will be divided into eight groups, depending on their specific investment objective. While Mr. Hayes emphasized that portfolio managers would have no less responsibility in making investment decisions than before, the groups will let managers share ideas with one another more easily.
"With so many funds out there, they had to rethink the structure of the investment groups," Mr. Kobren said. "This type of slicing and dicing will offer these fund managers a more efficient use of their time."
"They're trying to define their funds more precisely," Mr. Reken thaler said. "It will force a little more discipline on some of those funds."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Hong Kong Stocks Plunge 7.3%, Rattled by U.S. Bond Prices and China

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 11

 BODY:
As Hong Kong's stock market spiraled precipitously lower amid worries of war over Taiwan and over American interest rates, a mood of anxiety settled over this territory today.
In the four days since China fired three ballistic missiles into waters off Taiwan's two major ports, the volume of oratory and the pace of armed buildup have rapidly mounted. On Saturday, China announced that it would begin a week of live-fire military exercises over 6,000 square miles of the South China Sea off the coastline of Taiwan. This was followed today by news that the United States was sending two aircraft-carrier battle groups to the region. 
 And Hong Kong, a spit of land and islands clinging to the massive Chinese mainland, is spooked.
"I think it would be naive to be too complacent about the situation," said John M. Mulcahy, managing director at UBS Securities here. "The reality is that military situations that escalate in this way can all too easily tip over the edge."
"Over the last few days, I've noticed a sharper edge in the contretemps between China and Taiwan, and in the views of Hong Kong," he said. "People are worried that the fallout for Hong Kong, if there is a regional conflict, would be devastating. Hong Kong will be one of the immediate victims of that."
China maintains that Taiwan is a rebellious province and has pledged that it would take military action to prevent any move toward independence. President Lee Teng-hui -- who is seeking another term on March 23 in the island's first direct, popular vote for president, and is expected to win in a landslide -- has built his campaign and career on promises to expand Taiwan's international presence. He has succeeded in this while always stopping short of suggesting that he would push for a formal declaration of independence.
The rising military tension in the South China Sea late last week made Hong Kong's stock market, a skittish animal in the best of times, ripe for panic. And Wall Street's tumble Friday provided the catalyst.
In a knee-jerk reaction to the 3.04 percent slide in the Dow Jones industrial average and similar drops in other American stock indexes, the Hong Kong market went into free fall. By the end of the day, the benchmark Hang Seng index sank 820.34 points to close at 10,397.45, or 7.31 percent, its second-worst drop ever and more than double that on Wall Street. At the day's low, the index was down more than 8 percent.
[Hong Kong stocks bounced back somewhat by Tuesday afternoon, recouping 259.85 points, or 2.5 percent, to stand at 10,657.30.]
Last Friday's bloodletting in New York spilled over into financial markets almost everywhere, but the carnage was much worse in Hong Kong -- both because of the military posturing and because the Hong Kong dollar's exchange value is linked to the American dollar. American interest rates play a big part in the financial markets here, too.
In the absence of such factors in Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues fell, but more modestly, losing 359.58 points, or 1.78 percent, to close today at 19,796.29. [Japanese stocks also erased some losses on Tuesday, with the Nikkei rising 153.98 points, or almost eight-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 19,950.27.]
Major European stock indexes declined somewhat today, too: 0.96 percent in London, 1.19 percent in Frankfurt and 1.35 percent in Paris.
Even on Taiwan, the target of Chinese anger, the market's losses were restrained in comparison with those in Hong Kong, with the Taipei index off 2 percent.
Here, the mood was anything but upbeat.
"We are worrying about this getting hotter," said Ting-ko Chen, a senior executive vice president of the Charoen Pokphand group, a Thai conglomerate that is one of the heaviest foreign investors in China. "We're hoping for no military conflict. But certainly, this is having an effect on people's minds."
Mr. Chen said that investment in "the 1,2,3 area" -- China, Taiwan and Hong Kong -- had been down in the last year, anyway. But now, he said, the escalation of military tension in the region would dampen the enthusiasm of investors even further, at least until the political-military situation stabilized.
While that remains unpredictable, some regional analysts think the chances of conflict are small. Robert Broadfoot, managing director of Political and Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd., offered odds of 80-20 on a positive outcome of the current standoff. While he could envision a worst case, in which the United States thwarted a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, touching off a flight of people and capital from the island, he said he believed that a happier outcome was more likely.
"After the presidential election, the Taiwanese will try very hard to reopen negotiations with China," said Mr. Broadfoot, who advises major companies that want to invest in Asian facilities and services. "If things go favorably, you're going to see joint ventures between Chinese state companies and Taiwan companies -- what you don't see now."
At Lehman Brothers, Miron Mushkat, chief economist for Asia, said it remained difficult to disentangle the factors behind the plunge in Hong Kong's stock market. Concern over American interest rates and worries about China and Taiwan "seem to be reinforcing one another," he said, moments before the market gasped to a close. "I think the impression here locally is that because of the Chinese saber-rattling and arm-twisting, the crisis has escalated to a level above expectations."
"And what complicates things is the fact that all this Chinese pressure is in vain," he said, referring to the surge in the polls for Mr. Lee's candidacy in Taiwan -- the opposite effect China has sought. "No one would like it to get out of hand. It will only take a junior field commander issuing wrong instructions for things to get out of hand. It's a factor in market behavior."
Even so, many economists here say that a certain measure of common sense may prevail in Beijing. "China recognizes that its most important asset is the risk of conflict, rather than the conflict itself," Mr. Mulcahy of UBS said. "It has achieved a lot of objectives by forcing the independence movement to back away."
And, he added, it is not in China's interest to alienate the United States, one of its biggest trading partners. "At the end of the day," he said, "China still needs the U.S. from an economic standpoint."

HEADLINE: Burbank: A Cinderella City Where Fantasy Pays the Bills

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif.

 BODY:
Drive just outside the airport here on Thornton Street and look at an unmarked gray building where workers are busily tearing off the windowless walls, and one is face to face with how the economic pain brought by the end of the cold war is being transformed into Burbank's new promise.
Until six years ago, when the region was hit with tens of thousands of layoffs in the aerospace industry, and a punishing recession, the Lockheed Corporation was the biggest employer in this working-class city, and it designed its top-secret Stealth jet in the ominous gray box. 
 Lockheed is now all but gone, along with most of its jobs, but a $45 million renovation is turning the former design center into the harbinger of a new economic wave: the sunny home of a Walt Disney Company animation studio. It is, in fact, just one of dozens of such conversions here.
Long the butt of jokes by Johnny Carson, "beautiful downtown Burbank" was for years a metaphor for suburban dreariness. Even in the aerospace industry's heyday, the city, in the San Fernando Valley about 12 miles north of central Los Angeles, had a lifeless downtown, with no movie theaters and few restaurants. Burbank was regarded as a backwater, a follower of Los Angeles's glimmering lead.
No longer. Burbank, which has been associated with the movie industry for decades, is at the forefront of an economic transformation that is affecting Southern California and, in some regards, the country. The changes are based on the growth of new forms of entertainment, like computer games and CD-ROMs, the expansion of cable and satellite television, the international demand for American films, and the huge increase in the number of companies in the business.
The Burbank City Council is even debating an issue that would have seemed an impossible luxury just three or four years ago: Should it slow an expansion that has filled downtown with shoppers and prompted a construction boom?
Near the Burbank airport, for example, a former factory that made landing gears has been reborn as the Western Studio Service Company, a warehouse for sets and movie props. Warner Brothers is building an office in an old Dassault aerospace plant. MTV recently shot a special at a new studio next to another Lockheed property that developers might turn into a large shopping center.
Construction on more than one million square feet of office space is to begin this year, and nearly all of it is expected to be snapped up by film production and media companies at some of the highest rents in Los Angeles County, close to $30 a square foot.
"This is all being driven by the entertainment industry, and thank God for it," said Gregory K. Barsamian, an industrial real estate broker who recently pointed out the changes to a visitor, along with the hangar where he got his first job after college -- as a Lockheed engineer.
Burbank still lacks the cachet of nearby Glendale or Pasadena; its residential districts are more working class, even now. But the city is proud of its small-town feeling. Its streets are relatively safe, there is little graffiti, and the local newspaper, The Burbank Leader, is filled with articles about the fierce rivalry between high school football teams.
But its powerful commercial rebound is making the city the envy of Los Angeles County. Downtown is now bustling with a new Media City Center mall, a theater with more than a dozen screens, a huge Ikea store and a Virgin Megastore.
Ian Fagan, the owner of Byrne Home Furnishings on Magnolia Street, said that streets once nearly devoid of pedestrians were now thriving and that his business had grown sharply, in part because he is now renting furniture for movies.
"Ten years ago, you couldn't find a place to get a sandwich," Mr. Fagan said. "You could not watch a movie here. If you saw two people, it was a crowd. That has changed entirely."
The end of the cold war was devastating for Burbank and all of Los Angeles County. Since 1989, the county has lost more than 150,000 aerospace and other military-related jobs because of cuts in Pentagon spending, and no one expects them to return. Burbank, with a population of 94,000, lost nearly 14,000 jobs, many terminated when Lockheed, now Lockheed Martin, shut most of its operations and moved others.
But as of last year, Los Angeles County was finally growing again; Jack Kyser, the economist at the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation, said that by the end of 1996, the county would have regained about 150,000 of the 510,000 jobs lost since 1990. The migration from Southern California, which had deepened the recession here and raised worries about a permanent decline, is expected to reverse this year.
Those trends have been led by Burbank, whose unemployment rate has now dropped to 5.3 percent, compared with 8.6 percent in Los Angeles and 5.6 percent nationally. This suburb has capitalized on the fact that it has been the home for a number of studios since the 1920's. It long ago surpassed Hollywood as a center for the industry, but employment growth had earlier been modest. Walt Disney, Warner Brothers and NBC, where Mr. Carson once held court, have studios here, in what is known as the Media District, while Universal Pictures is adjacent to Burbank's northern border.
The big studios have been forced to fight for the little available space in the Burbank market, and they are constructing more. Warner Brothers has a master plan that envisions the construction of 3.3 million square feet of studios and offices, while Disney's master plan would put the same combination on 1.8 million square feet. In the next 25 years, Universal Pictures plans to build a theme park, hotels, offices and studios covering 6 million square feet.
Commercial vacancy rates have dropped to about 4 percent in Burbank from 17 percent in 1989, said William Boyd of the CB Commercial Real Estate Group. That compares with a vacancy rate of nearly 20 percent in downtown Los Angeles, where rents cost about half as much.
The changes have gathered momentum quickly. M. David Paul, the developer who is renovating the old Lockheed design center for Disney's animators, was asked if he would have predicted such investments even three years ago. "Not a chance," Mr. Paul said.
The aerospace industry, which once employed nearly 300,000 workers in the county, now has about 133,000. Officially, the motion picture industry employs 129,300. But Mr. Kyser said that figure was about half of the actual number because the industry included thousands of small companies whose employees have not been counted.
"This industry seems to be growing like a house on fire," Mr. Kyser said.
Burbank's recovery from the painful loss of its military industries makes it, in certain important respects, a microcosm of trends that are affecting the entire country. Small businesses are replacing big corporations. Knowledge-intensive companies serving the new digital world are replacing manufacturers. The biggest employment gains are taking place in the suburbs rather than in the old city cores.
But there are still reminders of Burbank's cold-war legacy. Industrial solvents used by Lockheed and other companies have left the ground water badly polluted. The companies and the city have been forced to initiate a costly cleanup.
And some officials question the pace of growth now, concerned that it will alter the quality of life. The current focus of the debate is the airport, which is a great convenience for the movie industry. Planners have proposed a new terminal that would be twice as big as the current one. But several City Council members have said the expansion and added traffic would cause too much noise and disruption.
"The outlook is rosy for the city whether the airport is expanded or not," Councilman Bob Kramer said. "We have to protect our citizens first."
The good news, of course, is not being spread evenly in Los Angeles County. Long Beach, a port city at the opposite end of the county, has lost thousands of jobs from a McDonnell Douglas plant, and two Navy installations have been shut down. A plan for a big marine park planned by Disney, which the city had counted on, has been dropped.
Nevertheless, Long Beach has been helped by the rapid growth in another sector of the economy, foreign trade. Long Beach has become the nation's busiest container port.
It is clear, though, that Long Beach will lag behind Burbank for some time because of the flow of jobs the studios are attracting. For instance, the union local representing grips, or movie crew members, recently ended 50 years in Hollywood and moved to Burbank.
"It puts us right smack in the middle of the business," said Patrick Hoff, the local's chief financial officer. "We're just following the money."

HEADLINE: Strike's Effect Widely Felt In Auto Plants

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 11

 BODY:
The effects of a week-old brake-factory strike rippled across North America today, with the General Motors Corporation's closing of 14 assembly plants and 16 parts plants from Chihuahua, Mexico, to Oshawa, Canada.
Today's layoffs turned the strike into the largest auto industry work stoppage in recent years, surpassing a 1992 strike at a G.M. parts factory in Lordstown, Ohio, that idled 43,000 workers at nine assembly plants. 
 The walkout by 3,200 members of the United Automobile Workers at two G.M. brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, idled 58,000 G.M. workers elsewhere today, as assembly plants ran out of brakes to install and stopped building cars and trucks. Companies across the continent that supply G.M. with parts also began reviewing today whether to shut down their operations.
The strike has halted production at nearly half of G.M.'s 29 assembly plants in North America and forced the furlough of a sixth of its North American work force. It is probably costing G.M. $30 million to $40 million a day, said Scott F. Merlis, an independent automobile-industry analyst in Westport, Conn.
G.M. began the strike with a very large inventory of cars and fairly large supplies of popular pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Spot shortages of some popular vehicles could develop if the strike continues. The strike has also delayed cars that customers order from factories.
Because G.M.'s operations are so vast and affect so many other industries, the strike already appears to have lasted long enough to have a small but measurable effect on the United States' overall economic output in the first quarter, said Paul D. Ballew, a longtime Federal Reserve economist who recently joined J. D. Power and Associates, an auto industry consulting firm.
Even if the strike ends quickly, G.M. may not be able to resume full production quickly. "It could take them a good week," Mr. Ballew said. "They've got to get Dayton back up and running, you've got to get parts back in the pipeline."
Despite the damage from the strike, union and company negotiators in Dayton have gone three days without even trying to hold talks. "There are none and there are none scheduled because we seem to be very far apart," said James M. Hagedon Jr., a G.M. spokesman. There were some informal contacts in Detroit between union and company officials over the weekend.
About 300 of the 3,200 striking workers in Dayton continue to enter the factories each day with the U.A.W.'s approval to produce brakes for the Chrysler Corporation and American Isuzu Motors Inc. Some U.A.W. hard-liners have criticized the unusual arrangement. Tom Lewis, the union's strike chairman, said today that these workers remained on strike against G.M. itself and carried picket signs when they were not inside the factories.
The strike is ostensibly about whether General Motors has kept a 1994 pledge to continue buying almost all of its brakes and brake parts from the Dayton factories. G.M. says that while it now buys some brake parts elsewhere, overall employment at the factory has edged up because other parts are now being made there. The union says the company should build many more parts there and hire more workers.
But, more broadly, the U.A.W. is fighting to keep its control over the production of auto parts as well as the final assembly of cars and trucks. G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are all trying to buy more parts from outside companies that have lower costs and typically have lower wages. The extent of these purchases will be a central issue when the union's national contract expires on Sept. 14, auto executives and union leaders say.
Strikes at parts factories are also cost-effective for the U.A.W., because it only needs to pay $150 a week in strike benefits to several thousand workers at one or two factories. When big auto companies then lay off tens of thousands of workers at assembly plants and other parts factories, the laid-off workers quickly qualify for state unemployment compensation, possibly driving up G.M.'s unemployment insurance costs for years to come.
About 7,300 workers at G.M.'s Saturn division were idled this afternoon when the company shut down its operations in Spring Hill, Tenn. But those workers went into training sessions and maintenance work instead of being laid off, because they had a separate contract.

Stock Market Recovers Two-Thirds of Its Loss
The stock market regained nearly two-thirds of the ground it lost on Friday in its worst drubbing in four years. Riding a wave of buying from mutual funds and other investment managers, who saw an opportunity to scoop up bargains, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 110.55 points, or 2 percent, to 5,581.00, its strongest gain in five years. [Page A1.]
 
Utility stocks did not bounce back. Rather, the Dow Jones utility average fell 0.56 of a point to 215.69. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D10.]
 
In Hong Kong stocks tumbled because of concerns about American interest rates and worries of war over Taiwan. The benchmark Hang Seng index sank 820.34 points, or 7.31 percent, to close at 10,397.45. [D8.]
 
Treasury Securities Prices Rise
Prices of Treasury securities moved sharply higher, recouping about a third of Friday's panic selloff, as buyers sensed an oversold condition. The 30-year bond rose 11/32 to a price of 9127/32 , yielding 6.63 percent, down from 6.72 percent on Friday. [D20.]
 
Arms Makers in $1 Trillion Contest
The $1 trillion competition to design and build a midpriced jet fighter for the Air Force, Navy and Marines begins in earnest this week, and executives from Lockheed, Boeing and a team linking McDonnell Douglas and Northrop Grumman cannot find enough superlatives to inspire their troops. Each seeks guaranteed prosperity in an otherwise bleak period. [A1.]
 
Rolls-Royce and General Electric said they would jointly develop an engine to compete for contracts worth $90 billion. The engine would power a new military strike aircraft for both the United States and Britain. [D4.]
 
W. R. Grace to Sell Unit to Betz
W. R. Grace agreed to sell its Dearborn water treatment and process chemicals business to Betz Laboratories for $632 million in cash. The sale is part of a continuing drive at Grace to enhance shareholder value. [D7.]
 
Battle Mountain Gold in Merger
Battle Mountain Gold, based in Houston, said that it had agreed to merge with Hemlo Gold Mines of Toronto, exchanging stock worth $1.5 for Hemlo's stock and creating one of North America's largest gold producers. [D2.]
 
New-Home Sales Rose in January
New-home sales shot up 4.2 percent in January, even though sales plunged 40 percent in the Northeast, which bore the brunt of the season's snowstorms. It was the second straight gain as mortgage rates dipped to a two-year low, 7.03 percent on average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. [D4.]
 
Plan for Nigerian Sanctions
Washington is circulating a plan for tough sanctions against the military Government of Nigeria. It would ban all new foreign investment there and try to freeze the financial assets of the country's leaders, but it does not call for an embargo against Nigerian oil. Europeans are cool to the proposal. [A1.]
 
Royal Dutch/Shell made a potentially important oil find off the Nigerian coast. Human rights groups have criticized the company for its operations in Nigeria. [A8.]
 
Effects of G.M. Strike Felt Across Continent
The effects of a week-old strike at two General Motors brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, rippled across North America; G.M. closed 14 assembly plants and 16 parts factories from Chihuahua, Mexico, to Oshawa, Canada. Responding to shortages caused by the walkout by 3,200 brake workers, the company laid off an additional 58,000 G.M. workers, making the strike the auto industry's largest work stoppage in recent years.

HEADLINE: N.C.A.A. TOURNAMENT;
St. John's Forces Mahoney To Leave

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
Brian Mahoney reluctantly walked away from St. John's University yesterday. He was asked to leave the job he once coveted for years, the one for which he waited patiently if anxiously in the spring of 1992 while a slow-moving search process eliminated more-established candidates.
Less than one year later, Mahoney was the Big East coach of the year. Today he is unemployed. 
 Five days before, at the somber conclusion of a third consecutive nonwinning season, Mahoney had stood in an emptying dressing room in Madison Square Garden and repeated that he had no intention of resigning as head basketball coach.
"He was asked to step down," said Ed Manetta, the St. John's athletic director, who delivered his decision to Mahoney during a meeting yesterday. The resignation, after an 11-16 season completed Mahoney's four-year record of 56-58, including 31-47 in Big East play, leads St. John's to a situation the university has not faced for decades, if ever.
St. John's must now respond to the forced departure of a coach without anything close to an obvious replacement, as pressure builds to produce a high-powered successor. When Frank Mulzoff left in 1973 after three post-season appearances in three years, Lou Carnesecca was ready to return from the New York Nets of the defunct American Basketball Association. When Dusty DeStefano, an assistant under Frank McGuire, was removed as head coach in 1956 after an experience similar to that of Mahoney, Joe Lapchick was eager to return from the Knicks.
Now, as other metropolitan area teams work to raise their profiles, St. John's must start over.
"There will be no search committee," Manetta said. "I will interview the candidates. I will select the finalists."
At that point, Manetta said, he will make his recommendation to the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, the school president, who declined to discuss the decision yesterday. The president's office released a two-paragraph statement that said in part: "At St. John's, our priority has always been the total development of our student athletes -- both as competitors and as people. That is our commitment to them. Ed's decision has been made in keeping with that commitment, and he has my support."
Manetta said he did not have a timetable in mind. Although the process may be more direct than it was in 1992, the marketplace has grown four years more complex and costly. The search will soon establish whether St. John's can break from the pattern established by past Big East hires by meeting the demands of high-profile candidates seeking minimum packages of $500,000 a year.
The second- and third-generation coaches hired by Big East schools, like Jim Calhoun of Connecticut and Steve Lappas of Villanova, established their coaching credentials at a level beneath the elite leagues. A move within that economic framework could lead Manetta to conversations with Fran Fraschilla of Manhattan, Mike Jarvis of George Washington, Herb Sendek of Miami of Ohio and Bob McKillop of Davidson.
Fraschilla, when reached at his office yesterday afternoon, said his only concern was preparing the Jaspers for their National Invitation Tournament game against Wisconsin. "That is really all I am going to allow myself to think about," he said. "I owe it to them."
The choice of a coach with a higher profile, such as P. J. Carlesimo of the Portland Trail Blazers or Tom Penders of Texas, would require an unprecedented economic commitment, enough to possibly require the school to establish an endowed position. Penders has seven years remaining on his contract.
"I'm not expecting anyone to call me," Penders said last night. "I'm not looking for a job. I don't need an offer to improve my situation. I don't think it would be fair to Texas or the kids I have in my program."
Attempts to reach Mahoney were unsuccessful. A 16-year assistant under Carnesecca, he was rewarded with a seven-year extension after his first season ended with a second-round National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament appearance in 1993. Manetta did not discuss details, except to say: "We have an existing contract with Brian. We'll fulfill what needs to be done."
Mahoney had insisted in recent weeks that his contract was guaranteed to the year 2000. A person familiar with the contract, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that a provision calls for the university to cover the difference if Mahoney's future salary should be less than than his base pay at St. John's.
Felipe Lopez, whose decision to enroll at St. John's as the national high school player of the year intensified the program's expectations two years ago, said the players had been told they would meet with administrators today to have the decision explained to them.
"It was a struggle all year for the coaches and the players," Lopez said. "It's kind of surprising because coming in, we had a great recruiting class. We never knew that it would come to this."

HEADLINE: Board Members, Too, Are Getting Investor Scrutiny

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
In a move that could mark the beginning of a new phase in the shareholder-rights movement, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' pension fund is expected to release today a list of what it calls the 23 "least valuable directors" in corporate America.
Among those named are Frank C. Carlucci, the former United States Secretary of Defense, and Vernon E. Jordan, the politically active lawyer and former head of the Urban League. 
 The list is "an attempt to put a face on inefficient board oversight," said Bill Patterson, the teamsters' director of corporate affairs. "A bad board is a breakdown of individual shareholder's rights, but you can't just look at a board as a monolith," he added. "Oversight will improve when shareholders focus on the individuals.
"We are trying to stimulate a discussion and to challenge shareholders to think about who's on boards."
The teamsters' pension fund, which has $46 billion in assets, will vote against the re-election of directors on the list, Mr. Patterson said.
The teamsters said the rankings were based largely on a list of poorly performing companies with highly paid chief executives that was compiled by Graef Crystal, the consultant on executive pay, who said he had not been contacted for the study. The rankings presumed that directors serving on the boards of several of these companies were tolerant of poor performance.
"There seems to be a mutual support network of people who say, 'You be a director on my board and overpay me and I'll serve on your board and overpay you,' " said Bart Naylor, the teamsters' national coordinator of corporate affairs.
The rankings also looked at the directors' attendance at board meetings and at whether they had conflicts of interest.
The teamsters called Mr. Carlucci "one of the most overcommitted corporate directors in the United States" because he attended 150 board meetings in 1994. Mr. Carlucci serves on the boards of Ashland Inc., the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and others.
Mr. Jordan was cited for serving on the boards of 11 companies, 7 of which use the services of his law firm, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. The teamsters also said Mr. Jordan had one of the worst attendance records of American directors. Mr. Jordan is a director of the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, the American Express Company and the Union Carbide Corporation, among others.
Mr. Jordan and Mr. Carlucci could not be reached for comment. The teamsters released the list yesterday after business hours.
The other directors on the teamsters' list are Drew L. Lewis, the chairman of the Union Pacific Corporation; Marshall M. Criser, the former president of the University of Florida; Richard M. Morrow, the retired chairman of the Amoco Corporation; Richard D. Simmons, the publication director of The International Herald Tribune; Paul R. Tregurtha, the chairman of Mormac Marine Group; H. Jesse Arnelle, a corporate lawyer; Jack S. Blanton, the president of the Eddy Refining Company; Douglas C. Yearley, the chairman of the Phelps Dodge Corporation; Lois Rice, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution; John T. Hartley, the former chairman of the Harris Corporation; John M. Kucharski, the chairman of EG& G Inc.; Kathryn Eickhoff, an economist; Richard M. Rosenberg, the chairman of the BankAmerica Corporation; Richard H. Jenrette, the chairman of the Equitable Companies; Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Republican Senator from Tennessee and the White House chief of staff for a time during the 1980's; James L. Broadhead, the chairman of FPL Group Inc.; Joseph L. Dionne, the chairman of the McGraw-Hill Companies; William LaMothe, the former chairman the Kellogg Company; Victor G. Beghini, the vice chairman of the USX Marathon Group; Michael H. Jordan, the chairman of Westinghouse; and William May, the former chairman of the American Can Company.
For more than a decade, a number of large investors have been pressing companies to improve their financial results and pushing directors to be more independent and to take a more active role in the board room.
But in the past, shareholder-rights advocates generally focused individual attention on chief executives. When it came to the board room, these shareholders generally concentrated on governance practices, not on the individuals. They pushed for the selection of directors with no connections to chief executives, for the payment of directors' fees in stock rather than cash and for the appointment of a lead director to act as a counterweight to a powerful chairman and chief executive.
By highlighting individuals, the teamsters have gone a step further.
"It's not enough to say, 'We want independent directors,' " said James E. Heard, president of Institutional Shareholder Services, an advisory firm in Washington. "You have to know who they are."
Most large companies have a majority of independent directors now, said Patrick McGurn, director of corporate governance at the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington.
"So now the institutions want to look at stock ownership of a director, potential conflicts of interest with the company, service on too many boards and attendance at meetings," he said.
As proxy statements are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission this year, the center is beginning to keep track of those things in its data base.
Such moves serve notice on directors that their individual performance, not just their collective record, is under scrutiny. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, which is known as Calpers, is using profiles of directors as the basis for some complaints in its current discussions about performance and governance at 10 companies it says are underperforming.
As these large investors gain more information on directors, they are expected to try to vote some of them out of office at annual meetings.
"You'll see board exits by directors the same way we've seen exits by C.E.O.'s," Mr. McGurn said. "Underperforming directors will be eased off boards."
Some will go voluntarily, simply not standing for re-election, Mr. McGurn predicted. "There'll be a thousand other reasons given for these exits, and not the real reason. You'll never know for sure unless you get in the board room."

HEADLINE: Don't Let Immigrants Take Jobs From the Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was puzzled by the March 11 Op-Ed article on immigrant competition with black Americans, "The Jobs Immigrants Take." Roger Waldinger spent almost the entire piece outlining how immigrant numbers and networking freeze low-skilled blacks out of jobs -- then concludes that reducing immigration won't help! 
 He may be right that the modest cuts proposed in legislation before Congress would still result in large numbers of immigrants moving to our big cities. It would seem, however, that the corollary should be that deeper cuts are needed, and that a larger proportion of those who are allowed in should be skilled, so as not to compete with the United States' own working poor.
Reducing the flow of unskilled immigrants is not a panacea for our inner cities; Professor Waldinger's prescription for providing job training and attacking pro-immigrant discrimination is right. But no effort to help this nation's poor, black or otherwise, can succeed without changes in our pernicious immigration policies.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
12,927 Aid Neediest Cases, As $4.8 Million Is Raised

BYLINE: By SARAH JAY 

 BODY:
Bernadine T., a single mother of four children in Brooklyn, budgets her monthly $1,426 paycheck meticulously. Even so, there were days last year when she came up short. No money for diapers, or food, or both.
In those moments of crisis, Ms. T., who in the last few years has rallied back from a rape, homelessness and unemployment, relied on the Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, whose 84th annual campaign ended earlier this month. 
 A total of 12,927 donors to the 1995-96 appeal gave $4,815,609.76, the second highest tally since the fund began in 1912. Although the drive ended on March 1, the final tally was completed yesterday. The highest total was $5,083,550 in 1991-92, and the next highest was $4,590,568 in 1993-94.
Last year, thousands of people besides Ms. T. turned to the charities as a last resort for food, clothing, medicine or perhaps just a word of advice. They included people like Yorna Mera, who received rent assistance from the UJA-Federation of New York when illness and injury prevented her from working, and Rodney Palacios, a single working father unable to provide medication for his 9-year-old son without the help of the Children's Aid Society, also supported by the Neediest Cases Fund.
This year, as changes in the welfare system take effect, the heads of the charities say they expect to see even more people like Ms. Mera and Mr. Palacios even as budget cuts force the charities to reduce their services. In that light, money they receive from the fund can have an even more critical role.
The drive, which began on Nov. 26, kept pace with last year's until the final week, when several large gifts arrived from Wall Street firms, which made record contributions this year. There were also a number of smaller last-minute gifts from individuals moved by George C. Ginsberg, a 96-year-old New Jersey man also known as the Penny Philanthropist, and there were first-time givers like Daniela Varon, who sent $18 in late February.
"As a new New Yorker, I am thrilled to live in this city," Ms. Varon wrote, "not least because it is really so many cities, each neighborhood having such different characteristics and energies -- and I am grateful for all you do to make this city a better place for people to live in."
As in the past, a significant portion of the fund total came from interest and distribution of trusts and estates. Among those contributing to trusts and estates, which totaled $1,137,889 this year, were the estate of Elizabeth H. Bryant, which gave $250,000, and Evelyn Y. Davis of Washington, who gave $51,000.
The idea for the fund dates back to 1911, when Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The Times, came upon a beggar in the street. Mr. Ochs gave the man some money but continued to think about the plight of the city's most destitute citizens and ways that he could help them. The next year, The Times published summaries of the 100 neediest cases, and 117 readers responded by sending in a total of $3,630.
As the city's population increased, so too did the number of people living in poverty, and the fund responded by accepting donations beyond the 100 neediest cases. The money is divided among the seven charities, which provide direct aid and services. Although this year's campaign has ended, the fund accepts contributions throughout the year and will credit them toward next year's drive.

HEADLINE: 'Ambiguity' On Taiwan

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
With China test-firing missiles into the seas around Taiwan's main ports and American warships patrolling the Taiwan Straits in response, the United States remains deliberately vague about the depth of its commitment to defend Taiwan from attack.
That ambiguous approach has long been viewed by Republicans and Democrats alike as a prudent one. But now, as some Congressional Republicans call for more pointed guarantees by Washington to defend Taiwan, the traditional consensus is under threat. 
 While some Republicans still favor what the policy makers call "strategic ambiguity," a swelling chorus of China critics are pushing for a more explicit commitment. Even Senator Bob Dole, the Majority Leader and front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has edged from his usual bipartisan caution on foreign policy toward a more explicit embrace of Taiwan.
The United States' defense treaty with Taiwan was abrogated in the years after President Nixon's visit to Communist China in 1972. The visit led to recognition of Beijing, accepting its argument that it, not Taiwan, was the Government of a single China.
But in return, the United States received promises that reunification with Taiwan would happen peacefully and at some vague time in the future. And in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United States set forth the intentionally vague commitment that now applies.
The law asserted Washington's right to help Taiwan defend itself and declared Taiwan to be within the American sphere of interests. And it said the United States would consider "any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States." It said the United States would "maintain its capacity to resist" any act that jeopardized the security or the social and economic system of Taiwan.
But the act does not require any particular response.
"The act is an important framework whereby China knows that the use of force will have consequences," a senior Administration official said. "Without pre-committing or allowing Taiwan to dictate our China policy, it's very important that China knows it cannot act with impunity, and that we have options and can use them."
[Speaking to reporters in Chile, Defense Secretary William J. Perry declined to say if Washington was planning for any eventual Chinese attack on Taiwan, Reuters reported. But Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said tonight on "The News Hour with Jim Lehrer" that the naval build-up was meant to "reassure our friends in the area that we have a big stake in the stability and peace of that region."
["At the same time," he added, "we are not on the brink of war."]
By sending more American ships to patrol near Taiwan, officials say, the United States is insuring that China does not underestimate American resolve, while stopping short of an explicit challenge that could lead to a confrontation.
"We want to make clear, against indications of some in Beijing who are thinking of using force, that we are committed to a one-China policy, but in the context of peaceful unification," one official said.
But the Administration is also trying, by this ambiguous show of force, to head off more drastic measures in an election-minded Congress. Some proposals now alive in Congress could infuriate China: providing more advanced arms to Taiwan, supporting United Nations membership for Taiwan or issuing invitations to high-ranking Taiwan officials to visit the United States after Taiwan's presidential elections March 23.
"What the Administration has done in the last two or three days has been a measured, prudent but necessary step," Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, said in an interview. "But by emphasizing only one side and emphasizing military force, China is making it harder for the United States to maintain bipartisan support for the policy," Mr. Nunn said.
Senator Dole has been circumspect on China, criticizing the Administration for being weak on Chinese violations of human rights and arms accords and calling for more American forces to be sent to back up Taiwan, but stopping short of a promise to go to war over the island.
The United States should make it clear to China that Washington has strong ties to Taiwan and "if necessary, we would protect them" from any Chinese military action, Mr. Dole said over the weekend, without saying how. He suggested China was testing Mr. Clinton because of a wavering foreign policy.
Senior Administration officials accuse Mr. Dole of playing politics and say a Dole Administration policy would be no different.
"It's a campaign year, and they will very likely play for any advantage they can get," one official said -- including using Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign promises to get tough on China against him.
Mr. Nunn said: "The unfortunate thing about presidential candidates in both parties is that they focus so much on getting elected they don't focus on what foreign policy commitments they've made. Dole will have a lot of pressure on him not to be responsible about China."
Stanley O. Roth, of the United States Institute of Peace, says that while it is vital that China understand that Washington would react, "if it becomes a formal defense commitment, we may rue the day it is made."
To defend Taiwan against unprovoked aggression is one thing, he says, but if Taiwan should declare independence, "it's quite another thing if you're really intervening in a 50-year-old Chinese civil war."
"That's why the ambiguity makes sense," Mr. Roth added.
Too strong a confrontational policy, he said, frightens American allies in Asia, while too soft a reaction undermines American credibility as Asia's "great balancer."
A senior Asian diplomat applauds Washington's show of force but says: "If you get into a direct confrontation with China, you'll probably be alone," given China's importance to the region. "No one expects a war, but everyone is worried that given the political, domestic dynamic in America, Taiwan and China, it could somehow get out of hand."
But there is pressure in Congress to alter the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act to recognize that while Taiwan has moved toward democracy since 1979, China remains Communist and is not respecting its commitments, says Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California.
"It was one thing to normalize with China when both Beijing and Taiwan had authoritarian regimes," Ms. Pelosi said. "The fact is, Taiwan is now a democracy, and that makes all the difference in the world."
Many in Congress "want to see Taiwan's rights respected," she added, including free elections.
"It could mean peaceful reunification or self-determination," she said. "Fundamentally, there's a commitment to one China, but now there are two economic and political systems, and it increases the challenge."
 
 The article also misstated the change that took place when President Nixon visited China in 1972. He did not recognize Beijing as the government of a single China; rather he began the process of establishing diplomatic relations with the mainland and left open the question of which government was the rightful ruler of a single China.

HEADLINE: Film Price Hits $8.50, But There Are Ways To Save

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
The price goes up. The price goes down. Sony Theaters, the city's second-largest chain, has quietly raised the price of a ticket at its Manhattan theaters to $8.50 from $8, keeping New York securely in first place as the nation's most expensive city in which to see a movie.
But in an experiment that has attracted moviegoers in droves, Cineplex Odeon has been showing older first-run films for $2 at its Worldwide Cinemas, a six-screen complex in Worldwide Plaza on West 50th Street near Ninth Avenue. The policy, introduced two years ago, draws near-capacity crowds even on weeknights to theaters that had previously been deserted. On weekends, the Worldwide is a mob scene, with films often selling out early. 
 Sony, which has 10 locations and 46 screens in Manhattan, said that its latest price increase was a cost-of-living adjustment. "This is only the second time since May 1990 that we've raised prices," said Marc Pascucci, Sony's vice president for advertising and publicity. "If we kept at the rate of inflation for the New York area, we'd be at $9."
The new price puts New York a dollar above the top price in Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago. Nationwide, the average price for a movie ticket was $4.35 last year, according to the National Association of Theater Owners.
Many New Yorkers have already reached the $9 barrier, since they order tickets through a telephone service operated by Moviefone that charges users $1.25. For some users, the service is a convenience. For others it is a necessity, since popular first-run films often sell out well in advance of showtime at the city's busiest theaters. The 45 Manhattan theaters that use Moviefone sell up to 50,000 tickets weekly through the service.
Cineplex Odeon, which operates 21 theaters and 51 screens in Manhattan, has not raised prices. Howard Lichtman, the executive vice president for marketing and communications, would not say whether the company planned to follow Sony's lead. "Pricing is something that we review at least twice a year on a very specific market-by-market basis," he said. "We look at a host of factors, and one factor is the pricing of our competitors. We haven't matched Sony's yet, but we understand why they raised their prices."
Mr. Lichtman cited the rising cost of presenting films, and an increasing investment by theater companies in better sound systems, screens and even cup holders. "Why wouldn't the cost of movies go up on an annual basis?" he said.
The $8 ticket is the standard for first-run Hollywood films in Manhattan, with a few exceptions, like the Quad Cinemas in Greenwich Village, which charge $7.50, and the Cineplex Metro Twin and the Cineplex Olympia, on the Upper West Side, which charge $6.50.
Otherwise, the $8 ticket prevails even at most repertory and art houses. Film Forum recently raised its prices to $8 from $7.50, and the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum both have an $8 museum admission fee to see films. An exception is the Walter Reade theater at Lincoln Center, which charges $7.50 for the general public and $5 for members of the Film Society of Lincoln Center.
Most first-run theaters offer price breaks to the elderly and children, and some nonprofit theaters, like the French Institute and Anthology Film Archives, also offer discounts to students. A few theaters offer matinee discounts as well.
Cineplex Odeon, United Artists and Sony also sell blocks of discounted tickets to corporations and to membership organizations like the Automobile Association of America. Members of the automobile association, for example, can order booklets of tickets at about $4.50 a ticket. The Sony tickets are good only after a new film has been out for 10 days.
And some films are actually free. At the Museum of Modern Art, children under 16 can see films free, and no one has to pay to see old films at the Donnell Media Center at the Donnell Public Library.
The Cineplex Worldwide may not be free, but it comes as close as New York is likely to see. Since early last March, the theaters have booked first-run films, like "Seven," "Goldeneye" and "Get Shorty," that have already played for several weeks elsewhere. The $2 ticket price applies to all films at all times.
Cineplex has tried the cheap-seats policy in a few other cities, but none have drawn the crowds Worldwide has. Mr. Lichtman said that the company expected about 1.5 million customers to pass through the theater's doors this year, making it one of the most heavily attended theaters in the country, although it operates at a loss. There are no plans by Cineplex to extend the policy to other Manhattan theaters, he said.
The pricing policy was a defensive measure by Cineplex, which had opened the Worldwide in 1989 with the expectation that the neighborhood was on the way up. The optimism proved to be unfounded. "The area did not become as attractive as we hoped," Mr. Lichtman said.
The Worldwide has attracted three kinds of customers: bargain seekers, procrastinators and fence-sitters, who are willing to take a chance at $2 on a film they are not sure they will like.
"It's just so much cheaper, and you get to see all the movies you missed the first time around," said Jessica Liberman, who is 24 and works for a public-opinion research company. "You can see all the movies you could see on video, but for less money and on the big screen."
Ms. Liberman said she lives on the Upper West Side and walks to the Worldwide. "I really want to make sure it's a $2 experience," she said. "Otherwise, the subway would be more than the movie, and that would ruin it."
Cineplex, of course, is the company that administered a dose of shock therapy to New York moviegoers when it raised ticket prices to $7 from $6 in 1987, a move that was quickly followed by Loews, the city's second-largest chain, which has since been bought by Sony. The increase caused howls of outrage not only from ordinary citizens but also from the Mayor, Edward I. Koch, who called for a consumer boycott to force a price rollback.
The movement went nowhere. In June 1989, Cineplex raised prices 50 cents more, and in May 1994, Cineplex and Sony both raised ticket prices to $8.

HEADLINE: A Korean Family's Dream, A Community's Struggle

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
WHILE their high school friends spent most Saturdays and summer vacations lolling in bed, playing basketball or going to movies, Veronica Jung, now 21, and her sister Rose, 19, worked.
At their family's two grocery stores -- one was in Floral Park, L.I., the other is in Fresh Meadows, Queens -- they stacked tins of tuna, made pyramids of gleaming red peppers and arranged persimmons, pointed ends up. They sprinkled water on cilantro and watercress, swept floors, bagged groceries and made change. If there was a free moment from 7:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. on Saturdays, and if it was the school year, they did homework. 
 Their mother, Agnes Soo Jung, 45, and father, Young Hun Jung, 51, simply worked -- 10 to 12 hours a day. The Jungs, South Korean immigrants, have worked to send their daughters to good schools and, they hope, better lives.
The plan has so far paid off. Veronica, a junior at Harvard University, and Rose, a sophomore at Bryn Mawr College, are moving away from the back-breaking work of their parents. "Even now when I see them work, I see that I would personally hate to do this, day in and day out," Veronica said.
Their parents' lives are not so certain. Their first store, Green Village, opened in 1986, but after about three years, the Jungs left it and, exhausted, took a year off. In December 1990, they opened Royal Fruits, at 187-08 Union Turnpike in Fresh Meadows. But business is down, eroded by competition from too many stores. Flowers, for example, once 50 percent of sales, have dropped to 20 percent.
Business is so bad, in fact, that on March 29, the Jungs have to vacate the store. Their landlord wants a more profitable tenant, Veronica said.
The Jungs are not alone. After some 20 years, groceries like theirs -- owned and operated by Korean immigrants -- are either on the wane throughout the city or are reinventing themselves.
The city's first Korean groceries were established in the late 1960's, in Manhattan's garment district, in the West 30's, said B. J. Sa, the executive director of the Korean Produce Association, a trade group founded in 1970 and based at the Hunts Point produce terminal market in the Bronx. In the early 1970's, it had 35 members; in the late 80's, 3,000, but as of January, membership was down to 2,500. Some grocers, "maybe a hundred," have returned home, Mr. Sa continued, adding that his figures were conservative.
At first, New Yorkers embraced the little stores, which stayed open 24 hours a day, selling fresh food, convenience and pleasant ambiance. But the customer and the market have changed.
"We worked 24 hours for the convenience of the customers," Mr. Sa said. "But the decline is due to competition by the same Korean-American groceries, too many on the same block or in the same territory." He also attributed the downward spiral to the influx of small markets being opened by Vietnamese, Turkish, Indian and other immigrants -- and to the opening of giant supermarkets. "Customers want one-stop shopping," he said, "and supermarkets have all the fruit and vegetables."
The average Korean grocer, working 80 hours a week, makes around $50,000 a year, said Andrew Ku, the president of another trade group, the Korean-American Grocers Association of New York, which is based in Long Island City, Queens, and was founded in 1986. "You don't need any special skills," Mr. Ku added. "It depends on ability and luck." (Ability is a synonym for hard work.)
Most Korean grocers spend three to five years working 72-hour weeks for someone else, save $10,000 to $50,000, then open their own stores. When times were best, through about 1993, the number of Korean-owned groceries had reached about 5,000, Mr. Ku said. Today, he continued, there are 3,500 to 4,000.
To survive, some store owners are striving to be wholesalers. Mr. Sa's group, which sometimes buys food and beverages in volume, recently bought 2,000 cases of a soda, with 10 cans to a case, a move that saves each retailer $1 to $2 a case. "But with 2,500 members, it's difficult to park and to distribute," Mr. Sa said. "We need some kind of facility." Eventually, he said, grocers may go directly to the farmers to buy.
Many of the grocers also haunt fancy-food shows, tasting salsas of red, yellow and green peppers; popcorn, and strawberries dipped in chocolate. They sip drinks of papaya, kiwi and ginseng. And they crunch on potato chips flavored with sour cream, mesquite and vinegar. They are searching for the next profitable step in selling food.
They want to be manufacturers, wholesalers, importers and exporters. "We want to have our own food service, own our own bakery line," Mr. Ku said. Although many Korean grocers sell similar foods -- the ubiquitous fried chicken, potato salad and green salads -- the food does not come from a central commissary. A few owners have upgraded their delicatessens to restaurants, making corned beef and roast turkey in their own kitchens, selling them along with cappuccino. Mr. Ku's group is considering importing coffees, iced teas and waters and exporting to South Korea anything American, like dried groceries and pots and pans.
For the Jungs, business has been failing for the last year. On a recent day, for example, they had only six customers in two hours, and the purchases were tiny -- a pack of cigarettes here, a cup of coffee there.
Times weren't always so tough. "There was one year when they were unemployed," Veronica said over the telephone from her dormitory in Cambridge, Mass. The year was 1989. "They thought the world was too exhausting for them, physically, and they wanted another occupation. We lived on savings -- and we ate up all the savings." In December 1990, they opened their second store. Asked what he would like to do now, Mr. Jung said through an interpreter, "At the moment, I have no idea."
Mr. Jung sighed and added softly, "Ideally, we would like to move away from New York and move to Memphis, where my eldest brother is." In Memphis, where Samuel Jung owns three dry cleaners, the weather would be warm, and a job with him would be guaranteed. But that dream, too, is being deferred. "Our daughters don't want us to move," Mr. Jung said. "They think that New York is the center of their lives, and they would miss their parents."
His wife added, also through the interpreter, "All our lives we've lived together, and we feel it's not right to live far apart."
The Jungs have nurtured their dream for more than 20 years. In the 1970's, Samuel Jung moved to Memphis and sent back word to Seoul that the Jungs should move to New York, where there were more Koreans. "Ever since we were married in 1975, he wanted to emigrate," Mrs. Jung said. "But I didn't."
In Seoul, Mr. Jung worked for an offset printer, binding books. He often took home discarded books without covers. The girls remember biographies of Abraham Lincoln and Marie Curie and Mark Twain's "Adventures of Tom Sawyer," all in Korean. "My daughters begged me to read to them," Mr. Jung said.
Veronica was in a private school in Seoul, where tuition cost the equivalent of $400 every three months and escalated yearly. Rose was in a public school, because the family could not afford tuition for both girls. The Jungs also thought the Korean education system was rigid. "In Korea, you have to immediately declare what you want to study, what career you want, and that's what the college prepares you for," Veronica said. "In American colleges, you explore what you want to do."
In 1983, when Veronica was 8 and Rose 7, Mrs. Jung gave in, and the family moved to New York. When they arrived, Samuel Jung, who had flown from Memphis, met them at Kennedy International Airport, Veronica recalled. He helped them settle in Astoria, Queens, where they had a distant relative.
Within a week, the family had joined a Korean-American Catholic parish. A priest found Mr. Jung a job at Kim's Fruit Store, at Second Avenue and 21st Street in Manhattan, where he worked from 8 A.M. to 7 P.M. Three nights a week, he would go home and eat dinner, and at 11 P.M., he would go with his employer to the Hunts Point market in the Bronx, where he learned to select the perfect, freshest specimens of cantaloupes, strawberries and bananas.
Mrs. Jung, who had been a homemaker in Seoul, suddenly found herself working odd jobs 12 hours a day. "I knew I had to work," she said. "But I didn't realize how hard. It's different hearing the warning and actually facing it."
For the first year, the daughters clutched English-Korean dictionaries, struggling to learn the language. After school, they went home, took their snack money from the table and went a few doors down to a local pizza parlor. "For dinner, we'd wait for our parents to come home, late at night," Rose said. When they watched television, they were told to watch only Channel 13.
They obeyed.
In 1984, Mrs. Jung's mother, Deborah Kim, arrived from Korea, and life became more gracious. She would be home for the girls when they finished school, making Korean food, like beef soup and grilled fish, and keeping the house clean.
In 1986, the Jungs had saved enough to open their own grocery. By the time the girls were in high school, they were working with their parents at the store, on weekends and during part of their summer vacations. "Every Saturday -- no matter what," Mrs. Jung said.
Three nights a week, Mr. Jung would go home at 8, eat dinner, and sleep from 9 P.M. until 2 A.M. Then, like other grocers throughout the city, he would go to Hunts Point to buy much of the food for that day. Since last month, however, he no longer goes there. Instead, he has hired a delivery service. It is no longer worth the trip.
The Jungs fret about themselves, but not about Veronica and Rose. Most of their daughters' education is paid for by scholarships and financial-aid and work packages, with books and clothing paid for by the Jungs. While some parents brag about their children, Mr. Jung is shy. "The girls don't want us to talk about them in a proud kind of way, because their academic career has just begun," he said.
But the daughters worry about their parents. "I am concerned about their future not being secure, because they don't have retirement funds and they lack fluent language skills," Veronica said. "Their options are going to be very limited. I see them starting something new, but it would be some kind of manual labor. As they get older, I'd like to see them do something less strenuous, physically and emotionally."
Whatever the daughters do in the future, Veronica said, they know that part of the money they earn will go toward helping their parents.
Veronica is an advocate. At Harvard, she is trying to push the school into adopting an Asian-American studies program; at home, she is registering Korean-American voters. She hopes to go to law school. Rose is more the humanitarian than the advocate. She has tutored children, volunteers at hospitals and wants to be a physical therapist.
One thing the daughters share is the knowledge that they do not want to sell oranges. "If Rose and I never know relentless manual labor as daily reality," Veronica said, "it will be precisely because my parents knew it so well."

Beyond the Birdcage

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Who would have guessed that we live in a country where Robin Williams and Nathan Lane are a sexier box-office pair than Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer? Not me or anyone in Hollywood. But that's a fact: "The Birdcage," a comedy celebrating a gay couple's 20-year bond, sold $18 million worth of tickets last weekend while "Up Close & Personal," which it knocked out of the No. 1 slot, had opened to a mere $11 million.
A fluke? Perhaps. Many gay and straight critics have viewed "The Birdcage" as a safe retread of "La Cage aux Folles" with "tried and true gay stock characters" -- in the words of Jeffrey Friedman, the co-director of "The Celluloid Closet," the documentary charting Hollywood's often shabby treatment of homosexuals. Yet the popularity of "The Birdcage" comes only months after two of TV's most popular sitcoms -- "Friends" and "Roseanne" -- staged sincere, even sentimental gay weddings, to sky-high ratings and mere ripples of protest. Could the public be ahead of politicians in its live-and-let-live attitude toward same-sex marriage? 
The question is important because same-sex marriage could be the next bloody battleground of the culture wars. In August, on the eve of both political conventions, a Hawaii court will hear a case that experts on both sides believe will lead to that state's legal recognition of marriages between homosexuals. Since the "full faith and credit" clause of the Constitution might require other states to recognize Hawaiian same-sex marriages, the legislatures of 20 states are now rushing to pass laws that will try to void those marriages once the couples cross state lines.
Why would gay people want a government-sanctioned civil wedding as opposed to the religious or spiritual ceremonies already being performed on both TV and in real life? The most practical explanations come from those who are already booking their tickets to Hawaii. Fran De Benedictis and Emma Llaurado, New York City police officers who've been together for 12 years, talk of how much costlier and more cumbersome it is to jointly adopt their child without legal benefit of marriage. Nor could either collect the other's considerable "line-of-duty" death benefits under their pension plans.
Russell Reish and his partner of 25 years, Albert Masse, who could have stepped right out of "The Birdcage," are proud of having raised two of Mr. Reish's nieces who were abandoned by their own parents. (The girls are now married with children of their own.) Speaking by phone from Los Angeles, Mr. Reish expressed concern that when he dies, other, hostile members of his family will try to wrest his estate from Mr. Masse -- because even an ironclad will and his hiring of "a very nasty attorney" do not guarantee his wishes being carried out.
Couldn't the equal benefits denied same-sex couples, from tax, Social Security and health-plan advantages to the right to make medical decisions for an infirm loved one, be achieved through strong "domestic partnership" laws? Some pragmatic gay activists argue for such an incremental strategy, even though domestic partnership could not equalize all marital benefits, since it avoids raising the red flag of "marriage." No major national politician in either party, after all, has come anywhere near endorsing same-sex marriage.
But that's why the popularity of "The Birdcage" and TV's gay marriages may be more telling than what politicians do or don't do. From the start, the most eloquent proponents of same-sex marriage have not been gay people on the left, some of whom oppose marriage in any event, but gay conservatives who argue that marriage promotes mainstream ideals -- "social cohesion, emotional security and economic prudence," in the words of Andrew Sullivan, editor of The New Republic. Or as Rich Tafel, head of the Log Cabin Republicans, argues in debates with religious-right opponents of his party: "You can't have it both ways -- accusing gays of being promiscuous and then denying us the right to incorporate into monogamous, legally recognized relationships."
In "The Birdcage" and its TV cousins, same-sex marriage is presented in exactly that conservative fashion -- as an enclave of familial stability in a country full of broken homes. If Nielsen and box-office numbers tell us anything, it's that this message has a huge constituency. Politicians who plan to run this year on a platform of exclusionary family values had better stop by the mall to check out what their voters are applauding in the multiplex.

China's Nationalist Tide

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
We met in a restaurant on the edge of Beijing, a seedy place with warm Tsingtao beer and a fish tank full of giant frogs. My dinner companion was a thirtysomething veteran leader of the 1989 democracy uprising in Tiananmen Square, who'd done his jail time. He came to talk about changes in the human rights struggle in China, and I think his words are worth listening to at this key juncture in U.S.-China relations.
I began by asking how the U.S. should deal with China on the human rights front and he answered swiftly: "I believe in secret diplomacy," adding that all his dissident friends now held this view. "You have to preserve the face of Chinese leaders in public and then pressure them very, very hard in private. If five U.S. Congressmen write a letter to [President] Jiang Zemin in public, it will have no effect, but if George Bush writes one letter in private it can have an effect." But, I said, many U.S. human rights activists say China's leaders will only respond if they are publicly embarrassed. No, no, he shook his head: "They don't understand -- we are swimming in a different sea today." 
 Communist ideology, he explained, has increasingly been replaced by a rising nationalism that resonates widely among China's people. China's aggressive stance against Taiwan today may be misguided, but it is very popular here. If the U.S., on human rights, tries to confront China's leaders publicly, Washington will crash straight into this nationalist wave and most Chinese -- even liberals -- will rally behind their leaders, he said. This is especially true after years of the Chinese media telling the people that it is the U.S. that is keeping China from assuming its rightful place in the world: the U.S. barred China from getting the Olympics, the U.S. bars China from the World Trade Organization, the U.S. encourages Taiwan's independence.
"When Tiananmen happened there was a lot of emotion -- it was the culmination of a decade of democracy debates, and people here knew who was the enemy," he said. "But seven years later, it is not so clear to everyone that the Government is the enemy. People are more nationalistic, and because of economic growth they have more personal space and freedom and money, so it makes it easier to accept the Government's line." Moreover, with about half of China's companies now privately owned, people don't blame the Government for everything anymore, because it doesn't run their lives as much, he said. And with more Chinese working in private factories in the cities, more of them have an economic stake in stability. They don't want confrontation.
Not only should America rely more on private pressure, he argued, but it should put its human rights arguments more into a U.N. framework, and less of a purely U.S. one. "If America wants to improve human rights in China," he explained, "it has to establish a legal framework for criticism of China that the leadership here can't ignore. You should be pressing China to accept the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights. Get away from the purely U.S. arguments." And the top priority should not be elections, but getting China to establish the rule of law. "I can wait 10 or 20 years for an election in China," he said, "but we need the rule of law right now."
He was encouraged, he said, by the legal reform bill that could be passed on Sunday by the National People's Congress. It would for the first time give Chinese some protection from arbitrary arrest and detention, protection from presumption of guilt, the right to a lawyer before a trial starts, and the first tentative protections from corrupt and abusive court officials. This was precisely the reform Chinese dissidents were demanding during last year's congress. If it now passes it would suggest that China may be slowly following the model of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- where one-party governments eventually discovered that they could not operate a modern economy, or control a rising middle class, without providing their people with the rule of law.
Before disappearing into the night, my dinner guest left me with this thought: Tiananmen was seven years ago, and "China has changed in a lot of ways since then" -- some for the better, some for the worse. It's time for U.S. officials to review their China human rights strategy to see whether it really fits today's China.
I know just the person and just the restaurant where they can start.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Of Nixon and Kissinger: What Might Have Been

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
There's a briefly introspective moment in Russell Lees's entertaining "Nixon's Nixon," when Richard M. Nixon (Gerry Bammon) and Henry A. Kissinger (Steve Mellor) consider how far they've come from their humble origins. It's late on the night of Aug. 7, 1974. The place is the Lincoln Sitting Room in the White House and both men have had a lot to drink. Facing impeachment, the President of the United States is being urged by his Secretary of State to bite the bullet and resign. Nixon refuses to make a decision. Kissinger is worried about his own future.
"Sometimes I stare in the mirror," Kissinger muses. "What's happening behind those eyes? I'm astonished. Mystified." There's a pause. He adds, "I like it." Nixon admits that although he doesn't often stare in the mirror now, he did on the way up. He not only stared, but also talked to himself: " 'You sly dog,' I'd say. And we'd share a secret smile. But then I fell. I fell like Satan tossed from heaven." 
 "It's the great American story," Kissinger says benignly, as if to soothe. "Requited ambition." Which prompts Nixon to suggest that maybe one should commit suicide when one's at the top, before triumph turns to tragedy. "There's the catch," the President points out with brow furrowed. "You don't know when to kill yourself until it's too late."
This is the stuff of Mr. Lees's blissfully funny and sometimes cruel fiction, which opened last night at the Westside Theater, after its limited engagement at the MCC Theater Off Off Broadway.
"Nixon's Nixon" deserves all of the good things you have heard about it and more. It's both a serious work of the imagination and a fully realized political satire of the sort that the American theater seldom sees. It may also be the perfect antidote to Oliver Stone's fancy and flatulent three-hour-plus movie, "Nixon," an upscale docudrama that pretends to deal in facts, a number of which may not be true.
"Nixon's Nixon" makes no such mistake. It's like a jazz riff on contemporary history. It's one playwright's speculation about what went on at a meeting that was closed to all except the two parties involved. There were no flies on the wall of the White House that night. Mr. Lees uses this occasion to create a small, vivid drama that confirms and even humanizes the participants as they are known through their public personalities. The revelations here are not of facts but of fiction that informs.
Jim Simpson has staged the intermissionless 80-minute piece with admirable simplicity and with two splendidly effective actors. As you may have read, Mr. Bamman and Mr. Mellor eschew all padding and putty that might make them look like their real-life counterparts.
At times Mr. Mellor seems to resemble Mr. Kissinger at the age of 30, long before his Washington days, but that seems accidental. The distinctive accent and voice are suggested, not imitated. Mr. Bamman doesn't resemble Mr. Nixon at all, though he has the hand gestures, the facial expressions and the walk. Best of all, both actors have the characters as written by Mr. Lees.
This Nixon is desperate, shrewd, paranoid, utterly baffled by the situation in which he finds himself. As the night of drink and talk, of accusations and reconciliationscontinues, he seems increasingly unable to finish a sentence. His mind is going too fast. No sooner does one thought come into his head than another arrives before he has fully articulated the first. His language is obscene. He also has a gift for the matchlessly inept simile. "Rugs as thick as thieves," he says of the carpeting in Mao Zedong's Imperial City.
Kissinger also disintegrates in his own fashion. He's alternately unctuous and aggressive until Nixon lets on that there are tapes that could bring the Secretary of State down, too. At which point Kissinger begins to see the value of whomping up a small international crisis to keep Nixon in office. The colleagues who initiated the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, opened China and negotiated the end of the Vietnam War are suddenly back in business.
They discuss various "Dr. Strangelove"-like possibilities until they seize on the idea of an incident along the Russian-Chinese border. Says Kissinger: "A provincial mayor gets assassinated sort of thing." They foresee how the crisis will escalate. Kissinger: "We tell both sides what's going to happen." Nixon: "We play 'em like banjos." Kissinger: "It gets tense. Who can prevent world war? Who has the power and prestige and trust of the Soviet Union and China? Who?" Nixon: "Me!"
"Nixon's Nixon" has the brio of a revue sketch constructed with a playwright's appreciation for character. The play doesn't cut deep but it cuts true. Within its short running time, it also manages to touch lightly on most of the major events so laboriously recapitulated in Mr. Stone's fractured film. In its wit and economy, "Nixon's Nixon" recalls Robert Altman's 1985 film, "Secret Honor," adapted from the one-character play about Mr. Nixon by Donald Freed and Arnold M. Stone. That work, too, was pure speculation.
At the time Mr. Nixon left office, who could have foreseen that he would become a figure of such fascination in fiction? Who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? Maybe Mr. Lees is right when he has his protagonist announce, "I appeal to the Richard Nixon in everybody."

HEADLINE: Japan Votes for Clinton

BYLINE: By R. Taggart Murphy; R. Taggart Murphy, a former investment banker who has lived in Japan for 15 years, is the author of "The Weight of the Yen."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
When forecasting the Presidential election, the punditocracy endlessly debates Bob Dole's electability, the Buchanan insurrection and Bill Clinton's resurrection from political death. But the commentators have ignored an enormously important factor: Japan.
The last three Presidential races were greatly influenced by events there, and this year will be no different. Washington and Tokyo have agreed on steps that could help protect President Clinton from the greatest threats to his re-election: soaring interest rates and market instability. 
 Government leaders on both sides may win, but American workers are likely to continue to get the short end of the stick.
Of course, Japan has no votes in the Electoral College. But in the early 1980's, its willingness to buy tens of billions of dollars of Treasury securities let Ronald Reagan cut taxes and run up the largest-ever peacetime deficit. Deficits stimulate the economy -- at least until the bills start coming due -- and Mr. Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign labeled the resultant economic euphoria "Morning in America."
Likewise, in 1988 Japan's Ministry of Finance so zealously browbeat the country's financial institutions to support the dollar and the American bond market that some financial analysts jokingly suggested that it should register as a Republican political action committee.
To be sure, the ministry had motives beyond influencing the American election -- Japan's economy would be crippled if a dollar crisis upsets the world financial system. But the Japanese felt that Michael Dukakis was more inclined toward protectionism than George Bush, which no doubt gave the Ministry of Finance powerful additional reasons to act.
On the surface, Japanese support for President Clinton may seem improbable. Mr. Clinton is more widely disliked in Japan than any President since Harry Truman. Although his trade initiatives have accomplished little and he long ago abandoned his campaign pledge to halve the trade deficit, his speak-loudly-and-carry-a-small-stick approach has led the Japanese public to consider him a Japan-basher.
Privately, high-ranking Japanese officials say they would love nothing more than to see the White House back in the hands of a predictable, George Bush-type Republican. But it is the Ministry of Finance, not popular views, that has the greatest control over Japan's markets. Indeed, the ministry's temporary loss of this control helped defeat George Bush in 1992.
In 1990, officials at the ministry and the Bank of Japan punctured Japan's overheated "bubble economy" -- which had made Tokyo's stock market the world's biggest and raised the market value of Japanese land -- by raising interest rates and putting controls on lending.
But these officials got more than they had bargained for. Japan's stock market fell to less than half its late 1989 peak, and banks discovered that the development projects they were financing were worth only a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars in loans taken out to finance them.
Needing cash at home, Japanese investors cut their buying of long-term United States securities, which helped send long-term American interest rates soaring. These stubbornly high rates helped keep the American recession of the early 1990's going much longer than expected, giving Bill Clinton his "It's the economy, stupid!" campaign platform.
This year, of course, Mr. Clinton needs low interest rates for the economy to work in his favor. Conventional wisdom says the Japanese can have little effect, because they have not returned to the market for long-term dollar securities and the Federal Reserve sets short-term rates.
But such reasoning ignores the one thing that could force the Fed to raise rates sharply and thus possibly doom Bill Clinton: a dollar free fall. And the Japanese help keep the dollar stable.
Japan has been running trade surpluses of more than a hundred billion dollars for each of the last four years. Its Government and private banks hold at least $350 billion -- a good half of America's external debt.
Fortunately for Bill Clinton, the Japanese authorities have almost as much to lose from a dollar crisis as he does. Japan needs a stable dollar to work out the festering bad debts of its financial system, officially estimated at some $400 billion (but possibly two or three times that large).
These bad loans have hung like a storm cloud over the Japanese economy for four years, dampening new investment and sabotaging growth. For the last few weeks, Japan has been embroiled in a political crisis over the Government's decision to liquidate seven bankrupt housing-loan companies that together managed to run up some $7 billion in uncollectable debt.
The widespread bashing of the Ministry of Finance by the Japanese media has helped the opponents of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and increased the pressure on the ministry's bureaucrats to get the bad debt problems behind them.
For that, a stable yen-dollar rate is absolutely essential, one in which the dollar is high enough to allow Japanese corporations to earn at least moderate profits on their exports so that they can service their debt.
Last April, the value of the dollar fell in a few frightening weeks from 100 yen to less than 80. No Japanese exporter could make money at that rate; it threatened to unravel the Ministry of Finance's entire strategy for dealing with the bad debt problem. It also threatened Bill Clinton's re-election, because it signaled the possible end of the dollar's role as a global currency and with it our ability to finance the national debt without economy-crushing interest-rate hikes.
Thanks in part to an arrangement reached quietly last June between the Clinton White House and the Ministry of Finance, the dollar rebounded against the yen and has been stable. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, agreed with Japanese officials to help prop up the dollar while the Japanese supported the United States bond market.
Since then, the ministry has taken several steps to boost Japanese investment in dollar securities, including allowing insurance companies and pension funds to hold more of their assets in foreign currencies. For its part, the White House has called off the tough talk on trade and taken bold steps to shore up the dollar.
Not only is the pressure off Japan to open its economy further to American goods, but letting the dollar rise against the yen makes American goods less competitive against Japanese products. Once again, American jobs are sacrificed on the altar of a stable dollar.
Republicans can console themselves with the thought that Mr. Clinton's new allies are forcing him to govern like a Republican. Thanks to the debt run up by Presidents Reagan and Bush, Mr. Clinton has no alternative to putting the priorities of the debt holders in Japan ahead of those of working Americans.

Bond Prices In Retreat Once Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower yesterday as expectations that the Federal Reserve would not soon lower short-term interest rates continued to dog the market.
A bearish mood returned to the market a day after Treasury prices recouped about a third of what they lost in the selloff on Friday. Still, a late wave of buying helped bonds erase much of the day's declines. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond settled down 1 3/32, to 91 14/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.66 percent, from 6.63 percent on Monday. Shorter-maturity bills, however, did fare better, supported by investors fleeing the volatility of the stock market. The rate for a three-month bill was unchanged at 4.95 percent.
Bond prices were under pressure at the opening because of selling in overseas markets overnight. Prices fell further after the Mitsubishi Bank/Schroder Wertheim weekly survey of chain-store sales showed more strength than expected. The survey's index rose 1 percent for the week that ended Saturday.
"With enough people in the market harboring bearish sentiment it didn't take much to get the selling started," said Theodore Ake, government trading manager at Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago.
But another weekly retail report, from Johnson Redbook, seemed to counter the Mitsubishi data. The Johnson Redbook report, released in the afternoon, showed a drop of 1.5 percent in the first week of March. The report helped bond prices turn around by the end of the day.
Bonds also got some support from a weak manufacturing report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and from a Commerce Department report showing a rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent in wholesale inventories, an increase that was greater than had been expected. The reports pointed to continued weakness in the economy, reviving hopes among some in the market that the Federal Reserve could still cut rates.
As a result, the data prompted some short-cover buying by speculators who had bet against a rise in bond prices, Mr. Ake of Everen Securities said. "Besides that, there are a number of large accounts sitting on the sidelines with cash on hand who continue to come in and take advantage of the stable moments in the market to buy," he said.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, agreed that the Atlanta Fed survey indicated a significant deterioration in activity during February. "These data are in sharp contrast to the recently reported employment data, at minimum raising the red flag to the reliability of that data," she said.
More clues to the state of the economy will be available tomorrow when the Government reports on producer prices. Reports on consumer prices and industrial production will be released on Friday.
In other action in the Treasury market yesterday, the Government announced that it would sell $9 billion of 42-day cash-management bills today to raise cash to pay a cash- management bill maturing tomorrow.
In the municipal bond market, Merrill Lynch & Company made the wining bid on $430 million of general obligation bonds from the State of Georgia, priced to yield from 4.15 percent for maturities in 1999 to 5.55 percent in 2015. The debt is rated Aaa by Moody's Investors Service and AA+ by Standard & Poor's.
Rising rates prompted the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority to postpone its sale of $834 million in revenue bonds. That sale, which was to have been negotiated through Merrill Lynch, would have been the largest bond pricing of the week.

Dollar Ends Lower, Tracking A Hard Day's Trading Gyrations

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar followed American bond and most stock prices lower yesterday.
The dollar was also under pressure as expectations for steady interest rates in Germany and Switzerland bolstered the Swiss franc and the German mark. 
 Tensions between China and Taiwan weakened the Japanese yen and were viewed as potentially negative for the dollar because of the possibility of United States involvement in the conflict, market analysts said.
"We were seeing a good bit of buying of marks," said Kevin Harris, international economist at MCM Currency Watch. "The funds were coming out of the dollar in frustration with the U.S. markets."
In trading in New York, the dollar largely mirrored the ups and downs of the volatile investment markets. It fell to its lows of the day as stocks bottomed out, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 95 points. The dollar then trimmed losses ahead of the close in tandem with other markets.
Falling markets often hurt the dollar's value because demand from foreign investors wanting to buy American assets diminishes. But yesterday's response differed sharply from that on Friday, when the dollar largely shrugged off stock and bond plunges. Currency traders then focused instead on the prospects for American interest rates' remaining steady or rising -- which tends to help a nation's currency.
Yesterday, the stock market erased most losses by the close and ended mixed while bonds were weaker but off their lows, as well.
In late trading in New York, the dollar slipped to 1.4745 marks from 1.4807 marks on Monday. It was quoted at 105.25 yen, down from 105.41 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5235 from $1.5241.
The mark and Swiss franc gained broadly after the president of the Swiss central bank, Markus Lusser, said he saw no need at the moment to cut interest rates further, while a Bundesbank official, Franz-Christoph Zeitler, said the German bank might have room for further rate cuts if factors like money supply and market rates allowed.
His comments followed those by another member of the bank's rate-setting council, Ernst Welteke, who said on Monday that lowering the discount rate would be hard, given the rise in long-term bond yields.
The yen came under pressure as China began war games in the Taiwan Strait. Investors moved money out of yen into Singapore, Australian and New Zealand dollars and possibly the mark and Swiss franc as safe-haven currencies.

HEADLINE: Sovietologists, Years After the Collapse, Cope With a New Reality

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
With breathtaking suddenness in 1991, the cadre of academicians popularly known as Kremlinologists -- pampered and privileged by years of Federal, foundation and academic patronage -- found themselves outmoded.
The Soviet Union had collapsed, the cold war was over and, despite their vaunted scholarship, linguistic proficiency and esoteric reporting skills, they had utterly failed to foresee one of the turning points of the 20th century. 
 Hand-wringing and mea culpas echoed from the pages of the liberal Nation to the neo-conservative National Interest, with the latter asking, "Why did it take virtually everyone -- and especially most of the supposed experts -- by surprise?"
There has been no shortage of answers. One of the more ingenious came from Vladimir Kontorovich, a Haverford College Sovietologist, who argued that had it not been for Yuri V. Andropov's weak kidneys the Soviet Union would still be in business today. Mr. Andropov's death in 1984 made possible the ascension of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Now, five years after the Soviet collapse, the effect on the profession has been profound. Subsidies from both the Government and the private sector are rapidly drying up. Students look elsewhere for more promising careers. Academic departments shrivel by attrition and sometimes by more drastic means.
"It's a classic case of restructuring taken from the corporate world," said L. Jay Oliva, president of New York University and a professor of Russian history. "You have people who are experts on a vanished age, and so the question is, How do they retool?"
Many have given up and retired. Some are turning their attention to Eastern Europe and Latin America or issues with international scope like protection of the environment. And there are indications that post-Soviet regional studies are proving attractive to a new generation of scholars excited by the fact that the field is now liberated from the static ideological clashes of the cold war.
"Three of my students are organizing a conference on private life in Russia," said Jane Burbank, who is on sabbatical as director of the Center for Russian and East European Studies at the University of Michigan. "That's something we could never have done in the past when we were preoccupied with the cold war."
On the other hand, not a few ex-Kremlinologists are fighting the trend with warnings that Russia, even shorn of the newly independent states, is still the world's largest nation and one with plenty of nuclear power. Further, they say, the rise of the ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who has evoked comparisons with Stalin, suggests the possibility of a rising tyranny that could threaten world peace.
But the general public has lost interest in the field. Mark Von Hagen, director of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University, called the public's new attitude "triumphalism -- the arrogant belief that we won the cold war because we were right and nothing more needs to be said about it." The Harriman Institute was one of the chief centers of Kremlinology, but now concerns itself broadly with the study of Russia, the Soviet Union and the successor states.
Congress has sharply reduced Federal grants for post-doctoral research, area studies and training in the languages of former Soviet bloc countries. Even more striking is the fact that most private foundations have virtually abandoned the field.
"The ostensible object of our study no longer existed," said Hillel Frandkin, vice president of cultural and international programs at the Bradley Foundation, a Milwaukee institution that until recently supported Soviet studies at Harvard University and the University of California at Los Angeles.
Shepard Forman, director of international affairs programs at the Ford Foundation, said that since Russia seemed to be on the way to becoming an open society it was time to support Russian studies by Russian scholars working inside Russia. In order to explore such prospects, Mr. Forman said, Ford opened an office in Moscow earlier this year.
The Russian Research Center at Harvard announced last month that it had received a $10 million pledge from a longtime supporter, and in gratitude would change its name in April to the Kathryn W. and Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Russian Studies.
"It couldn't have come at a better time," Marshall I. Goldman, associate director of the center, said of the pledge. "After the end of the cold war, we lost the support of Mellon, Ford, MacArthur and Bradley."
Post-Soviet scholarship also suffers from a lack of interest among university presses. "It used to be that they would take just about anything we had to offer, but now they shy away from us," said Alvin Z. Rubinstein, a specialist on Soviet foreign policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
Given the situation, it is not surprising that college students are seeking other career paths. David Maxwell, director of the National Foreign Language Center in Washington, said a recent survey showed that college and university-level study of Russian in the United States declined 30 percent to 50 percent from 1989 to 1994.
"Today, more students want to study Japanese and Swahili than Russian," said Kermit Hall, the dean of humanities at Ohio State University. Mr. Hall said he anticipated sharp cuts in the department of Slavic and East European languages and literature, which has already lost about one-third of its faculty.
Across the nation, Soviet-studies professors who retire are not being replaced. At the University of Pennsylvania a few years ago, three members of the history department devoted themselves to Soviet studies. Now, two have retired, one is on long-term leave and almost no one expects any of the three to be replaced by Soviet or Russian specialists.
Unlike universities, independently endowed centers like the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University and the Harriman Institute are much less vulnerable to intellectual trends and fashions. Yet Hoover, which is cushioned by its $165 million endowment, still has to raise about $5 million a year and nowadays finds it much easier to come by that sum for domestic rather than international studies.
Despite their ideological divisions, post-Soviet Russian scholars are united today in their belief that they -- and the problems of that part of the world about which they have special knowledge -- have been written off prematurely.
Richard F. Staar, a former United States arms negotiator and now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, is one of a minority in the field who argue that Russia remains a potential military threat.
"It may take a generation," Mr. Staar said, "but they'll solve their problems and emerge in the big league of world politics.
"We like to say their fleet is rusting at Vladivostok. Well, their new submarine, the Akula-II, is quieter than ours, and fires a nuclear-tipped missile. They're developing a new ICBM, the Topol-M, which had two successful tests over the last several months. They have five new types of military aircraft under development."
James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress and an authority on Russian history, also recognizes many risks, but he is generally optimistic. "Rational self-interest should dictate our continued study of Russia," Mr. Billington said. "There's a chance it could become another United States with huge national resources and a highly educated work force."
William C. Potter, a defense expert and director of the Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, dismisses as "paranoid" the notion of Russia as a military threat, but agrees that the region bears close watching because of frighteningly lax safety standards at more than 50 nuclear power plants throughout the former Soviet Union.
Many of these scholars comment on the paradox that at a time when Soviet archives are open as never before there are fewer American students and scholars able to study them. The Hoover Institution is busily engaged in microfilming records of the Soviet Communist Party in an arrangement with the State Archival Service of Russia. Nearly eight million documents have been copied.
Another striking feature of post-Soviet Russian studies is that the old ideological rift is gradually giving way to a generational one.
Senior members of the profession who maintain their deep suspicion of Russia are typified by Myron Rush, an emeritus professor of Soviet affairs at Cornell University whose tour de force of Kremlinology in 1955 revealed to the world that Nikita S. Khrushchev had become Stalin's successor.
Professor Rush had noticed that the official Soviet press sometimes capitalized the words "First Secretary" of the Communist Party in rendering Mr. Khrushchev's title. But sometimes the title was not capitalized. Being a microscopic reader of the Soviet press, he recognized that the variation was not a matter of typographical carelessness but reflected Mr. Khrushchev's fortunes in the Kremlin power struggle.
Within a few days, Professor Rush saw that the word "First" in Mr. Khrushchev's title began to be consistently capitalized, and then -- like an astronomer discovering a new planet -- he was able to announce Mr. Khrushchev's ascendance.
Younger scholars express admiration for the feats of scholars like Professor Rush, but say that such work has little in common with their own.
"Back when you didn't have any information, you had to impute a lot," said Professor Von Hagen, who at 41 is a member of the rising generation of historians of the Soviet Union. "Today we adhere more to professional scholarly standards. Let's just say there's less room for creative speculation."
Michael McFaul, a young politicial scientist at Stanford, said: "The isolation of the older generation of Sovietologists sitting here in California was probably not a good thing. They looked at Russia as totalitarian, but it isn't that any more. It may be more like what you have in Latin America. We need to have more people go there and see what's happening."
Still, the old guard and the new have at least one thing in common. "Today we are afflicted with a great humility," said Arnold Beichman, a research fellow at Hoover. "We were all wrong. And we know it."
 
An Array of Grants Dips For Post-Soviet Studies
 
 Support for post-Soviet studies has markedly declined in recent years. Following are some examples of the loss of support.
Last year, grants for postdoctoral research, area studies and training in the languages of former Soviet bloc countries under Title 8 of the National Higher Education Act were reduced to $7.5 million from $10 million.
Federal grants under Title 6 for fellowships for foreign-language study -- a large share of which has helped to keep alive the study of such languages as Ukrainian, Uzbek and Kazakh -- have aroused opposition in Congress and their future is uncertain.
The Andrew Mellon Foundation, which in the 1980's gave grants of $1 million and $500,000 to Soviet studies programs at Columbia, Harvard, the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Michigan, has discontinued almost all of those programs. Much of the money has been redirected to East European research.
The Bradley Foundation, which poured $250,000 a year from 1988 to 1990 into the Russian Research Center at Harvard and a little less to a similar program at the University of California at Los Angeles, has discontinued both grants.
The Ford Foundation markedly decreased its support for Russian studies in the United States but recently gave about $1 million to the Russian Science Foundation in Moscow to set up a competition for research fellowships for Russian scholars in the social sciences and economics.

HEADLINE: Governor Rowland's First Year

 BODY:
Gov. John Rowland has rightly focused attention on the problems of Connecticut's troubled cities. But he also promised to reduce spending that is vital to urban areas and to deliver a $200 million tax cut that will make it even harder in future years to assist the cities. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which represents the state's cities and towns, has estimated that the Governor's proposed cuts in aid to municipalities add up to $65.4 million for 1996-97. The group has begged him to put off the tax cut. He should forget about it altogether.
The nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis estimates that the state faces a shortfall of $2 billion over the next four years -- a deficit that will become even worse if Mr. Rowland carries through on an election promise to abolish the state's income tax over that same period. True, the Governor wants to pay for most of the first year's tax cut by selling off a small part of the state-owned lottery to private investors. But that is an ill-conceived solution that provides relief for only one year. 
 Although it has the highest per capita income of any state, Connecticut contains three of the country's poorest cities, and four that are losing population the fastest. Badly hit by the decline of the insurance, defense and banking industries, it lost about 162,000 jobs in the recent recession and its personal income growth rate has been the slowest in the nation in recent years. The State Comptroller estimates that only 14 percent of the job losses had been recovered by the second quarter of last year. The middle class has fled the cities, decimating their tax base.
The state's last Governor, Lowell Weicker, pushed through the state's first income tax in 1991, then did not seek a second term. Governor Rowland campaigned on a pledge to abolish the income tax within five years. But once in office he realized that he could not immediately repeal the tax, which provides some $2.6 billion a year, more than a quarter of the state's revenues, so he has proposed a $200 million cut for the next fiscal year instead.
Mr. Rowland plans to partly replace the lost income tax revenues by selling 6 percent of the state lottery to private shareholders. But the lottery sale would not make up for the continuing lost revenue. Comptroller Nancy Wyman notes that Mr. Rowland's plans also do not include an inevitable cutback in Federal assistance and are overly optimistic about revenue growth.
Mr. Rowland is relatively young, 38, and energetic. His concern for the cities -- he hails from Waterbury -- seems genuine, but his promised tax cut makes it virtually impossible for him to give them any substantial relief. He has little support for the lottery sale in the financial community and faces skepticism in the Legislature, which will have to approve any plan.
Mr. Rowland is also trying to balance his budget by cutting general assistance recipients off after two months, reducing rental assistance and cutting money for school transportation and property tax relief for the elderly. If he insists on an ill-advised tax cut, and on temporizing with a partial sale of the lottery, Connecticut's cities will continue to bleed.

HEADLINE: Rich Are Getting Richer, but Not the Very Rich

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
The rich appear to have gotten richer in the early years of this decade, according to Federal statistics issued today, but this time they did it at the expense of the super-rich.
The portion of the nation's wealth in the hands of the richest 1 percent of Americans declined to 30.4 percent from 37.1 percent from 1989 to 1992, a survey for the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Service showed. The next richest 9 percent saw their share of the wealth grow to 36.8 percent from 31.2 percent. 
 The results of the 1992 Survey of Consumer Finances, however, showed little or no improvement in the relative position of the vast majority of the population. The bottom 90 percent of Americans saw their share of the wealth rise to 32.8 percent in 1992 from 31.8 percent in 1989, a statistically insignificant increase.
Much has changed in the economy since 1992, including the biggest bull stock market in history. Further, economists said they were concerned that the survey, which is conducted every three years and is the most comprehensive of its kind, might have been plagued by problems that yielded unreliable findings this time around. Moreover, the survey results appear to contradict other findings that indicate a continuing growth in economic inequality.
But assuming the results are valid, they said, the figures indicated a sharp reversal in the trend of the 1980's, when wealth became increasingly concentrated among the very richest households.
"If it's true, it would certainly be good news," said Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University who studies wealth and income distribution. "It would show that the tremendous increase in inequality that occurred during the 1980's has not only stopped, but actually reversed."
The survey showed that the aggregate wealth of the bottom 90 percent of Americans grew by 20 percent from 1989 to 1992. The total net household worth of the richest 1 percent declined by 4.6 percent during that period, while the biggest winners, the next 9 percent, saw their total wealth increase 37 percent.
Long the subject of ideological debate, studies showing increasing income and wealth inequalities were an issue in the 1992 Presidential campaign, with Democrats charging that 12 years of Republicans in the White House had led to policies favoring a wealthy elite at the expense of the middle class.
Today's figures, if valid, suggest that concentration of wealth at the very top of the scale was moderating even before Bill Clinton regained the Presidency for the Democrats in 1992.
But because they show little change in the relative position of the vast majority of people -- a transfer of wealth from, say, Donald Trump to a Greenwich stockbroker is unlikely to resonate with the middle class -- today's numbers will probably only underscore the themes of economic insecurity that have played a large role in this year's Presidential race.
"Even if you take the numbers at face value, if you look at the bottom 90 percent of the population, it's still lost in this story," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a research group in Washington. "The gainers are still disproportionately those at the top."
"If you could really show big changes across the board, or down to the 50th or 60th percentile, it might make a difference," Mr. Baker added. "But someone concerned about holding onto a job is not going to stop being concerned because somebody at the 90th percentile is gaining from someone at the 99th percentile."
The figures suggested that the distribution of wealth had reverted approximately to where it was in 1983. At that time, 31.5 percent of wealth was held by 1 percent of the population, with 35.1 percent in the next 9 percent of the population and 33.4 percent held by the bottom 90 percent of Americans.
The sharpest fall was in the top half of 1 percent of households. That group saw its share of wealth fall to 22.8 percent in 1992 from 28.8 percent in 1989.
The survey defines wealth as household net worth -- or the total of a household's assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds, insurance policies, self-owned businesses and savings accounts, minus its liabilities, meaning all debts including mortgages and credit cards.
The results of the survey were released by the Federal Reserve in the form of a working paper on the methodology of the project. In its only general analysis of the results, the paper, by Arthur B. Kennickell of the Federal Reserve, Douglas A. McManus of Freddie Mac and R. Louise Woodburn of the Internal Revenue Service, said that the aggregate net worth of the top half of 1 percent of households fell 8 percent from 1989 to 1992, while the total for all households rose 17 percent.
"There were also sizable declines in the top group's holdings of bonds, trusts and other assets," the paper said. "This drop in the wealth of this group may reflect directly or indirectly the lingering effects of the 1991-92 recession, falling prices for real estate, the rise in business failures, or a cooling in the markets for some financial assets and for art."
Economists outside the Government said that surveys of this sort were plagued by the problem of getting people to fill out lengthy questionnaires fully and accurately. In addition, the Government agencies hired a different outside group to do the survey work than they had in 1989, and used different techniques to account for the difficulty of adequately representing the wealthiest households in the sample.
Economists also said the survey's results were hard to reconcile with research that showed that other measures of inequality, particularly in income, had continued to increase during the period.
"The income numbers show widening inequality in a host of different ways," said Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard University.
Among the most striking findings of the survey was a shift in holdings of stocks. In 1989, the top 1 percent of households held 49.4 percent of the value of equities, with the next 9 percent holding 35.9 percent and the bottom 90 percent holding 14.6 percent.
In the 1992 results, the top 1 percent held 38.8 percent, with the next 9 percent holding 42.3 percent and the bottom 90 percent holding 18.9 percent.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Confirms Blunders During Economic Spying on France

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Blunders by Central Intelligence Agency operatives trying to gather secret information on French trade negotiations and economic espionage led to an international embarrassment, a report by the agency's inspector general concluded today.
The career of one legendary spy is over, the agency's role in gathering economic intelligence may be damaged, and its reputation may suffer another self-inflicted wound as a result of the internal investigation into the C.I.A.'s Paris station, officials familiar with the report said. 
 The report, which is classified, is likely to intensify the debate over the risks and rewards of spying on allies for economic intelligence.
It found that the C.I.A. station chief in Paris, Dick Holm, kept the United States Ambassador to France, Pamela Harriman, in the dark about important aspects of his work, the officials said. They said Mr. Holm allowed an operative to carry on a love affair with the French official she was targeting, a decision that may have doomed the operation. And his underlings, including the lovestruck spy, made serious blunders that led to an international embarrassment, they said.
Mr. Holm retired last year while waiting for the inspector general to compete his report. He is a famous figure to his fellow cold warriors. He was flying into Zaire -- then the Belgian Congo -- during a counterinsurgency operation in 1962 when his light plane disappeared from the radar. He was presumed lost. But he lived, though horribly burned and permanently scarred, and was nursed by villagers who pulled him from the wreckage.
The wreckage of the Paris operation goes beyond Mr. Holm's career. Joseph DeTrani, chief of the Europe division of the C.I.A.'s clandestine service, has been placed in administrative limbo and at least four covert operators have been recalled from Paris. The inspector general's report will be shared with the congressional intelligence committees, some of whose members are likely to use it as a club with which to bash the C.I.A. for its work in the field of economic intelligence.
Officials familiar with the report said the basic facts of the case were accurately disclosed by France's Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, in February 1995. In interviews, intelligence officials added details to the story, which was a major embarrassment for the C.I.A. when the French revealed it.
In 1993, R. James Woolsey, then a new Director of Central Intelligence, publicly announced that economic intelligence was a major new priority for the C.I.A. This naturally entailed spying on allies like Japan, Germany and France. The French had been particularly aggressive in spying on American executives -- bugging and stealing from hotel rooms, for example. "No more Mr. Nice Guy," Mr. Woolsey warned in a speech.
Soon the C.I.A.'s Paris station had at least five operatives -- four officers posing as diplomats and a woman posing as the Paris representative of a private American foundation -- working on a two-pronged project. They were assigned to uncover French positions on world trade talks and to counter French economic espionage against American companies.
The undercover operative posing as a foundation representative made fundamental mistakes: communicating too openly with the C.I.A. station and communing too secretly with her target, a French official. Mr. Holm, the station chief, found out about the love affair she was conducting with the official. It was clear that the romance could compromise the operation. He and Mr. DeTrani, his boss as chief of the Europe division, agonized over whether to abort it. Mr. Holm wanted to carry on, and he convinced his boss.
Neither man told Ambassador Harriman that their operation existed, was imperiled and could be exposed. But French counterintelligence officials soon knew that a network of C.I.A. officers was operating against them. Either through sloppy work or through pillow talk, the undercover operative had revealed her secret status as a spy. The operation quickly unraveled.
The French, breaching the traditional protocol in such cases, raised an uproar over the spying rather than letting the four accused spies working under diplomatic cover slip out of the country for activities, as the phrase goes, "incompatible with their diplomatic status." The ensuing publicity raised questions about whether spying on allies for economic data is a worthy pursuit for the C.I.A., or whether its operatives would do better to concentrate on the activities of terrorists and other deep political secrets abroad.

HEADLINE: Protesters Fight a Plan For Washington's Home

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: FALMOUTH, Va., March 11

 BODY:
If George Washington really cut down that cherry tree, this is where it happened, on the back edge of Ferry Farm, his boyhood home. It is also where he tossed a dollar across the Rappahannock River, or maybe it was a stone or maybe that never really happened, either.
Anyway, this much is certain: The future first president lived here in Stafford County with his family on nearly 600 acres along the river from the time he was 6 years old to age 20. And now Wal-Mart wants to build a store on a piece of the 70 acres of the farm that remain, plans that have touched off the latest in a series of emotional fights in Virginia, pitting historians against the forces of economic development eager to create jobs and tax revenues. 
 So far, historians have held their own. In recent years, they have defeated attempts to put a Formula One race track on the Brandy Station Civil War battlefield in Culpeper County, a shopping mall on Civil War battlefields near Manassas and a Walt Disney theme park near Civil War battlefields in Haymarket.
But this latest clash could deal them a mighty blow.
Six years ago, the county agreed to rezone about 25 acres at the southern end of the farm from agricultural to commercial; in exchange, the current owners, the Samuel Warren family of Arlington, Va., would donate the remaining tract to the county. County supervisors who negotiated the deal hailed it as a major coup, preserving acreage that included the Washington family residence for a much-needed tourist attraction to compete with nearby historical sites in Fredericksburg and elsewhere.
The Warrens then negotiated a deal with developers in Richmond.
But when the developers found a willing tenant in Wal-Mart, and the retailer last month announced plans to build a 93,000-square-foot store, leaving space for an adjacent small shopping center, the mood among historians and many local residents turned downright revolutionary.
Even promises by Wal-Mart to plant a 50-foot buffer of trees to hide all commercial development from the farm and to offer $100,000 in matching funds to build the tourist attraction has failed to blunt their attempts to drive Wal-Mart away.
"A store of that size and all the additional facilities will simply overwhelm the farm," said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which had also worked to oppose the Disney project.
While much of the original Ferry Farm has long since been developed with houses, stores and fast-food restaurants -- a McDonald's and 7-11 are plainly visible across a highway from the presumed cherry tree incident -- historians contend that the remaining acres are probably filled with artifacts of the era.
Earlier studies of the property, which Washington's father, Augustine, bought in 1738, produced evidence that at least seven slaves also lived on the farm and that one of Augustine's daughters, Mildred, who died at the age of 1, is buried near the residence, only a foundation of which remains after a fire in the late 1700's.
Augustine Washington died in April 1743, leaving the farm to George, and he spent much of the next nine years there with his mother, Mary Ball Washington, and her four other children until he moved north to Mount Vernon in the French and Indian War. His mother continued living in the farm house until she moved across the river to Fredericksburg in 1772, at the age of 64.
Washington sold the farm in 1774, 15 years before he became president.
Groups opposed to the Wal-Mart store have tried a variety of tactics to thwart the development. They have argued before county supervisors and the five members of the county Architectural Review Board, which is scheduled to vote April 1 on the Wal-Mart plans. They have staged rallies, written letters and pleaded with Wal-Mart executives to choose another site in the area.
"This is the most important historic site in Stafford County," Bill Beck, president of the Historic Fredericksburg Foundation, told the review board during a hearing today that was attended by 200 people, most of them opponents of the Wal-Mart store. "If you allow this, you cannot deny anything in any other site."
Charles L. Cabell, a lawyer representing the Richmond developers, told the board that Wal-Mart would do whatever was necessary to comply with regulations, even use colonial-style light poles in the parking lot and colonial-style bricks in construction. He assured them that Wal-Mart executives were sensitive to the concerns of historians and did not want to spoil a national treasure.
Some opponents expressed the fear that if the Wal-Mart is built, Ferry Farm's application to become a National Historical Landmark, like Mount Vernon and Washington's birthplace 30 miles east of here, would be denied. But all vowed to fight on and some seemed hopeful that they would prevail. In her closing remarks to the board today, Rae Ely, a lawyer from Gordonsville, Va., suggested the April 1 vote might become the board's "finest hour."
"One of the wealthiest corporations is in front of you," she said, "and all of the people of the United States are behind you. This is a sacred trust."
When she finished, scores of opponents in the audience leaped to their feet and led by a woman dressed like George Washington's mother, began singing "America."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
N.F.L. Won't Use Replay in 1996

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE 

DATELINE: PALM BEACH, Fla., March 12

 BODY:
Instant re play used from the 1986 through the 1991 seasons and creating as many problems as it did solutions -- is not likely to return for the 1996 National Football League season, but may be used on an experimental basis this fall, Paul Tagliabue, the league's commissioner, said at the league owners meeting here today.
Partly because 21 of the N.F.L.'s 30 current head coaches were not in that position when instant replay was last used in 1991, there has been new support from coaches for the return of instant replay. Despite the many headaches instant replay caused, including long game delays and controversy even after reviews, these coaches say that replay still has merits. They want it back in a new form. 
 The owners, who will make the final decision, appear unconvinced that instant replay is needed. A vote on whether to experiment with it further during the coming season will most likely be held here Wednesday.
"My sense is that everybody feels that if we're going to have replay, we should look for a concept that works, maybe with experimentation in '96 and implementation in '97," Tagliabue said. "There is feeling that replay can be used as an officiating supplement. But we want to do it right."
The questions the owners ask about replay include:
*Who triggers review of a play or call?
*Who makes the call?
*What are the plays that are covered?
Answers to those questions remain elusive. In the old system, officials made the decision on which play to review. The new system could involve challenges, where coaches could ask for review. In the old system, replay officials in a booth made the call. In the new one, a sideline monitor and official would help the referee.
The old system mainly covered plays that involved change of possession. The new one could involve scoring plays, out-of-bound plays and possession calls.
"Even there, in the scoring plays, you have questions," Tagliabue said. "What is a scoring play? Is it one where the guy stepped out of the end zone? Or is it a fumble at the 5-yard line that would have been a scoring play? There are plenty of things still to be evaluated on this concept."
In other news, the owners heard from Phil Bredesen, the Mayor of Nashville, which has lured the Oilers from Houston. On Monday, the Houston Mayor, Bob Lanier, made a folksy presentation on why Houston deserved another N.F.L. franchise if the Oilers did leave; at the very least, Lanier said, the Oilers should fulfill the final two years on their contract at the Astrodome.
Bredesen said today that his city had proposed building a $290 million stadium in downtown Nashville and that the mid-South region of America "is an enormous business and economic opportunity with Nashville serving as the center because of its music industry."
He said that more than 46,000 private-seat licenses to help build the stadium had already been sold, accounting for $71.5 million. "We asked for our day in court, and we had that today," he said.
The Seattle Seahawks' planned move to Los Angeles appears to be more of a problem. Both sides will very likely wind up in court, Tagliabue said, and he added that the concerns over the Seahawks' current playing site, the Kingdome, residing on a seismic fault is a concern "that should not be taken lightly."

HEADLINE: Mount Sinai Rejects Plan To Run Public Hospitals

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In a surprising setback to the city's efforts to dismantle its public hospital system, Mount Sinai Medical Center has withdrawn from the bidding to take over Elmhurst Hospital Center and Queens Hospital Center, two of the three hospitals that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had offered for long-term lease.
Mount Sinai, which has long been affiliated with the two hospitals and which has provided the medical staff for Elmhurst for almost 25 years, had been considered the obvious candidate to take over the Queens hospitals. And its decision to pull out of the bidding leaves the future of the two institutions -- as well as the Mayor's plan to dismantle the Health and Hospitals Corporation -- very much up in the air. 
 "From the beginning Mount Sinai had been viewed as the pre-emptive favorite for the Queens sites," said James R. Tallon, the president of the United Hospital Fund, a research and philanthropic group. "It doesn't suggest that this is impossible, but it does suggest that putting these marriages together is going to be a pretty complicated thing."
Mount Sinai officials refused to comment on the decision or even to confirm it. "We entered into a confidentiality agreement with the city at the start of the bidding process," said Mel Granick, the hospital's director of public affairs.
But in a letter to Mount Sinai employees who work at the two hospitals, Dr. John W. Rowe, the president of Mount Sinai, said that the terms of the leases laid out by the city were unacceptable.
Mount Sinai "reluctantly concluded that we could not submit a formal binding proposal consistent with the terms and conditions required by the city at this time," he wrote.
City officials also confirmed the withdrawal. "We regret that Mount Sinai has elected not to submit a bid for Elmhurst," said Coleen A. Roche, the Mayor's spokeswoman. "The city will, however, go forward with those who have expressed interest." But she would not disclose how many bids had been submitted.
One known bidder is New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Myrna Manners, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said it had recently bid for the two Queens hospitals as well as for Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn. Catholic Medical Center has also expressed interest in the Queens hospitals.
But until today, both were considered dark-horse candidates that would -- if their bids succeeded -- be taking over struggling hospitals that were unfamiliar to them.
The proposal to find new operators for Elmhurst, Queens and Coney Island hospitals was intended as the first step in the Mayor's ambitious plan to privatize a significant part of the public hospital system. Elmhurst and Queens, which are close to each other, were offered as a package deal, with the stipulation that the buyer would be required to rebuild Queens, a tired, aging complex.
Many health analysts said that the Mayor had chosen the two hospitals as guinea pigs in the privatization experiment, in part because it was considered a sure bet that Mount Sinai would buy them.
Since the plan to sell the hospitals was put forth last year, it has been hit by lawsuits from the City Council and community groups seeking to bar the hospital leases, and by a scarcity of interested bidders. The Council contends that the Mayor does not have the authority to sell or lease the hospitals.
Opponents of the sale expressed relief at Mount Sinai's decision. "This throws a monkey wrench into the privatization train," said Rory Lancman, chairman of the community advisory board for Queens Hospital Center, which opposes the Mayor's plan. "It confirms what we've been saying all along: that selling a public hospital is a lot more complicated than the Mayor thinks."
Health care experts said the withdrawal underscored the difficulty of finding private operators for public hospitals, particularly while the financing of health care for the poor was so uncertain. Mr. Tallon said that recent Medicaid cuts from Albany and the specter of further cuts in the next year may have made private hospitals warier about taking over a public hospital, so that deals that seemed sweet in 1995 may have soured by now.
It is unclear exactly what turned Mount Sinai, which previously expressed interest, away from the plan, although many health experts have said that it would make more economic sense to shrink Queens Hospital Center than to rebuild it.
Also, the Health and Hospitals Corporation currently pays Mount Sinai well over $50 million annually to provide doctors for the two Queens Hospitals. Some health care experts speculated that the issue of how to compensate Mount Sinai for this loss of income if it became the owner of the hospitals was a sticking point in the negotiation.
Although Dr. Rowe's letter to employees dangled the possibility that Mount Sinai might negotiate an "alternative approach" with the city to the current bidding process, it is unclear what that approach might be, and the Mayor's office said it was pressing on with its bidding plan.

HEADLINE: Ex-Soviet A-Bomb Fuel an Easy Target for Terrorists, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
The republics of the former Soviet Union cannot account for a large share of the hundreds of tons of bomb-grade uranium and plutonium once listed in their stockpiles, creating a "primary national security concern for the United States," Government investigators are warning in a new report.
The investigators say that the nuclear material is an easy target for smugglers and terrorists, given the lax security procedures at scores of civilian and military nuclear sites throughout the former Soviet Union, and that the United States has little ability to track the material if it is stolen. 
 In the report, to be released on Wednesday, the investigators for the General Accounting Office said, for example, that they had been able to wander into one prominent nuclear storage site in Moscow, the Kurchatov Institute, without showing identification, and that it had been guarded by a single unarmed policeman.
While the investigators said they had no direct evidence of the existence of a nuclear black market linking sellers in the former Soviet Union to buyers elsewhere, the recent seizure of nuclear material in Russia, Germany and the Czech Republic suggests that a black market could be forming.
The report was prepared for the Senate Government Affairs permanent subcommittee on investigations, a panel whose leaders have joined in a bipartisan call for the Clinton Administration to step up programs aimed at controlling the international spread of materials used to make nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
While there has long been concern over the smuggling of uranium and plutonium from the former Soviet Union, the report provided several new, disturbing details on the lax security systems protecting nuclear stockpiles, and on the ease with which thieves could steal and sell nuclear components.
The report suggested that social and economic tensions in former Soviet republics had created new opportunities for nuclear thieves and terrorists, with employees in nuclear plants so poorly paid and demoralized that many might be tempted to steal.
"The challenge is to insure that the former Soviet Union does not become a vast supermarket for the most deadly instruments known to man," said Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the senior Democrat on the investigations subcommittee. "Unfortunately, there already appear to be many prospective customers."
The General Accounting Office report said that when the Soviet Union fragmented in 1991, it had stocks of 1,200 tons of highly enriched uranium and 200 tons of plutonium, some built into warheads but much held in civilian and military storage sites in containers small enough to be carried by one or two people.
Now, the report found, the nuclear material is scattered across Russia and several other republics, and many of the newly independent governments are clearly unable to provide adequate security. The report said the material would be highly attractive to terrorist groups because it was easy to transport and could be easily converted to weapons use.
The investigators from the General Accounting Office said they had traveled to nuclear sites throughout the former Soviet Union and found that several had no "comprehensive" records on the size of their stockpiles of uranium and plutonium.
At one site in the Russian city of Obninsk, the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering, Russian officials said that there were 70,000 to 80,000 small disks of uranium and plutonium, but that they had no exact count.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Cone Says His Fastball Is Popping and Hopping

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: DUNEDIN, Fla., March 12

 BODY:
David Cone has never been concerned about regaining his precise touch on pitches and getting his splendid right arm to perform productively. He chuckles at speculation that he has thrown too many pitches to be effective anymore and he reminds doubters that the Mets whispered about his supposedly overworked arm after trading him four years ago.
Guess what? Cone is still ticking. 
 Except now Cone is with the Yankees, and every pitch he throws is scrutinized because he is the unchallenged leader of the still-evolving staff and perhaps the new leader of the team. So even when he stumbles slightly in spring training, Cone hears questions about his arm. Then he pitches and silences the critics again. "It was never to a point," said Cone, "where I doubted whether I could do it again."
Cone set the tone for the Yankees again today by breathing life into his fastball and sharpening his breaking pitches to plow through five innings and help the Yankees defeat the Toronto Blue Jays, 8-7. Forget that he allowed three runs, three hits and walked three, Cone said, because he had crisp stuff. In 78 pitches, he displayed better arm strength as he struck out three batters and retired the side in order three times.
Should anyone worry now?
"When you have a David Cone on your team, you can't worry much about spring training," said Manager Joe Torre, who stressed that he did not worry after Cone's first two sluggish outings. "You've made your bed with him and he's it."
Because Cone logged 147 pitches in the decisive game of the American League division series against Seattle last October and because he has averaged 225 innings over the last eight years, the doubt about his arm strength becomes a topic whenever he does not come close to reaching 90 miles an hour on the radar gun. But Cone said his fastball today had "pop" and "hop" against the team that traded him to the Yankees last July.
"I heard the same talk when the Mets traded me," said Cone, who has permitted 8 earned runs and 12 hits in 11 innings this spring. " 'He's got too many miles. He's not worth it. Time to dump him now.' I do have some hard miles on me. I'd also like to think I pitch with a style that allows me to pitch longer and throw more. There's nothing wrong. I pitched the first game of spring and I'm pitching opening day."
After the Yankees burst to a 5-0 lead behind Tino Martinez's two-run double and Paul O'Neill's two-run homer, Cone encountered his only troubling inning in the bottom of the third. With two out and none on, Cone loaded the bases on two walks on 3-2 pitches and a bloop single by Joe Carter.
Cone fed Ed Sprague sliders until the count reached 3-2 and he opted to fire a fastball that Sprague bounced off the fence in center for a three-run double. After the hit, Cone retired his last seven batters on an economical 27 pitches.
After signing Cone to a three-year, $19.5 million contract, the Yankees are expecting major dividends from the 33-year-old right-hander and he knows it. He could have been much more anonymous with the Orioles in Baltimore, but he is attracted to the attention in New York. He expects it.
"It's starting to come together now," Cone said. "I'm aware that the team is watching me. I know it's time to start picking it up a notch. Today was a nice step. Today is something good to build on."
 
INSIDE PITCH
RUBEN SIERRA's experiment as an outfielder went awry as JOHN OLERUD's looping liner to left field in the sixth inning hit off his glove and was generously scored a double. Sierra was slow reacting to the ball and then failed to block it as it rolled past him. "If he can't catch it, he's got to keep it in front of him," said Manager JOE TORRE. . . . After General Manager BOB WATSON said DWIGHT GOODEN's start versus Cleveland Wednesday would not be particularly critical, he added, "If MELIDO PEREZ continues pitching well and Dwight Gooden continues to scuffle, I'm quite sure MEL STOTTLEMYRE and Joe will tell me they want to make a change." . . . MATT LUKE hit a mammoth two-run homer and JIM LEYRITZ knocked in two runs with three hits to power the Yankees to a 4-3 victory over the Reds in Plant City, Fla., on Tuesday night. ANDY PETTITTE gave up two runs and five hits in four innings for the victory.

HEADLINE: Backpack: An Inalienable Right?;
Student and Her School Tangle Over Civil Liberties

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, N.J., March 12

 BODY:
On one side of the courtroom was a willfully defiant 14-year-old honor student, well versed in the civil disobedience of Thoreau and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and eager to start carrying her maroon backpack to classes again.
On the other was the principal and some teachers from William Annin Middle School in Bernards Township, N.J., and the district superintendent, all eager to persuade Judge Solomon A. Metzger of the Office of Administrative Law that bulging backpacks were threats to the health and safety of students and teachers and deserved to be outlawed from classrooms, halls and the cafeteria. 
 So began a civil-liberties-versus-school-authority clash today between the eighth grader, Elyse Meredith, and the educational hierarchy of a well-heeled suburb hoping for Judge Metzger's blessing that its ban on backpacks is reasonable and its enforcement powers have not been exceeded.
During their testimony today, Annin's staff members depicted a backpack craze turned dangerous in a school of 500 students. Teachers talked of monster and mega backpacks overflowing with cans of hair spray and stuffed animals in the halls of Annin; of tripping over straps poking into aisles from beneath desks; of getting whacked in the face by careless students turning abruptly, and of the backpack machismo of eighth-grade boys intimidating sixth graders.
"You have three or four boys coming down a hallway," said a guidance counselor, James Buist. "It creates a bit of a flow problem,"
Sandra Hyde, a math teacher, testified about being struck twice in the face by the backpacks of students who turned unwittingly into her path. No permanent injuries, she told Judge Metzger, just "startling blows."
"I need to now be defensive as I walk through the hallways," Ms. Hyde said, "because I never know."
Miss Meredith said she did not consider backpacks as safety threats, and rejected the argument about the unwary tripping over straps protruding into aisles. "I feel they're almost like an extension cord on the floor," she said during a court recess.
When the school imposed the ban on Jan. 2, Miss Meredith ostensibly began her disobedient behavior by refusing to stash her backpack in her locker, as the school rule required. She has complained that the three-minute break between classes is not enough time to go back and forth from her locker, and each class requires a separate three-ring binder. The books are heavy.
But she also views her struggle more philosophically. She has read Thoreau's essay "Civil Disobedience."
"I admire him and Martin Luther King, too," she said outside court. "I feel this is all a question of liberties. I feel it's important to stand up for liberties you have, to keep them. I feel it's taking away students' rights to property."
Her defiance of Annin School's backpack ban has cost her 10 days in suspensions from classes. She served that time in a room in the school, doing homework under the watch of a teacher. A ruling last month forced her to abandon her maroon backpack, a moderate-sized one like those lugged around by millions of college and high school students. She now carries her books and other belongings to class in a black attache case that her father, Charles Meredith, gave her.
Mr. Meredith seems to delight in his daughter's fight, although he regrets that she has received her first B-plus at Annin after a string of A's. He is a burly former football coach and history teacher at Rutherford High School in Bergen County who now works as a salesman. For now, he is serving as his daughter's lawyer, albeit one a bit unpolished procedurally. Several times today, Judge Metzger admonished him gently to ask direct questions and refrain from offering opinions.
"We've always taught her that the first element of intelligence is questioning," Mr. Meredith said of his daughter outside of court. "The purpose of this country is to think critically. That's the purpose of education, theoretically."
Miss Meredith's challenge might extend beyond Annin School. If the backpack ban is upheld, other school districts in New Jersey might be encouraged to enact similar prohibitions. Only a few have them now in middle schools, including Bridgewater, Raritan, and Flemington. Bernards Township's school board has already spent $10,000 fighting this battle, and the Superintendent, Dalen Showalter, said the district would appeal if it loses this round of the fight.
This is the second time that Judge Metzger, an administrative law judge, has heard the case this year. Initially, the board came before him on an emergency basis and asked him to order Miss Meredith to obey. He refused, calling the ban a "minor school rule," and said he was not convinced that Miss Meredith had to submit to authority.
"If other parents and children do not understand, then it is the kind of learning opportunity that civics teachers pray for," Judge Metzger wrote in early February. The school board appealed to the State Education Commissioner, Leo F. Klagholz, and he overruled Judge Metzger, deciding that Miss Meredith's disobedience was akin to anarchy.
But her classmates today seemed unwilling to join Miss Meredith in a mass protest. Some seemed already weary of the two-month-old dispute. "She's never going to win," said John Cooney, a fellow eighth grader. "The backpacks are a fire hazard. The judge should decide that if the principal makes a decision, the kids should follow it."
To a few parents, the issue is also economic. Mary Besbris, whose son Jeremy is an eighth grader there, suggested that the district has its priorities confused. "We can't even get the supplies we need, and now we're paying lawyers' fees," Mrs. Besbris said. "Let the kid go."
To the school board, however, the broader issue is whether the rule is reasonable and within the board's rule-making authority, an important point for school boards statewide.
The school board's lawyer, Les Aron, sought to justify the rule today on grounds that the backpacks pose a safety risk. A substitute teacher at Annin, Dorthy Norris, told of tripping over a backpack and falling. Her ankle hurt for six or seven weeks, she said. Elaine Lent, who teaches fine arts and industrial technology, said she tripped twice over backpacks, hurting a thigh the first time and an arm the second.
Of her second fall, she said: "It just knocked the wind out of me, it really did. I would not consider it a major injury, but it was nasty."
The hearing will continue on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: California To Get More In Quake Aid

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 12

 BODY:
More than two years after the Northridge earthquake jolted Southern California, the Clinton Administration announced today that it would pay $932 million to Los Angeles County to help rebuild or replace four local hospitals.
The announcement ends a lengthy and, at times, contentious dispute between the Administration and county officials over the scope of the earthquake damage and the amount of money the Federal Government would ultimately funnel into the region. During the negotiations, critical parts of the hospitals have been closed or barely operational. 
 The relief package was announced today by officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It includes $394 million for the Medical Center of the University of California at Los Angeles, $373.7 million for the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, $133.5 million for St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and $30.8 million for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
The sudden willingness to resolve the dispute offers fresh evidence of the White House's determination to be seen as sensitive to California's economic concerns, which even before the earthquake had made California, a politically crucial state, the focus of special Administration attention.
Today's announcement raises the estimate of the Federal contribution in the wake of the 1994 earthquake to more than $13 billion, more money than had been expected.
In Washington, James Lee Witt, the FEMA director, said in a statement, "In the event of a future tremor the magnitude of the Northridge earthquake or larger, it is absolutely imperative that critical care facilities such as hospitals are effectively operating."
He added that residents in the area could now "rest assured that these four hospitals will continue to serve their needs when disaster strikes."
Zev Yaroslavsky, a county Supervisor, said: "It's not as much money as we asked for, but it's more than the Government initially offered. We have something to work with."
Last October, the Federal emergency agency offered to provide $300 million to help the county repair the four hospitals, including the 2,000-bed County-U.S.C. center, one of the nation's largest medical complexes. The relatively small relief package was reported to be the result of official skepticism in Washington about local estimates of earthquake damage in the Northridge section of Los Angeles, northwest of downtown.
But state and local officials balked at the suggestion that they were exaggerating the damage from the earthquake to get a Federal windfall.
The Northridge quake, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, left 61 people dead, 9,000 injured and 25,000 homeless. It seriously damaged more than 30,000 houses, apartments and businesses, many beyond repair, and left perhaps 250,000 others with minor damage.
The dispute over the amount of relief threatened to become a political issue when Gov. Pete Wilson, then a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, publicly chastised the Clinton Administration for its handling of the matter.
Today's announcement, political strategists said, could help Mr. Clinton's standing in the state, especially in the Los Angeles area, the biggest population center. In 1992, the Los Angeles area gave Mr. Clinton the edge he needed to carry California and win the Presidency.
Although the Federal aid was prompted by the earthquake, local officials said it would also help the county cope with major budget cuts and revitalize its troubled medical care system.
Last year, county officials discovered a $1.6 billion deficit, with about a third of it caused by rising health care costs. They decided that one way to help balance the books would be to close most of the county's public hospitals and clinics, which provide free health care to the 2.5 million Los Angeles residents -- out of a total population of 9 million -- who are too poor to afford medical insurance. The sprawling County-U.S.C. medical center was among those that was to be closed.
But in a surprise move, the Clinton Administration announced a $363 million Federal bailout of the county's public health system, which local political experts hailed as a savvy tactic, especially because of Governor Wilson's much-publicized reluctance to aid the county. The state is strapped for money because of various strict limits on tax rates and because it is still recovering from the recent national recession.

Blocking School Board Winners
 
Legislative leaders reached agreement on a bill that would strengthen the hand of the New York City Schools Chancellor at the expense of the community school boards as he investigates corruption. The bill would allow the Chancellor to block winners of school board elections in some districts from taking their seats for up to a year. The bill falls far short of what the Chancellor, Rudy Crew, the Board of Education and Mayor Giuliani had requested: the outright postponement of elections, for at least year, in all 32 community school districts.

HEADLINE: Key Semiconductor Index Falls for 2d Month

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 12

 BODY:
The semiconductor industry's leading indicator fell for a second month in February, a trade organization reported late today.
Although the decline was within industry analysts' expectations, the report showed that orders for chips continued to slow. 
 The report was issued after the stock market closed, and it set the stage for continued volatility in at least some technology stocks.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, which is based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio for the three months ending in February of 0.90, down from a revised figure of 0.92 for the period ending in January. But the trade group said that the chip market appeared to be stabilizing after a steep drop in January, which was the first time the indicator fell below the break-even point -- or 1.00 -- in five years.
"The new numbers suggest that the dramatic drop in January was a one-month aberration," said Doug Andrey, the association's director of information systems and finance. "Over all, we continue to expect solid growth for the semiconductor industry throughout 1996 because the global consumer demand for chip-related products, such as personal computers, is going to increase for the foreseeable future."
But analysts said that while the ratio was within the range of expectations, which ran from 0.88 to 0.93, the underlying figures still showed a significant decline in orders, and an end to the industry's ability to defy normal cyclical demand.
The book-to-bill ratio compares the rate of orders to that of shipments. Thus, a ratio of 0.90 indicates that for every $100 worth of computer chips shipped, only $90 worth were ordered for future use, an indicator of declining sales.
One factor driving the book-to-bill ratio down is the steep drop in memory prices. Andy Neff, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company, wrote in a recent report that 4-megabit dynamic random access memory chips have dropped to a wholesale price of $7 apiece from $14 in the last four months, primarily because of excess inventory.
"Mathematically, the book-to-bill ratio can drop during a period of sharp price declines, even in the face of higher unit demand, because the unit prices for products ordered this month are lower than the revenue from products shipping this month that were ordered a few months ago," Mr. Neff wrote.
Analysts attribute the price drop to an inventory correction as personal computer manufacturers must use up stocks accumulated in anticipation of a too-optimistic forecast for Windows 95, the new operating system Microsoft released in August. The Intel Corporation's overestimate of demand for printed circuit boards called motherboards and Apple Computer Inc.'s unexpectedly weak sales also contributed to an oversupply of memory, Mr. Neff said.
Semiconductor orders for February reached $3.9 billion, a 4.5 percent decline from the $4.08 billion in new orders recorded in January, but a 5.7 percent increase over bookings in February 1995. In comparison, orders in January 1996 declined 16.8 percent from the December 1995 numbers.
Shipments in North and South America totaled $4.34 billion in February, down 1.8 percent from $4.42 billion in January 1996, but a 31.6 percent increase over the $3.3 billion mark recorded in February 1995.
"Relative to the doomsday scenario some people were predicting, the overall ratio is not that bad," said Dan Niles, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens & Company.
But the 5.7 percent year-over-year increase in orders is down from 14 percent in January and 45 percent in December, he noted. "The trend is definitely not working in the direction you would like," he said. "This is not going to help semiconductor stocks tomorrow."
The book-to-bill ratio is computed using a three-month moving average and is seasonally adjusted. The Semiconductor Industry Association began adjusting the number last year. Using unadjusted numbers, February's number is the lowest since November 1985, when the ratio was 0.89.

HEADLINE: Stigma Curtails Single Motherhood in Japan

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 12

 BODY:
This was a grandchild that Mika's parents did not want.
Mika, then 19, was secretly living with her boyfriend, so her parents were startled when she told them she was eight months pregnant. Her parents met her at the train station, whisked her inside and kept her hidden from the neighbors until they drove her to the hospital for the delivery. 
 "I made a mistake," said Mika, now 21, who spoke on condition that her last name not be used. "At the time I was ferocious about raising a child. I didn't think it would be so bad for my kid. But now I've cooled down and, as I look back, I think my parents were right."
Mika gave up her baby, and she is not the only one in Japan who thinks that having a baby outside of marriage is a terrible idea. Although the numbers of single young women giving birth is soaring in countries all over the world, Japan is a striking exception.
Only 1.1 percent of births in Japan were to unwed mothers in 1994, the most recent year for which figures are available, compared with 30.1 percent in the United States. In America the proportion has soared in recent years, fueling a debate over family values. But in Japan it has tumbled -- Japanese women are much less likely to become single mothers in the 1990's than in the unsettling years after the war, in the late 1940's and 1950's.
In 1994, 14,700 babies were born to unmarried mothers in Japan. (The United States, which has twice Japan's population, recorded 1,240,172 births to unwed mothers in 1993, the latest year for which official figures are available.) The Japanese figure was a slight increase over the previous years, but it was only about one-tenth the number of births to singlemothers in 1947, the first year for which figures were made available.
Why has Japan not had a surge in single mothers? For a start, it may be that Japanese teen-agers are less active sexually than young people abroad. Moreover, abortions are easily available -- and common -- for those who become pregnant.
But the most important factor is social pressure. Single mothers face economic and social discrimination. In Japan, having a baby without being married is still a humiliation.
In the United States there is a great debate about whether welfare programs encourage births to unmarried women by creating financial incentives for them to have babies. Such an incentive also exists in Japan, where a single woman who would not get benefits might receive them under certain circumstances if she has a baby.
But even unwed mothers prefer to find work and day care rather than go on welfare, and the result is that less than 7 percent of single-parent households receive benefits.
 
Less Teen-Age Sex Than in the U.S.
It is tough to gauge how sexually active Japanese teen-agers are. Certainly many Japanese say that by their standards the young people are very promiscuous.
"I get the impression they have sex very frequently," Kunio Kitamura, who runs a family planning clinic, said of teen-age girls. "Even a 13-year-old once came to me."
But surveys suggest that Japanese teen-agers are much less active sexually than young people in America or Europe.
"I don't want to have sex until I go to college because I'd feel sorry for my parents," said Ayako Kitagawa, a 16-year-old student at an all-girl high school. "I'd feel bad because I'd be lying to them.
"Having sex is just an outrageous thought for us -- we don't even have boyfriends. Those girls who supposedly have had sex are flashy bad girls, so I wouldn't pity them if they become pregnant."
When they do get pregnant, Japanese girls often get an abortion. While doctors prefer parental consent from teen-agers for abortions, many perform them without it.
Even if they insist on having the baby, the mothers often end up buckling to family pressure by marrying the fathers or by giving up the baby, as Mika did.
Social pressures are also intense. Marriage prospects for the children are slimmer, and sometimes even funeral services are affected: in one case relatives refused to enshrine the ashes of a man in the family tomb because he had been born out of wedlock.
 
Unwed Are Shunned In a Family Culture
There is ubiquitous name-calling and bullying, high schools sometimes turn down the children, and companies often will not hire the parents.
Some older children of single mothers have reported being told by teachers that even if they excel in national examinations they will not get into prominent schools.
And if all these pressures were not enough, official discrimination against single mothers and their children is still overwhelming. Children of single parents, for instance, have weaker inheritance rights and their unusual status is recorded on their family registration, a document the Government requires every family to file.
Moreover, tax policies discriminate against women who choose single motherhood. Mothers who were divorced or widowed after having children can take a few thousand dollars in tax deductions against their income.
In contrast, mothers single by choice get none. Not only do they pay more national and local income taxes, but by reporting higher income because they do not get the deductions, single mothers also pay higher public day care fees and, in some areas, health premiums.
"It seems the national Government thinks that if you allow single motherhood to proliferate, it would damage Japan," said Shuhei Ninomiya, a law professor at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, who has researched children's rights.
"Japan accomplished high economic growth through this very established system of families, in which people took care of their parents.
"The national Government feels that if single motherhood proliferates, Japan's family system would break down and family morals would collapse."
Keiko Nakada, a 40-year-old woman who is raising her 1-year-old boy, Tsukasa, on her own, worries that he may be mistreated.
 
 'I Will Fight for Him,' An Infant's Mother Says
"If it happens, I will fight for him," she said, as she cuddled him in her studio apartment. But she feels bad that even her older two children, who are in the custody of her first husband and his wife, are being warned by their relatives: "Kids grow up fine when both parents are around, but when one is missing, there are doubts about how they will be raised."
After her first marriage failed, Ms. Nakada remarried, got pregnant again and then, even when her second husband divorced her, she continued with the pregnancy.
She thought she could count on her experience as a mother, but she was unprepared for everything else.
Now her parents have refused to visit, her sister does not help out, even welfare officials are rude, and she was turned down by five real estate agents because she was a single mother.
After she found a place to live and was late a few times in paying rent, her landlady complained to Ms. Nakada about her unstable social and economic status. Ms. Nakada has company, at least, for she helped find an apartment downstairs for her friend, a single mother with two toddlers. Her 23-year-old friend finally decided to take a night job and leaves her children, 1 and 3, at home while she goes out to work. So Ms. Nakada goes downstairs two or three times during the night to check on the toddlers.
Most high schools expel pregnant students, so teen-agers sometimes go to great lengths to disguise their sexual activities.
Kazuko Yokota, who runs Motherly Network, a small adoption foundation, described the case of a 16-year-old high school student who was impregnated in a rape that she never revealed to her parents.
She always wore loose outfits and, as she grew larger, her parents thought she was sick so they took her to the hospital, only to find out that she was due to give birth in a few weeks. She wanted to continue school, so she stayed home, got a doctor to make up a medical excuse and then returned to class several weeks after the birth.
"Single mothers are not permitted in Japanese society," Miss Yokota said.
 
Many Try to Deny Anything Is Amiss
But in most cases, the teen-agers have a sense of what they are doing, though they may deny to themselves that anything is amiss. A year before she gave birth, Mika had an abortion. Her boyfriend, Naoki, paid for it with $1,000 from his mother's bank account.
When she became pregnant again, after she graduated from an all-girl high school, her boyfriend began using tranquilizers and she spent her days in his bedroom, keeping him company. Naoki's mother, who works long hours and did not see Mika much at all, finally noticed Mika's expanding belly, when the girl was eight months pregnant, and ordered Mika to go to the hospital.
For a month after the birth of her daughter, Natsuki, both families argued over whether Mika and Naoki should get married, but in the end, they did not. Instead they put the baby up for adoption at Miss Yokota's Motherly Network.
Even among teen-agers who get pregnant, many do not talk about it, have never heard of other similar situations and do not think twice about getting an abortion. When Yuka Sugimoto, a 19-year-old student, got pregnant more than a year ago, she was shocked.
She held a conference with her boyfriend, her sister and her best friend, whose father is a gynecologist, and they mapped out a plan. She found a doctor, but when he asked for a letter from her parents, she nearly fainted.
Miss Sugimoto ultimately persuaded the doctor to keep her parents out of it. She explained, "If my parents even knew that I have a boyfriend, they wouldn't let me go out of the house."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ECONOMY;
Buchanan, in Midwest, Vows to Protect American Markets

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio, March 12

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan said today that as President he would use tax and tariff policies to return "virtually the entire" United States steel market to domestic companies.
Demonstrating how far his economic ideas had veered from Republican orthodoxy, Mr. Buchanan declared that American steel companies had suffered from "the neglect of the Government." 
 Mr. Buchanan focused his attention on the Midwest, where Ohio and three other states vote on March 19. He is bidding for the support of blue-collar voters by stressing his economic ideas.
Those ideas, which he would enact through broad intervention by the Federal Government in domestic and international markets, form the most iconoclastic component of what Mr. Buchanan calls his "new conservatism of the heart."
Mr. Buchanan has said recently that he believes the United States economy should be "designed" for the benefit of its workers.
"This is our market, this is our country," Mr. Buchanan declared at a news conference here. "The Government of the United States should be defending the private industry of the United States."
In fact, the United States steel industry is already rebounding. Domestic companies are rapidly adding capacity and have recently taken business from foreign competitors.
As the domestic steel market grew from 1994 to 1995, steel imports fell from 30 million tons to 24.4 million tons, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group in Washington. At the same time, American exports made the biggest increase since 1940, from 3.8 million tons to 7 million tons.
But the new, smaller steel mills employ far fewer workers per ton of steel manufactured.
Mr. Buchanan argued today that foreign steel companies were heavily subsidized by their governments, giving them unfair advantage.
He visited Youngstown Steel Door, a privately held company that manufactures doors for freight trains. From a high of about 2,200 jobs in 1979, employment has fallen to 300 to 350 hourly and salaried workers, the plant's management said.
Employment has climbed slightly as the company has diversified into other steel products. Mr. Buchanan, wearing one of the company's blue windbreakers, praised the operation as an example of "American ingenuity and American ability."
"We've got to make America the industrial power of the world again," Mr. Buchanan told about 100 workers who gathered around him in the murky, cavernous plant. "We've got to get places like Youngstown booming again."

HEADLINE: Embattled L.I. Incinerator To Go Way of Shoreham

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: GLEN COVE, L.I., March 12

 BODY:
When Glen Cove's $40 million incinerator and its towering smokestack were built in 1983, its technology was heralded as the solution to the problem of shrinking landfills on Long Island and in other densely populated areas.
But the smokestack's emissions, including a light powdery ash that fell on a nearby playground, soon alarmed many residents of Long Island's North Shore, touching off years of litigation. After operating for eight years, the incinerator now stands like some extinct dinosaur overlooking Glen Cove Creek, a victim of determined opponents, tougher pollution laws and the changing economics of the trash-hauling industry. 
 Today, Mayor Thomas Suozzi announced that the incinerator would be abandoned and torn down, adding, "The incinerator war is over."
On an island where the $5 billion Shoreham nuclear power plant was scrapped because of safety concerns, experts were quick to see parallels between the solid-waste industry and the nuclear-power industry.
"At first, incineration was like a dream come true, an appealing alternative to environmentalists worried about dumping garbage and chemicals and everything else into a hole in the ground," said Mark McQuerrey, a lawyer who specializes in solid-waste laws. "But over the last 10 to 15 years, it's not only become too costly a process, but they've become politically unpopular. It's now a dying concept."
It has become cheaper to ship garbage to new landfills in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Ohio and Illinois, Mr. McQuerrey said.
In Glen Cove's case, abandoning the incinerator will allow the city to cut its waste disposal costs in half. Initially, much of the savings will be used to pay $6 million to buy out a 20-year contract the city signed in 1992 with a company to operate the incinerator. But in time, Mr. Suozzi said, "We'll be making a profit."
The incinerator was closed in 1991 when the State Department of Environmental Cooperation described it as the worst-run incinerator in the state. Even though a new operator, Island Resource and Environmental Company took over in 1992, promising a cleanup and spending $22 million to improve the facility, the legal battle continued.
With Long Island running out of space to place its refuse, the operators of the incinerator planned to truck in vast amounts of trash as well as sewage sludge from all over the Island, reduce it to a small amount of ash and dump it in the remaining landfill or ship it to out-of-state landfills.
But many municipalities that had been shipping garbage to the Glen Cove incinerator soon found it cheaper to contract with carters who ship directly to new landfills in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
"The economics of the garbage business made these kinds of incinerators losing operations," said Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, which helped Glen Cove close down the incinerator. "The permanent closing of this incinerator marks an end of an era in New York State."
Mayor Suozzi said the city had contracted a new carter to ship its garbage at $30 a ton, $45 a ton less than the city is paying under the current contract with the incinerator's operator, Island Recycling. Since the city ships 20,000 tons a year, the overall savings would add up to $900,000 a year.
Mr. Suozzi said the carting company could either sell the city's garbage to one of the five other municipal incinerators on Long Island, which are looking for additional waste to process, or ship it off Long Island. "It will go where they get the best price," Mr. Suozzi said.
The towns that operate the five incinerators welcomed as a major victory a United States Supreme Court ruling last month that helped insure a continuous flow of garbage. The Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that gave one of the towns, Smithtown, the power to control the disposal of garbage collected within its borders. At stake were millions of dollars in disposal fees the towns used to pay debts incurred to build the incinerators.
Garbage haulers, who wanted the right to seek lower rates elsewhere, had argued that the system violated interstate commerce laws.
Mr. Cowen said the Supreme Court ruling would no doubt be used by towns with incinerators across the country. "There is a lot of confusion out there," he said.

HEADLINE: Denver Airport's 2 Deals Clouded by Rising Rates

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
The finances of Denver International Airport became even more complicated yesterday as rising interest rates threw a cloud of uncertainty over two deals -- including an unusual so-called Dutch auction -- aimed at lowering Denver's borrowing costs.
The Dutch auction and a $266 million refinancing of high-interest bonds issued in 1992, are scheduled to go to market today. But Denver officials and its underwriters, Goldman, Sachs & Company, were uncertain late yesterday whether these deals would go forward and at what amounts. 
 As part of the first stage of the Dutch auction, holders of around $1 billion in outstanding Denver airport bonds offered yesterday to sell their bonds back to the City and County of Denver. City officials said they might accept up to 10 percent of these tendered bonds, or about $100 million, and replace them with new bonds -- depending on market conditions today.
"Things are unclear right now because of market conditions," said Robert Gibson, director of financial management for the City and County of Denver. "We are now evaluating the response to our tender offer and we are looking at market conditions to determine what actions to take."
Originally, Denver had orchestrated a sophisticated finance plan. Some $1.9 billion in debt -- that was not callable until 10 years from now -- was eligible to be tendered in the Dutch auction. In addition, Denver had also planned to issue about $266 million in new bonds today to pay off high-interest bonds issued in 1992.
If that deal goes through, although with at least $100 million in bonds replaced in the Dutch auction, Denver would be in the market for $366 million or more today.
But with municipal bond interest rates rising, gaining nearly a half of a percentage point since last week, the city's bankers and officials are now uncertain whether Denver will save enough money by going to the market at today's higher interest rates to justify these deals.
According to the city's original plan, Denver is seeking to cut its borrowing costs on $150 million to $350 million of outstanding debt through the Dutch auction process. This process, which is rarely used in the municipal markets, calls for holders of around $1.9 billion in outstanding Denver airport debt to name a price in which they would sell their bonds back to the city -- and the city would then determine which of these bonds it would buy back.
Yesterday's announcement by the city that it would accept 10 percent of the $1 billion tendered in the Dutch auction indicates that the deal has already fallen short of its initial goal.
Rising interest rates have hurt this program in two ways: the market uncertainty has made many investors hesitate to offer their bonds back to the city at attractive prices, and the high interest rates that the city would have to pay for new bonds to replace that old bonds that were tendered make the whole deal less attractive.
"We are just looking at a lot of factors right now," Mr. Gibson said.
The interest rate rise presented some roughness to Denver's otherwise smooth sailing of late. Now, after the airport has been open for almost a year, its revenues are up, its costs are down and its bonds are rising in value in the marketplace.>

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE FRONT-RUNNER;
Dole, Dominant in Primaries, Faces New Battles in Capitol

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Barring some completely unforeseen development, Senator Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner, faces a pair of prospects no one has ever faced before.
After a clean sweep at the polls, winning seven primaries out of seven held today, he seems all but certain to lock up his party's Presidential nomination no later than the California primary two weeks from today, which would make him the first Senate majority leader ever to be nominated by either party. And because the primary contest is winding down so early and the conventions are so late, he will have to navigate an uncharted stretch of four months between the effective end of the nominating contest and the Republican National Convention in August. 
 During that period, of course, he will have work to do in the Senate -- work that will involve him in political combat, but also in delicate negotiation with the man he will face in the general election, President Clinton.
Flying from San Antonio back to Washington on Monday night after his final rally before today's primaries, Mr. Dole sat in the darkened front cabin of his plane, intently studying a legislative calendar.
"Time to go back to work," he said in an interview. "We have about 80 legislative days left and a lot to do -- balanced budget, term limits, line-item veto, Medicare, Medicaid. In this atmosphere, it's going to be difficult to get it done."
To some degree, the campaign will be fought out during April, May, June and July at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue, not on the hustings. Part of the picture of Mr. Dole that voters take into the fall campaign will inevitably be formed then. By locking up the nomination, Mr. Dole will become the party's de facto leader, supplanting Speaker Newt Gingrich, at least for the moment, and the success or failure of the Republicans will mainly be his responsibility.
When the Republicans took control of Congress in the 1994 election, Mr. Gingrich and his Contract With America assumed dominant positions in Washington. But after flirting with the idea of running for the Presidency, Mr. Gingrich stepped back, and he has been only a marginal figure in the campaign to date. Much of the Contract With America has been bogged down in Congress, and it has figured little in the campaign, as issues like the flat tax and economic anxiety and abortion came to the fore.
Now all kinds of questions face Mr. Dole: Will he be able to work out a new relationship with Mr. Gingrich in which he takes the lead? Will the Republican freshmen in the House, far less pragmatic than he, follow his lead? Which issues will he emphasize? Will his relationship with Mr. Clinton break down under the stresses of partisanship?
Ever the realist, Mr. Dole said he knew there would have to be a lot of horse-trading, "some reciprocal political advantages, some for us, some for him." He said that term limits seemed unlikely to become law but that there was a good chance for the line-item veto, "if we can agree on an effective date." Mr. Clinton favors the measure, and in principle so do most Republicans, but some are reluctant to give such a powerful weapon to a Democratic President.
The Kansas Senator said it was his view that a balanced budget agreement should be possible that "lets him win and lets us win, a little each." Failure to agree on anything, he said, would amount to political Russian roulette: "Who do the voters blame then? Him? Us? Both of us? I don't know."
Just an hour or so before, in San Antonio, he had been denouncing Mr. Clinton for vetoing earlier budget legislation and urging his audience to "veto the President" in November.
There lies the conflict. Mr. Dole will have to find some way to deal with Mr. Clinton on legislative business in private while making the case in public that he should be replaced. It is not an easy circle for anyone to square.
In the closest parallel to the situation that is emerging this year, Lyndon B. Johnson presided as majority leader over a special session of Congress after his nomination as John F. Kennedy's running mate in 1960. But the agenda was much shorter, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was not seeking re-election, had less at stake.
Still, it was an unhappy experience for the Democratic nominees. Proposals by Kennedy, then a Senator, were gunned down in the House, including an increase in the minimum wage and an early Medicare proposal. Trapped for hot, tedious weeks in Washington, Kennedy and Johnson watched as Richard M. Nixon ranged across the country, taking an early lead in Gallup Poll trial heats.
Mr. Dole said he subscribed to the old maxim of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Postmaster General and political strategist, James A. Farley, that most people begin thinking about elections only after Labor Day. But he also said that he was searching for some way to avoid being pinned down in the capital while Mr. Clinton campaigned at will -- "something clever, to generate a little excitement," he said -- but he confessed that he had not yet found it.
"He's got the White House, and he'll be in the spotlight," Mr. Dole added. "Incumbency is a big advantage, and I'll have to counter it somehow."
Half facetiously, he said in Florida this week that reporters should refer to Mr. Clinton as a Presidential candidate and not just as President, because it was obviously better to hold the job than merely aspire to it.

HEADLINE: The New Drug-Price Squeeze;
H.M.O.'s Are Fighting Back in the Battle Over Costs

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
It took only a few weeks for Merck & Company, the nation's biggest drug maker, to note the damage after the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York told its 850,000 members that it would no longer pay for most of Merck's highly regarded but often expensive products.
Several of Merck's banner drugs abruptly lost customers. Take just one example. Sales of Vasotec, a heart and blood pressure treatment, plummeted in early 1994, going from 60 percent of the prescriptions for HIP members using this class of drug to fewer than 5 percent for those who could not use a substitute, according to executives of the big health maintenance organization. 
 Hoping to get its customers back, Merck sent a vice president and other executives to the health maintenance organization's Manhattan offices offering concessions, from price breaks to free educational programs that steer patients and doctors toward certain drugs.
But so far, the drug maker's efforts have been unsuccessful. And that, analysts say, is a powerful sign of the shifting power balance as drug manufacturers and managed care companies across the country square off in a battle over pricing and influence in the enormous $65 billion market for prescription drugs.
The battleground is the "formulary," a preferred list of prescription drugs that each managed care plan urges on its doctors and patients, often by saying it will only pay the full cost of medications on the list.
Health maintenance organizations wrest discounts and rebates from the manufacturers by contending they can push tens of thousands of patients toward one or another brand, or often a low-priced generic copy, at the expense of similar drugs.
For their part, the manufacturers are scaling back on rebates unless an H.M.O. can show that use of particular drugs actually increased. Some drug makers also offer package deals -- one overall price for important, one-of-a-kind drugs along with older products that can readily be replaced.
The drug makers still send thousands of salespeople to tout their wares to doctors, who in turn still write millions of prescriptions for people who pay out of pocket or have traditional, unrestricted insurance coverage. But with more than 56 million Americans now in health maintenance organizations, the formularies can be the key to market share.
In the battle to determine prices, the drug companies are ahead in most markets. Last year, the prices that health maintenance organizations pay for some types of older blood pressure drugs increased by as much as 31.6 percent, according to IMS America, a market monitoring firm. Drug securities analysts project further increases this year.
But with competition growing sharply among similar drugs in such multibillion-dollar categories as heart, antidepression and gastrointestinal therapies, the balance is shifting to the H.M.O.'s.
"As we get to end of 1996 and into 1997, we would expect the managed care organizations to gradually take more buying power and flex their muscles," Jerome R. Brimeyer, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said.
Physicians complain that their professional role is often diminished in the back-and-forth, and all sides argue about whether patients are winners or losers. Managed care partisans quote a number of studies that say H.M.O.'s provide high-quality care, while critics say they have unhealthy financial reasons to deny needed care.
Even the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, whose membership includes three companies -- Merck, SmithKline Beecham, and Eli Lilly & Company -- that own their own thriving managed care drug concerns, has doubts about highly restrictive formularies.
After a recent survey for the Tennessee Medical Association found that physicians in that state overwhelmingly objected to restrictions on prescriptions in the Tenncare program for the poor, Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the association, said the results were "evidence that patients are hurt by restrictions on prescription drugs."
Still, getting a grip on drug costs remains one of the health care industry's most pressing challenges. For many health maintenance organizations, drugs are the fastest-growing cost, typically absorbing 7 percent to 11 percent of expenditures. What is more, free or subsidized drug benefits are an important attraction in campaigns to recruit new members, especially for H.M.O.'s that are pursuing Medicare beneficiaries.
Indeed, some health maintenance organizations pay for almost all drugs, so they have little leverage in price negotiations. At the other extreme, the United Healthcare Corporation, the big Minneapolis-based managed care company, is planning a highly restrictive formulary -- only one drug in each category -- for its Medicare H.M.O.'s in Florida, Chicago, St. Louis and Rhode Island.
"We found that by picking one drug, the manufacturers were much more interested to come to us with a better price, because we were going to move market share." said Dr. Lee Newcomer, chief medical officer of United. Medicare patients who need drugs not on the free list will get a reduced price, he added.
The manufacturers, not surprisingly, say that even the most expensive drugs are cost effective because they reduce a patient's need for the even more costly services of doctors and hospitals.
It may take years of carefully tracking patients to prove this fully; while both the drug makers and health maintenance organizations are eager for answers, many H.M.O.'s refuse to let the drug companies into the medical records of patients, whose privacy is also an issue.
In most markets, the manufacturers have regained much of the ability to raise prices that they lost in the early 1990's, when drug costs suddenly became a national political issue. Last year, the manufacturers' profits rose 13 percent, on average, and pharmaceutical stocks soared.
As the drug makers played catch-up, the prices paid by H.M.O.'s rose 4.9 percent, on average, last year -- more than double the 1.9 percent increase in all drug prices, IMS America said.
Even Merck and Pfizer Inc., which have pledged to keep their average overall prices below consumer price inflation, announced increases of 4 percent or more for some important products. Presumably, manufacturers kept their promises by cutting prices on other products that faced heavy competition. According to the Commerce Department, consumer prices over all rose 2.5 percent last year.
Spokesmen for several drug makers did not respond to requests for comment on prices. Always a sensitive subject, they are now even more so, because of pending lawsuits by thousands of retail stores charging the drug makers with illegal price discrimination. A Federal judge recently gave preliminary approval to a settlement in one suit under which 15 drug manufacturers agreed to pay $408 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.
"The manufacturers' legal departments decided that the word 'price' would never be uttered, inside or outside the company," Mick Kolassa, a drug marketing and management researcher at the University of Mississippi, said.
But price is very much on the minds of the health-plan executives who today make the most significant decisions about drug purchases.
At HIP, Mohan Vodoor, vice president for pharmacy services, said that after consulting advisory panels of physicians and pharmacists, his staff had determined that certain drugs made by an assortment of companies were "therapeutically equivalent," not to mention cheaper, than Vasotec and a number of other important Merck products. The H.M.O.'s new formulary took effect in February 1994.
Originally, Merck insisted that HIP had to sign up for the company's entire product line if it wanted special prices, Mr. Vodoor said. But after a few months, Merck was willing to negotiate prices for groups of just two or three products, and by early 1995, the big drug maker finally offered to negotiate separately on any drug, he said.
Earlier, though, Merck had gone over Mr. Vodoor's head and made its pitch -- without success -- to a senior vice president at HIP. Then last year, the company sent in a team from its Medco managed care unit, offering to provide services such as getting in touch with physicians and pharmacists to help the H.M.O. keep control of costs.
"We took a look, but what they were offering didn't fit our needs," Mr. Vodoor said.
John Doorley, a spokesman for Merck, said the company declined to comment on its specific dealings with HIP. He said that it was working with "key customers like HIP NY, to improve our relationships," but he conceded that some H.M.O.s resented Merck's requirement.
Another front in the pricing wars is Washington. With the political heat turned down, the drug industry is lobbying Congress, trying to roll back the rebates that manufacturers are required to give to state Medicaid programs for the poor based on the "best price" at which they sell each product. Medicaid pays for 13 percent of all prescriptions, and the rebate requirement was designed to assure that drug makers did not profit at the taxpayers' expense while cutting prices to grab market share in the private sector.
The rebates can be substantial: California cut $273 million from the $1.5 billion drug bill for its Medi-Cal program last year.
The manufacturers are focusing on proposed Medicaid legislation that is stalled in Congress in their effort to get rid of the rebates. Still, the rebate rule shows how tricky it can be to squeeze drug costs out of health care.
Soon after the Medicaid rebates took effect in 1991, industry consultants say, the drug companies began reviewing their contracts with big H.M.O.'s and hospitals and paring back concessions. By raising the floor under the "best prices," they could charge more to private customers while reducing their rebates to the states.
 The chart also misstated the 1995 sales for the antibiotic, Zithromax. They were $399.5 million, not $339.5 million.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 20, 1996, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day last Wednesday, comparing changes in drug prices paid by health maintenance organizations and those paid by retailers, omitted an explanatory heading. The bar graphs represented changes in four categories -- heart medication, antibiotics, allergy relief and arthritis relief. The graphs did not depict changes for the specific drug brands -- Procardia XL, Zithromax, Claritin and Lodine -- illustrating the categories.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Graph: "Rx for Competition" lists information concerning four brand name drugs from the following four categories: heart medication, antibiotics, allergy relief, and arthritis relief. Information includes sales, market share, average wholesale price, and daily dose for Procardia XL, Zithromax, Claritin, and Lodine. Graphs compare percent change in respectiv drug prices charged to H.M.O.'s and to retailers during the years 1993, 1994, and 1995. (Sources: Company reports, Lehman Brothers, IMS America) (pg. D1)
 
Table: "H.M.O.'s Opinions of Drug Companies"
 All drug compaines are not equal, according to a semiannual survey of managed care pharmacy directors, who negotiate contracts with the drug companies. They were asked to name the six companies that offered the most satisfactory deals, and the six that offered the least satisfactory ones, based on the prices and conditions of each contract. The results measure the number of favorable ratings minus the number of unfavorable ratings each company received. Table lists the results for some companies from the fall 1995 survey.

HEADLINE: Denver Airport Completes Bond Auction

 BODY:
While it did not go exactly as planned, the Denver International Airport yesterday completed its Dutch auction -- a financing technique unusual in the municipal market that lowers the airport's borrowing costs.
The recent rise in municipal bond interest rates that began last week forced Denver officials to scale back the size of the auction, along with another bond refinancing that went to market yesterday. Together, the two deals issued about $243 million in refunded debt at rates ranging from 4 percent to 6.05 percent. These borrowings replace existing debt with higher interest rates. 
 This is about $100 million less than Denver had hoped for as recently as Tuesday and up to $200 million less than it had sought several weeks earlier. Despite this lower amount, Denver officials said that the strong investor interest in the Dutch auction might persuade them to use this financing tool to reduce debt costs again in the future.
In the Dutch auction, holders of more than $1.9 billion in Denver airport bonds -- nearly half all bonds outstanding -- were invited to sell their bonds back to the city. The investors who responded named a price, and the city selected the bonds with prices that it was willing to pay. Holders of $1.1 billion in Denver airport bonds offered their bonds and Denver chose to buy $114 million of them and replace them with bonds at lower interest rates.

The Shaky Three

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Three of the world leaders who gathered at Sharm el-Sheik in Egypt -- Shimon Peres, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton -- are actively campaigning to remain in office. It is as if they were running mates on an international incumbency ticket, with each having an intense interest in helping the others win.
Can these three political musketeers bring it off together? Or will the weakness of any one of them help drag down the other two? 
 The calendar puts Clinton in the best position to help his global running mates. Election Day in Israel comes at the end of May, in Russia two weeks later, in the U.S. more than four months after that. The American President also has the greatest incentive to come to the ticket's support, because he has identified his policies with Peres's, and been a rooter for Yeltsin; their failure might well contribute to his own.
Therefore, to shore up Shimon Peres:
Clinton has invested heavily in identifying himself with the initiative begun by the Israeli. Despite Clinton's brief protocol appointment with the opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu during today's stop in Israel, nobody doubts that the loftily named "peacemakers' summit" and subsequent visit to terror-tortured Israel is designed to stop the plummeting polls of Peres.
The ratings of Israel's Prime Minister will probably be blipped upward by the emergency visitation. Jews had to be somewhat reassured by the sight of Arab summiteers -- notably excepting Syria, which supports the terror process -- agreeing to a statement of "strong condemnation of all acts of terror . . . including recent terrorist attacks in Israel."
Getting Arabs to sign on to that has meaning. Credit Clinton with good arm-twisting to get that language, though it was vitiated by a promise to pay money to Arafat's organization even before he proves his ability to root out Palestinian terror. Israelis may not forgive Peres for gambling with lives by subcontracting antiterrorism to Arafat, but they have to notice how Clinton stands by his South Lawn guests.
To shore up Boris Yeltsin:
Clinton has his work cut out for him there. Yeltsin's polls remain in single digits for good reasons. His promises to end the carnage in Chechnya have been broken, with a recent rebel raid embarrassing the army; he has tightened his control of state television and fired free-market economists, alienating reformers; he has failed to protect Serbian war criminals, infuriating extreme nationalists.
But Clinton used his influence on the International Monetary Fund to extend Russia a multibillion-dollar loan, bolstering Yeltsin's prestige in the run-up to elections.
Next month, Yeltsin will host the U.S. President and other G-7 leaders at a summit in Moscow, partly to talk about nuclear safety, partly to appear side-by-side with Clinton on Russian and American TV, campaigning together in the same media-sensitive way the American did yesterday in Sharm el-Sheik and will today in Tel Aviv with Peres. To avoid embarrassing Yeltsin, Clinton will dismay Eastern Europe by downplaying NATO enlargement.
Clinton knows that Yeltsin will immediately take his election campaign to China, signing a treaty settling old border disputes while selling China more advanced warplanes. The U.S. President will be tempted to let the Russian carry a message to Beijing about Taiwan; such a Yeltsin role, playing Russia's new China card, might cause proud Russians to see Yeltsin as a global superpower broker.
Thus do the candidates in Washington, Moscow and Jerusalem work in unprecedented harmony. They believe it to be in their nations' interests and know it to be in their personal political interests.
The question in each case is this: Does the image of a leader bestriding the world scene decisively affect voters' behavior -- or will voters see this alliance of incumbents as merely a pose to distract attention from problems at home or worries about their leaders' characters?
My guess is already on the record: If Peres, Yeltsin and Clinton all lose office this year, I will collect the Pundits' Trifecta with its deliciously long odds. If all three leaders win, however, the lesson will be plain: In presidential politics, hands across the sea can wash each other.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lower in Quiet Trading As Stocks and Bonds Calm Down

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar crept lower in quiet trading yesterday as American stock and bond markets settled down after three days of wild swings.
The German mark and Swiss franc extended gains against the dollar on expectations that neither European country would soon cut its interest rates.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar slipped to 105.10 Japanese yen, from 105.25 yen on Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 1.4703 German marks, down from 1.4745. The British pound fell to $1.5230, from $1.5235.
Stocks and bonds edged modestly lower yesterday, but there was no sign of the volatility that has gripped the markets since Friday's surprising report that more than 700,000 jobs were created in February.
The lull, however, may be temporary as the markets braced for any surprises in United States inflation reports scheduled for today and tomorrow.
"The market is still trying to reassess the state of the economy so we are anxious to see inflation and production data," said Bob Lynch, currency analyst at MMS International. "More important for the dollar is probably going to be German policy."
The mark rose against the dollar on widespread expectations that the Bundesbank would keep rates steady at its council meeting today despite plentiful signs of economic weakness and high unemployment.
"The market is pretty much of the opinion if they were to cut rates, it would be a surprise," said Steven Jury, chief dealer at the Union Bank of Switzerland.
Mr. Jury said the Swiss franc strengthened further a day after the president of the Swiss National Bank, Mark Lusser, said he saw no need to lower rates.
Currency traders said there was also some buying of Swiss francs, a traditional safe-haven currency, as a result of China-Taiwan tensions.
The dollar was little changed against the Japanese yen as threats to Taiwan from China weakened the yen.
The New Zealand dollar and the Australian dollar benefited from investment flows out of Japan and Taiwan, traders said.
The dollar stayed in a narrow range in New York trading. It dipped below 1.47 marks several times but quickly bounced higher.
"There is interest in buying under 1.47 marks," said Lizbeth Goldberg, assistant vice president at Bayerische Hypobank. "Funds were in buying at 1.4685."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Edge Lower; 6.68% Yield

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices edged lower in nervous trading yesterday as market participants awaited reports on inflation due out today and tomorrow.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 5/32 of a percentage point, to 91 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.68 percent, from 6.66 percent on Tuesday. Shorter maturities fared better, with some investors selling longer maturities to buy shorter maturities and reduce their length of exposure in an unsettled market. 
 Bond prices received some support early in the session from comments by a Federal Reserve official and by a report pointing to modest growth with low inflation.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Jack Guynn, said late Tuesday that the chances of either slower or more rapid economic growth were balanced, and as a result he was comfortable with the current monetary stance.
Mr. Guynn's comments suggested that the direction of the economy had not fundamentally changed despite Friday's employment report, which pointed to surprising strength. That conservative view of the economy was echoed yesterday in the Fed's survey of business conditions.
The survey of the Fed's 12 regional districts, known as the beige book, found that the economy "grew modestly" in the first two months of the year, with wages and prices generally subdued.
Bond traders said the report was in line with expectations and did not give much guidance in deciding whether the employment report was overstated.
Still, the report curbed anxieties about wage pressures that the job report had rekindled.
"Basically economic growth is moderate," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "Even more important, inflation is very subdued and there doesn't seem to be worsening wage-price pressures. This report gives us the peace of mind that we all needed after last Friday's jolt."
Today, the market turns its attention to the Government's reports on producer prices in February. Mr. Sohn said the market was expecting little change in the Producer Price Index, which measures the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers. The Government reports on February consumer prices tomorrow.
"The bottom line today is that earlier this week market participants were concerned about the Fed raising rates because of the strong economy," Mr. Sohn said. "That fear has subsided. Now the hope of further cuts in interest rates is regaining momentum given the subdued inflation in the beige book."
Still, he added, "You'll need a strong heart to stay through this market."
In other market activity, the Treasury sold $9 billion of 42-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.11 percent, a higher rate than the three-month maturity at this week's regular bill auction on Monday, which saw the average rate down to 4.95 percent. The bills were sold to raise cash to pay a cash-management bill maturing today.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of the new 42-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Canada, Backed by Mexico, Protests to U.S. on Cuba Sanctions

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
In a sign of the growing tensions between the United States and its trading partners over stepped-up American sanctions against Cuba, Canada said today that it had lodged a trade protest with the Clinton Administration, and Mexico immediately asked to join Canadian-American discussions on the issue.
Responding to a new American law that seeks to tighten the economic vise on Cuba by putting pressure on other countries not to do business with Fidel Castro's Government, Canada said it asked for consultations with the United States under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Canada has extensive trade with Cuba, and has vigorously protested what it sees as unfair efforts by the United States to penalize Canadian companies and business executives who operate there.
Canadian officials said the law, sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, both Republicans, and signed on Tuesday by President Clinton, could violate the free trade agreement in several ways.
In Ottawa, Canada's Trade Minister, Arthur Eggleton, said his Government would "seek clarification of U.S. intentions" in introducing the bill.
"Canada finds objectionable the Helms-Burton bill, which could interfere with companies engaged in legitimate business and which attempts to extend U.S. law to other jurisdictions," Mr. Eggleton said.
Mexican officials, expressing similar misgivings, said they supported the Canadian action, and wanted to take part in the consultations to get a clearer idea how the United States would carry out the legislation's most contentious measures.
A request for consultations is the first step in resolving trade disputes under Nafta, and could lead to a formal ruling on whether the American legislation violates the pact.
The legislation was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton after the downing of two small civilian aircraft by Cuban fighters last month. Among other things, it allows American citizens to sue foreigners and foreign companies that "act to manage, lease, possess, use or hold an interest in" property confiscated by the Cuban Government from people who are now American citizens.
It also permits the United States to bar entry to foreign corporate officers and controlling shareholders who take part in using such property and foreign executives whose companies do business in Cuba.
The United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, said the American position "is entirely consistent" with both the rules of Nafta and the world trade talks.
In an interview, Mr. Kantor said that under the trade agreement the United States reserved the right to protect its security interests and to bar from entry people who have committed crimes of moral turpitude under United States laws.
"The combination of those two, or either standing alone depending on the situation, would support our position," Mr. Kantor said.
Federico Salas, the minister for political affairs at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said, "The Canadians have taken the initiative and we have requested to participate in these consultations." The European Union said last week that the law would "represent the extraterritorial application of U.S. jurisdiction and would restrict E.U. trade in goods and services with Cuba."
Russia also objected to provisions in the law linking American foreign aid to Russia to Moscow's cutting its military and economic ties to Mr. Castro.

HEADLINE: New York City's Newest

 BODY:
New York City has heard warnings throughout its history about the burdens of its large population of immigrants. New estimates from the Census Bureau, showing migration patterns in and out of the city in the first half of the 1990's, may well reinforce fears that a rising flood of arrivals from foreign countries will increase the cost of schools and social services while the city's tax base keeps eroding. Examined more carefully, however, the patterns of immigration yield a strikingly more hopeful portrait. In fact, the influx of foreigners in the city is enhancing its economic vitality and rescuing whole neighborhoods from decline.
The large number of new immigrants, especially those from Asia and the Caribbean, are everywhere evident in New York City. But immigration levels were much higher in the past. The City Planning Department estimates that half the city's population is foreign-born or descended from a foreign-born parent, compared with nearly 80 percent in that category earlier this century. 
 Starting in the 1950's, the trend of upper- and middle-class people, especially whites, fleeing the city while the poor flood in has indeed eroded the city's tax base. But that pattern has changed in the last couple of decades. According to the Planning Department's population division, Puerto Ricans and native-born black citizens -- who constituted the greatest wave of newcomers in the postwar decades -- are now leaving the city in proportionately larger numbers than whites. An especially extraordinary change is taking place in the city's black population, with native-born black residents leaving the city and being replaced by immigrants from the Caribbean and elsewhere. The Planning Department estimates that about 40 percent of the city's black residents are foreign-born or descended from a foreign-born parent.
With its proud symbol of the Statue of Liberty, New York City certainly remains a beacon of freedom for refugees and the poor. But immigrants today are increasingly people with skills, entrepreneurial spirit and cohesive family structures who are less inclined to go on welfare or use public housing than current city residents. Except for Dominicans and Mexicans, all the foreign-born groups in the city have a lower percentage of people in poverty than the city's average of 19 percent. According to the Planning Department, the median household income for foreign-born black residents is more than $28,000, compared with $22,000 for native-born black residents.
Providing services to immigrants does cost the city money, particularly because they are a major factor in expanding school enrollment. But educating the children of immigrants amounts to an investment in the trained work force and taxpayers of tomorrow. There is also little doubt that many of these immigrants are working at lower wage rates than native-born New Yorkers, perhaps contributing to a stagnation or even decline in wages for native-born workers. But the work they do is also helping to keep businesses and retail outfits afloat and provide domestic help to middle-class families in which both spouses work.
New York, like other major cities, has its share of decaying neighborhoods, but think of what would have happened in many of them if there had not been immigrants. Some two million people left New York City in the 1970's, the period of its worst financial difficulties since the Depression. In that same period, 800,000 immigrants came to the city to seek opportunities. The city actually grew in size in the 1980's and is projected to grow again this decade. In neighborhood after neighborhood, immigrants have moved in, set up shops and revitalized community life.
The next time New Yorkers hear warnings of immigrants strangling its services and wrecking its economy, they should remember that the city remains a place of perhaps the greatest ethnic diversity in the United States, where immigrants of all kinds come to compete and seek opportunity. Their story is one of success for them and the city itself.

HEADLINE: Fed's Survey Finds Growth Is Moderate

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
The nation's economy grew modestly in the first two months of the year, with wages firmly in check despite an apparent spreading of labor-market tightness, a Federal Reserve survey found today.
But severe weather in the Northeast and other natural disturbances clouded the assessment. Analysts said they could find no significant difference from the preceding report issued on Jan. 17 that described the economy as "growing at a generally modest pace" in the final weeks of 1995. 
At a time when securities traders are studying every shred of economic evidence, the Fed's anecdotal survey of business conditions in all 12 of its regions prompted no discernible market reaction on its release at noon.
The question of whether a February pickup was just a bounce-back from the January blizzard or the start of something more vigorous "is not clarified at all" by the central bank's summary of the anecdotal information it solicited, mostly from the private sector, said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Signs of a pickup come from the Labor Department report last Friday of 705,000 additional jobs in February.
Some other analysts took the seemingly flat trend in today's report as a partial confirmation of suspicions that the jobs report represented a statistical fluke, overstating job gains in the rebound from January's blizzard-related decline.
"They didn't say it's better -- they said it's the same," said Lacy H. Hunt, chief United States economist at HSBC Markets in New York, referring to business activity described in the Fed's beige-book report. He noted that the economy grew at an annual rate of less than 1 percent during the fourth quarter of 1995.
Unchanged or even slightly stronger performance means "there is no resurgence in the economy actually taking place," he added.
The strong jobs report had been taken to mean that the Fed could not be expected to cut interest rates again, for fear of fueling inflation -- a perception that led to last Friday's 171-point market drop.
And even after today's report, Mr. Hunt and other analysts regard the employment figures as probably ruling out a cut in short-term rates at the Fed's next scheduled policy meeting on March 26. But he is not precluding a cut at the May session.
Leif H. Olsen, a Connecticut consultant and financial manager, also focused heavily on the discrepancy between the soundings in the beige book and the Labor Department's report of the biggest payroll expansion in more than 12 years.
"It comes much closer to telling the truth about what happened in February, continued low inflation and modest growth," Mr. Olsen said of the Fed sampling, which was prepared to aid policy makers at the coming meeting.
In its summary of the survey, assembled this time by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston based on information collected before March 4, the central bank painted the usual mixed industry and geographic picture.
"Over half the districts cite moderate economic growth or continuing solid levels of economic activity," it said. "Most of the others mention recent improvements, largely reflecting rebounds from weather-related slowdowns earlier in the year."
Manufacturing was mixed, with activity level or growing more slowly in the Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas districts, the Fed found. Retailing generally improved but the February uptick did not appear in parts of the West and Midwest where continued sluggishness was evident in San Francisco, St. Louis and Minneapolis, the report said.
One of the clearer developments was that all districts reported increased activity in residential real estate, in most cases including higher sales. But while the market for new homes has improved in the New York metropolitan area, the upstate market remained depressed by employer downsizing and "pervasive" pessimism among consumers, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Today's report found little inflation pressure even though it found "tight labor markets in several districts" compared with January's characterization of "shortages of skilled workers" in some areas.
It said wages "are reported to be increasing at a modest pace" while retail prices, if up at all, were just slightly higher. And prices of most commodities were "steady, stabilizing or increasing very little; a few are falling."
Other developments in the survey were the highest shipments in more than a decade from iron mines in the Minneapolis district, an "especially severe" drop in commercial borrowings at banks in the Cleveland district, slower business in both exports and imports at Richmond-district ports, a significant rise in European and Brazilian but not Mexican tourists in Florida and heavy drought damage to the winter wheat crop in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mostly Higher Despite Drop in Dow

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Although the Dow Jones industrial average eased yesterday, stock prices generally rose.
"The Dow has been outperforming the general market so far this year, so the day's correction was due," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist of Everen Securities. "Evidence was building of gradual economic strengthening and less chance that the Fed will cut interest rates later this month." 
 One such piece of evidence came yesterday when the Federal Reserve issued its so-called beige book report showing moderate growth in the economy during the last two months. This report will be a major focus when the Fed's policy-setting committee meets on March 26 to discuss rates.
In yesterday's mixed market performance, the Dow Jones industrials declined 15.17 points, to 5,568.72, but the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 1.46 points, to 638.55, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index jumped 15.59 points -- or almost 1 1/2 percent -- to 1,088.64.
Advances far exceeded declines on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,536 to 884. Turnover on the Big Board was 413 million shares, down from the 461.5 million shares traded on Tuesday and even below the most recent three-month daily trading average of about 423 million shares.
Technology stocks surged amid the perception by traders that the economy was not likely to wilt in 1996. Microsoft, which was upgraded by Merrill Lynch, increased 5 1/8, to 100 7/8; I.B.M. rose 1 5/8, to 115 7/8; Compaq gained 3/4, to 37 3/4, and Hewlett-Packard advanced 1, to 94 3/4. The Morgan Stanley high-tech index was up 6.79 points, to 320.33.
Oil service issues once again enjoyed investor attention, as gasoline inventories plunged to a two-month low. Schlumberger closed at 78, up 3 1/2; Halliburton closed at 56 1/4, up 3; Dresser Industries closed at 28 7/8, up 1 1/8, and Baker Hughes closed at 27 7/8, up 1 5/8.
Machine tool stocks also benefitted from the anticipation of an economic pickup. Cincinnati Milicron advanced 5/8, to 28 3/8, and Giddings & Lewis climbed 1, to 18 3/8.
However, tobacco stocks plunged on the news that the Brooke Group's Liggett unit had agreed to settle a class-action suit over nicotine addiction. Philip Morris, which fell 4 3/8, to 98, was responsible for more than 12 points of the drop in the Dow. Other decliners included RJR Nabisco, off 1, to 33 7/8; American Brands, off 3/4, to 44, and UST, off 1/2, to 34 5/8. In contrast, Brooke soared 1 1/2, to 9 7/8.
Drug issues slumped, as portfolio managers rotated their funds into cyclical sectors. Merck declined 1 1/2, to 61 5/8; Pfizer dropped 1 3/4, to 62; Eli Lilly gave up 1 1/4, to 62 1/4, and Schering-Plough fell 7/8, to 58 3/8.
Some alcoholic beverage companies were also lower. Anheuser-Busch closed at 65 3/8, down 2 1/4, and Brown-Forman class B shares closed at 38 1/8, down 3/8.
Two big retailers moved into plus territory on favorable news. J. C. Penney increased 1 1/4, to 50 1/4, after raising its dividend by more than 8 percent. And Toys "R" Us advanced 1 5/8, to 27 5/8, after telling analysts that management was optimistic about this year's profits.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: LOOKING FORWARD;
With Dole Cashing In, Both Sides Say All Bets Are Off for Fall

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 13

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole's emergence as the likely Republican nominee has led both parties to re-evaluate just how much of an advantage, if any, President Clinton would have over him in November.
Prominent Democrats who had expected Mr. Clinton to coast to re-election say they are beginning to reconsider Mr. Dole now that he is having some success putting the bruising primary battle behind him after his sweep of Florida, Texas and five other states on Tuesday. 
 "These things have an ebb and flow, and right now the flow is that Dole's going to get his day in the sun a little bit," said James Carville, a strategist for Mr. Clinton. "I've detected too much Democratic glee for my taste right now."
But one who is still gleeful is Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. "Dole is a substantially weakened opponent as a result of his performance in the primaries," he said. "His inability to articulate -- period -- is indelibly printed on people's minds."
Though it is in their interest to present a united front, even Republicans who for months fretted that Mr. Dole was no match for Mr. Clinton are now tempering their concerns.
With the outcome of the primaries essentially a foregone conclusion, Mr. Dole, who was prone to stumbling on the campaign trail, can now spend more time in an atmosphere that better suits him: the well of the Senate. Mr. Dole's advisers said the Senator would now play to his strengths as majority leader and emphasize issues like the budget, overhauling welfare and cutting taxes as he casts Mr. Clinton as failing to deliver to the American people.
"Clinton's trying to run against a do-nothing Congress," said Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, "so we'll make the case that we're running against a do-nothing President."
Mr. Clinton, who does not share Mr. Dole's talents as a legislative mechanic but is considered a more adept campaigner, is doing his best to stay above the political fray. His staff continues to push back the date that Mr. Clinton will formally announce his re-election campaign. And one after another, White House aides refuse to be quoted publicly sizing up Mr. Dole.
But privately, strategists on both sides say they are preparing for a hard-fought contest, and they discount polls that for months have put Mr. Clinton ahead in a one-on-one matchup. One uncertainty is that with the primary season ending far earlier this year than usual, and the national conventions not beginning until late August, the contours of the election could greatly change, and change again, before November.
"It's natural for Dole to look pretty damaged at this point -- he has just run the gauntlet and been paddled like a fraternity brother," said Charles E. Cook Jr., a nonpartisan analyst. "But eight months is a lifetime. I think this thing is going to get real close."
This much is certain: Americans generally sound dissatisfied with both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole. Forty percent of Republican voters and 46 percent of Democrats said they would like to see a third-party candidate in the race, according to a CBS News poll of 1,265 adults nationwide conducted on Sunday and Monday.
In fact, several recent polls offer signs of the strengths and weaknesses of both candidates. The surveys show that people continue to have doubts about Mr. Clinton's leadership skills and his character, though they like him more than they did a year ago, and are generally more upbeat about the economy.
By contrast, voters are concerned that at age 72, Mr. Dole may lack the stamina to be an effective President, and they are concerned that he has no vision. Still, voters generally consider Mr. Dole's longtime experience in Government a plus.
Florida, where Mr. Dole won an overwhelming 57 percent of the vote on Tuesday, is an important testing ground for the relative strengths and weaknesses of both men. While President George Bush won this state in 1992, the margin was small, and Democrats are beginning a major effort to win here in November.
A recent Mason-Dixon poll in Florida found that after months in which Mr. Dole was well ahead, Mr. Clinton has risen to the point where he and the Senator are in a statistical dead heat. Yet there are signs that this fresh strength will not last.
"Unfortunately for Clinton, both the G.O.P. squabbling and voters' interest in it are likely to diminish considerably now that Dole is overwhelmingly favored to win the G.O.P. nod," said Robert Joffee, a vice president of Mason-Dixon, a national polling company.
Another possible trouble spot for Mr. Clinton is Texas, which he also lost in 1992. Two statewide polls released last week show that Mr. Dole holds a substantial lead over Mr. Clinton in the state, even among self-described Democrats.
One close adviser to Mr. Clinton, speaking on the condition on anonymity, said that while the President was a better campaigner, Mr. Dole would "play this whole thing of experience and maturity and solidity."
The adviser added: "With a fairly good economy, what's left to go after? The character issue."
The Republicans are viewed as having some advantages in amassing the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. For one thing, Mr. Clinton won several Southern and Western states in 1992, like Georgia, Louisiana and Colorado, that strategists say he may have trouble hanging onto because voters in those states perceive that he has moved to the left since he was elected.
And even if Mr. Clinton wins California, he will likely need to capture the industrial heartland -- states like Ohio, Illinois and Michigan -- which vote in primaries next Tuesday and are increasingly Republican havens.
The CBS News poll found that 63 percent of all voters see Mr. Dole as losing against Mr. Clinton in November. If there is a two-candidate race, Republican voters are split over their expected outcome, with 49 percent saying Mr. Dole will win, and 43 percent viewing the President as likely to prevail.
The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, also found that 69 percent consider Mr. Dole's three-decade career in Washington a positive factor, while only 21 percent said it was a drawback.
But in a finding that could be damaging to Mr. Dole, many people who voted in Florida and Texas on Tuesday said they were fairly distrustful of the Federal Government. Sixty percent of Floridians and 68 percent of Texans said they see the Government as trustworthy only some of the time.
Although he says Mr. Dole's weaknesses are significant, even Mr. Mellman, the Democratic strategist, expects the race to tighten. "It's still likely to be a close race," he said, "because they usually are in a country that's pretty evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans."

HEADLINE: Census Sees a Profound Ethnic Shift in U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
 Fueled by immigration and higher birth rates among Hispanic women, the United States is undergoing a profound demographic shift, and by the middle of the next century only about half of the population will be non-Hispanic whites, the Census Bureau predicted today.
By 2050, the bureau said, immigration patterns and differences in birth rates, combined with an overall slowdown in growth the country's population, will produce a United States in which 53 percent of the people will be non-Hispanic whites, down from 74 percent today. 
 In contrast, Hispanic people will make up 24.5 per cent of the population, up from the current 10.2 percent, and Asians will make up 8.2 percent, an increase from the current 3.3 percent. The percentage of the black population will remain relatively stable, rising to about 13.6 percent by the year 2050 from the current 12 percent.
The population as a whole will rise to about 394 million from 262 million, an increase of 50 percent, the bureau said. Even with that increase, it added, the country would be going through some of the most sluggish population growth in its history.
Over all, the report suggests that the United States is experiencing one of the most dramatic shifts in its racial and ethnic makeup since the trade in slaves transformed the racial composition of the South and the waves of immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave an ethnic flavor to industrialized urban areas of the Northeast and Midwest.
"The world is not going to be the same in 30 years as it is now," said Gregory Spencer, director of the Population Projections Branch at the bureau. To put the growth rates of the Asian and Hispanic population in perspective, the report noted that the two groups were expected to have annual growth rates of 2 percent to the year 2030. In comparison, even at the zenith of the Baby Boom, the country as a whole never grew by 2 percent a year.
The report, "Population Projections of the United States by Age, Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin: 1995 to 2050," noted that its projections were simply projections. Changes in legislation regarding immigration, changes in fertility rates, and breakthroughs in medical care that could extend life expectancy could alter future estimates.
Though the United States is the fastest-growing country in the industrialized world, the report indicated that the nation was about to embark on a sharp slowdown in the rate of its population increases. Indeed, the report said that after 2025, the United States would grow at a slower rate than any time in its history, mainly because of declining birth rates and an increased number of deaths as the population ages.
But with that slowdown will come more diversity, a phenomenon that will present a host of new economic business and social issues. For example, the report noted that by the year 2030, the non-Hispanic white population would make up less than half of the people under the age of 18, but three-fourths of those over 65.
Given this, questions of the mix of tax revenues distributed to public education or Social Security or Medicare could easily take on a racial and ethnic tinge.
"You might have somewhat poorer Hispanics being asked to pay for the benefits of relatively well-off white Baby Boomers," said William H. Frey, a research scientist with the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan. "It's not clear what the political dynamic of that will be. It may not just be the boomers verses the busters."
The Census Bureau report is likely to fuel the debate over immigration.
The report's population-growth projections are, in part, based on an annual net increase in immigrants -- both legal and illegal -- of 820,000. Both the Clinton Administration and Republican sponsors of bills being debated in Congress support changes in the immigration law that would reduce legal immigration by about one-third. Leaders of both parties advocate vigorous efforts against illegal immigration.
Much of the debate has focused on whether immigrants take jobs from unemployed citizens but its subtext concerns population growth in general and ethnic diversity in particular.
Organizations such as the Carrying Capacity Network and Negative Population Growth and the Federation for American Immigration Reform argue that immigration should be curbed because the country is approaching its limit in terms of a manageable population.
Dan Stein, executive director of the federation group, said: "The most important part of the story is that this is happening and no one has asked the country is this what we want. Do we really want another 100 million people?"
For their part, pro-immigration organizations say the country can accommodate a higher population with little difficulty. They say they fear their opponents are worried not about the number of added residents, but rather their ethnic backgrounds. "We are all against illegal immigration," said Lisa Navarete, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights group. "And when it comes to legal immigration, we are not being flooded with people."
The Census Bureau reports indicate that the number of births to non-Hispanic whites is expected to drop throughout the rest of this decade and begin a slow rise in the next century. In contrast, births to women of Hispanic and Asian descent are projected to more than triple by the year 2050.
In addition to higher birth rates, the median age for these groups is younger than for non-Hispanic whites and, as a result, they have more women of child-bearing age. Cultural mores relating to family size also come into play. For example the fertility rate of Hispanic-American women born in Mexico is 147 births per 1,000 women, much higher than that of non-Hispanic whites and of Hispanic women born elsewhere in Latin America.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Planning could help in upheavals like the arms industry cutback.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
OUT of sight, out of mind? The virtual collapse of Southern California's mighty arms industry, with the largest regional job losses since the Great Depression, is no longer on the national radar screens. Unemployment in Los Angeles County has edged down to 8.6 percent today from 9.4 percent in 1994. Besides, downsizing is hardly a problem unique to Southern California or to military contractors: the drive for enhanced productivity is hitting every big business from banking to textiles to retailing.
But planning specialists at Rutgers University's Project on Regional and Industrial Economics and the nonprofit Economic Roundtable in California argue that the long road back for Los Angeles offers lessons that should not be ignored. For one thing, said Ann Markusen of Rutgers, it says a lot about what sort of government intervention works in coping with economic dislocation. It also underscores the risks in leaving the military-industrial complex intact -- arguably even stronger -- after consolidation. "If the contractors don't diversify, you'll end up with even more pork in the defense budget," she said. 
 While just about everyone knows that Los Angeles took a hit from Pentagon cutbacks, few people who don't live there understand the magnitude. The county with the most military-related production lost roughly half of its high-paying military-related jobs from 1990 to 1995. What's more, the Rutgers-Economic Roundtable's newly released report, "Post Cold War Frontiers: Defense Downsizing and Conversion in Los Angeles," estimates that contractors' revenues fell to $10.2 billion in 1994 from $16.8 billion in 1988
Adding to the county's woes, the Pentagon cuts came amid a broader regional decline driven by high land and housing costs, tightening environmental regulation and festering inner-city problems. Indeed, the authors argue that the big military buildup of the Carter-Reagan years masked serious weaknesses in the regional economy -- weaknesses that had already hollowed out the manufacturing base of older American cities.
The prevailing wisdom in Los Angeles -- and Washington -- is that Southern California neglected the basics of capitalist hygiene. After decades of living well off Federal largesse and the natural attractions of the region, local government lost sight of what keeps free enterprise healthy. From this perspective, what Los Angeles needs is less regulation, lower taxes and improvements in infrastructure that help business.
And how do military contractors fit into this picture? Hazily, if at all. They are the equivalent of dying Soviet enterprises, clumsy dinosaurs that evolved to satisfy the needs of a single and increasingly reluctant client. Seen through this lens, the policy of encouraging mergers among arms companies offers the tidiest way of coping with a long-term liability to the regional economy.
But the evidence, the authors of the report argue, suggests a more complex picture. Among the big contractors, Rockwell, GM Hughes and TRW have been relatively successful at converting production capacity to civilian use. Hughes, for example, is broadening its base in communications satellites, while TRW is pressing ahead in advanced vehicle and highway systems.
It is no coincidence, the authors say, that all four had substantial experience producing for nonmilitary markets. By contrast, Northrop Grumman, McDonnell-Douglas and Litton are consolidating capacity and jobs to remain specialized military contractors.
To the Rutgers-Economic Roundtable group, the message is clear: what's needed is smarter government, not less. Carefully planned state and Federal subsidies can preserve high-paying jobs and diversify the local economy. Nothing could be more counterproductive, they say, than the Pentagon's enthusiasm for mergers as a means of cutting military production capacity.
Consolidation will lead to even less competition among military suppliers. Worse, perhaps, it will strengthen the hand of liberal and conservative politicians alike who have come to treat military spending as a jobs program. Consider, Ms. Markusen says, the successful lobbying to continue production of Northrop Grumman's B-2 bomber, an incredibly expensive weapon designed to mop up secondary targets after a nuclear cataclysm.
Are they right? Regional planning -- in particular, economic planning -- is a hard sell in America, and not without reason. By some interpretations, one great strength of the economy is its capacity for unplanned self-renewal. No one in Washington, after all, decided to replant the orchards around San Jose in silicon.
But the era in which rapid economic growth and mobility covered a multitude of social sins may be coming to an end. Americans may not be good at planning economic change. But then again they aren't good at living with the insecurity and waste of the upheavals of the last few decades.

HEADLINE: Pension Insurance Fund Deficit Is at Its Lowest Level Since 1981

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
The deficit in the Government's single-employer pension insurance fund fell by $925 million last year to the lowest level since 1981, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation announced today.
In its annual report to Congress, the Government's pension insurance agency attributed the improvement to a record $2 billion in investment earnings and to the fact that no major pension plan was terminated. 
 "The Federal insurance program protecting pensions of the nation's work force has been restored to a level of financial strength unseen in more than a decade," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, the agency's board chairman, said in a statement.
The program insures about 33 million pensions in plans sponsored by a single employer and covers about one-third of the nation's work force.
Still, Mr. Reich noted that the decline in the insurance agency's deficit reflected economic conditions that were subject to change, and said, "We must view this improvement with caution, remaining vigilant in assuring a sound pension system."
The deficit in the single-employer program was $315 million, the difference between assets of $10.4 billion and liabilities of $10.7 billion. It was the smallest imbalance since the gap between assets and liabilities was $189 million in 1981.
The deficit totaled $1.24 billion in 1994, after peaking at $2.9 billion in 1993.
The pension agency also reported that its multi-employer program covering nine million people had a net surplus of $192 million last year.
The agency said its improved financial condition mirrored a similar gain among the pension plans it insures. Inadequate funding of such plans dropped to about $31 billion from $71 billion a year earlier.
The agency paid about $763 million in benefits to more than 182,000 people whose companies had failed to honor their payments last year, an increase of about 5 percent from 1994.
It said it received $860 million in revenue from the insurance premiums paid by companies with covered pension plans. The agency receives no funds from general tax revenues.
Including those people receiving benefits, the agency was responsible for the pensions of about 392,000 workers in 2,094 terminated pension plans.

HEADLINE: As Albany Cuts Funds, Lobbies Spend More

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 13

 BODY:
Scrambling to save their piece of the shrinking state budget, corporations and interest groups spent $46.9 million to lobby state government in New York last year, a 17 percent increase over 1994 and the largest rise in nearly two decades, a state commission said today.
Hospitals and other health-care providers were among those at the top of the list, in large part because they undertook expensive efforts to beat back Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to reduce the state's Medicaid costs. Unions for state workers and teachers, which feared layoffs and cuts in money for education, also made large expenditures. 
 The Greater New York Hospital Association was first at $1.18 million, and the Health Care Association of New York State was fourth at $1.04 million. After their lobbying of legislators and their buying of television and other advertising to attack budget cuts, Mr. Pataki's proposed reduction in the state's Medicaid bill last year was pared from nearly $1.5 billion to $700 million.
The increased spending stirred new calls for reform of New York's lobbying laws, which have changed little in decades and are more lax than those of many states. It also focused attention on the rise in lobbying in state capitals nationwide, which until recent years was far less sophisticated than the lobbying campaigns mounted in Washington.
Ten years ago, corporations, unions and other interest groups spent $15.1 million on lobbying state government officials in New York, less than one third the amount spent last year, according to the New York Temporary State Commission on Lobbying.
That money typically went to pay lawyers who glad-handed legislators in the back rooms of the Capitol or tried to sway their opinions over a leisurely lunch. But with governors seeking to squeeze budgets and the Republicans who control Congress fighting to give greater responsibilities to state governments, lobbying tactics at the state level in New York and many other states are growing more aggressive.
These days, for example, state lobbyists buy television ads, something that was unheard of just a few years ago.
One study found that between 1980 and 1990, the number of interest groups lobbying at the state level nearly doubled, to an average of about 620 per state, said Prof. Michael J. Malbin, director of the Center for Legislative Studies at the Rockefeller Institute in Albany.
"Since Ronald Reagan became President there has been more emphasis on policy making at the state level," Mr. Malbin said. "So, more people have a stake in trying to track what's going on and trying to influence it. And the proliferation of interest groups at the national level has made it easier for them to replicate and to decentralize when it became time to do so."
Instead of just talking to legislators, lobbyists here and in other state capitals are devoting a significant chunk of their lobbying budget to advertisements that are intended to get the public to pressure state officials. Much of the money spent by health-care groups last year, for example, was funneled to television commercials that sought to raise alarms about Mr. Pataki's cuts.
The lobbying commission said that expenditures for advertising rose from about $250,000 in 1994 to more than $6 million last year.
The third-ranking group on the lobbying commission's list, AT&T, spent $1.16 million, mostly on advertisements that focused on influencing a State Public Service Commission debate on rates for Nynex. AT&T was concerned that the commission would allow Nynex to set high rates that would keep AT&T out of the regional telephone market, said David E. Roos, AT&T's lobbyist in Albany.
Officials of the state lobbying commission said that the increase in television advertising was one reason that the lobbying expenditures of four groups reached more than $1 million last year for the first time. The total last year for all groups was $46.9 million, up from $39.1 million in 1994, which, adjusted for inflation, represents a 17 percent increase.
Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents 174 hospitals and nursing homes in the New York City area, said that the push to cut health-care costs had forced his group to protect itself. It concentrated much of its money on advertising, he said.
"The hospital community is being clobbered by budget cuts and proposed budget cuts both in Albany and in Washington," he said. "From our point of view, we would prefer not to spend this money. The problem is that given that these issues are so enormous, the only thing that we can do is go to the public and let them know what it is about."
Morris H. Klein, chairman of the state lobbying commission, said that last year, 1,156 interest groups registered with the commission, up from 1,099 in 1994. Mr. Klein and several organizations that lobby for government reform used the announcement of the expenditures to press the Legislature to revamp the state's lobbying laws.
Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, called the increase in lobbying last year staggering.
Mr. Horner said that the Legislature should strengthen the powers of the lobbying commission, which it established in 1977 as a temporary agency and whose authority it must renew periodically. He said New York should follow other states and ban campaign contributions by interest groups that also lobby heavily.
He pointed out that lobbying by groups at the top of the commission's list carried more weight because of their campaign contributions. The state teachers' union, for example, spent $1.17 million on lobbying and $402,000 on campaign contributions. The Health Care Asssociation of New York State channeled $112,000 into campaign contributions, in addition to its $1.04 million on lobbying.
"We have among the weakest laws restricting lobbying practices in the country," Mr. Horner said. "Twenty states restrict lobbyists' ability to make campaign contributions. The nation is way ahead of New York."

HEADLINE: Grass-Roots Fight Emerges on Hospital Plan

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani selected the first city-run hospitals to be put up for sale, he chose three that were considered the most marketable. Because they were in neighborhoods with medical alternatives, they were also considered the least likely to generate community opposition, or so his advisers told him.
What the officials did not anticipate was that advocates for the hospitals -- Coney Island Hospital, Queens Hospital Center and Elmhurst Hospital Center -- would rise up to fight the sales. 
 The Community Advisory Board of the Queens Hospital Center in Jamaica, the most vociferous of the opponents, has filed a lawsuit to prevent the sale. Twenty-five Brooklyn groups have formed a coalition that has held half a dozen rallies as well as monthly meetings in an effort to keep Coney Island Hospital in public hands. The Elmhurst Hospital Community Advisory Board in Queens has developed a proposal calling for it to become independent.
The effectiveness of the grass-roots protests is difficult to gauge, but by most accounts they have proved to be one more stumbling block to the Mayor's troubled attempts to sell or lease to private operators some or all of the city's 11 municipal hospitals. With Mount Sinai withdrawing from the bidding process on Tuesday, and a suit filed last week by the City Council over the sales, neighborhood groups have redoubled their effort to lobby elected officials to oppose privatization of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates the city hospitals.
"It was a morale booster," said Peg Graham, executive director of the Campaign to Save Our Hospitals, a Manhattan-based group of clergy and civic and union leaders formed two years ago to help communities organize against hospital privatization. "It gives us reason to do more lobbying and targeting of our City Council members so that when they do win their lawsuit and vote on privatization, they will stop the Mayor."
She added that Mount Sinai's withdrawal underscores the group's concerns about the lack of a comprehensive plan, including the economics of privatization and how to provide care.
Assemblyman William Scarborough, coordinator of Friends of Queens Hospital Center, the advisory board's fund-raising arm, summed up opponents' prevailing view.
"There is no guarantee that the poor will not be refused hospital care," Mr. Scarborough said. "They will be out in the streets. The scary thing is what's happening to the economy with downsizing and privatization, you have the potential for a crisis that could hurt every segment of society."
The fight at Queens Hospital, a deteriorating 20-acre complex whose future is the most threatened by a change of hand, began as soon as the Mayor announced his proposal in February 1995. Rory I. Lancman, chairman of the hospital's advisory board, was then a 25-year-old student at the Columbia University School of Law. He bowed out of his statutory interpretation class after hearing word, dashed to the computer lab, fired off a press release and headed to City Hall to attend the Mayor's news conference.
Vowing to fight the proposal "with every fiber of our being," Mr. Lancman filed a suit last September charging that the Giuliani administration failed to comply with the law by not consulting with advisory board members. The suit, now under appeal, was dismissed on the ground that such boards have no policy-making power. About 100 supporters showed up at a January dinner dance in St. Albans, raising $6,000 for the court battle.
All 11 of the city's hospital advisory boards, whose purpose is to safeguard the interests of their communities, have joined the appeals effort, contending that they have a right to inclusion and information in the privatization process.
For its part, the City Council suit charges that the administration has declined to provide specifics about how the city would care for indigent and uninsured patients. It also addresses a larger issue. The Giuliani administration, which says the hospitals would be managed more effectively if removed from city government, argues that the Mayor has the power to sell the hospitals; the Council disagrees.
"This definitely bolsters our case," Mr. Lancman, now a lawyer at a Wall Street firm, said of the City Council suit. "There has been a lot of secrecy surrounding this, and we are entitled to know the answer to numerous questions, which City Hall has so far failed to answer."
Speaking for the administration, Jeffrey D. Friedlander, first assistant Corporation Counsel, which represents the city in the suit, said that "consulting will be done at the right time" and noted that the administration is just as concerned with providing good health care as the City Council and the Queens Hospital advisory board.
Queens Hospital treats 325,000 patients each year, nearly 40 percent of them uninsured. Most patients come from the largely middle-class southeast part of Queens, which has pockets of poverty and a large Caribbean and South Asian immigrant population. An imposing hodge-podge of brick buildings straddling the border of Flushing and Jamaica, it has been scheduled for renovation for 20 years, but plans were scrapped last summer because of the fiscal crisis.
Many health analysts believe that, because of its proximity to Elmhurst Hospital, which is newly renovated and duplicates some services, Queens Hospital would be better downsized or even eliminated. The advisory board's virulent opposition can be partly attributed to the specter of lost jobs and a threat to the very existence of the hospital. A hard-nosed private hospital, considering the Elmhurst-Queens package, might just decide to do away with much of Queens.
Last year, Elmhurst Hospital, which is in the final phase of a three-year, $250 million renovation, treated 534,000 patients, only 7 percent of them uninsured. Its board has proposed to city officials that the hospital become a not-for-profit, self-governing facility, independent of the city as well as any other hospital.
It is Coney Island Hospital, widely considered well run and well maintained, that is thought to be the most marketable of the three. Last year, it treated 412,000 patients, 36 percent of them uninsured, in a primarily working-class population.
But opposition has been strong in Coney Island, where the hospital is seen as a centerpiece to the neighborhood, with its elderly patrons and burgeoning population of Russian Jews and people from Caribbean nations. Both the Coney Island Hospital Advisory Board and the area's community board have passed resolutions opposing privatization.
A coalition of community groups, ranging from Jewish organizations to senior centers, have been actively campaigning against the proposed sale, holding demonstrations, distributing fliers, shooting off letters to public officials.
Georganna Deas, 47, president of Coney Island Pride, a seven-year-old community organization, has been using the hospital's services for 25 years. An unemployed maintenance worker with no health insurance, she is fearful about the hospital's future not only for herself but for others like her. As reinforcement for her case, she pointed to the area's sprawling housing projects.
"We are the working poor, and I'm concerned that we won't have this type of ongoing care," said Ms. Deas. "Emergency care is not enough for people with AIDS. We feel like we are in a precarious situation and we are afraid."
The city has encountered such community resistance before: In 1980, the closing of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem led to sit-ins and clashes with the police, although it was long thought to be the most costly, inefficient and unnecessary hospital in the municipal system.
To many residents, hospitals are valued just as places where the bones of their children have been reset after a fall on a bicycle, and where sick relatives have been nursed back to health.
Audrey Orr, 69, of Hollis, has been a member of the Queens Hospital Advisory board for 21 years. She had a severe asthmatic attack in 1963 and was pronounced dead. But a tracheotomy in the emergency room allowed air to flow into her lungs.
"This hospital has a lot of memories for me," Mrs. Orr, a retired I.B.M. data processor said. "Privatization is not going to do anything whatsoever. No one has indicated who will take care of the indigents. They are trying to play Russian roulette with the lives of the people of our community."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN EGYPT: THE OVERVIEW;
World Leaders Join in a Condemnation of Terrorism

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SHARM EL SHEIK, Egypt, March 13

 BODY:
Invoking the solemn shared history of three religions, leaders of 27 nations, including a broad swath of the Arab world, joined today in a sweeping condemnation of the recent suicide bombings in Israel and vowed to cooperate in fighting terrorism and promoting peace throughout the Middle East.
In a hastily organized one-day meeting sponsored by the United States and Egypt at this Red Sea resort, President Clinton and leaders from countries as diverse as Russia, Saudi Arabia, Japan and the Western European powers pledged to work together to prevent terrorist organizations from recruiting members, raising funds or supplying arms on their soil, and to share training and equipment "to cooperate in cutting them off." 
 "We are at a watershed," Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel said at the meeting, which amounted to a giant show of support for his peacemaking efforts. "Our region is going through a period of transition. The dark days are at an end. The shadows of its past are lengthening. The twilight of wars is still red with blood, yet its sunset is inevitable and imminent."
By almost any measure, it was a landmark event, if largely symbolic, drawing presidents and prime ministers together with sheiks, princes and kings from 14 Arab nations from North Africa to the Persian Gulf, whose mere presence in the same room with an Israeli Prime Minister would been unthinkable not so long ago. Today they raised their linked hands aloft with his.
Indeed, this scuba-diving port at the tip of Sinai was the staging area for Egypt's blockade of the Strait of Tiran before the 1967 war with Israel, yet today bikini-clad sunbathers shared the sand and sidewalks with the parade of dignitiaries.
But there were cracks in the facade of solidarity. Two of the most important countries in the region, Syria and Lebanon, declined invitations altogether. And the Saudi delegate, whose presence and handshake with Mr. Peres was praised by American officials as the most significant appearance of the day, mixed his condemnation of the attacks on Israeli civilians with a sharp warning against over-broad retaliation against Palestinians.
"Collective punishment, closure and every type of violence against innocent people will in turn generate more violence," said the Saudi Foreign Minister, Saud al-Faisal, referring to Israel's sealing of border settlements in the wake of the bombings, which have killed 62 people, including the bombers, since Feb. 25.
Later, Mr. Clinton and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt took pains to say they believed the closings would not be long-lasting, and Mr. Clinton justified the measures as reasonable "at a time when it's hard to tell who may be wrapped in plastique" explosives. The communique the two men issued at day's end said the participants had agreed to continue both economic and political support for the peace effort, "with special attention to the current and pressing economic needs of the Palestinians."
Mr. Clinton expressed disappointment at Syria's absence, but dismissed it as "part of a general pattern of going their own way." He acknowledged that today's meeting was only a first step and insisted, "You can focus on what didn't happen today, but if you do, it will blind you to what has happened, which no one would have conceived of happening even a few months ago."
For his part, Yasir Arafat, the president of the Palestinian Authority, vowed "that we are confronting and will continue to confront terrorism and to uproot it from our land, because our dream of freedom, independence and self-determination cannot bear fruit and be realized amid a sea of blood and tears."
After the meeting, Mr. Arafat told reporters that "the Israelis informed us that there has been a partial lift of the security cordon and we hope that during the next few days there will be a total lift of the blockade."
Senior Clinton Administration officials said the mere fact of the meeting and the diversity of its cast were its principal achievements.
"Israel and many of these Arab countries haven't worked on anything openly and above the table," one American official said.
The gathering also had the effect of bolstering Mr. Peres's sagging political standing as he heads into elections back home at the end of May, and of burnishing Mr. Clinton's foreign policy in the face of his own re-election challenge. Again and again today, Mr. Clinton heard the other leaders praise him as a statesman and peacemaker in the most glowing terms.
Just what practical results the meeting will produce is another question. This afternoon, the White House announced that the State Department's special Middle East envoy, Dennis Ross, would convene the first working session of the group's anti-terrorism efforts in about two weeks in the United States, to discuss the details of cooperation and report back to the participants in 30 days.
Mr. Clinton is to hold more talks with Israeli officials in Jerusalem on Thursday on how the United States can more effectively share intelligence about terrorism with countries throughout the region, and Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John M. Deutch, are to hold further talks on Friday.
Today's meeting, under a crystalline sky on a seaside plain where the mountains of Sinai plunge down to the sea, mixed high pageantry and symbolism with a carnival air.
Sinai is rich with the region's shared cultural and religious history and most of the leaders made reference to those traditions -- Jewish, Christian and Islamic. Mr. Clinton recalled Moses' receipt of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, Mr. Peres cited biblical injunctions against violence and Mr. Arafat declared that Muslim teachings rejected both suicide and murder.
"I'm not going to say it was one big love-in," an American official said of the meeting. "But these kinds of symbols can't be overestimated at this point."
On the way to Egypt, Mr. Clinton shared one potent American symbol of his own with King Hussein of Jordan, giving him an 11-hour ride on Air Force 1. The King, who by coincidence had been visiting the United States and who is a certified jet pilot, compared the Boeing 747 with his own L-1011, allowing that Mr. Clinton's plane had "more power and thrust," said the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry.
"He was in the cockpit for takeoff, but did not attempt to wrest control from the United States Air Force, which was probably wise on the King's part," Mr. McCurry said.

Hamas Defends Bombings
 JERUSALEM, March 13 (By The New York Times) -- Thrown on the defensive by the show of international resolve to fight terrorism at the summit meeting in Egypt, the militant Islamic group Hamas sought to justify its bombingstoday, calling it legitimate resistance to Israeli occupation.
In a memorandum addressed to world leaders gathered at Sharm el Sheik, Hamas asserted that its recent suicide bombings were aimed at soldiers and that civilian casualties were "unintentional," adding that it was prepared to cooperate with efforts to broker a cease-fire.
Hamas argued that United Nations resolutions recognize the right of armed resistance to military occupation.
"The Palestinian people has had no choice but to take up arms to defend itself, combat Israeli terrorism and fight the occupation," it said.

FORBES PLANNING ON DROPPING OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

 BODY:
Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate who had challenged the Republican establishment on Capitol Hill with his call for a radical restructuring of the tax system, will drop out of the race for the Republican Presidential nomination today, his campaign manager said yesterday.
Mr. Forbes's decision came after he had spent $25 million to $30 million of his personal fortune, a record amount, in a quixotic quest for his party's nomination. In the end, he managed to win a mere 71 Republican convention delegates, less than 10 percent of the 996 needed to prevail. Calculated against the cost of his campaign, Mr. Forbes spent $352,112 to $422,535 for each delegate he gained. 
 Mr. Forbes first hinted that he was having second thoughts about continuing his candidacy on Tuesday night after his poor showing in the Super Tuesday primaries, each of which was won by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. Mr. Forbes finished a distant second in Florida and third in the other six contests.
William Dal Col, the Forbes campaign manager, said Mr. Forbes realized that the days before next Tuesday's primaries in the Midwest would not be enough time for him to mount a credible challenge that might result in a primary victory or close second to Mr. Dole, the presumptive front-runner.
"He's too much of a realist," Mr. Dal Col said. "He looked at it pragmatically and made his decision." He said Mr. Forbes informed him of his decision at about 10:45 yesterday morning in a brief conversation. Mr. He quoted Mr. Forbes as saying, "I've made a decision that it's time to get out."
Other close advisers, including former Senators Malcolm Wallop, Bob Kasten and Gordon J. Humphrey, were informed at midday in person or by telephone. Jack F. Kemp, the former Congressman from Buffalo and Housing Secretary in the Bush Administration who had recently endorsed Mr. Forbes's candidacy, was also told yesterday.
Reacting to word of Mr. Forbes's intentions, Mr. Dole was quoted by The Associated Press as saying yesterday, "No doubt about it, it helps."
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, a childhood friend of Mr. Forbes who urged him on Monday to abandon the race, said his withdrawal was "in the best interests of a unified Republican Party." She said she intended to invite Mr. Forbes, who is a resident of New Jersey, to be a member of the state delegation committed to Mr. Dole at the Republican National Convention.
While Mr. Forbes has barely 16 percent of the votes cast during the Republican primary season, and a tenth of the delegates amassed by Mr. Dole, his candidacy nevertheless managed to remind Republicans nationwide that the supply-side wing of the party, however small, was still alive and well. His pro-growth-hope-and-opportunity banner inadvertently became a devastating critique of the Capitol Hill Republicans' Contract With America.
The Forbes candidacy managed to broaden the national focus of debate from just a discussion of cutting the deficit and balancing the Federal budget to include the question of what kinds of policies will produce a better economy, more jobs and economic security.
"Steve understood that the Republicans made a tactical error in approaching Medicaid/Medicare debate the way they did," said Ken Tomlinson, the former top editor of Reader's Digest, and an adviser to Mr. Forbes. Mr. Forbes's candidacy, he said, showed the party that it could champion conservative principles without advocating "root canal" Republicanism.
While flying from the Midwest to New Jersey on Tuesday night on his chartered campaign plane, Mr. Forbes discussed the same theme at length in an interview: "You can't govern by polling. You can't govern by focus groups. The Contract has a lot of sensible ideas but you have to give it coherence, an overview. And by emphasizing the budget so much instead of combining it with some of the tax and other positive changes, they left themselves open."
He continued: "What they did was say 'Gee, Ross Perot said the balanced budget was important. Ross Perot won 19 percent of the vote.' They didn't realize that people voted for Perot because they saw him as a lever to register that they wanted a change. It was a genuine protest vote. Again they lost sight sometimes, some of them, that a balanced budget is supposed to be a means to an end, not an end unto itself."
Depending on circumstances, Mr. Dal Col said that Mr. Forbes, who is 48, could be a Presidential candidate in the year 2000. "He's built a base, he's a bright, articulate spokesman," Mr. Dal Col said. "He clearly outlasted the professional politicians. He proved what he can do and it's a base to build on in the future."
The base Mr. Dal Col referred to was his clear-cut victory in the Arizona primary and a more ambiguous one in Delaware, where Mr. Forbes and Alan Keyes were the only ones to campaign in person.
Other observers were less certain about Mr. Forbes's future viability as a candidate or public policy figure. "The grass-roots support for supply side economics is relatively small, " said Alan Brinkley, the Columbia University historian. "I don't think this is a popular proposal shared by many outside of elites of any kind."
In the interview on Tuesday, Mr. Forbes expressed interest in speaking at the Republican convention in San Diego, but it was clear that this was not his highest priority. Asked what role he would like to play, he said: "I look beyond the convention. I'll be directing my message to voters, to citizens."
In recent days, Mr. Forbes had added appeals to independents and pro-growth Democrats in his stump speeches, which focused on his advocacy of a 17 percent flat tax. "That's how you create a realignment," he said on Tuesday.

Why Dixie Was Buchanan's Waterloo

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 13

 BODY:
After his victory in the New Hampshire primary last month, Patrick J. Buchanan's campaign rumbled southward, and it seemed to many that he was steaming toward fertile ground.
But three weeks later, it is the South, a region so often stereotyped as a hotbed of Bible-thumping populism, that has effectively marginalized Mr. Buchanan and insured the Republican Presidential nomination of Senator Bob Dole. 
 With Mr. Dole's victories on Tuesday in Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Louisiana, and his triumphs in the last week and a half in South Carolina and Georgia, Southern Republicans showed themselves to be pragmatists who place a heavy emphasis on electability and who seek to balance social conservatism with economic conservatism.
With the benefit of hindsight, political scientists and Republican strategists in the region said today that they were not all that surprised. After all, they said, it was also the South that stopped Pat Robertson's momentum in the 1988 Republican primaries and derailed Mr. Buchanan's effort to swipe the 1992 nomination from George Bush. And, with a few exceptions, the South was also decidedly inhospitable toward Ross Perot in the 1992 general election.
After so many decades without influence, in national and local politics alike, the newly empowered Republicans of the South seem to understand the importance of winning. As a group, they are reluctant to throw away their votes on protest candidates or to support those they believe may be too extreme, either for the Southerners' own tastes or to win a general election.
"In every Southern state, with the possible exception of Louisiana, the pragmatic conservatives outnumber the doctrinaire conservatives," said Lanny Griffith, a Republican strategist who ran Lamar Alexander's unsuccessful campaign in the South. "I think it has something to do with the time that people have spent concentrating on winning. Nobody has ever been able to take power or winning office for granted."
In Texas, where Mr. Dole defeated Mr. Buchanan by 56 percent to 21 percent on Tuesday, the state Republican chairman, Tom Pauken, said that even voters attracted to Mr. Buchanan's politics had concluded that infighting was hurting the party and that Mr. Dole had the best chance to win in November.
"It doesn't mean that Texas all of a sudden has become a centrist or moderate state," Mr. Pauken said. "But it means that most of the conservatives in Texas want to get rid of Bill Clinton and believe that Bob Dole, of the current crop of candidates, has the best chance of doing it." Mr. Dole, he said, was "everybody's second choice."
Although Mr. Buchanan had tried to paint Mr. Dole as a liberal, the Senator succeeded in the South because even those voters who preferred another candidate found him acceptable, particularly on social issues like abortion.
Strapped for time and resources after third-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire last month, Mr. Alexander, former Governor of Tennessee, never became well enough known outside his home state to be a factor in the region. And when voters peeled away from Mr. Buchanan after determining that he was either too extreme or otherwise unelectable, they found in the Dole campaign a comfortable place to rest, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls in several Southern states.
The most striking shift since the voting in Iowa and New Hampshire has been among voters who consider themselves part of the religious right.
In the New Hampshire primary, 54 percent of that group voted for Mr. Buchanan, and only 11 percent for Mr. Dole, according to a survey taken by the television networks and The Associated Press. But Mr. Dole won 40 percent of that vote in South Carolina and 36 percent in Georgia. On Tuesday, he won 46 percent of it in Texas and 52 percent in Florida.
Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University who writes frequently about Southern politics, said Southern Republicans wanted "a presentable conservative."
"The notion that Buchanan would do well in the South was based on an image of the South as an impoverished Dogpatch where the rawest kind of emotional, nativist appeals will rally the people to your side," Mr. Black said. "But the most effective politicians in the South are those that can balance social and economic concerns, and there's nothing balanced about Pat Buchanan."
Former Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, whose endorsement and organization helped Mr. Dole win there, said Mr. Buchanan had suffered from a protectionist economic message that held limited appeal in the region.
Unemployment rates in most Southern states fall below the national average, and the region has outperformed the nation in job growth in each of the last 15 years.
Many of the new jobs have been created by foreign investment and by exports, making Southerners wary of talk about raising tariffs and closing borders. And many of those jobs have been filled by transplanted Northerners, who bring their own accents and typically mainstream political views to the suburbs of Atlanta, Nashville, Tampa and Greenville.
"People just have a total misimpression of what Southern states look like these days," said Susan A. MacManus, a professor of political science at the University of South Florida-Tampa. "There's been a huge infusion of growth in recent years, and that's been ignored in analyzing the rise of Republicanism. These people just don't have the Deep South mentality."

American Envoys' Killers Are Freed in Lebanon

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, March 13

 BODY:
An appeals court today freed two Lebanese men convicted of kidnapping and slaying two American diplomats and their driver in 1976, at the height of Lebanon's civil war.
The three-judge panel ruled the slayings of Ambassador Francis E. Meloy, his economic counselor, Robert O. Waring, and their Lebanese driver, were covered under a 1990 amnesty for political crimes. 
 Presiding Judge Moueen Osseiran ordered the men, Bassem Farkh, 39, and Namek Kamal, 46, freed. They were sentenced to death in 1994.
Prosecutor General Adnan Addoum argued for the death sentence to be upheld. But defense lawyers said the two men had no role in the murders, and were only low-ranking members of a Palestinian-backed Communist militia.

To the Editor:
If your objective is to scare readers, you scored a coup with "The Downsizing of America." Between 1980 and 1994, while the population grew about 13.5 percent (rising from 226.5 million to 257 million), civilian employment increased about 24 percent (from 99.3 million to 123.1 million). In 1994 the unemployment rate was 6.1 percent, versus 7.1 in 1980. It's sad when some people lose their jobs. But we can be glad that many more are getting new and better jobs.

HEADLINE: Should Downsizing Lead to a New System?;
New Ethical Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The series on the changing patterns of employment and corporate life in America helps explain a number of reactions to the new pleas for isolationist policies. But it does not help explain that masses of new middle classes (although many still lower-middle) are being created around the world. Nor does it help us face the ethical issue of who the "we" is in a post-nationalist era of geo-economics. 
 Has it not been clear from the effects of the Depression, the alliances formed to fight National Socialism and the more recent fall of the Berlin wall that fenced-in societies would and should be drawn into new levels of interaction, and that much of the violence of this century is a reaction against the idea of "them" versus "us"?
When we now seek to "protect our own," the "us" is radically expanded and the possibility of a deeper recognition of common humanity is on the horizon.

HEADLINE: Should Downsizing Lead to a New System?;
Blacks and Insecurity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your series on corporate downsizing really hit home. Blacks, black men in particular, have known job insecurity since we were emancipated from slavery in America. Today, unemployment has decimated our community to a new nihilism. 
 How ironic that now that white middle-class America is experiencing what blacks have dealt with all along, the term coined is "downsizing."

A United Response

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The only thing we'd add to your March 3-9 series is the importance of a mutual and united response. 
 Our group is a coalition of more than 50 labor, religious and community organizations and individuals with stories like those you featured. In January, we overflowed Faneuil Hall in Boston with more than 1,000 people, including half the Massachusetts Congressional delegation, to hear from blue-, pink- and white-collar workers, mothers on public assistance, immigrants and even economists.
Our purpose was to build support for efforts by the Progressive Caucus to require Congress and the President to promote good jobs, and the efforts to eliminate corporate welfare, raise the minimum wage and cap the tax-deductibility of executive compensation.
These proposals are only a start in trying to close the gap between people who are suffering and policy makers. When other states have joined us, we will begin to see things change.

HEADLINE: The Great Safire Disconnect

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Safire, in his utilitarian defense of corporate downsizing ("The Great Disconnect," column, March 11), argues that layoffs provide "the greatest good for the greatest number," with "good" defined as low unemployment rates and high mutual fund prices. The problem is that many Americans define the quality of their lives and of their society in terms other than these. 
 No one argues that companies should honor commitments to job security all the way to bankruptcy court. But the power imbalance between employer and worker in our employment-at-will system leaves employees highly vulnerable to personal economic upheaval.
This is not a problem if you define quality of life through macroeconomic indicators. But it is a problem if you are concerned about the well-being of individuals and the stability of their communities.
Public policy can temper the ruthlessness of markets with incentives for companies to give workers some control over their working lives, with modest commitments to job security or retraining. This is neither antithetical to capitalism nor a threat to the Republic.

HEADLINE: The Great Safire Disconnect

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re William Safire's March 11 column: Even if you do not agree with the popu-libs, you have to listen. They aren't creating the anger, they are simply recognizing it and making use of it. Where the French riot and the Bosnians kill one another, Americans vote. There is a real danger of having "corporate morality" legislated if we do not listen. 
 What is good for the economy is good for the stock market, but a good stock market does not necessarily reflect a good economy. All those nervous, laid-off workers are taking their severance packages and pumping up the market with mutual-fund contributions. Higher price-earnings ratios by virtue of bid-up stock, not increased earnings, aren't good.
As for "the sacrifice of the relative few in these prosperous times," just go to the market, fill a basket, then engage others at the checkout in conversation. I'd wager it would be difficult to locate anyone who wasn't nervous.

HEADLINE: The Great Safire Disconnect

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Has the time come to downsize William Safire? His March 11 column on the economy merely regurgitates standard economists' pap. One of its most toxic components is the thought that while Social Security now taxes current workers to pay retirees, pension funds based on stock holdings do something different. They don't. 
 Both the share-price rises and the dividends that increase fund payouts require keeping current wages low and downsizing often. (So do chief executives' fat salaries.) A company that cuts, say, research spending today may well damage all our futures, but, by looking good on the bottom line, it benefits current pensioners.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Strolling Through Political Art's Past

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
A few years ago, the New York State Council on the Arts issued a call for exhibitions addressing the still underrecorded history of alternative movements in American contemporary art. Two shows that resulted are now on view in SoHo, at Exit Art/The First World and the Drawing Center.
Despite their shared source of inspiration, however, they make an odd pair. One is big, the other small. One feels confidently expansive; the other looks scrappy and unsure of itself. And they often seem to be talking about different things: the underground press on the one hand, the New York art world on the other. 
 But the real problem lies in how they're alike. Both deal with "political art," yet neither makes an attempt to define the term or to evaluate the strengths and limitations of this ever-embattled genre. They settle instead for a critically neutral and half-nostalgic stroll through the past.
That stroll is, to be sure, an exhaustive workout in the case of "Counterculture: Alternative Information From the Underground Press to the Internet" at Exit Art. Organized by Brian Wallis and Melissa Rachleff, the show is a monumental accumulation of some 2,000 examples of politically radical newspapers, magazines and posters produced in America from the early 1960's to the present.
The work, ferreted out of closets, scrap books and library archives for the occasion, covers virtually every inch of Exit Art's substantial wall space. It is chronologically arranged and much of the most interesting material comes at the beginning, with the protest movement of the 60's.
That brief, explosive crosscultural moment, in which barriers of gender, class and race at least appeared to dissolve in a collective wave of anger and idealism, was, of course, extraordinary. And it produced a distinctive and influential visual style.
But it was a style that initially had little or no connection to the art world of the time, vanguard or mainstream. In fact, the first half of "Counterculture" is the story of the low-art medium of graphic design from which grew, on the cheap and often on the fly, a potent generational language.
That language literally blossomed with the rise of Flower Power, the passive-aggressive countercultural banner under which politics, drugs and free love merged. And any one of the dozens of tabloids on view in Exit Art's front room -- The San Francisco Oracle, The Berkeley Barb, The East Village Other -- with their mix of psychedelia and sloganeering could stand for the rest.
Other graphic work from the period, such as that produced by the Black Panthers, was deliberately less ingratiating, and by the end of the decade the political climate had in general grown harsh. The text-heavy manifestos of radical splinter groups like the Weather Underground and the bummed-out underground comics of R. Crumb and Art Spiegelman have a nasty, frankly paranoid charge that leaves pipe-dream utopias behind in the dust.
With the late 70's and 80's, things change again. Punk publications turn paranoia into a theatrical posture and the line between fashion and politics, always slender, more or less vanishes. Tie-dye and love beads are exchanged for black leather and flesh-piercing pins, and Aquarian Age givens -- the idea of students as an oppressed minority, for instance -- reappear as sendups.
It is around this point in the show, too, that political subject matter passes into the purview of the art world. Out of nowhere in particular comes a smattering of protest work by painters and sculptors, some of it created in the 60's by the Art Workers Coalition. The show concludes with a gathering of design-savvy posters addressing the AIDS epidemic. In this recent material, production values are high, but the still-incendiary issues of class and ethnicity have subsided. What's left is a polished, estheticized vehicle for political sentiment that's hard to imagine appearing anywhere outside the predominantly white and academically inclined art world itself.
Which is roughly where the show at the Drawing Center comes in. Titled "Cultural Economies: Histories From the Alternative Arts Movement NYC" and organized by the artist Julie Ault, it documents an oblique offshoot of the underground history detailed at Exit Art.
Like "Counterculture," it relies heavily on print media, to which it adds paintings, sculptures, photographs and other art objects. Specific institutions, most of them long gone, are represented (Fashion Moda in the South Bronx, ABC No Rio on the Lower East Side among them), as are collaborative protest groups (Guerilla Girls, Gran Fury) and several fine individual artists (including Jane Dickson, David Wojnarowicz and Martin Wong).
But the results feel wan and unconvincing. The show's confusing organization is partly to blame, as is its scattershot historical account. And much of the art chosen -- almost all of it by Ms. Ault's contemporaries -- looks thin in this half-hearted context. (Some of the best work of the early 80's was conceived precisely not to appear in pristine SoHo spaces like this one).
Most problematic, though, is that the art world hermeticism that afflicts the second half of "Counterculture" at Exit Art is also evident here. Many of the alternative spaces and the art they nurtured were created in impoverished immigrant neighborhoods, but little sense of grass-roots energy or street-level radicalism comes across.
Granted, "Cultural Economies" and "Counterculture" have set themselves daunting documentary tasks. In their different ways, they have made a start on a history and that's important, particularly at a time when political art is both yesterday's news in the art world and the target of a war of attrition by political powers that be.
But yesterday's news is always worth a hard look, not just to fight off nostalgia (which shows like these inevitably elicit), but to get some actual sense of what went right and what went wrong. How, without that kind of rigorous, complicated, self-critical evaluation, can the necessary project that "political art" is ever move ahead?
 
"Counterculture: Alternative Information From the Underground Press to the Internet" remains at Exit Art/The First World, 548 Broadway, at Prince Street, in SoHo, through April 20. "Cultural Economies: Histories From the Alternative Arts Movement NYC" remains at the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, in SoHo, through April 6.

Torture by H.M.O.

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
From the New England Journal of Medicine comes the story of a North Carolina family that was devastated by the inflexible and thoroughly inhumane decisions of a national health maintenance organization.
A three-month-old girl was referred by the H.M.O. to a pediatric-oncology group at the University of North Carolina Hospitals in Chapel Hill. 
 (The H.M.O. was not identified in the article, which appeared in the Feb. 22 issue of the journal. I am withholding its name at the request of the authors, Dr. Brent Weston, a staff physician, and Marie Lauria, a clinical social worker. H.M.O.'s have been known to retaliate against critics. A respected Cambridge physician, Dr. David Himmelstein, recently was fired "without cause" by U.S. HealthCare after he criticized certain managed-care practices on television and in print. He was reinstated after a public outcry.)
The three-month-old girl was diagnosed with leukemia. A bone marrow transplant, with her older sister as the donor, was recommended. The H.M.O. approved the transplant and asked for help in arranging a transfer of the baby to a hospital in another state that had been designated by the H.M.O. to do all bone marrow transplants in the region.
Dr. Weston and Ms. Lauria wrote that it soon "became clear that treatment out of state for several months would be detrimental to the family. Both parents were distraught. The father would not be able to be involved because of employment restrictions. The mother, who obviously needed to be with the infant, would lose her position and be forced to take a lesser job with a pay cut.
"The older sister, who was having serious behavioral problems, would have to be separated from her mother for a prolonged period. The expenses associated with an extended stay in a city where the family had no relatives or friends would be difficult for the family to manage. There are two excellent transplantation centers nearby in our own state and we were asked to request that the H.M.O. make an exception to its policy on selecting a transplantation center."
They asked, but such humanitarian concerns are not what corporate care is about. In the competition with profits, patients must always lose. The H.M.O. said no. There would be no exception. The transplant would have to be done out of state.
Dr. Weston and Ms. Lauria were cautioned by their colleagues not to push the H.M.O. too far. A transplant specialist warned them against offending the carrier "because we are in the running for the next contract."
Others suggested, sympathetically, that they wise up to "the new medical-economic reality."
The H.M.O. complained about their interference with "the client-carrier relationship."
The entire experience was disorienting. The expanding universe of corporate care is a very strange environment for health professionals concerned primarily with the needs of their patients.
The baby was taken out of state for the transplant and was not returned to the care of her physicians in North Carolina for six months. The older sister was sent to live with relatives in a different state. The mother was demoted. Compounding all other problems, the father lost his job.
Several weeks ago the baby suffered a relapse. When a second transplant was contemplated, the H.M.O., for reasons having nothing to do with the quality of care, recommended a different transplant center in yet another state.
Dr. Weston and Ms. Lauria were appalled. None of the factors that had made the first transplant such an enormous problem had changed. "In addition," they wrote, "the first transplantation center had established an ongoing relationship with the family."
Now the family would have to start all over, at a different center in a different state.
This time, in order to keep the family together, the mother quit her job, gave up her H.M.O. coverage, and applied for Medicaid.
"The parents have lost their home and their savings," wrote Dr. Weston and Ms. Lauria, "and the older sister has had increasingly severe behavioral problems."
That, of course, is the family's problem. Corporate care is about the bottom line. There will be no exceptions.

Little Change In Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday, paring back earlier gains made after a Government report showed no mounting price pressures in the economy.
The price of the 30-year bond settled down 3/32, to 916/32, leaving its yield unchanged at 6.68 percent. 
 "The market is extremely fragile and appears to be hanging on by its fingernails, hoping to get some good data," said Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston.
Prices rose after the market was surprised by a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index. Many economists had expected no change or an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent. The data indicated that inflation at the manufacturing level was stable even if last Friday's employment report suggested that economic growth was rebounding strongly. The producer prices report rekindled hopes that the Federal Reserve would still be able to cut short-term interest rates this spring.
That view was bolstered by the weekly report on initial claims for state unemployment benefits. Jobless claims for the week that ended March 9 rose by only 353,000, from 363,000 the week before, and was below the 365,000 that had been forecast by economists. The data provided some comfort for a market still smarting from last Friday's report, which showed that more than 700,000 jobs were created in February.
Despite the favorable data, the market remained nervous ahead of a number of Government economic reports scheduled for today, on consumer prices, industrial production and capacity utilization.
"The market is still spooked by the thought of an accelerating economy, and thus will need a host of economic statistics indicating moderate growth with no inflationary undertones before relinquishing the fear factor," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
William J. Michaelcheck, chairman of the Mariner Investment Group, a money management firm, said, "The market has calmed and repriced to a new level after the employment number last week."
"I think the market is now waiting for validation of the economic strength or the data to refute last week's employment numbers," he said. "Every number has a few suspects."
Mr. Fine said the Consumer Price Index for February was unlikely to upset the market, but both the industrial production and capacity utilization reports could be expected to show strong gains from weather-depressed January levels.
"To make matters even more confusing," Mr. Fine said, "the G.M. strike and subsequent shutdown of assembly plants could well have a noticeable impact on various economic statistics depending on the length of inactivity, starting with the initial claims statistics next Thursday.
"But after all is said and done, one can reasonably conclude that inflation continues to appear subdued, benign and nonthreatening, economic growth is proceeding at a moderate pace, and the Federal Reserve is likely to keep monetary policy unchanged over the near term."
In the corporate market yesterday, Litton Industries sold $400 million of debentures in a two-part transaction through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Underwriters offered $400 million of debentures due in 2026 at a price to yield 7.787 percent and $100 million of debentures due in 2006 at a price of par to yield 6.98 percent.
The debt is rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps Credit.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Trading Is Lackluster As Stocks and Bonds Settle Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished slightly higher yesterday against the mark and yen after a lethargic trading session largely unaffected by new United States economic data.
The dollar finished mixed against other currencies. Its rise against the German and Japanese currencies came as American stock and bond markets remained steady for the second straight day after several sessions of volatility. 
"It's difficult to know why the market is in such a status quo mode," said Steve Jury, chief foreign exchange dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland. "There is a lot of confusion. People do not have much of an opinion of what is going to happen next. We are in a stalemate."
In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 105.50 yen, up from 105.10 late on Wednesday, and at 1.4708 marks, up from 1.4703.
Some traders said the dollar was kept afloat against the mark partly because of fears that a big hedge fund would enter the market, overwhelming smaller orders, if the dollar dipped as low as 1.4680 marks.
The fund was thought to have bought dollars on Wednesday, said Brian Garvey, a currency strategist with IDEA, an analytic service. Whenever the dollar approached 1.4680 marks, traders bought it back up for fear that the fund would overwhelm the market and their orders would fall by the wayside. The dollar never fell below 1.4697 marks.
Traders were also influenced by a rumor that the French Government was considering shuffling the Cabinet. That prompted a shift to marks and away from French francs. Traders also bought the mark against the Italian lira.
The market, which has been looking for new data to give it direction, saw a fall in the Producer Price Index in the United States as negating inflationary worries inspired by high employment numbers reported last week.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.1869 Swiss francs, down from 1.1872; 5.0445 French francs, up from 5.0375; 1,565 Italian lire, down from 1,567; and 1.3680 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
The British pound was quoted at $1.5292, up from $1.5230.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Dayton Hudson Net Falls, But Is Above Expectations

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Dayton Hudson Corporation posted sharply lower fourth-quarter earnings yesterday.
Dayton Hudson, the parent company of the Target discount chain, earned $228 million, or $3.08 a share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, down 18 percent from $279 million, or $3.81 a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 14 percent, to $8 billion from $7 billion. 
 The results were slightly higher than Wall Street's expectations of earnings of $3.06 a share, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research. Shares of the company rose $1.875 each yesterday, to $81.625.
Still, it was the second consecutive fourth quarter, which is usually the most profitable period for retailers, that earnings have not increased under Robert Ulrich, who became chairman and chief executive in 1994.
"We're certainly very disappointed with our 1995 results," the company's chief financial officer, Douglas Scovanner, said.
Dayton Hudson, based in Minneapolis, said it expected results to recover this year and said it was already seeing improvement. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, climbed 8.4 percent in February.
But if performance at its Mervyn's department store unit does not improve, "we would certainly entertain some other concepts or some other ideas," Mr. Scovanner said.
He declined to identify the options, saying that the company wanted to keep Mervyn's. But Wall Street analysts and some shareholders say the expect the unit will be spun off or sold, especially if a rebound does not occur soon.
"In our opinion, the strategic decision has already been made to shed Mervyn's," said Saul Yaari, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc. "Dayton Hudson is buying time to dress up the division for for a sale or spinoff."
Mervyn's has been hobbled in recent years by California's weak economy and by competition from the J. C. Penney Company.
But Mr. Scovanner said Dayton Hudson wanted to to retain Mervyn's in order to maintain a diverse retailing base.
Dayton Hudson's three retailing divisions help shield the company from swings in the economy because they draw consumers from different income levels. Cash generated by Mervyn's and the department store division, which includes Marshall Field's, Dayton's and Hudson's, helps finance the rapid expansion of Target, which competes with Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart.

HEADLINE: Credit-Card Delinquencies Rise; Price Report Shows No Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
The ranks of consumers who have fallen behind on credit-card payments edged up to match a 10-year high in the final quarter of 1995, a sign of growing household distress that some economists argue threatens to bring the five-year-old economic expansion to an end.
Meanwhile, prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers fell in February for the first time in eight months, easing fears that the big jump in new jobs last month might lead to higher inflation. 
 But the bond market drew scant comfort from the two reports, as other economic indicators, including a sharp decline in first-time jobless claims last week, suggested that prospects for a revival of economic growth were improving. The yield on benchmark 30-year bond, which often gains ground on news of low inflation and a higher risk of recession, was unchanged at 6.68 percent.
With the current outlook so cloudy, experts are hoping that fresh reports on consumer prices and industrial production scheduled for Friday will help bring the picture into sharper focus.
Several analysts expressed particular concern about the rising delinquency rates, as consumers also fell further behind on mortgages, home equity loans and auto loans.
Though increasing less rapidly than earlier in the year, the rise in consumer delinquencies is "still alarming," said James Chessen, chief economist at the American Bankers Association. He said additional problems would show up if consumer borrowing kept outpacing disposable income.
The bank group's survey found 3.34 percent of credit-card accounts overdue 30 days or more, up from 3.3 percent during the summer and from 2.93 percent in the final 1994 quarter. In dollar terms the rise was larger, to 4.45 percent from 4.21 in the latest period.
The delinquencies on home equity and auto loans, while also higher, remained generally below recent peaks, the association found.
In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said slightly more homeowners were behind on their mortgages during the October-December period, the third straight quarterly rise.
The Government figures on inflation at the producer, or wholesale, level were even better than analysts had expected. This encouraged some economists to keep alive their faint hopes that the Federal Reserve would still decide to make another cut in short-term interest rates at its next policy-making meeting at the end of the month or later this spring.
The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods fell two-tenths of 1 percent in February, the first decline since June, as energy products reversed a sharp January advance.
Even more encouraging, analysts said, was a lack of inflation at earlier stages of the production pipeline. The prices of intermediate goods apart from the volatile food and energy components -- a gauge closely monitored by the Federal Reserve -- have now declined five straight months.
This is in sharp contrast to the situation in early 1995, when intermediate goods, like plywood, were advancing briskly and analysts worried that these pressures would ripple through the economy. Instead, the price increases failed to stick, dissipating at later stages in a climate of intense competition.
But the impact of last Friday's bond-market debacle resulting from the Government's report of huge February job growth showed up in today's weekly tally of interest rates by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
Freddie Mac said that rates on 30-year conventional mortgages soared to 7.83 percent this week from 7.38 percent last week, an exceptionally big move that lifted the rate to the highest point since late August. Rates on one-year adjustables, the company said, climbed to 5.55 percent from 5.4.
This jump promptly caused a sharp reduction in mortgage applications, especially for refinancings, said Paul S. Reid, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
But other indicators pointed to evidence that the economy might be gathering some strength again. The Labor Department said that first-time claimants for unemployment insurance fell by 10,000 in the week ended last Saturday, to a total of 353,000, well under what most analysts had expected. The four-week average fell by 7,000, to 364,000, after having exceeded 380,000 in mid-February.
The bankers' delinquency survey showed that consumer installment debt, still swelling at a double-digit rate in January, had climbed to near-record proportions of disposable income. At 19 percent, this ratio is now just short of what it was in the late 1980's and is well above the 16.2 percent to which it fell in 1992.
"The consumer is in recession," said Lawrence J. Sterne, director of research at Economic Analysis Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., firm specializing in the financial behavior of households. "There's some real income stress out there."

HEADLINE: NYC;
Keeping a Plant In the Bronx Is Job No. 1

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
ASKING Jose Alvarez if he is worried about his future is a bit like asking if he is alive. Why waste the question, that's how obvious the answer is, he said.
For 16 years, he has been a maintenance man at Farberware, the century-old maker of pots and pans in the South Bronx. But now the company has been bought by a Boston silverware manufacturer, and the 700 jobs at its squat, red-brick plant -- sandwiched between Bruckner and Southern boulevards -- are more in doubt than the future of Middle East peace talks. Worried? 
 "What do you think?" Mr. Alvarez said during a break the other morning. "They're talking about moving somewhere else, maybe in a few months. I'll have to go on unemployment."
As best as can be determined, no decision has been made by Farberware's new owner, the Syratech Corporation, which bought the company from U.S. Industries, a conglomerate based in Iselin, N.J. But anyone ready to bet his last dollar on those Bronx jobs surviving can probably be persuaded to buy a bridge or two across the East River.
Leonard Florence, the Syratech chairman, said he cannot make a profit in the South Bronx unless the city and state help him lower the costs for essentials like electricity, water, sewage and labor. Otherwise, Mr. Florence said, the only alternative is to "outsource" -- the term of art these days for shipping jobs off to Arkansas or Hong Kong or anywhere else where people are ready to labor for even less than the prevailing $10 an hour on Bruckner Boulevard.
THIS is not a swipe at New York, he insisted. Nor is there reason to suspect a bluff to squeeze the city and state for tax breaks. It seems to be strictly business. "If you can show us how to make a return on our investment there, we'll look at it," Mr. Florence said.
Showing him how has turned into an important test of New York's stated resolve to make itself a jobs-saving, business-friendly place, a task that falls to an assortment of officials. They include the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer; the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, John S. Dyson; his state counterpart, Charles A. Gargano, and the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, Charles Millard.
It would be nice, not to mention helpful, if they all admired one another and could work closely together on the issue. That, unfortunately, is far from the case. About the only detectable consensus thus far is that it is vital to keep Farberware where it is.
How vital?
In the big picture, 700 jobs may not seem like much. But the Bronx, where health care is the dominant field, has only about 14,000 manufacturing jobs left. So Farberware, which moved to that borough from Brooklyn in 1944, accounts for a hefty 5 percent of the total.
MOST of its workers live nearby in Port Morris and Mott Haven, where employment choices are not exactly plentiful. And as their jobs go, so go neighborhood businesses like the restaurant across the street and Victor Flores's tire shop down the block. Mr. Flores gives a thumbs-down when asked what life without Farberware would be like for him.
"This is a vignette of the whole national issue of off-shore sourcing," Mr. Dyson said. "But it is not the result of an unkind God. It is the result of actions taken over the last 50 years that add up to a whole set of costs in New York that are out of whack with what the same services go for elsewhere."
The Deputy Mayor and Mr. Florence met this week, mainly to lay out the problems. All the sides have yet to sit down together, and solutions, assuming they exist, are well down the road. Take electricity, to cite but one issue. Syratech dismisses the Bronx rates as prohibitively high -- 20 cents per kilowatt hour, it says -- but Mr. Ferrer responds that 11 cents is closer to reality. Whatever the true figure, Mr. Florence wants it lowered.
One idea making the rounds is to stretch the city's new Federal Empowerment Zone so that it encompasses the Farberware plant, which lies just outside it now. The zone cuts across northern Manhattan and a sliver of the South Bronx, its purpose being to spark private investment through lower taxes and a small infusion of Government money. Maybe a lure of Federal tax credits for employees living in the zone would persuade Farberware's bosses to stay put.
At least that's the theory. But who knows if Washington will agree to redraw the lines, or if that will be enough for Syratech?
Count Nestor Lopez among the optimists. Mr. Lopez has been a Farberware driver for 17 years, and he said, "I don't think they'll move. I got my Jesus up there helping."
No disrespect, but this time some temporal intervention will also be needed.

HEADLINE: In Search of New Commodities;
U.S. Futures Exchanges Try to Regain Lost Ground

BYLINE: By BARNABY FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 14

 BODY:
When Wall Street swooned last Friday, worried investment managers sought cover here, where the nation's largest futures exchanges give them an opportunity to hedge their risks.
But while the Chicago Mercantile Exchange recorded its second-busiest day ever, such spikes in trading cannot mask the disquiet gripping both the Merc and its bigger crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade. 
 Over all, trading levels on United States futures and options exchanges fell last year, even as activity expanded abroad, continuing a 20-year boom in futures trading worldwide. Besides global competition, the American exchanges face the challenge of the more private "off exchange" market, where banks and other big futures players trade directly with each other, often more cheaply than in Chicago's pits.
And so the Merc, the Board of Trade and other leading American exchanges are engaged in some of the most ambitious new-product development campaigns in their history, shouldering new risks in hopes of defending their central role in the futures business.
The Board of Trade is offering insurance contracts for hurricanes and other future catastrophes, and it has begun trading waste paper and other recyclables, hoping that they will one day grow into markets big enough to require their own futures and options.
The Chicago Merc is pushing hard into futures tied to the volatile currencies, debt, and stock markets of developing countries. The New York Mercantile Exchange, better known as Nymex, last month announced plans to began trading electricity futures, anticipating the day when deregulation of utilities will create more risks of rate swings. The Merc and the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York recently introduced competing milk futures and options contracts, spurred by the trend toward less regulation in the dairy industry.
These and other exchanges are also considering creating futures on such staples of commerce as water rights, coal and real estate. And they are forming international alliances like the Board of Trade's recent deal with the London International Financial Futures Exchange, which will allow each exchange's members to trade the other's most popular products on their own floors.
"Bill Gates taught it to I.B.M., Sam Walton taught it to Sears, and the Internet is teaching it to the Encyclopaedia Britannica," said Richard Sandor, a former professor who helped design the Board of Trade's key contracts and is now a director of the Chicago Merc.
"There are no franchises you can rely on any more," he said, "and the exchanges, like every other business, have to innovate to survive."
The futures exchanges have reinvented themselves repeatedly through the years. While the Chicago Board of Trade, for instance, still handles the agricultural products that occasioned its birth more than a century ago, contracts for Government bonds and notes now account for three-fourths of its business. "It's the relentless issuance of Government debt that's fueled our market," Patrick Arbor, the board's chairman, said.
No wonder, then, that one of Mr. Arbor's current headaches is the possibility that Congress and President Clinton may shrink the debt market by negotiating a plan for balancing the Federal budget.
While the success of the new products will affect the prosperity of those thousands of traders whom are shown screaming at each other in trading pits on the odd occasions when the exchanges show up in newscasts, far more is at stake as well. In the last 20 years, futures have assumed a pivotal role in the world economy. There are 75 futures and options exchanges around the world, trading more than a billion contracts annually, up from just a handful trading fewer than 30 million contracts in 1975.
If banks, pension funds and other investors could not easily use bond futures contracts to manage their risks, the Government would have to pay much higher interest to convince them to buy bonds. The result would be battles over Government spending and taxing that would make the conflict currently paralyzing Congress seem tame.
Similarly, stock index futures like the Chicago Merc's contract for the Standard & Poor's list of 500 major stocks have become so indispensable that trading in those underlying stocks nearly halted when a flood forced the Merc to close for a day in 1992. According to the exchange, the dollar value of trading in the index is 60 percent more than that in the stocks themselves.
While trying to increase their revenues, some exchanges are also merging to cut costs. Nymex, the world's leading energy futures exchange, recently acquired the Commodity Exchange of New York, which specializes in copper and precious metals futures. Both exchanges operate from the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
Here in Chicago, the Board of Trade and the Merc early this month began to study the money-saving benefits of at least a partial merger, though past efforts to combine the rivals have collapsed. And both exchanges are looking to set up subsidiaries to pursue "off exchange" business from customers who want something other than standardized futures contracts.
The most heavily traded futures contracts throughout the world are hedges against unexpected movements in interest rates, currencies and other financial instruments either issued by governments or heavily influenced by them. Most others are in traditional commodity arenas like mining and agriculture that are driven by Government subsidies and trade policies.
As a result, most new-product efforts respond to recent or expected Government policy changes. Usually, the exchanges go after niches, like the new milk futures. There, declining Government support prices for milk have made prices more volatile, creating interest in futures and options among dairies, their major customers like candy companies, and even some farmers.
The Board of Trade's corn yield contracts are a more radical leap. The first yield contract, introduced last summer, was priced at $100 times the average bushels an acre of corn grown on Iowa farms: for example, approximately $13,000 in recent trading for a September contract. Last month, the board added contracts for average corn yields in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska and the entire country, though it does not expect any significant trading until the spring planting season.
All previous crop contracts have been based on projected prices. That made sense as long as the United States dominated world agriculture, because prices and yield were fairly closely linked. When yields were high, the bumper crop drove down prices everywhere. In a bad year, supplies would be short and prices would rise.
Now, with the American share of the world market much smaller and trade much freer, Midwest farmers can be hammered if domestic yields are meager but prices remain low because of, say, reports of projected bumper crops in South America. To manage that risk, an Illinois farmer can now sell futures pegged to an average-sized corn crop in Illinois. If he and most of Illinois have a bad year, he generates less than expected from his fields, but offsets that with profits from those futures.
The Board of Trade hopes to expand the yield contracts into soybeans and wheat if the corn yield futures succeed. But the odds are against that success.
That's because the vast majority of new products fail to catch on -- about 80 percent by the Board of Trade's reckoning -- although many limp along from year to year with no one bothering to delist them. Among the more recent flops: the Board of Trade's barge futures and the Merc's broiler chicken futures.
"There haven't been any home runs since the early 1980's," said Todd E. Petzel, a fund manager who left the Chicago Merc at the end of January after years as head of its product-development effort.
Part of the problem is that it is hard to attract customers until they see the success enjoyed by the pioneering traders. As the uptick in insurance trading after the Florida hurricanes of 1994 demonstrated, it sometimes takes disasters to give momentum to new products.
The learning curve is steepest if the niche market is new to futures, like the insurers to whom the Board of Trade is trying to sell its catastrophe contracts. The need is clear: insurers are scrambling to manage their exposure in an era when the frequency and intensity of natural disasters seem to be increasing. But it is not obvious to many insurers exactly how to figure out the true value of the contracts without a track record.
Wary customers are only the last hurdle. Well before that, exchanges must get their own members to participate in developing and backing the new products.
The major exchanges are not-for-profit organizations owned and largely governed by their members. In the case of the Board of Trade, Mr. Arbor must seek reelection every two years. He faces an electorate of giant corporations like Merrill Lynch & Company and Cargill Inc., small local traders, grain specialists and bond traders -- some of those wealthy longtime players, others young, poorly capitalized newcomers -- all with conflicting interests and differing views of how to invest in the future.
Even if an exchange can convince members to invest in developing a new contract, convincing traders to handle it is always ticklish. "To most traders, long term is five minutes," said Patrick J. Catania, the Board of Trade's senior vice president in charge of market and product development. "They look for instant results in defining success."
Many exchanges recruit traders for new products by granting temporary permits or selling seats with limited trading rights at bargain prices. That is what the Merc did in January, selling 50 seats in its new emerging-markets division for $30,000 each. At that price, a trader can make a living with far less business than a Merc member who is paying off the cost of a full seat, now about $700,000.
But designing the terms of the limited seats is nearly as challenging as designing the contracts themselves. Full members are loath to give up their control over what could turn out to be a great trading opportunity -- somewhere down the line.
 
How Futures Work: A Sample
Futures and related contracts like options are known as derivatives because their value is derived from an underlying commodity like a Treasury bond, stock share, coffee or oil. Futures involve the obligation to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity on a set date at a set price. Options are the right but not the obligation to strike such a deal.
One simplified example: A bank holding $10 million of 30-year bonds that are paying an average interest rate of 7 percent sells $10 million worth of futures contracts in the trading pit for 30-year bonds. If interest rates rise, the bonds are less attractive and may tumble in value to, say, $9.5 million. But the decline is offset by the value of the commitment the bank holds from the futures buyer to pay $10 million for such bonds on the contract delivery date.
 If interest rates fall, the 7 percent return on the bank's bonds looks better, and the bonds might rise in value to $10.5 million. But the bank will lose $500,000 meeting its commitment to sell such bonds to that buyer for $10 million on the delivery date.
Thus, by selling futures, the bank sacrifices potential gains in its bond portfolio for protection against losses.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Creates 2 Bills On Legal and Illegal Aliens

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
By a surprisingly wide margin, the Senate Judiciary Committee agreed today to consider new restrictions on legal and illegal aliens in two separate bills rather than one, imperiling large proposed cuts in legal immigration.
After two weeks of jousting, the panel voted, 12 to 6, to strip the more politically charged cuts in skilled foreign workers and family visas, and deal with them separately after addressing stricter enforcement measures against illegal aliens. 
 Six of the committee's 10 Republicans, including the panel's chairman, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, turned a deaf ear to the pleas of the legislation's main author, Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, to deal with legal and illegal aliens together.
"This is the way this legislation should be taken up," said Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican who led the effort to split the bill.
Mr. Simpson played down today's vote, saying: "This won't affect anything. We'll go to the floor with both measures." But others who support deep cuts in the numbers and types of immigrants who enter the country legally said Congress's compressed election-year schedule as well as opposition from a broad coalition of business and pro-immigration groups would make their task more difficult.
Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports cuts in legal immigration, said: "Senators will not have the time or the political will to deal with two separate bills. Since illegal immigration excites people the most, that's what's going to come first. Legal immigration will just shrivel up."
Supporters of legal immigration say current law insures a plentiful supply of skilled immigrants to serve as a wellspring of economic innovation. But critics say foreign workers are taking jobs from Americans and placing huge burdens on public services in states with large numbers of aliens like California, Florida and New York.
The House Rules Committee decided today that an amendment to divide its immigration bill into two parts could be offered next week. It is unclear what effect the Senate decision will have on the House amendment.
Lawmakers said they also expected a heated debate in the House and Senate over requiring employers to use an automated system to verify the legal status of job applicants. Supporters say this is necessary to crack down on illegal aliens with bogus documents. But critics, including liberals and libertarians, argue that such a system is a dangerous step toward an intrusive national identification card.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance on Hopes For Rising Company Profits

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market rose modestly yesterday as traders bet that an expanding economy would push corporate profits upward.
Many traders sold some shares late in the day in anticipation of today's "triple witching," when futures and options on stocks and stock indexes expire simultaneously. 
 In addition, bond prices remained in a very narrow range for most of yesterday's trading. "With a benign bond market, the path of least resistance for stocks is higher," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason. "And the Producer Price Index number gave confidence that the Consumer Price Index is going to be a friendly number."
The Labor Department reported yesterday that producer prices unexpectedly fell two-tenths of a percent last month, the first decline in eight months and indicating an absence of inflation. It is scheduled to release its report on consumer prices today.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.34 points, to 5,586.06, after rallying more than twice as much earlier in the session. When the Dow was up 50 points at 2:51 P.M., the New York Stock Exchange's "downtick rule" was triggered in an attempt to stabilize the market by curbing stock-index arbitrage.
Among the broader indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 2.32 points, to 640.87, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 2.43 points, to 1,091.07. The Dow Jones transportation average climbed 36.35 points, to a record level of 2,154.22. Advancing issues topped decliners on the Big Board by 1,449 to 929, while volume soared to an exceptionally heavy 492.6 million shares, from 413 million shares on Wednesday.
Oil stocks climbed after the price of crude oil jumped above $21 a barrel for the second time in three years. Phillips Petroleum, which was upgraded by Merrill Lynch, rose 3/4, to 39 3/8; Texaco added 1 3/8, to 84 1/2; Exxon advanced 1, to 81, and Chevron increased 1, to 56.
American Express led the financial services sector higher, adding 2 1/4, to 47 1/4. Other gainers included Citicorp, up 2 13/64, to 78 5/8; Chemical, up 1 1/2, to 68 1/4, and Federal National Mortgage, or Fannie Mae, up 1/2, to 31 1/4.
The retail sector benefited from rotation by portfolio managers. Kmart closed up 5/8, at 9 1/2, its highest price since last October. Dayton Hudson closed at 82 5/8, up 1 7/8, after stating that earnings for the quarter ended Feb. 3 exceeded expectations. Wal-Mart closed at 23 5/8, up 5/8.
Monsanto gained 4 5/8, to 149 5/8, after announcing plans for a stock split and an enhanced share buyback program. Others in the chemical group showing advances included Dow Chemical, up 2 1/2, to 88 5/8, and Georgia Gulf, up 2 1/4, to 35 1/2.
However, tobacco issues slumped for a second day amid new legal pressures on cigarette manufacturers. Philip Morris, which slumped 5 1/2, to 92 1/2, once again was responsible for holding back the Dow industrials. RJR Nabisco dropped 1 1/4, to 32 5/8, and UST fell 1, to 33 5/8. The S.& P. tobacco index plummeted 84.41 points, to 1,609.83.
Some communications equipment concerns also finished lower. DSC Communications closed at 28, down 7/8; Cisco Systems ended at 45 15/16, down 3/16, and Oracle closed at 48 1/8, down 1 1/2.
Earnings-related news pushed down the prices of a number of companies. Office Depot gave up 2 3/4, to 20 1/2; Big Flower Press fell 4 7/8, to 10 7/8, and Active Voice dropped 5 1/4, to 13.

HEADLINE: CLINTON, IN ISRAEL, STRESSES SUPPORT FOR PEACE EFFORT

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 14

 BODY:
By turns politician, preacher and professor, President Clinton raced from the peak of Mount Herzl here to the heart of coastal Tel Aviv today to convince Israelis that the United States stood squarely behind them and their endangered peace.
The formal centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's brief visit was his commitment of $100 million to supply Israel with training and technical assistance in the fight against terrorism. 
 American officials said the aid would include advanced bomb-detection devices, X-ray systems, robotics for dealing with suspected bombs and advanced thermal and radar sensors. They said $50 million of the funds would come from the Pentagon's 1996 budget, and the rest would be added to next year's budget.
American foreign aid to Israel is $3 billion a year, of which $1.2 billion is economic assistance and $1.8 billion military.
Mr. Clinton was less precise on the possibility of a formal military treaty with Israel, which would be troubling for both Israel and the United States. The President said only that the two sides would immediately begin negotiating a agreement to combat terrorism, and urged reporters not to "jump ahead."
The pledge of $100 million, coming on the day after world leaders gathered in Egypt to condemn terrorism, was part of a broad effort by the Clinton Administration to revive Israeli faith in peace with the Palestinians after four suicide bombings in which 62 lives were lost.
"The message of the pact to the people of Israel should also be quite clear," Mr. Clinton said at a news conference in Jerusalem. "Just as America walks with you every step of the way as you work toward peace, we stand with you now in defending all that you are and all that has been accomplished."
The President's 22-hour visit was clearly intended to bolster Prime Minister Shimon Peres's damaged standing before the national elections on May 29. It included a meeting with the entire Israeli Cabinet; a visit to the national cemetery on Mount Herzl to lay a wreath at the tomb of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and to pay respects at the graves of 10 victims of terror attacks, and meetings with the opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu and with Israeli students in Tel Aviv.
Following criticism from the Mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, that the schedule did not pay sufficient attention to that city, Mr. Clinton joined Mr. Olmert in visiting a Jerusalem school that lost four pupils in the recent wave of terror attacks.
At every stop, the theme was the same, urging Israelis to stay the course. At the assembly with thousands of students in the Center for the Performing Arts in Tel Aviv, Mr. Clinton was greeted with a long standing ovation, and he was introduced by Mr. Peres as "one of the greatest Presidents that the United States has ever had."
Repaying the compliment, Mr. Clinton told the students that to succeed, they first had to follow the advice of the Prime Minister. Clearly savoring the warm reception, the President was at times the teacher -- tutoring the students on the importance of "learning how to learn" -- and at times the preacher, citing psalms to drive home his message.
"Israel is not alone, America stands with you, and with every passing day, so do more people, here and abroad," he said. "But we will not rest until, in the words of the psalm, 'There is peace within Israel's walls and security in her towers.' And we know that Israel will never give her enemies the victory they seek, never abandon the hope of peace, never lose 'a tikvah leshalom' " -- a hope of peace.
Although the politics of the visit was transparent, and many of the scenes were certain to reappear in the campaign advertisements of both Mr. Peres and Mr. Clinton, the powerful personal gesture of support from an American President made a distinct impression. In Israel, as at the summit meeting in Egypt, Mr. Clinton made it clear that he was throwing his support and sympathy behind Israel, and not only behind a process or a region.
The President made no effort to balance his backing for Israel with a gesture toward Yasir Arafat or the Palestinians, as visiting dignitaries usually do, and he publicly supported Israel's severe measures in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including the siege of Palestinian settlements.
Mr. Clinton argued that an objective of the "terrorists" was to compel Israel to punish all Palestinians. "It's a deliberate attempt by them to make the Palestinians as miserable as possible," he said.
In an article titled "Clinton, the Last Zionist," Nahum Barnea -- a commentator for the popular newspaper Yediot Ahronot who lost a son in one of the suicide bombings -- said Mr. Clinton was the first recent American President not to feel compelled to be "balanced" in his relations with Israel.
"There are other countries around the world which were hit by terror and have paid a similar price," Mr. Barnea wrote. "But none of them have received the comprehensive, warm, unconditional support that Israel has received from the American President."
While Mr. Clinton made his tour, the Israeli Army invited reporters to the village of Rafat in the West Bank to watch the demolition of the house of Yahya Ayyash, the Hamas bomb-maker known as the Engineer, who was killed in January. Three of the recent suicide bombings were said to be revenge for his killing.
Although Mr. Clinton's schedule was clearly tilted toward Mr. Peres, the main architect of Israel's peace policy, the President did meet with Mr. Netanyahu, the leader of the opposition Likud, whose ratings have risen sharply since the suicide bombings. After the meeting, Mr. Clinton insisted that the United States would cooperate with any leader elected by the Israelis.
Mr. Clinton's visit was accompanied by some of the stiffest security anyone could remember in peacetime because of fears of another terrorist strike while he was here. The Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway was sealed off for his passage, as were the areas he visited.
His visit passed without incident. But Mr. Clinton acknowledged at his news conference that there could be no guarantee against more attacks.
Asked whether the measures he and the Israelis were taking could stop a determined bomber, Mr. Clinton said, "No, no one can do that."
"What we are trying to do is to reduce the risks, to reduce the likelihood of this, to prevent more of these things from happening, to catch more of the wrongdoers," he said. "We can absolutely do that, and that should be the focus."

Ire and Votes: U.S. Vents Its Rage at Cuba In Trade Law

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
The bill that President Clinton signed this week penalizing foreign companies doing business with Cuba illustrates two of the most controversial trends in American trade policy.
The measure, which set off howls of protest from American trading partners, represents the latest of many attempts to extend the reach of United States law beyond the country's borders. 
 And it marks the fourth battle in 14 months between the Americans and the recently created World Trade Organization, the body that Washington did much to promote but which it now often seems reluctant to use or respect. The United States had billed the organization as the cornerstone of a reformed trading system that emerged from the Uruguay Round of negotiations that produced a new international trade accord near the end of 1994.
Since the World Trade Organization opened for business in January 1995, the United States has refused to join in the agreement it negotiated on freeing trade in financial services, saying that those provisions do not go far enough.
It has also ignored the organization's dispute-settlement procedures in a quarrel with Japan over auto parts, preferring to threaten Tokyo with sanctions.
And it is appealing an order to develop a plan to change a key feature of the Clean Air Act, which, the trade organization ruled, discriminated against gasoline imported from Venezuela.
Now the new law seeks to punish foreigners doing business with Cuba, an apparent violation of their right to trade freely under the Uruguay Round accords. Another bill, sponsored by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, would do the same thing to foreign companies selling oil and gas equipment to Iran and Libya. It is expected to soon win Congressional approval.
"The fundamental issue is whether the U.S. is willing to deal with a multilateral trading system in cooperation with other countries or whether it is veering off toward a more unilateral approach," said Jeffrey E. Garten, a former Clinton Administration Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, who is now dean of the Yale School of Management.
And Geoffrey Faux of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington observed: "The Administration has obscured the reality of the sovereignty loss implied by free trade. Free trade is good if it promotes exports and jobs, but constraining when it gets in the way of military and political objectives."
That inherent conflict becomes more apparent in a Presidential election year, when trade issues sometimes become entangled in sensitive foreign policy matters, as they have this year, several trade experts said.
In fact, President Clinton had fought tooth and nail against the law in question, the Cuba Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, until Cuba's downing of two civilian aircraft late last month seemed to make further resistance untenable. The Administration now maintains that the law is necessary to protect the country's national security interests.
It allows Cuban-Americans to file suits in American courts against foreign companies that benefit from expropriated Cuban property. The suits can seek punitive damages. The law also allows the banning from the United States of the officers of such companies and the barring of imported goods containing Cuban sugar and produce.
Mr. Clinton's price for signing the bill was a clause allowing him to suspend the right to bring such suits for periods of six months if he deems this to be in the national interest. Whether the President can afford to order such a suspension, affecting Cuban-Americans, in an election year is a matter of speculation.
The legislation's aim is to snuff out a small foreign investment boom -- mainly from Canada, Mexico and Spain -- that Cuba is now enjoying, denying it badly needed foreign exchange and in the process trying again to bring about the downfall of President Fidel Castro.
For other countries, however, the bill represents an attempt to export the United States' longstanding trade embargo against Cuba.
"The extraterritoriality of this act is objectionable because it seeks to use American courts to change other countries' policies," said Robert L. Muse, a Washington-based trade lawyer.
"We remain strongly opposed to this legislation," said Peter Guilford, trade spokesman for the 15-nation European Union, the world's largest free-trading area. "One of the principles of the W.T.O. is that you don't export your laws and your principles to other countries."
Europe's chief trade negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, is scheduled to discuss the matter next week with Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada and with Administration officials in Washington.
Although Cuba said it had formed 225 joint ventures with foreign companies by the end of 1995, most are small-scale tourist projects. Those of an industrial nature are thought to number only a few dozen.
Nevertheless, several foreign-owned multinational companies with important American interests could be vulnerable to suits under the new law, Mr. Muse said. He cited the big British confectionery concern Tate & Lyle, which buys Cuban sugar, and the British-American Tobacco Company, a unit of B.A.T. Industries P.L.C., which makes cigars in Cuba and has a subsidiary in Kentucky.
As many as 300,000 Cuban-Americans now have the right to sue, Mr. Muse estimated, adding that claims against the American assets of foreign companies doing business in Cuba could reach $95 billion.
"When the world realizes the scale of the threat, there will be a universal outcry against this pernicious bill," he declared.
Still, some European diplomats have expressed reluctance about filing a complaint under the World Trade Organization's dispute-settlement mechanism, fearing that such a move might only make a bad situation worse.
That is because the United States, in its arguments, could be expected to invoke Article 21 of the world trade agreement, a rarely used provision that allows members to take trade actions to protect their "essential security interests."
The risk, specialists say, is that a trade-dispute panel might feel unqualified to make a political judgment about American security needs, creating a devastating precedent for other countries to cite when flouting trade rules.
And that, said Gary C. Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, "could blow a huge hole in the Uruguay agreements."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Sharm el-Sheik Reality

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
It would take a heart of stone not to be moved with hope at the sight of the presidents, prime ministers and kings gathered at Sharm el-Sheik to denounce Hamas terrorism. Yes, and it would take a brain of mush not to see that the conference evaded major realities of fighting Hamas terrorism, and created a new one.
The hope is that because President Clinton has promised big results from the pageant, the participants will deliver antiterrorist achievements -- preferably before more bombs explode in Israeli streets. 
 But no matter how national leaders and human yearnings pump up the hopes, the conference will be just symbolism until somebody puts antiterrorism results where the conference mouth was. Somebody -- Mr. Clinton, Prime Minister Shimon Peres, the Saudi King, the German Chancellor, somebody. Maybe Yasir Arafat -- no, too foolish a thought.
But what the conference evaded or slid by remains real, not symbols.
The overriding reality is Israel's responsibility to defend its people against terrorism.
The Oslo agreement of 1993 brought benefits for Israel and Palestinians. For Israel: acceptance, if not recognition, from many Muslim states. For Palestinians: the road to independence.
But the Labor Government committed an error that almost literally has been ticking away ever since. It turned over the fight against terrorism from surrendered territories to the Palestine Liberation Organization, for decades a fount of terrorism.
Mr. Arafat had the tools to fight terrorists -- about 30,000 troops, economic and military aid pouring in from the West. Instead he gave them safe haven.
But there's none for Israel. Neither Mr. Peres's Labor Government nor the opposition Likud would try to retake land given up. But Likud would give up no more until Israel established on-the-spot responsibility for antiterrorist action in Gaza and the West Bank.
Mr. Peres hopes the conference can save him from that decision at least until the May elections. And he hopes Mr. Clinton's preference for him over Likud will swing enough Israelis to elect him.
Another reality touched on too lightly was the funding of Hamas and allied terrorists. It comes mostly from Iran, Libya and Syria. But now money comes also from private U.S. donations, as shown repeatedly by the Washington investigative journalist Steven Emerson.
For years, the U.S., plaintively and futilely, has asked Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Japan, all conference members, to stop the trade billions they pour into the countries that empower Hamas.
But can we expect one little favor? The next time terrorist killers like those taken from the Achille Lauro fall into Italian hands would Rome please not give three out of four of them leaves from jail so they can skip the country, one after another? That would be nice.
Some Arab states at the conference that also had been funding Hamas said "no more." Why anybody should believe them escapes me, since the U.S. Congress itself sees nothing wrong with funding Hamas.
Congress is destroying a bill that would have blocked money for terrorist groups. It is being done in by a combination of the gun lobby and the American Civil Liberties Union; together, new horizons beckon.
Now, about Mr. Arafat. Never did he give up his talk of holy war, of the martyrdom of terrorists -- until the spiritual atmosphere of the hotel at Sharm el-Sheik brought, presumably, epiphany.
As Hamas bombs were going off in Israel and later, Mr. Arafat's chief of security in Gaza held regular meetings with Hamas's chief of military operations, according to Yigal Carmon, a former counterintelligence adviser to Israeli prime ministers.
After the bombings, Mr. Arafat said right-wing Jews had helped Hamas. His aides keep talking about the "option" of renewed conflict with Israel. The other day, at a Washington hearing, his representative passed around a statement on a letterhead showing all Israel as Palestinian territory.
So -- at Sharm el-Sheik, Mr. Arafat received promises of lots more American help in addition to the hundreds of millions he has spent, or socked away.
That is the new Arafat reality. He was not skipped over at the conference. The man just won it.

HEADLINE: G.M. Strike Closes Plant In Tarrytown

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: NORTH TARRYTOWN, N.Y., March 14

 BODY:
Ripples from the distant General Motors strike in Ohio finally reached here today when the company shut down its gargantuan assembly plant looming over the Hudson River. But given the uncommon predicament of the 2,000 workers, the shutdown was as much insult as injury.
Workers at the plant, which has been here for eight decades and now assembles Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac mini-vans, have known for more than three years that it will shut down for good on June 28. In that time they have been bracing for a tumultuous change in their lives. 
 But they got an earlier taste than expected of things to come when G.M. sent workers home for an indefinite period because the factory -- like others around the country -- had run out of brake linings manufactured in the strikebound Dayton factories.
"First we were told we would work until June," said Maria Sieradzki, an assembly-line inspector in North Tarrytown who has been with G.M. for 11 years. "Now we could be closed sooner."
On Tuesday, the auto maker shut down its Linden, N.J., factory, which has 2,200 workers assembling trucks and four-wheel-drive vehicles. In fact, by 4 P.M. today, when an assembly plant in Bowling Green, Ky., also closed, 24 of G.M.'s 29 vehicle assembly plants were shuttered and 111,550 of its 240,000 workers were idle.
As their cars streamed out of the G.M. parking lot for the last time this week, and maybe longer, laid-off workers said they needed every day's pay to prepare for the life they will lead after June 28.
A majority of the 1,866 unionized workers at the plant here -- whose 2.5 million square feet make it bigger than the World Trade Center -- will be transferred to plants in Georgia and Maryland or be placed on a waiting list for work at the Linden plant. Many of the most senior people will retire.
Some of the transferred workers will need money to pay for moving, even though General Motors is providing moving allowances of $20,000 for those going to Georgia and as much as $60,000 for those going to a less desirable site in Baltimore. Others, like Joseph Leveille, a paint mixer whose stained hands showed he had recently been working on red cars, spoke of more immediate expenses, like mortgages and utility bills.
In Linden, where workers today picked up last week's paycheck and their 1995 profit-sharing checks of $814, Linda Heicklen, who has been tightening lug nuts on wheels for 19 years, breathed a sigh of relief. "That should help carry us through till we get back to work," she said.
But William Washington, 48, of Irvington, was angry.
"The bottom line is even if you get a profit-sharing check, you're still out of a job," said Mr. Washington. "Most of us still have mortgages and car payments and big bills. Profit-sharing helps for maybe a week."
Many workers said they were counting on unemployment benefits to help them get through the shutdown, but General Motors said today that it would fight workers' efforts to win such benefits, arguing that the shutdown was the result of a strike.
In North Tarrytown, the workers sympathized with the Dayton strikers, who walked off their jobs because General Motors has been farming out manufacturing of parts to cheaper, nonunionized plants in the United States and abroad in a process known as outsourcing.
"I support the strike because they're killing the union and killing jobs," said Harry Stevens, a worker with 33 years on the assembly line. "Outsourcing shouldn't be done."
The message was stressed in both North Tarrytown and Linden through signs placed at the employee parking-lot entrances. "No Foreign Vehicles Permitted," the sign in Linden said. "This Parking Lot Reserved for American Vehicles Only."
Otto Rivera, shop chairman of Local 664 of the United Automobile Workers, saw Machiavellian motives in today's shutdown. He pointed out that the national union's three-year contract with G.M. expires in September, and G.M., he said, may be showing its muscle now.
"Maybe this is just a power play," he said. "They're trying to flex some muscle before the negotiations. They're letting us know where they're coming from."
G.M. decided on a permanent shutdown of the North Tarrytown plant in February 1992, when there were 3,450 workers there. The decision came as G.M.'s share of the automobile market was declining and when mini-vans were not selling as briskly as hoped. Since then, the fortunes of both G.M. and the mini-van have turned around, but the company has not gone back on its decision. It agreed only to a one-year extension until this summer.
Among the workers idled today are 615 temporary workers who were hired to fill assembly jobs of workers already transferred.
For Alton Armwood, a temporary worker who receives $120 a day and is getting engaged in April, today's shutdown was a blow to his spirit as much as to his wallet.
"I like to work," he said, "I'm not used to just staying home and doing nothing. I'm used to getting up at 4:45 A.M."

HEADLINE: Across Nation, Scores of Workers Affected

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, March 14

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation and its outside suppliers have laid off tens of thousands of automobile parts workers across North America as a nine-day-old brake-factory strike here continues to cripple the world's largest auto maker.
G.M. announced today that it had temporarily laid off 47,900 parts workers this week, in addition to the 70,750 assembly plant workers idled by the strike so far. A shortage of brakes has forced G.M. to close 24 of its 29 assembly plants in North America, including a mini-van factory in North Tarrytown, N.Y., that shut down today and laid off 2,000 workers. 
 Even G.M. does not know exactly how many workers have been laid off by its 1,600 suppliers. But executives in the auto parts industry said today that they were increasingly feeling the effects of the strike, after trying for the first week of the work stoppage to keep their factories busy producing extra parts for their inventories.
TRW Inc., based in Cleveland, laid off 350 workers today at a Mexican seat-belt factory. Allied Signal Inc., based in Morristown, N.J., has laid off 570 workers at air-bag and seat-belt factories in Tennessee, Michigan and Alabama. And Johnson Controls Inc., based in Milwaukee, has closed car-seat factories in Tennessee, Louisiana, Ohio, Indiana and Maryland, laying off a total of 1,100 workers.
All these companies said they planned to rehire their workers when G.M. reopened its factories.
There was little if any progress today in efforts to end the strike by close to 3,200 members of the United Automobile Workers union at two G.M. brake factories here that supply parts for almost all of G.M.'s cars and trucks. Negotiators for G.M. and the union did not even meet here today, although informal talks continued in Detroit.
G.M. announced this evening that it would ask state employment departments across the country to deny unemployment benefits to U.A.W. workers laid off because of the Dayton strike. G.M. has occasionally taken similar action in previous strikes. although not in the last several years. Most states have rules either barring unemployment benefits to striking workers or requiring that they be on strike for many weeks before becoming eligible.
"Since G.M. is assessed the cost of state unemployment compensation, we don't believe we should finance a strike against ourselves," said John F. Mueller, a company spokesman. About two-thirds of the laid-off workers belong to the union. Each state will make a separate decision on whether to grant G.M.'s request.
Reg McGhee, a U.A.W. spokesman in Detroit, said the union would review G.M.'s move but had no immediate reaction.
The dispute here is over the auto maker's decision to hire few high-wage U.A.W. workers in Dayton while pushing the current workers to put in seven-day weeks and subcontracting brake work to lower-cost, nonunion companies. Harry J. Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman, said in an interview earlier this week that the company needed to hold down its parts purchasing costs.
Because the current work stoppage started in Dayton, G.M.'s suppliers here have suffered the most.
A few workers sat idle this morning on the front steps of the Mayo Plating and Manufacturing Inc. warehouse here, a huge, steel-sided building with pink and white walls that stand out in the gray and brown desolation of Dayton's industrial south side in late winter. Until last week, 75 workers here cleaned and sorted bright orange, blue and black plastic trays the size of card tables. The trays are used to carry parts from suppliers to assembly lines, and have slots that match various sizes and shapes of parts.
Mayo laid off 40 of the 75 workers here on Tuesday, and may lay off 20 more on Friday if the strike does not end soon, said Harry L. Mayo Jr., the general manager of the company. The Dayton-based business sorts trays for 200 G.M. suppliers in southeastern Ohio, and all of them are worried, he said.
"Everybody is cautiously scaling down, with the assumption that things may pick back up and you have to be ready," he said, adding that if the strike lasted into next week, "That's when you'll see a cataclysmic effect."

HEADLINE: Transit Chief Warns of Cuts In Service

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
After months of assurances from transit officials that there would be no more cuts in subway and bus service until 2000 or beyond, the new president of the Transit Authority warned yesterday that he might have to cut service to balance the authority's budget.
The warning by Lawrence G. Reuter, who took over the Transit Authority on Monday, came just a few months after declining city, state and Federal subsidies led to the first widespread service cuts in two decades and the first fare increase in almost four years. In calling for the fare increase, transit officials had said it was part of a financial plan that would prevent the need for any additional service cuts for five years. 
 But in a wide-ranging interview with reporters yesterday, Mr. Reuter said, "there could be some service reductions." He stressed that he would look first at cutting administration and wringing cost-cutting concessions from the unions.
Cutting service, he said, would be considered only "as the last resort to balance the budget." He did not say when that decision might have to be made, though with this year's budget looking fairly secure, it appears certain that such cuts would not happen for some time.
Mr. Reuter, who oversaw service cuts as chief of the Washington transit agency, later said that he meant that service cuts would be considered "only if factors outside of our control affected the financial plan," like further reductions in Federal aid.
Mr. Reuter's assessment of the Transit Authority's fiscal health was stark. "We've got some very serious and tremendous challenges, as I look at the financial situation," he said. "There will be some downsizing of the organization. I think ultimately, there will be some service changes."
He said that he would not allow the transit system to fall into disrepair, but that if all else failed, he might have to consider steps like eliminating lightly traveled bus lines and closing little-used subway stations. He also said he would study whether it made sense to continue operating the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, a short, decrepit subway line in Brooklyn with a small ridership that has been proposed for closing several times, but saved each time by neighborhood protests.
His remarks were a shift from what has been heard recently from the leaders of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency. Mr. Reuter's boss, E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A. chairman, has insisted that there will be no service cuts at least through the end of 1999, and he repeated that assertion yesterday.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said, "Both Mr. Conway and Mr. Reuter have assured us that the current financial plan will not result in any need for a cut in service."
Since 1989, the authority's staff has dropped by 5,000, to about 38,000, and 1,500 more jobs are slated for elimination this year. In the same period, its operating budget, which is about $3 billion a year, has shrunk by about 20 percent when adjusted for inflation.
In the last year, the Transit Authority has lost about $300 million a year in city, state and Federal subsidies. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani eliminated most of the city's support for free student transit passes, Congress cut all mass transit subsidies and may eliminate them entirely, and Governor Pataki reduced support for the Transit Authority while increasing it for every other transit agency in the state.
Last year, the M.T.A. ordered a round of budget cuts that included less service on 11 subway lines, elimination of several bus lines and reduction in the cleaning and maintenance staffs. It also raised the fare 25 cents, to $1.50.
Mr. Conway proposed the fare increase last August as part of a five-year financial plan that he said would mean no more service cuts or fare increases at least through 1999. It also promised $7.3 billion in capital improvements from 1997 through 1999, despite the state's signaling that it would contribute no new money to that effort. The capital program would be paid for largely by borrowing billions of dollars, and by diverting billions more from sources of money that are now used for day-to-day operations.
All this would be accomplished, Mr. Conway said, by cutting costs by $500 million a year, without any harm to service and with none of the deferred maintenance that led to the subway system's near-collapse in the 1970's. Much of that savings is expected to come from labor, and in fact, the Transit Authority's 1996 budget assumes that by the middle of the year, the unions will have agreed to $100 million a year worth of concessions like changes in work rules and allowing part-time employees.
Almost from the day it was released, Mr. Conway's plan was derided by former transit officials and riders' groups as a prescription for higher fares, poorer service, deferred maintenance, a mountain of debt or a combination of those factors.
Some of the sharpest criticism came from Robert R. Kiley, who, as M.T.A. chairman from 1983 to 1990, presided over the rebuilding of the subway system from its nadir.
"Reuter knows what everyone else knows about the finances, and he's being honest, saying cutting service is the last he wants to do, but he can't rule it out," said Mr. Kiley, who is now the executive director of the New York City Partnership, an alliance of corporate executives.
Informed of Mr. Reuter's remarks yesterday, Beverly J. Dolinsky, executive director of the Transit Riders Council and a nonvoting member of the M.T.A. board, said: "This is what we've been saying all along. It's a huge amount of money they've got to come up with, and I don't know how they're going to do it."
Ms. Dolinsky predicted that there would be no cuts before the gubernatorial election in November, 1998, because "Virgil is the Governor's person."

HEADLINE: Clinton Plays Politics In Minority Contracts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Clinton Administration's imposition of a three-year moratorium on any new Federal programs that reserve some contracts for companies owned by ethnic minorities and women (news article, March 8) sends an alarming message to the nation's black-owned businesses: that the enforcement of measures designed to increase the participation of African-Americans in the business of the Federal Government might be sacrificed for political expediency this election year. 
 Along with the refusal to commit desperately needed resources to the economic revitalization of the nation's cities, this is another step toward a devastating divestiture of economic resources away from black communities.
The Administration's moratorium concedes undeserved moral ground to the Republican Party on the issue of affirmative action.
It also gives pause to African-American voters whose enthusiastic turnout in November will be critical to President Clinton's re-election chances.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Tax Cuts Have Worked

BYLINE: By Timothy J. Goodspeed and Peter D. Salins; Timothy J. Goodspeed is a professor of economics at Hunter College. Peter D. Salins is a professor of urban planning at Hunter and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

 BODY:
States around the country are cutting taxes, and no state has received more attention than New Jersey, where Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's income tax cuts have made her a rising Republican star. But because all states pass most of their revenues back to local governments, critics say that states' cuts will force local property taxes to rise -- leaving taxpayers no better off.
A study we have done on New Jersey's taxes for the Manhattan Institute indicates that such criticism is unjustified. We found that in the majority of towns and cities, property taxes have not risen since Governor Whitman's cuts took effect. Even in the municipalities that have raised taxes, property owners are still saving money and will continue to do so. 
 If there is any place where cutting state taxes would force cities and towns to raise their own levies, it is the Garden State; 90 percent of state income tax money goes directly to municipalities, which spend most of it on schools. Local governments' only other source of tax revenue isproperty taxes.
Yet even before the recent cuts, there was little relationship between state and local taxes. Between 1985 and 1990, local property taxes grew steadily 6 percent to 8 percent each year, adjusted for inflation. But over that period state income taxes fluctuated widely, increasing by more than 20 percent in real terms in 1987 and falling the next year by 5 percent.
Likewise, higher income taxes haven't meant lower local taxes. In 1991, Gov. Jim Florio raised income taxes sharply -- revenues increased by 10 and 17 percent in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Property taxes did fall slightly in 1991 but then increased at a steady real rate of 1 percent to 2 percent each year through 1994.
So how will lower income taxes affect local governments? Our study of 509 school districts from 1991 through 1995 shows that reduced state revenues will cause overall property taxes to go up slightly but that the rise will be far less than the state tax savings. If present trends continue, for every dollar the average New Jerseyan's income taxes are cut, he or she will have to pay only an extra 22 cents in local taxes.
In fact, in 1995, the first full year of the Whitman tax cuts, the property taxes of 310 of the 509 districts did not go up at all (when adjusted for inflation).
Why don't reductions in state aid force local taxes to shoot up? Because local officials are likely to spend as much as they can when the entire state's taxpayers are picking up the tab. But when state aid declines, local taxpayers are reluctant to pay more, so municipalities tighten their belts.
Yes, in some towns this has led to lower spending on schools. Yet our data show that in 93 districts school spending did not fall, even after state taxes were cut. Many of these were the state's poorest communities, which receive more state aid than wealthier districts. But even many middle-income and affluent towns have been able to hold expenditures steady. A typical household in Summit, a wealthy town, saved about $210 in state income taxes in 1995, but its property taxes didn't go up and school spending didn't fall.
So New Jersey taxpayers can look forward to the best of all worlds: sharp reductions in state income taxes, modest increases in local property taxes and plenty of leeway to determine how much they -- not other state taxpayers -- should spend on schools and other local services. Other states would do well to ignore the critics and learn from New Jersey that they can cut state taxes without forcing up local taxes.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises vs. Mark and Yen Over Taiwan Tension Rumors

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher against the German mark and Japanese yen yesterday after seesawing on fresh economic reports and rumors related to tensions between China and Taiwan.
Early in the day, the dollar fell sharply against the mark, hit mainly by one large seller, dealers said. The dollar also came under pressure from a selloff in the bond market after economic data pointed to strength in the economy. 
 The dollar then revered course. A brief dip below 1.47 marks spurred strong buying interest, which turned the dollar around to make highs for the day at 1.478 marks.
Some of the buying was fueled by rumors in the market of an incident involving a United States vessel or aircraft in the Taiwan Strait, where China has been conducting war games to discourage any move by Taiwan toward independence.
The rumors were quickly put down by the White House, which said it had no evidence of any such incident. The dollar came off its highs shortly after the statement. Traders often buy dollars as a secure investment during times of turmoil.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar edged up to 105.93 Japanese yen from 105.50 yen on Thursday. The dollar was quoted at 1.4725 German marks, up from 1.4708 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5265 from $1.5292.
Treasury prices fell sharply after several economic reports, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond to 6.74 percent, from 6.69 percent Thursday. In one, the Federal Reserve reported industrial production jumped 1.2 percent in February, the biggest rise in nearly eight and a half years. The report indicated that the economy was too strong for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, as the bond market had expected. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell, pushing its yield up to 6.73 percent from 6.68 percent.
"The selling off the industrial production, with bonds coming down, weighed on the dollar," said Richard Marrow, a currency dealer at Midland Bank.
In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.1855 Swiss francs, from 1.1869 on Thursday, and to 5.0430 French francs, from 5.0445. It also fell to 1,562 Italian lire from 1,565.

HEADLINE: Technology Stocks Rally, But Dow Falls 1.09 Points

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks closed one of the most active sessions ever with small losses yesterday on trading that was largely linked to the expiration of futures, index futures and stock options, known as a triple witching.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 1.09 points lower at 5,584.97 after bouncing back from an early morning loss of 35 points. For the week, the Dow was up 114.52 points. 
 In the broader market, declining issues led advances, 1,249 to 1,111, on very heavy trading of 536.9 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange -- the sixth-most-active trading session ever.
Analysts said technology stocks powered ahead on speculation the group would turn out more solid earnings.
The Nasdaq composite index, which has many high-technology shares, rose 8.52 points, to 1,099.59, despite earnings reports from Micron Technology and Oracle that fell short of expectations. Micron rose 3 1/2, to 32 5/8, and Oracle rose 3/4, to 48 7/8.
On the Big Board, I.B.M. rose 3, to 119 7/8, Compaq added 1, to 39 3/4, and Motorola climbed 1 3/4, to 55 5/8.
"Techs are trying to regain the leadership role they held for most of 1995," said Guy Truicko, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management Inc. He said technology stocks were expected to benefit from an improving economy.
There was more good news about the economy.
Industrial production rebounded sharply in February after a storm-weakened January, and consumers grew more optimistic in March, economic reports showed.
Separately, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent last month, suggesting inflation remained well in check.
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities jumped 1.2 percent after a revised four-tenths of 1 percent drop in January, when blizzards caused many plants on the East Coast to close. The jump was the biggest since a rise of 1.3 percent in October 1987, the Fed said in its report.
A separate survey by the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index jumped to 95.7 in March from 88.5 in February, implying a possible rise in spending ahead that would fuel growth and lessen the need for more rate cuts.
Economists said the data were in tune with the surprisingly strong February jobs report released the previous Friday.
The upbeat reports, which reduced the chances that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates soon, hurt the bond market.
The 30-year bond dropped 18/32, to 9019/32, sending its yield up to 6.73 percent, from 6.68 percent on Thursday. It was the highest yield since Aug. 24.
"The bonds are down on the news about the economy, but the big story continues to be that the stock market is somewhat immune to the weakness in bonds," said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane.
Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker, said a decoupling of stocks and bonds would be negative.
"That's what happened in 1987" before the market crash," he said, adding, "That would highlight the extended valuation in stocks."
Stronger technology shares included Hewlett-Packard up 4 1/4, to 99 7/8, and Microsoft up 2 3/4, to 102 3/8.
Semiconductor makers were aided by a stabilization of memory chip prices. Intel rose 2 3/4, to 58 7/8; Texas Instruments added 2 7/8, to 52 1/2; LSI Logic climbed 2, to 28 1/4, and Applied Materials jumped 2 5/8, to 34 5/8.
Among individual issues, Philip Morris rose 2 7/8, to 95 3/8, rebounding from a 9-point loss in the last two sessions.
Tobacco shares have been hit by news on Wednesday of the agreement by Liggett Group to settle its part in the biggest liability case pending against the tobacco industry.
Lidak Pharmaceuticals plunged 23/16, to 2 1/2, after preliminary test results showed little difference between its oral herpes treatment Lidakol and a placebo.
Prism Solutions, a designer of data warehouse management software, soared 7 1/2, to 24 1/2, in its first day of trading.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.56, to 641.43. The American Stock Exchange index was off 0.27 at 561.51.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.01, to 343.39. The average share was unchanged.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of New York Stock Exchange, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,315.527, up 8.864, or 0.14 percent.

HEADLINE: Jet Skis vs. Peace on Islands in Battle of San Juan County

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: FRIDAY HARBOR, Wash., March 14

 BODY:
Over the last decade, the drone of Jet Skis, Wave Runners and other high-powered wet bikes has come to virtually every waterway in the United States, bringing with it a conflict that may be the recreational equivalent of smoking versus nonsmoking in public spaces.
But it was not until these small personal watercraft began buzzing around quiet bays and sheltered inlets of the San Juan Islands that what may be the most polarizing of all Jet Ski battles was joined. 
 A county of 172 islands at the far northwestern corner of the contiguous states, the San Juans are known for their mischievous resident orca whales in the water and quirky resident iconoclasts on the land. These islands, connected only by boat or float plane to the mainland, seem to embody the liquid Northwest.
On any given day, the cold waters of San Juan County are plied by tiny kayaks and luxury yachts, cedar canoes and 19th-century schooners, salmon trawlers and tour boats -- even the occasional rustbucket Navy vessel, long-retired and sold as surplus. But one thing that is no longer here are personal watercraft.
In one of the most sweeping measures enacted anywhere against such craft, San Juan County last month banned all Jet Skis and similar vessels from its waters. The future of San Juan County, its way of life, its solitude and tourism-based economy, its surfeit of writers, artists and other solo-minded entrepreneurs -- all is at stake in the battle to keep the zippy little boats out of the islands, county commissioners said.
What they are seeking, they say, is a Jet Ski-free archipelago.
"We acted to pre-empt something that was threatening the very lifeblood of this county," said Rhea Miller, one of three San Juan County Commissioners, the governing body of the islands. "We are a very unique place on the face of the earth. You take away what makes this place special, and you're just like any other place in America."
Across the country, other cities, counties, parks and governing bodies have tried to limit the jet-fired small craft, which can reach speeds of more than 60 miles an hour. But industry officials say no jurisdiction has gone as far as San Juan County -- with an outright ban.
It comes as personal watercraft sales have reached record highs, with nearly a million units sold for at least $4,000 a piece, accounting for 34 percent of all boat sales last year. And the industry, including corporate giants like Kawasaki and Yamaha, has taken up the battle.
Two weeks ago, the personal watercraft trade association, joined by individual dealers, filed suit against San Juan County, seeking an injunction. A threat to jet skiers in one area is a threat to all, they said, a point that gives the San Juan battle significance to the other areas awaiting the outcome.
"It's as if one city banned the sale of Chevrolets," said John Birkinbine, the executive director of the Personal Watercraft Industry Association, a trade group based in Chicago that represents the six major manufacturers of personal watercraft. "What they've done is discriminatory. I don't know of anything that could be more extreme."
Industry officials say the ban, which carries fines up to $200, prohibits people from "exercising their fundamental constitutional rights of interstate travel."
San Juan County's prosecutor, Randy Gaylord, says there is no interstate travel ban -- people are free to come and go among the islands. What is banned is one mode of travel -- Jet Skis and similar craft, he says.
"This is a question of local control -- of how counties can protect their health, safety and general welfare," Mr. Gaylord said. "We're a small county, and a small office. We don't have a lot of horsepower to fight these people. But we think we're on solid ground."
Echoing the sentiments of nearly one-fourth of all registered voters in this county who signed a petition asking for the ban, Mr. Gaylord said, "There are plenty of places where you can operate these craft, so you don't need to invade the last few special places as well."
All this fuss may seem out of place for a fight that some say is little more than a battle of one toy over another. Not so, say islanders, who see it as a stirring David vs. Goliath battle. In the ordinance banning the craft, a passage from Washington State's labor department is cited, noting that the island economy is based on its reputation as a "tranquil oasis."
A full 40 percent of the 12,000 or so people who live in San Juan County are self-employed, typically working out of their homes, county officials said. Those people need peace and quiet to work and think, they say.
"I used to live in Key Largo, Fla., and jet skiers took over there," said Jim Skoog, a writer, sailor and boat builder who led the petition drive along with another islander, Mary Ann Anderson. "Then I lived in Australia, and saw what happened there. I moved here for the very qualities that attracted other people -- the tranquility, the lack of urban background clutter."
People who ride Jet Skis, Mr. Skoog said, "are nautical illiterates -- despised by almost all other boaters. All you need to ride one is a bank card."
Newer models make only about as much noise as a vacuum, industry officials say.
But opponents say the sound is unbearably magnified when the jet skiers travel in groups, whooping and jumping out of the water. Also maddening, they say, is the repetition of listening to a jet skier making endless laps and circles.
"It's the incessant, whining pattern of these things," the county commissioner, Ms. Miller said in an interview. "There's a pitch that's extremely irritating."
As deaths have risen, safety was cited in the San Juan ordinance. In 1994, the last full year for statistics, the Coast Guard reported that 56 people nationwide were killed from accidents involving personal watercraft -- up from 35 the year before.
Mr. Birkinbine said that more people died from canoe accidents that year -- the deaths were reported at 59 -- than from personal watercraft. And while it is true that in some states the minimum age to ride personal watercraft is 12, the industry favors raising that to 16, he said.
In the debate over the ban, a lone commissioner, Thomas Starr, argued against it. As a motorcycle rider himself, Mr. Starr said there is a special thrill to getting out in open territory, at a fast speed.
"We all have different interpretations of our pursuit of happiness," Mr. Starr said.
Even with its small, three-person legal staff, the San Juan County prosecutor's office plans to fight the industry lawsuit as far as necessary. It is of such interest here, he said, that people have been making donations to the prosecutor's office.
But the makers of personal watercraft say this county, sitting at the edge of the continent, cannot fight progress. "Other opponents have faded away as they have become more like us," Mr. Birkinbine said. "Times change, and they will just have to get used to it."

HEADLINE: Sudanese Vote, Sourly, as Islamic Fervor Chafes

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, March 14

 BODY:
Like many northern Sudanese, Siddiq Sidahmed Hassan considers himself a good Muslim. He favors traditional flowing Arab clothes, as white as pure faith, and prostrates himself to Mecca five times a day without fail.
But the 49-year-old shopkeeper does not share his Government's conviction that Islam should be spread to other countries or that the United States is evil. He fondly recalls working for an American oil company, and carries a laminated card in his breast pocket that shows he is a longstanding member of the Sudanese-American Friendship Society. 
 "Most people in the Sudan do not hate the United States," he said. "At first this Government was popular, but after one or two years it lost most of its popularity because they used the Islamic religion very badly."
Mr. Hassan's attitudes reflect a deep ambivalence among many citizens toward the Islamic military leaders who seized power in 1989.
Diplomats say that ambivalence pervades even the Government's upper echelons, where there is a quiet debate between pragmatists who want to mend fences with the West, and ideologues who preach holy war against America and Israel.
For the first time since the coup,the Sudan has been holding elections, which began on March 6 and will end on Monday. To hear Sudanese leaders tell it, they are trying to transform the military Government into a nonpartisan and strictly Islamic democracy, free of the sectarian politics that have hobbled the country.
The outcome is not in doubt. Lieut. Gen. Omar Ahmed al-Bashir, the current President, is sure to win among 42 candidates, most of them unknown because political parties are banned and the campaign lasted only 12 days. Several leaders of the former Government have denounced the vote as a sham.
But the polling also seems intended to persuade the world that the National Islamic Front, led by Hassan al-Turabi, has won a popular mandate with its brand of Islamic government, diplomats said.
"The election is one element of the leadership's attempt to be accepted again," said one diplomat. "They need to break up the isolation. They need hard currency to stay in power."
All week the turnout of voters has been low, and the mood in the dusty, oven-hot capital was sour and cynical. In interviews, Sudanese lawyers, students, intellectuals and merchants said the Government had become more unpopular not only because its Islamic bent had crimped personal freedoms, but also because the economy was limping along, hampered by devaluation and inflation.
Diplomats and Sudanese politicians said it was unclear how much support Dr. Turabi enjoys for his version of a strict Islamic state. Although Islam was always deeply imbedded in the society of the north, most Sudanese are Sufis, who are known for tolerance rather than militant fundamentalism.
To be sure, the Sudan has become more conservative on the surface since the National Islamic Front embarked on building a Government ruled by Muslim law.
Khartoum's bars and discos are shuttered. Women who dare to walk the streets in slacks or without a head-covering are often stopped by the front's security force and taken to police stations. Young couples courting in public say they are frequently harassed as well. College students said the police break up parties in private homes and confiscate liquor, and have at times horsewhipped the organizers.
The nation's laws now embrace sharia, a Koranic code that includes harsh penalties for some crimes, like death by hanging for adulterers and the amputation of a hand for thieves.
Some here say the Islamization has been largely cosmetic. Judges have proved reluctant to impose the penalties sharia prescribes, and it is difficult to prove a crime under the law. To prove adultery, for instance, four grown men must witness the sex act at the same time.
"I have not heard of anybody who was hanged or stoned to death because of adultery," said Chief Justice Obeid Hag Ali, explaining that sharia is "more of a threat intended to regulate society."
The fundamentalism is thriving in some rural areas, however, especially among the poor.
In Ombuda, a village outside Khartoum, the faithful send their children to Koranic boarding school.
On a recent afternoon, 762 pupils between the ages of 3 and 16 squatted in the shady spots of a sweltering dirt courtyard. For three hours at a stretch, they studied Koranic verses. Some younger children wore shackles around their ankles.
"They tried to run home," explained a teacher. "Their parents said they should wear the shackles until they learn the Koran."
At Niilen University in Khartoum, some true believers in the National Islamic Front could be found in a cafeteria. Duria Tajelsir, 21, a computer science major from the small town of Shendi, echoed the views of her three companions when she said: "I would like to build an Islamic country. It's our instruction from God."
But in other ways, the Government has modernized society, diplomats said. By most measures, it has done a better job than previous administrations in meeting basic needs. Electrical power is plentiful, the telephones work, the streets are fixed, crime is down and the marketplaces are full of essential goods.
Few here think the Government is likely to be challenged soon, diplomats said. The National Islamic Front is too well organized and entrenched, with its own militia and a separate security service outside of the police and military.
Still, its popularity has plummeted. The Government's support for militant Islamic groups like Hamas has left it increasingly isolated from Western democracies, hurting the economy and reducing foreign aid and investment.
For average Sudanese, this new era of militancy has meant, more than anything else, that their money is becoming worthless. In the 1970's, the Sudanese pound was worth about $3; today, it takes about 1,300 pounds to buy a single dollar.
To make matters worse, merchants and business owners complain that a small group of Islamic business people with connections to the ruling party are reaping huge profits and getting special breaks on tariffs and loans, while others struggle to get by.
"Nothing works but their companies," said Shomo Ibrahim Shomo, 48, who owns a stationery store in Khartoum. "They get exemptions from customs."
For the Sudanese Government to survive, many here say, it must attract hard currency and foreign investment, and to do that it must patch up its relations with the West.
"Sudan can't survive without foreign investment," said a senior Sudanese economist. "Investment won't come in such a climate. People who control the world market do not want to invest in Sudan."
Diplomats say there are signs the Government has debated loosening its ties with Islamic militants in an effort to avoid United Nations sanctions and regain American economic aid, which was cut off in 1993 after the State Department added the Sudan to a list of countries that sponsor terrorism. But there is no evidence of such a change, and the Foreign Minister said this week that Palestinian Hamas officials would continue to receive refugee status.
The economic problem has been aggravated by the continuing war against Christian and animist rebels in the south, diplomats said. The World Bank has estimated that the Sudan needs $600 million to $800 million in foreign exchange each year to keep basic services operating and to continue the war. The best estimate is that the country is earning about $350 million.
For his part, Dr. Turabi has put a brave face on the problem, saying the Sudan is rich enough to be self-sufficient. He boasts that isolation will force the country to develop its own industries.
"Economic isolation is very positive," he said in a recent interview. "Every new rise of civilization is encircled at first."
But other ruling party members sound more conciliatory. Ghazi -Salaheldin Atabani, president of the National Congress, the nation's top political body, said the Sudan had been courting Asian countries as relations with the West foundered over terrorism. But he added that after the vote, the Sudan will probably move to improve relations with Europe, and possibly even with the United States.
"I would envision some fence-mending with the West itself," he said. "We are not in principle against fence-mending."

HEADLINE: In Heavy Smoking, Grim Portent for China

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 15

 BODY:
Rushing down a Beijing alleyway where a north wind was kicking up dust among the vegetable stands and cigarette vendors, Huang Jinhui, 25, paused to explain to a stranger why he smokes.
"Man must smoke," said Mr. Huang, a young barber from Sichuan Province in central China. 
 "I know that smoking is not a good habit, that it's harmful to your health," he added. "But I have no choice. To carry on social relationships and to do business, I have to smoke."
In a nearby alleyway restaurant, where the tables were littered with empty beer bottles and oily plates and the air was a gauze of tobacco smoke, Fu Li, a young woman from Henan Province, fiddled self-consciously with her cigarette.
"In the very beginning, it was just for fun," she said of her habit. "When you play mah-jongg with friends, if someone offers you one, you cannot refuse. I never really think about the consequences."
Few Chinese do, but that may be changing.
China today has the biggest smoking habit in the world, with an estimated 300 million smokers out of 900 million adults, accounting for 30 percent of the world's consumption of tobacco.
The per-capita consumption of Chinese smokers still lags behind some industrial countries, where as many as 22 cigarettes a day is the norm among smokers, but China is rapidly catching up. The average Chinese smoker went from 12 cigarettes a day a decade ago to 16 today.
The governing Communist Party, which has built its legitimacy on doing a better job for the social welfare of the 1.2 billion Chinese than all the emperors and dictators of old, will soon be confronted with an epidemic of lung cancer and respiratory and heart diseases that threatens to overwhelm its health establishment.
The Government has recently begun to mobilize a national campaign against smoking. But this effort runs against a powerful tide of interests vested in the vast state-owned tobacco monopoly, which has become the world's largest cigarette producer and whose tax revenues are the Government's single greatest income source -- $8.6 billion in 1995.
"The tobacco industry is the No. 1 pillar of China's economic development, and so it is going to be a little difficult for us to get the smoking levels down in the near future," said Zhou Wei, a Public Health Ministry official assigned to combat smoking.
The Government has banned tobacco advertisements from television, magazines and newspapers, but sports events are festooned with the trappings of tobacco products, as are billboards throughout the country. Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities will try to enforce a ban on all smoking in public places, but health advocates, not to mention ordinary Chinese, are skeptical.
The consequences of China's growing fondness for tobacco appear to be staggering.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta say lung cancer rates are increasing 4.5 percent a year in China and estimate that by 2025, two million Chinese will die of smoking-related illnesses each year -- four times the number of deaths today.
China's smoking explosion has come much later than the West's, and so too will the medical consequences.
"In the West, we didn't see the full male lung cancer epidemic until the 1980's," said Richard Peto, an epidemiologist at Oxford University. Those cancers, he said, were spawned by the postwar increase in smoking, between 1945 and 1965, and by the time the crisis hit, smoking rates already were in decline. In China, per-capita tobacco consumption continues to rise.
"In the mid-1980's, I predicted that the risks from smoking in China were rather less than among British or American smokers," said Dr. Peto, largely because daily consumption levels were only half what they were in Western countries.
"But with more detailed evidence now available," he continued, "we are saying that the risk is not less than for British or American smokers, and therefore at least 50 million of the children now living in China will be killed by tobacco."
When the Communists swept into power in Beijing in October 1949, China's male population represented about 10 percent of the adult population in the world and smoked about 10 percent of the cigarettes consumed. Today, Chinese men are still roughly 10 percent of the world population, but they consume nearly a third of the world's cigarettes.
Some 61 percent of adult males smoke in China, but only 7 percent of the women, according to the World Health Organization. (By comparison, 28 percent of American men smoke, and 24 percent of women.)
But that big disparity between the sexes, too, is changing. More and more college and high school-age girls are embracing Western notions of women's independence, and cigarettes, along with bright makeup and tight jeans, have become symbols of the modern Chinese woman.
"China is about at the stage where the United States was in the 1940's and 1950's, where you have got very high male smoking rates and very few women smokers," said Judith Mackay, a Hong Kong-based doctor.
As young women take up the habit, it will only get worse.
"If the Chinese smoke like Americans, then they will die like Americans," Dr. Peto said.
Xiping Xu, an expert on China at Harvard University's School of Public Health, said: "My biggest concern is that more and more high school and college students are smoking. There is a lot of social pressure, and even the girl students are smoking."
It has not helped that many Chinese icons, including Deng Xiaoping, the country's 91-year-old paramount leader, are lifelong smokers.
Mr. Deng, whose health has seriously declined since 1993, is believed to have finally given up the habit, but his public image as a hard-grit revolutionary who rolled his cigarettes in newspaper engenders more admiration in China than opprobrium.
Prime Minister Li Peng, however, has adopted a higher anti-smoking profile. As 3,000 delegates to China's National People's Congress, or parliament, gathered in the Great Hall of the People last week, Mr. Li chastised 100 deputies from Shandong Province when he found cigarettes for sale in their meeting room. "Selling cigarettes here?" he asked, noting that Beijing was preparing to enforce a ban on smoking in all public places and that this year's session of the parliament was supposed to be smoke free.
Wang Jinquan, who works for Beijing's housing department, said: "I started to smoke when I was in high school. My father died at that time, and I felt so bad, people told me to smoke and relax."
Looking more harried than relaxed, Mr. Wang added: "In our hometown almost every person smokes. You know, it is easier to make business, or to make friends, when you draw out a cigarette and offer it to others. Without cigarettes and drinks, you can't get anything done in our town."
Even among doctors, smoking is on the increase in China.
Li Chunjiu, 58, a surgeon at Beijing Hospital, says he got his smoking habit from a fear of snakes.
When a huge flood struck central China five years ago, Dr. Li joined a team of 10 doctors and nurses who rushed there to help. But news that the flood zone was crawling with snakes set him shivering.
"I heard that snakes are scared of cigarette smoke and the local farmers even lay tobacco leaves on the paths to keep the snakes away, so that is why I started smoking at the time," he said. "But I haven't been able to quit."
A pack of Chinese cigarettes costs as little as a nickel in the Chinese countryside and in the cities the best brands are less than 50 cents. Foreign brands, like Marlboro and Winston, cost more than $1.50 a pack because of high tariffs, which in turn have given rise to a robust smuggling industry.
For all their attraction, foreign brand cigarettes have only a tiny share of the legal Chinese market, 2 percent or less, said Robert Fletcher, chairman of the Tobacco Institute in Hong Kong. Still, policy advocates fear the aggressive marketing and advertising schemes of Western tobacco giants.
Should China drop its barriers to foreign tobacco to enter the World Trade Organization, American and British tobacco companies are prepared.
"It wouldn't matter if every single smoker in America quit tomorrow," Dr. Mackay said, "because the tobacco companies would have found a much bigger market."

The 'Too Jewish' Question

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
As the upwardly mobile mobbed Sotheby's last week to get their hands on the American consumer's ultimate porno -- the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis auction catalogue -- I was some blocks away on the Upper East Side contemplating Barbra Streisand's nose.
Ms. Streisand's nose was enshrined at the Jewish Museum on Fifth Avenue on a huge canvas titled "Four Barbras (the Jewish Jackie Series)" -- a spoof of Andy Warhol's silk-screen Jackie O. series, with a repeated head shot of the star, seen in profile, substituting for the First Lady. Jackie Kennedy and Barbra Streisand, it must be remembered, became famous at the same time, at the dawn of the 60's. But Ms. Streisand never joined Jackie and Liz and Marilyn in the glamorous Pop Art pantheon of the era, as defined by Warhol. Her nose, perhaps, just wouldn't do. 
 "Four Barbras" is part of an exuberant -- some might say exuberantly tasteless -- exhibition that has the potential to mortify American Jews as much as Philip Roth did in the days of "Goodbye, Columbus" and "Portnoy's Complaint." The Jewish Museum's show is called "Too Jewish?" and its contents seem determined to affront assimilated, often secular American Jews by demanding to know to exactly what lengths they'll go to avoid appearing "too Jewish." I doubt anyone will confuse the works on display with Rothkos or Gottliebs, but as acts of provocation at this moment in American Jewish history, they sting.
Among the other pieces in "Too Jewish?" is "Chanel Hanukkah," in which a gold Chanel handbag becomes a menorah, with a row of lipsticks substituting for candles. On a TV monitor a teen-age daughter on "The Goldbergs" in the 50's sobs to her mother, Gertrude Berg, about the ugliness of her nose. The girl would no doubt rather look like Barbie -- though, as another display in "Too Jewish?" reminds us, the doll that has intimidatingly served as "the ultimate gentile goddess" for generations of American girls was in fact created by "a nice Jewish lady" who submerged her ethnicity to create an icon in the image of Sandra Dee.
If the more assimilated of my two Jewish grandmothers were still alive, I think "Too Jewish?" would kill her. When I was growing up in the 50's, she was so determined not to be too Jewish that when she wished to identify someone as Jewish in conversation she wouldn't say "Jewish" but would identify the poor soul as "one of us," in the same whisper in which she spoke of cancer. The pictures at the Jewish Museum -- an enormous Pop Art portrait of a box of Manischewitz "American" matzohs, for instance -- never whisper a Jewish identity; they shout it.
In 1996, the shouters may have a point. At a time when anti-Semitism on both the white right and black left is a real phenomenon, mightn't American Jews be more openly visible in our culture, especially mass culture, if only to defend their turf?
As Entertainment Weekly reported last year, "Jewish characters are practically nonexistent" in Hollywood movies, appearing less frequently than every other minority, whether religious, racial or sexual. On TV, Jewish men from "Seinfeld" to "Mad About You" are only faintly so and, in the grand tradition of the late, great George Burns (ne Nathan Birnbaum) and Gracie Allen, are never married off to Jewish women. That Jewish titan of fashion Ralph Lauren clothes America in the quintessence of WASP.
So what else is new? you might ask. But in the aftermath of a primary season in which a major Presidential candidate's anti-Semitic rhetoric went unchallenged, even unremarked, by his opponents, American Jews can't be blamed for wondering if we're a little too invisible for our own good. Though his G.O.P. rivals assailed Pat Buchanan for his "extreme" economic views and foreign policy, the extremity of his views about Jews (as well as his race-baiting embrace of the Confederate flag) was answered by silence. And, as Norman Podhoretz wrote in The Weekly Standard, to oppose Mr. Buchanan "only because he is a protectionist and an isolationist is inescapably to suggest that anti-Semitism is of no great importance as compared with these other issues."
Would the silence have been so deafening if Jews, like every other minority, were constantly in the country's face, noses and all? We are living in a time when being too Jewish in America maybe wouldn't hurt.

World Bank Moves to Cut Poorest Nations' Debts

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
The World Bank has offered to reinvest part of its $1.3 billion annual surplus in a new trust fund that would be set up to reduce the debts of the world's poorest nations.
The bank is asking the International Monetary Fund and other lenders to contribute to similar undertakings. 
 At the Halifax, Nova Scotia, summit meeting last June, the Group of Seven major industrial countries asked the World Bank and the I.M.F. to break precedent and relieve these struggling countries. In the past, individual lenders offered debt relief, but not the multilateral agencies.
The situation of Uganda is typical. It spends $3 per inhabitant on health annually, and about $17 a person on debt repayment, mainly to multilateral creditors, according to a study by Oxfam International, a private aid organization lobbying for debt relief. The debt burden chokes off the nation's economic growth.
Although the proposed size of the trust fund was not disclosed, it would be financed by the regional development banks as well as the World Bank and other donors. World Bank officials say they expect it to have annual outlays of around $400 million.
The proposal to cope with the developing world's debt problems addresses the first of two primary challenges facing James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank's president since last June. His second challenge is to persuade a skeptical Republican Congress to vote America's share of the World Bank's low interest rate lending specifically devoted to these very poor and heavily indebted countries that cannot afford to borrow at market rates.
While the United States, Britain and Canada were generally favorable toward the comprehensive debt relief plan, Germany, France and Japan took a more cautious approach when the World Bank's directors discussed the initiative for the first time on Wednesday, diplomats said.
However, in a statement approved by the directors, Mr. Wolfensohn said later that the executive board had "concluded that the proposal represents an important and comprehensive step in the right direction."
The plan will now be discussed by the I.M.F.'s directors next Wednesday and then by world finance ministers attending the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the I.M.F in Washington next month. A resolution may be reached then, or may await the next Group of Seven summit meeting in June, in France.
The World Bank and the I.M.F. believe that some 20 of the poorest developing countries, whose debts are in excess of 200 to 250 percent of their annual export earnings, may qualify for relief under the plan. They include: Mozambique, Nicaragua, Zaire, Zambia, Bolivia, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda.
To qualify for the help, these countries must undertake a three-year period of economic reform supervised by the World Bank and the I.M.F. after which they would become eligible for forgiveness of up to 67 percent of their bilateral debts to the group of donor countries known as the Paris Club.
In the second stage of the plan, these countries would continue with their economic reform programs for another three years, during which donor countries and aid institutions would provide them with additional assistance, such as free grants to reduce debt servicing costs.
At the end of this second stage, outstanding debts to Paris Club countries would be further reduced by up to 90 percent with comparable cuts in other bilateral and commercial debts. The proposed new trust fund would also pay off an undefined "portion" of their debts to multilateral development banks like the World Bank and the regional development banks.
Left unclear in the World Bank proposal is the precise role to be played by the I.M.F. The I.M.F. accounts for roughly half these countries' multilateral debts and has long resisted any debt relief on principle.
While the I.M.F. would not be expected to contribute to the World Bank trust fund, it is " expected to take action that would reduce the present value of its claims on a country participating in the initiative," the World Bank said. Any such action, officials said, would certainly involve selling some of the I.M.F.'s vast stock of gold, currently valued at $40.7 billion.
While the United States, Britain and Canada believe the most heavily indebted countries have little chance of resuming growth without debt relief, they also have reservations about whether the plan's six-year timetable is too long, as well as concern that Germany and Japan will refuse to forgive up to 90 percent of their bilateral debts through the Paris Club.
Among the less enthusiastic countries at Wednesday's meeting, Japan was said by officials to have the strongest philosophical objection to debt relief, believing it would set a dangerous precedent. Instead it thinks aid donors should continue lending to these countries at concessional rates.
Germany's top financial officials also share this view, but the country's aid officials are more sympathetic toward the plan. Although many of the most indebted developing countries are former French colonies, France appears ambiguous about debt relief.

HEADLINE: Industry Pace Rises Sharply; Inflation Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Rebounding more sharply than expected, industrial output rose 1.2 percent in February, a gain three times as large as a decline in January that reflected the impact of a blizzard in the Northeast, the Federal Reserve reported today.
It was the biggest surge of activity at the nation's factories, mines and utilities -- about one-third of the economy -- in more than eight years. 
 The Government also reported today that consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent last month, further evidence that inflation remained subdued.
But it was the University of Michigan that seemed to raise economic eyebrows the most today when it told clients that its index of consumer confidence jumped to 95.7 in mid-March, the highest level since August. February's reading was 88.5.
Taken together, analysts said the figures suggested that the economy was a bit stronger than had been believed, at least before the giant increase in payroll jobs for February that was reported last Friday, and that prospects may have brightened somewhat for coming months.
"It does not appear we have slipped into recession," said Martin A. Regalia, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "Two weeks ago we couldn't have said that" with much assurance.
The bond market slumped after the reports' release, further dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would soon cut short-term interest rates. [Page 45.]
Still, the data remain clouded because of the effects of the blizzard and the strike against the Boeing Company that was settled in mid-December.
Economists, who had fretted about lack of information because of the shutdown of the Government's statistical apparatus, said gauging the economy had been particularly hard this winter and that the General Motors strike would add to the confusion when figures are published for March.
Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist at Nationsbank in New York, said today that he detected in the production figures a "modest sign of pickup" but that there was no way to be sure when there were so many seasonal and other quirks. "Every month seems very awkward," he added.
The 1.2 percent jump in output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities last month was more than rebound from the blizzard but not much higher than projections derived from the Labor Department's report a week ago that employers added a strong 705,000 jobs for the month and that the length of the workweek returned to normal.
But analysts also said that January was not as weak as previously calculated, with the Fed revising that month's decline to four-tenths of 1 percent from an initial six-tenths of 1 percent.
"You got a bounce-back -- and then some," just like the employment results, said Brian M. Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
The Fed also said that industry operated at 82.9 percent of capacity, well above the 82.1 percent pace to which it had sunk in January and slightly above December's 82.7 percent. The utilization rate had reached a peak of 85.1 percent last winter.
The recent improvement in output was concentrated in business equipment and related durable-goods materials, the central bank said, with the recovery in aircraft and parts production after the Boeing strike accounting for nearly one-third of the growth in the first two months of the year.
Factory output climbed 1.4 percent last month while mining's rose 1.5 percent, nearly half of this from coal. Utility output, down 1.2 percent, has now fallen three straight months.
Motor vehicle assembly jumped to a 12 million annual pace from 11.2 million, the gain split evenly between cars and trucks, the report also showed.
As for the Consumer Price Index, which seemed to surprise no one, the deceleration to a two-tenths of 1 percent rise from January's four-tenths of 1 percent was marked by a downswing for petroleum-based energy.
Apparel fell sharply to more than erase a January increase while the heavily weighted housing component rose slightly less as prices fell for fuel oil and furniture and bedding products while cable television jumped 1.3 percent.
Transportation prices climbed five-tenths of 1 percent, their second straight hefty advance, as airline fares surged 5.9 percent and used cars increased another seven-tenths of 1 percent. On the other hand, finance charges fell 1.9 percent, the fifth straight decline.
Core inflation -- the Consumer Price Index with the wide-swinging food and energy components removed -- was up two-tenths of 1 percent in February, the same as the index as a whole and the same as the average core rate for December and January, the Labor Department's report also showed.
Divided between goods and services, the former showed no inflation in February while the latter was up four-tenths of 1 percent. Both categories, however, have risen at a 3.3 percent annual rate over the latest three months.
Prices in the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas climbed five-tenths of 1 percent and six-tenths of 1 percent, respectively, the highest of the five cities for which monthly figures were reported.

'American Flyer' Trains Planned for Northeast
Moving decisively to upgrade train service in the Northeast and challenge the airlines, Amtrak chose the contractors to build a $611 million fleet of "American Flyers" that will dramatically cut train travel time between Washington and Boston. The top speed of the new trains, the first of which is to be delivered in 1999, is 150 miles an hour -- 25 miles an hour faster than trains that now travel between New York and Washington, and 50 miles an hour faster than between New York and Boston.
Amtrak is ordering 18 "train sets," each consisting of six cars and an engine at either end. Each of the 345 seats will have an electric outlet for a laptop computer. The trains will be built by Bombardier Inc., of Quebec, and GEC Alsthom, which is Franco-British. But much of the work will be done in Plattsburg, N.Y., and in Barre, Vt. [Page 1.]
 
AT&T Sees Fewer Job Cuts As More Workers Take Buyouts
AT&T, not three months after it stunned Main Street and delighted Wall Street by estimating that it would cut 40,000 jobs over two to three years -- 10,000 from voluntary buyouts and 30,000 from pink slips -- is now predicting fewer reductions. The buyouts have exceeded expectations, and internal demand in some areas has been strong enough that employees who might leave one job are finding work in another part of the company. [37.]
 
Amdahl's Chief Executive Resigns
Joseph Zemke resigned unexpectedly as president and chief executive of the Amdahl Corporation, citing personal reasons. Amdahl, which makes computers compatible with I.B.M.'s mainframes, has been hard-pressed to keep up with a revitalized I.B.M. lately and reported a loss of $38.4 million in the fourth quarter. Mr. Zemke will be succeeded by John C. Lewis, Amdahl's chairman. [39.]
 
Liggett to Settle With 5 States
The Liggett Group and its parent, Brooke Group Ltd., which stunned the tobacco industry on Wednesday by agreeing to settle a giant class action suit by smokers, announced a preliminary settlement with five states -- Florida, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Louisiana and West Virginia. The states had sued seeking reimbursement for Medicaid spending for smoke-related illnesses. [6.]
 
Dow Slips as Nasdaq Advances
Blue-chip stocks closed with small losses in heavy trading that was largely linked to the triple witching expiration of futures, index futures and stock options. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 1.09 points lower at 5,584.97 after bouncing back from an early morning loss of 35 points. For the week, the Dow was up 114.52 points. Technology stocks moved ahead, reasserting their leadership and sending the Nasdaq Composite index up 8.52 points to 1,099.59. [39.]
 
Fokker N.V. Declares Bankruptcy
Fokker N.V., the Dutch aviation company whose World War I aircraft were made famous by the German ace, Baron von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron, declared bankruptcy for three core units, putting 5,600 people out of work, the most in the history of the Netherlands. Crippled by debt and heavy losses, Fokker was unsuccessful in its frantic search for a buyer after its German parent, Daimler-Benz A.G., severed a cash lifeline in January. [36.]
 
Treasury Securities Prices Fall
Prices of Treasury securities fell on growing concern over the faster pace of economic growth. The 30-year bond dropped 18/32 to 9019/32 , sending its yield up to 6.73 percent from 6.68 percent on Thursday. It was the highest yield since Aug. 24. [45.]
 
Crude Oil at 40-Month High
Crude oil prices rallied on the New York Mercantile Exchange, capping a week of gains, reflecting concerns about supply and expectations that United Nations talks with Iraq would not soon lead to an agreement to allow limited oil sales. Crude oil for April delivery rose 83 cents, to $21.99 a barrel, the highest settling price since Oct. 19, 1992. [38.]
 
The dollar gained after seesawing on fresh economic reports and rumors related to tensions between China and Taiwan. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.93 Japanese yen and at 1.4725 German marks. [38.]

HEADLINE: Pataki Reveals Surprise Funds To Ease Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 15

 BODY:
After threatening repeatedly in recent weeks to slash state programs if Washington failed to provide the aid he wanted, Gov. George E. Pataki made the surprise announcement today that he had found $1.4 billion in additional money that he said would enable him to balance his 1997 budget without making painful new spending cuts.
The announcement, at a hastily called news conference this afternoon, came one day after the White House rebuffed Mr. Pataki's request for changes in welfare and Medicaid laws that could save New York State $2 billion in the coming fiscal year, which begins in just two weeks. 
 The Governor's plan predicts that the regional economy will improve so that the state will take in $483 million more in tax revenues than Mr. Pataki had originally projected. It also estimates that the state will spend $758 million less on an array of programs, mainly by reducing the welfare rolls or shifting health care costs to the Federal Government.
The plan calls for only $223 million in spending reductions -- mostly from new programs the Governor had put in his earlier budget plan -- a relatively small amount, which could make the whole plan more palatable to legislators facing re-election this fall.
But the proposal is heavy with potentially risky assumptions about declines in interests rates, drops in state health care costs and savings from refinanced state debt. As a result, legislative leaders from both parties, who have been hesitant to start budget negotiations until the Federal budget impasse is broken, reacted skeptically.
Even the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican who is Mr. Pataki's strongest ally in the Legislature, referred to Mr. Pataki's $1.4 billion in found money as "a wish list" that was not certain to come true.
"My feeling is that the final document will look quite different than what is before us now," Mr. Bruno said. "But that is the process."
And the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said the new plan had probably arrived too late to be seriously considered in time for the new fiscal year. He accused the Governor of trying to shift blame for the state's fiscal problems onto President Clinton and the Legislature, and said he would prefer simply extending the state's fiscal year until July 1 to give Congress additional time to enact a new budget.
"The Governor had three months to fix what everyone knew was the problem in his budget," Mr. Silver said. "This is just recognizing that his original budget submission was not balanced."
Analysts with Wall Street firms that rate New York State's bonds said they had not had enough time to determine whether Mr. Pataki's proposal was realistic. They praised the plan as a good way to kick-start negotiations with the Legislature. But, they said, it seems almost certain that the budget will be late for the 12th consecutive year -- far and away a national record.
Richard J. Marino, a director at Standard & Poor's, also expressed concerns that Mr. Pataki's plan still depends too heavily on additional Federal money to address the state's recurring problem of spending more than it receives in revenues. He said the state's low bond rating -- which increases the state's borrowing costs -- would stand a better chance of improving if the state balanced its budget without relying so much on Federal aid.
Throughout his news conference today, Mr. Pataki placed the onus for solving the Federal budget impasse on President Clinton. Time and again, Mr. Pataki said that while Republican Congressional leaders had endorsed the welfare and Medicaid changes he wants, White House officials have been lukewarm to them. And he charged that the President was preventing a final Federal budget agreement because of election-year politics.
"I don't see why the President should not sign this," he said, referring to a plan endorsed by the National Governors' Association that would provide New York State the changes Mr. Pataki wants. "But it is an election year."
Asked what evidence he had that Mr. Clinton was motivated by Presidential politics, Mr. Pataki said, "I don't see any other reason why there is not an agreement."
But Democrats accused Mr. Pataki of acting as a political surrogate for Senator Bob Dole, the Republican Party's presumptive Presidential nominee, who Mr. Pataki has strongly supported throughout the primary season.
"To describe it in a word, it's Dole-ful," Mr. Silver said. "Pataki goes to Washington, talks to Newt Gingrich and comes back and says that the whole budget problem is Clinton's fault. That's what he would have you believe."
Under his plan, Mr. Pataki would close his $2 billion gap using $1.4 billion in newly found money, about $400 million in savings from shifting state costs to the Federal Government and $223 million in new spending cuts.
The plan includes many of the types of financial rejiggering that is typical of Albany budget negotiations at this time of year. For instance, it raises his projections for tax revenues by $483 million.
It also re-estimates downward the amount of money the Governor expects to spend on social programs, projecting that fewer people will be on the welfare rolls than originally expected and that health care costs will fall faster than anticipated. Both of those projections assume that the economy will not weaken and force more people to request public assistance.
The plan also calls for the state to try to maximize its Federal Medicaid reimbursements. One measure would increase a state tax on nursing homes by $76 million -- money that the owners could recoup almost entirely from Medicaid.
Mr. Pataki has criticized strategies like this in the past. But today he said, "If they won't change the rules, we'll play by the rules."
The Governor would also take $350 million from a state fund set aside to help doctors defray medical malpractice costs and use it to close the budget gap. And he projects that the state can save $197 million by refinancing its debt.
A large part of the $223 million in new cuts are to the Governor's own initiatives, including eliminating Mr. Pataki's proposal to use $100 million in state Lottery money for property tax relief.
Mr. Pataki's plan is unprecedented in that it asks the Legislature to pass a budget that includes two totally different assumptions: first, that Congress will enact major changes to welfare and Medicaid programs, and second, that it will not.
Under the first assumption, if Congress fails to make the changes Mr. Pataki wants, all the $1.4 billion in the new projections would be used to close the new $2 billion shortfall.
But if Congress does do what the Governor wants, he would use the $1.4 billion to increase spending on mental health, education and Medicaid programs. The plan would also set aside $125 million for "local economic development grants," which in Albany parlance has traditionally meant pork barrel spending for legislators.
Mr. Pataki's proposal to convert welfare and Medicaid programs into block grants would be placed on hold, pending enactment of a Federal budget. The proposal had been to give local governments less money for social programs but more freedom to decide how to spend it.


GRAPHIC: Gov. George E. Pataki announced yesterday that he had come up with $1.4 billion in revenues and savings that he would use to plug a hole in his proposed budget.Fiscal experts and bond rating firms often frown on budgetary maneuvers like these, saying that they are often based upon risky assumptions that do not pan out.
 
 Here are the major components of the $1.4 billion:
 
 Additional receipts: $483 million.
 
 Assumption: Th economy will strengthen in the months ahead, so state income tax receipts will grow
 
 Malpractice fund: $350 million.
 
Assumption: The insuarnce industry and doctors will not fight a plan to spend some of the surplus in the Medicaid Malpractice Insurance Association, a fund used to pay malpractice awards.
 
 Medicaid: $160 million
 
Assumption: The economy will not worsen and push more people poverty, so the state can refigured downward the estimates of what it will pay for Medicaid, the medical program for the poor.
 
 Welfare: $90 million.
 
Assumption: Since the state's welfare caseload is declining and benefits are being reduced, the costs will fall.
 
 Bond refinancings: $197 million.
 
Assumption: The state will be able to get lower interest rates for refinanced bonds for pention funds and public authorities.
 
 Re-estimates on spending: $77 million.
 
Assumption: Lowered spending estimates for a variety of programs will prove accurate.
 
Economic Developmet Assistance: $37 million.
 
Assumption: The Legislature will approve cuts in economic development programs.

HEADLINE: Administration Calls for End To G.M. Strike

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, March 15

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration called on the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers today to settle a 10-day strike that has virtually shut down the North American operations of the world's largest auto maker. The call came hours after negotiations here appeared to show the first signs of progress.
The strike at two brake factories here has forced G.M. to close 24 of its 29 assembly plants and dozens of parts factories across North America. The company announced the layoffs today of another 13,350 auto parts workers, bringing the number of idled G.M. workers to 124,700, plus another 7,300 Saturn workers who were receiving training while their factory is closed. 
 Wall Street analysts estimate that the strike is costing G.M. as much as $50 million a day.
In the Administration's first public comment on the auto industry's biggest work stoppage in a quarter century, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich in a statement this evening urged both sides to resolve their differences.
"The American public is holding its collective breath while this work stoppage idles more than 85,000 workers across the country," Mr. Reich said. "Clearly, the best way to settle this dispute is by both parties coming to the bargaining table."
While G.M. has included close to 40,000 Mexican and Canadian workers in its figures for idled workers, Mr. Reich excluded them.
Mr. Reich also appeared today to side with the U.A.W. in its fight with G.M. over whether laid-off workers were entitled to unemployment benefits. G.M. announced late Thursday that it would ask state governments across the country to deny unemployment benefits to U.A.W. workers laid off because of a brake shortage caused by the strike by close to 3,200 U.A.W. workers here.
"I would hope that workers' claims to unemployment benefits be given every consideration," Mr. Reich said. "Unemployment compensation determinations are made by states. Nothing in Federal law prohibits states from paying these workers if allowed by state statutes."
G.M. officials declined to comment on Mr. Reich's remarks, referring reporters instead to previous statements by spokesmen. "Since G.M. is assessed the cost of state unemployment compensation, we don't believe we should finance a strike against ourselves," John F. Mueller, a company spokesman, said on Thursday evening.
G.M. has tried to block unemployment benefits during long strikes in the past when a strike at one or two factories has forced layoffs elsewhere, arguing that the laid-off workers are effectively part of the strike. Most state laws limit or prohibit unemployment benefits for strikers.
James M. Hagedon Jr., a spokesman here, said this morning that the negotiations were continuing in Dayton and that "our priority remains to reach an equitable agreement as soon as possible so we can resume supply to our customers."
Leery of being labeled as traditional Democrats too close to organized labor, Clinton Administration officials have seldom commented on strikes the last several years. But the Administration has been trying to find a delicate balance in an election year between satisfying business groups while keeping labor unions happy.
Today's slap at G.M. was particularly unusual because the Big Three auto makers in Detroit have supported many of President Clinton's initiatives. They were particularly vocal in 1994 in favor of the Administration's health care plan, which would have helped them cope with the health care costs from their large and growing number of retirees.
But long before Mr. Reich issued his statement, the pace of talks here accelerated. Both sides sent senior officials from Detroit today for the first time since the early days of the strike, local officials from the union said.
The two sides agreed to stop discussing their differences in public and began talks at noon that continued until 10 P.M., the longest sustained negotiations here since the strike began. More talks were planned for the weekend.
Earlier this week, an auto company official said that the dispatch of senior officials from Detroit would signal the beginning of serious talks.
Several officials from the U.A.W.'s headquarters and one G.M. official from Detroit suddenly joined the talks today, said several local union officials who insisted on anonymity. The officials were fairly senior but did not include Richard Shoemaker, the head of the U.A.W.'s General Motors division, the local officials said.
Personal animosity between local union and factory officials has slowed the negotiations over the last week. Joe Buckley, the chairman of the bargaining committee for U.A.W. Local 696, which is on strike here, swore vociferously when asked about the brake factories' top managers on Thursday.
"One of the most difficult things after this is going to be to try to work with current management," he said. "They should consider some changes."
Scott F. Merlis, an independent auto analyst in Westport, Conn., estimated today that the strike was trimming $50 million a day from G.M.'s pretax earnings. The company can probably recover only half of the losses in later quarters with extra production, he added.
G.M. was selling its highly profitable pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles as fast as it could build them before the strike, so the lost output has a direct effect on profits.
Bob Rodriguez, the financial secretary of U.A.W. Local 696, said in an interview this afternoon that the union was willing to stay on strike "as long as it takes."

HEADLINE: SHOOTOUT IN THE BRONX: THE SUSPECTS;
3 Young Men With Violent Records Dating to Their Teens

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Ricardo Morales was 15 when he helped hold up a Bronx bodega, a stickup that left the owner dead. Angel Diaz's start in crime came almost as early -- he was 16 when he was sent to prison for holding up a jewelry store, 19 when he was paroled and 20 when he was sent back to prison for robbery and assault. Jesus Mendez had barely turned 18 when he began a 7-year sentence for armed robberies in the Bronx.
The three men returned to the streets of the Bronx within months of each other in 1995. And on Thursday night, law enforcement officials said, the three were together at 187th Street and Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. 
 There, the police said, the three men -- all under the supervision of parole officers -- began what would become their bloodiest crime spree, one that ended with a New York City police officer dead.
The criminal records of the three men are sure to raise questions about the criminal justice system: about the state parole system, about sentencing rules, about the handling of juveniles who commit violent crimes and about a judge who Bronx prosecutors say reduced their bail demand for one of the three men after he was arrested last month.
Mr. Diaz, who investigators say fired the shot that killed Officer Kevin Gillespie, was first arrested in 1985. He was convicted of armed robbery, paroled barely two years into a 2- to 6-year sentence, and was back in prison seven months after his release, convicted of robbery and assault after a gang he was with held up a grocery store. His sentence was 3 1/2 to 7 years.
Mr. Diaz got what is known as a conditional release from prison in October and was required to report weekly to a parole officer. His most recent visit to his parole officer was last week, state parole officials said. He told the parole officer that he was unemployed and living with his mother. Ten days later, Mr. Diaz was in handcuffs and on the ground, arrested for killing a police officer after stealing a car.
At 15, Mr. Morales was too young to go to prison when he was arrested in 1988 for the deadly holdup of a bodega on Castle Hill Avenue in the Bronx. The store owner was killed, and an employee was wounded; the holdup was the second conducted by Mr. Morales in a three-day span.
Mr. Morales was sentenced as a juvenile to 5 to 10 years. On May 26, 1995, Mr. Morales, after serving less than seven years, was granted a conditional release. He made his required weekly visits to a parole officer and regularly passed his drug tests. In October, he was found to be wearing a beeper and ordered to abide by a curfew. He was to be under the supervision of a parole officer until 1998.
Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed that parole be abolished for violent criminals and that violent young criminals be treated like adults. Had such measures been in force, they might have kept Mr. Diaz and Mr. Morales in prison longer.
Mr. Mendez's trip through the criminal justice system could well prove the most troubling. Arrested in 1987 for armed robberies, Mr. Mendez served 7 1/2 years and was paroled last July. In January, Mr. Mendez, who had been meeting with a parole officer, was arrested for robbery, assault and possession of a weapon.
Instead of instantly returning Mr. Mendez to prison for a parole violation, parole officials, as is customary, deferred to prosecutors, allowing them to go ahead with their new case against him.
Steven Reed, a spokesman for District Attorney Robert T. Johnson of the Bronx, said prosecutors had asked for $100,000 bail for Mr. Mendez. Mr. Reed said Judge Ruth Sussman had instead set bail at $25,000. Mr. Mendez posted bond on Feb. 14 and was released.
"We asked for bail to be set at what we believed was appropriate," Mr. Reed said. Mr. Mendez reported for two subsequent meetings in February with his parole officer, but he failed to appear for a meeting on Feb. 28 and missed a court appearance on Feb. 29. A warrant was issued for Mr. Mendez's arrest late last month.

HEADLINE: Pataki's New Budget Proposal Puts Giuliani's Plans on Hold

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's new budget proposal threw New York City's budget into disarray yesterday, offering a tiny flicker of hope for new state aid but raising the far more likely possibility that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will receive less than he has said he needs to close the city's $2 billion shortfall.
The most immediate effect of the Governor's proposals, however, could be to delay a full resolution of the city's budget until the state budget falls entirely into place: maybe this spring, maybe in the fall. All of it shows how the Federal budget impasse is causing ripple effects at every level of government statewide. 
 The Governor's proposal -- essentially a contingency plan of $1.4 billion in newly identified revenues that he would use if Washington does not enact the budgetary changes he hopes for -- reflected a growing recognition that the state might not receive the $2 billion in savings from Federal changes that Mr. Pataki had figured into his budget.
The Mayor's own preliminary proposal for the city's $31 billion budget in turn relied heavily on Mr. Pataki's ability to receive those savings. What's more, it assumed the state would share a larger part of the savings with New York City than the Governor proposed.
Mr. Pataki, a Republican, is still leaving open the possibility that the state will receive the savings from Washington, mostly in Medicaid and welfare. The state and city share the costs of those programs, so reductions in the state's benefits allow the city, too, to save money.
If the Governor fails to receive the savings, then the $1.4 billion in new revenues, along with other contingency plans, would plug the subsequent hole in the state's budget. If he receives the savings, which many officials from New York to Washington doubt, the new money would be used for a variety of programs, including what Mr. Pataki said was $690 million in new aid for the city.
Far from clarifying the city's budget picture, the Governor's proposal created such a muddle that the Mayor's office declined to comment until budget aides review the plan. The Mayor's press secretary, Colleen A. Roche, did say that Mr. Pataki had called Mr. Giuliani, also a Republican, and said the changes "would be helpful to the city."
But the Democrats who control the City Council criticized the Governor's proposal. Thomas L. McMahon, the Council's finance director, said the Governor was holding out the promise of new state aid that the city could desperately use, knowing there was actually little chance of getting it.
Either way, Mr. McMahon noted, even before today's modifications, the Governor's budget proposal included cuts in aid for the city and cuts in spending on education, health care and social services that will hurt many New Yorkers, particularly the poorest.
"It's a plan that continues to shortchange the taxpayers of New York City," Mr. McMahon said.
The Governor's new plan came on the day that the state's Financial Control Board issued a report strongly criticizing Mr. Giuliani's budget proposals for this fiscal year and the years ahead. Among its major criticisms, the board rebuked the Mayor for relying too heavily on state aid that was unlikely to materialize.
The board, created during the fiscal crisis to oversee the city's finances, concluded that the gap between the city's spending and its projected revenues would continue to widen to "historic highs" in the coming years: higher even than those during the recessionary years under Mr. Giuliani's Democratic predecessor, David N. Dinkins.
The board attributed some of the problem to the weak economy, but it also blamed the city for continuing to overspend, singling out the Mayor's recent labor settlements, which will add hundreds of millions of dollars in costs to the city's budgets in future years. And it criticized the Mayor's use of budget actions that provided one-time savings without addressing the city's core fiscal problems.
"In spite of the massive gap-closing efforts of the past several years," the board said, referring to the Mayor's first two years of budget cutting, "the city's finances continue to deteriorate."

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasuries Retreat for a Fourth Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the fourth time this week as concerns grew over the faster pace of economic growth.
Strong gains in reports on industrial production, capacity utilization and in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index caused selling that raised bond yields to their highest level in six months. The data appeared to bury any remaining hopes of a quick interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose on Monday but lost ground on subsequent days. Yesterday it dropped 18/32 , to 9019/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.73 percent, from 6.68 percent on Thursday. It was the highest yield since Aug. 24, 1995, when it was 6.81 percent.
Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford, said the data this week confirmed the market's view that last week's employment report pointed to a strengthening economy.
Indeed, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday that industrial production rose 1.2 percent in February. The gain was higher than expected and was a rebound from a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent in January.
The central bank also said that capacity utilization, or the amount of industrial capacity in use, rose to 82.9 percent in February from a revised 82.1 percent in January.
"Industrial production and capacity use was stronger than many had been led to believe," Mr. Whelan said. "And we know it appears to be growing at a healthy level relative to the 1995 fourth quarter G.D.P. But just as important, bullish investors have been focusing on the health of the consumer. The University of Michigan sentiment report released today says consumers do not appear to be very worried, and signals that they will be opening their wallets more."
Mr. Whelan said a further indication of consumer sentiment would come next week, when February retail sales are reported.
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for early March rose to 95.7 from 88.5 in February, traders and analysts said. The index is released only to subscribers.
In another report, the Consumer Price Index for February rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent, suggesting that inflation remained subdued. But the positive implications of the report had little impact on the bearish market.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research analysis firm, said, "In the past few weeks, the bond market has dropped like a rock."
The rise in yields, he said, has been prompted by "a reassessment by market participants about how strong the economy is."
"Instead of believing the economy was very weak, and the Federal Reserve will continue to lower rates," he said, "suddenly they appear to expect a surge that will ignite inflation and keep the Fed from lowering rates further and possibly push the central bank to increase rates later this year."
But Mr. McCarthy said the market was overreacting. "While the economy is certainly not as weak as it appeared in January, it is far from strong," he said. "It has picked up momentum in the past two months and is growing at a 2.5 percent annual pace, compared with 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter. That's an improvement, but it does not warrant the kinds of increases in interest rates that we have seen in recent months."

Haarhuis, Ranked 68th, Defeats Sampras

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN 

DATELINE: INDIAN WELLS, Calif., March 15

 BODY:
Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi both missed a chance to grab the No. 1 ranking today when they failed to brave perfect desert conditions and bowed out in the quarterfinals of the Newsweek Champions Cup.
Sampras, the two-time defending champion, wilted in the sun this afternoon against 68th-ranked Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-1. 
 Then Agassi, featured under the spotlights tonight against fifth-seeded Michael Chang, put on an increasingly flawed performance and succumbed, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-1. Agassi, who prides himself on his accuracy and his piercing return of serve, made 44 unforced errors and found himself aced 13 times; in all, Chang had 17 service winners to 3 by Agassi. The Las Vegan would have claimed the top ranking had he won.
The loss to Haarhuis cost Sampras his title defense and his chance to regain his No. 1 ranking from Thomas Muster, the Austrian powerhouse. Sampras didn't seem unduly devastated. "C'est la vie," he said. "If you don't play well, you're not going to win. I don't care who you're playing, but if you let him dictate, he's going to dictate," Sampras said of Haarhuis, who has gotten the better of him in three of four meetings.
Sampras doesn't often find himself outserved and out-aced, but Haarhuis, better known for his doubles conquests, used the relatively passive Sampras for target practice from start to finish. Haarhuis served 11 aces, 1 more than Sampras, and unlike Sampras, who was broken three times, the 30-year-old Dutchman never lost a service game.
After claiming the opening set, Haarhuis forced the tie breaker with a pair of aces and took a 4-3 lead there with another ace. But Sampras served himself to a 5-4 lead and tied the proceedings at a set apiece when he converted his second set point with a 114-mile-an-hour ace.
But Sampras's resurgence was short-lived, as Haarhuis jumped out to a 4-1 lead in the final set. He broke the sluggish Sampras for a 5-1 lead with a down-the-line forehand return that Sampras couldn't shovel back over the net. Sampras surrendered the match by netting a forehand on Haarhuis's first match point.
Haarhuis, who earned an economics degree from Florida State University in 1988 and put himself on the tennis map a year later by defeating John McEnroe at the United States Open, captured his first career singles title just last year.
"He's always given the Top 10 players trouble, and I'm one of them," Sampras said.
Haarhuis simply played it sharp and smart, and that was enough to unsettle Sampras, who committed 38 unforced errors and was particularly inept from the backcourt. "I don't know what happened," Sampras said. "My shots from the backcourt were just flying, just spraying."

HEADLINE: On Language;
Of Mainstreams and Movements

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
"THIS IS A RACE BETWEEN THE MAINSTREAM and the extreme," declared Senator Bob Dole, drawing the battle lines after his New Hampshire defeat by Pat Buchanan. That choice of words has reverberated through recent political history.
At the 1964 Republican convention in San Francisco's Cow Palace, as I noted recently, the outnumbered and humiliated Rockefeller-Scranton "moderates" hauled a 30-foot banner emblazoned with "Stay in the Mainstream" across the floor, to the derision of the Goldwater delegates. When the nominee, Barry Goldwater, cried, "Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice!" he stimulated a roar of enthusiastic approval from what was being called "the Goldwater movement." But observing from a box, the neutral Richard Nixon sat on his hands, telling friends later that Goldwater's choice of words guaranteed the landslide victory of Lyndon Johnson, which led to the Democrats' Great Society. 
 At the time, I thought that the political use of mainstream was a Rockefeller coinage. In fact, President Kennedy had told the Irish Parliament in 1963 that "Ireland is moving in the mainstream of current world events"; a month later, a Rockefeller speech writer, Hugh Morrow, fashioned a blast at "vociferous and well-drilled extremist elements boring within the party" that were "wholly alien to the broad middle course that accommodates the mainstream of Republican principle."
After the G.O.P. paradise was lost, it turned out that the actual coiner was John Milton: "The neather Flood," he wrote about the fall of the angels in his 1667 poem, " . . . now divided into four main Streames." Thomas Carlyle picked up the term in 1831, holding that "the Didactic Tendency . . . still forms the main stream," and in 1865 the critic Matthew Arnold hailed Byron and Shelley for their "Titanic effort to flow in the main stream of modern literature." A century later, the word was popularized by jazz writers: "Humph" -- a bandleader known by a single name -- "is authentic mainstreamer," wrote The New Left Review in 1961. "He's been influenced by everything in jazz up to the moment."
Mainstream gained a positive connotation in politics after the Goldwater debacle, though moderate, a seeming synonym, was considered by many to be a euphemism for "liberal." Extremism became pejorative again (despite its ringing defense by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.), and was embraced by President Bill Clinton to hammer at newly elected Republican Representatives in Congress who wanted a balanced budget on terms other than his.
Because of this use by Democrats, and notwithstanding the rhyming endings of mainstream and extreme, the Dole attack on Buchanan using that Goldwater-blessed word drew a tut-tut from Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition: "It is strategically unwise and politically shortsighted to label Buchanan or his supporters as, ipso facto, extremists or intolerant," he said. "That is the language of the left." (Ipso facto is the language of Latin and means literally "by the fact itself," its extended meaning "as an inevitable result.") Dole then turned to derogating Buchanan as a fringe candidate, one that could be defined as "on the margin," but that evokes memories of Theodore Roosevelt's classic 1913 pop at ardent reformers as a lunatic fringe.
Mr. Buchanan's political language has ranged from the subtle to the mysterious. One use is, at least to me, obscure: when the candidate Steve Forbes complained of attacks by opponents he had long been lambasting in TV commercials, Buchanan said, "What's happened is the little rich kid, who's been sitting on his estate throwing rocks at all the cars passing by, finally had someone get out of the car and clock him one." Clock him one? This may be a variant of bop him one or a reference to clean his clock; elucidation is sought from Lexicographic Irregulars, timepiece-vernacular division.
In the past, I have heard my former colleague in the speech dodge refer to himself as a movement conservative, meaning the Goldwater "movement" in contrast to traditional conservatives or neoconservatives. Lately, he has applied this word to his followers: "Listen, we have a great movement here. And if you bring Pat Buchanan's movement together with the Republican Party, we have a majority." That suggests his movement is separate from, and addable to or subtractable from, the G.O.P., holding out the threat of a bolt (a horseracing term).
It also offers an example of the vogue of third-person reference now gripping the Republican field. Nobody says I or me anymore; candidates call themselves by their proper names. Walter Bingham of Truro, Mass., wrote The New York Times about third-personalities: "Imagine if our country's leaders over the years had done the same: 'Give Patrick Henry liberty or give Patrick Henry death.' Or 'Douglas MacArthur shall return.' "
The most subtle use of a Nixon-era phrase was Buchanan's "Watch what we do"; this is taken from the comment of John Mitchell, Nixon's Attorney General, who answered a question about integration policy with "Watch what we do, not what we say." This was taken at the time to be evidence of hypocrisy, but later was understood as shorthand for strictly enforcing integration while publicly expressing sympathy for those opposing it.
Meanwhile, Lamar Alexander, who rejected "the Buchanan movement" and labeled its philosophy of "the wrong ideas" Buchananism (evoking McCarthyism), turned derisive fire on the best-financed candidate: he described Steve Forbes's proposal for a flat, or nonprogressive, tax as "a nutty idea."
"Nutty it's not," editorialized The Wall Street Journal. Milton Friedman, the Nobel-winning economist, said, "Far from being a nutty idea, the flat tax has a long pedigree -- back to tithing for the church." Prof. David Bradford of Princeton weighed in with "Nutty is the word to apply to the existing income tax." Paul Craig Roberts insisted, "It is a nutty idea only to people opposed to American success." But the dismal scientists are not running for office; many political realists agreed with Alexander's use.
The human head is shaped like, and is hard as, a nut. "She meets with a spoony that's nutty," went an English ballad collected in 1799; the meaning was "crazy with love." A century later, according to Jesse Sheidlower of Random House, the spooniness gave way to plain looniness in a book about New York's Chinatown: "He was either nutty or 'off his feed.' " In the mid-1930's, the simile nutty as a fruitcake appeared, and was used by a visitor to Al Capone in prison to sadly describe the gangster's mental decline.
Today, nutty is not as wild as "crazy," not as condemnatory as "foolish," not as formal or limited to the wealthy as "eccentric." Its precise synonym, which threatened to replace it until the word was rescued by anti-flat-taxers, is wacky.

HEADLINE: The World's Greatest Salesman

BYLINE: By Alexander Stille; Alexander Stille, an Alicia Patterson Fellow, wrote "Excellent Cadavers: The Mafia and the Death of the First Italian Republic."

 BODY:
THE POLITICAL CAREER OF THE ITALIAN MEDIA MAGNATE SILVIO BERLUSCONI STARTED, appropriately enough, with a videocassette. On Jan. 26, 1994, Berlusconi addressed the Italian people on all three of his national television networks. Within two months, he turned Italy's political world upside down, created a new political party from scratch and won national elections that would make him Prime Minister.
When people try to explain the "Berlusconi phenomenon," they often mention "the tape," which looked like an address from the Oval Office at the White House. Berlusconi was shown in the study of his sumptuous 18th century villa behind a commanding desk, with family photographs in the background. Even though he was a private citizen and a political novice, Berlusconi spoke as if he were already in office. "Berlusconi was the 'virtual reality' president," says Giuliano Ferrara, one of his chief political strategists. "I understood at that moment that he had changed the form of Italian politics." 
 But during the last year and a half, unpleasant realities have intruded on Berlusconi's presidential dreams. He was forced to step down as Prime Minister at the end of 1994 when part of his center-right coalition abandoned the Government and investigations into his business empire reached his doorstep. This year, in January, he went on trial on charges of authorizing bribes paid by his companies before he entered political life. But Berlusconi's travails appear only to have reinforced his determination to return to power and strengthened his almost messianic faith in his own talents, especially his considerable powers of persuasion.
Many Americans have the impression that since Berlusconi is a defendant in a criminal case, he is politically finished. They are mistaken. He remains the leader of the center-right coalition, which has an excellent chance of winning new elections, now scheduled for April 21.
Whether Berlusconi succeeds in his bid to return to office, his story is one of the great political adventures of recent times. He is the Citizen Kane of the television era, an astonishing example of what happens when media, money and politics combine forces in a society with almost no rules.
His Fininvest business empire extends far beyond television, including everything from book publishing to department stores. Imagine if a real-estate mogul along the lines of Donald Trump also owned CBS, NBC, the Fox network, Paramount Pictures, Newsweek, Random House, Conde Nast, The Los Angeles Times, HBO, the Dallas Cowboys, Wal-Mart stores, Aetna insurance, Loews Theaters and Fidelity Investments and had the political clout of Bill Clinton or Newt Gingrich, and you get an idea of the long shadow Berlusconi casts in Italian life.
From a middle-class family in Milan, Berlusconi helped to put himself through college by working as a nightclub singer on Mediterranean cruise ships. His skills as an entertainer and his own irresistible charm figure heavily in his many stories of his miraculous rise, even though crucial details change from one telling to the next.
When Berlusconi was trying to break into the French television market in the mid-1980's, he obtained an audience with President Francois Mitterrand, whose backing Berlusconi desperately needed. At the end of the encounter, Berlusconi was uncertain whether he had penetrated Mitterrand's glacial reserve and so, as Mitterrand was escorting him to the door of the presidential palace, Berlusconi had what he described as a "stroke of genius." He rushed over to a piano and began to sing "Au Revoir, Paris." Although the chief of protocol looked on in horror, Mitterrand seemed to melt. "I had touched the right chord," Berlusconi later told interviewers. "I had hit the bull's-eye."
In fact, when I attended one of Berlusconi's public appearances in December, it had more of the atmosphere of a concert than a political rally. The occasion was a meeting of his party, Forza Italia (Go, Italy!), whose name cleverly co-opts the rallying cry of Italy's national soccer team. As Berlusconi made his way through the excited crowd, the loudspeakers began to play the Forza Italia party anthem, which Berlusconi is said to have helped write. "Silvio! Silvio! Silvio!" the crowd chanted loudly, as Berlusconi moved toward the stage with a bounce reminiscent of vintage Ronald Reagan.
Berlusconi, who is about 5 feet 6 inches tall, has an athletic bearing. With his finely tailored, double-breasted dark suits and his ready smile, he has the smooth elegance of a 1950's crooner. Rather than stand behind a lectern and read a speech, he took the microphone and moved around the stage, establishing a rapport with the audience, as if he were Frank Sinatra or Tony Bennett.
Berlusconi spoke for more than an hour without notes, never missing a beat. Unlike most Italian politicians, he speaks in a clear, concrete manner. But this day's performance was somewhat angrier and more defensive than usual. Prosecutors in Milan are making his life difficult. They recently discovered a series of Swiss and offshore bank accounts that they say show that Berlusconi has funneled millions of dollars to a former Socialist Prime Minister, Bettino Craxi, a fugitive in Tunisia -- a charge Berlusconi angrily denies. He railed against the magistrates, the "Communists" and his many "enemies" who would stop at nothing to destroy him. The negative tone of the speech seemed to have a somewhat dampening effect on the crowd. Nonetheless, as I left the rally, I found myself humming the Forza Italia anthem.
I met Berlusconi the following day in his Rome residence, just behind Piazza Navona in a Baroque palace built by a 17th-century pope. Delicately painted frescoes of cherubs adorn the ceiling of the waiting room. He was dressed in blue jogging pants, jogging shoes and an elegant navy cashmere sweater. (The color blue plays a large part in the Berlusconi universe. "All the psychologists indicate it as the color that creates a sense of well-being," says Aura Nobolo, press secretary of the Forza Italia group in Parliament.)
Even in informal dress, Berlusconi is impeccably groomed. His thinning hair is carefully in place. And although he is masterful at working a crowd, he appears to have a phobia about germs and quickly washes his hands. "It seems to be typical of tycoons," says Giuliano Ferrara, his aide. "Tycoon" is a word Berlusconi uses to describe himself, and he takes obvious delight in his wealth.
BERLUSCONI, NOW 59, MADE AN INITIAL FORtune in the 1960's and 70's in real estate. He had no experience in construction but immediately showed a talent for sales that has since become abundantly evident. He has phenomenal energy, a great attention to detail and boundless conviction in himself. His deepest beliefs seem to spring from American self-help gospels like Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People." At a training session, he told company salesmen that every morning he stands in front of the mirror and says: "I like myself. I like myself." He is fond of saying he carries "the sun in his pocket," and he instructs his employees to project the same total inner confidence.
His success in politics depends at least in part on his ability to get Italians to share his own radiant optimism. The problem is that he seems ready to say whatever is necessary at a given moment to convince a particular audience, even though that may vary from another version, or from fact. This, too, is part of the Berlusconi philosophy. If you want to convince someone, he told his sales force, make up a quote and attribute it to some renowned authority: "So use this method: 'As Bill Paley of CBS said. As Plato said. As Abraham Lincoln said.' . . . Who's ever going to go and look it up? . . . People are incredibly gullible. They love quotations."
Berlusconi's success has also depended on an ability to manipulate the political levers in Rome. He and his associates were even able to persuade the Government to change the air routes into the Milan airport, which turned his biggest real-estate deal from a potential fiasco into a gold mine. It was in this period, the middle to late 1970's, that Berlusconi cemented his friendship with Craxi, whose political base was in Milan. Craxi became the best man at Berlusconi's second wedding and the godfather to one of his children.
Throughout Berlusconi's meteoric rise, a fundamental question remains: Where did this young man of no apparent means get the capital to start his real-estate ventures? A recent book by two Italian journalists says Berlusconi's initial investors were anonymous Swiss companies whose owners remain unknown. At the same time, there are several criminal investigations stretching back 15 years that have linked members of the Fininvest group to organized crime -- investigations that Berlusconi has denounced as political witch hunts.
For all his claims of being self-made, much of Berlusconi's success in establishing a near monopoly in private television derives from his political backing, virtually limitless credit and a willingness to play fast and loose with the rules. Throughout the 1980's, Craxi's Socialists repeatedly threatened to bring down the Government every time anyone tried to introduce antitrust legislation applicable to the television industry.
Even so, Berlusconi has been a genuine innovator. Before him, Italian television was technically crude and substantively old-fashioned, concentrating on cultural and informational programming. Berlusconi, unencumbered by any notion of television as public service, looked to Hollywood for his model and began buying up entire film libraries. He introduced Italy to "Dallas," "Dynasty" and "Wheel of Fortune," while adding an Italian accent with programs like "Colpo Grosso," which may be the world's first nude game show. These programs fit the mood of the times: the Italian middle class, sick of the terrorism and ideological frenzy of the 1970's, was ready to enjoy a period of prosperity awash in the consumer goods shown on Berlusconi's network.
"Berlusconi created a culture built around the idea of success, personal wealth and material well-being," says Mauro Paissan, a member of Parliament with the left-of-center coalition. Berlusconi himself seemed to fulfill the very dreams that his television stations were promoting. He was a larger-than-life overnight billionaire -- an Italian version of J. R. Ewing. In 1993, a public opinion poll showed that Berlusconi was better known among Italian young people than Jesus Christ. When I mentioned that, he quickly corrected me: "It wasn't 'best known,' it was 'most loved.' I was first, Arnold Schwarzenegger was second and Jesus Christ was third."
By the 1990's, Berlusconi's holdings had expanded greatly. They include the three national television networks; Mondadori, which is the country's largest book publisher and largest magazine publisher; the largest movie production company; the largest department store chain; the most successful soccer team; a chain of movie theaters; a major insurance and mutual fund company and a daily newspaper, Il Giornale. Berlusconi's networks account for about 45 percent of Italy's television audience and about 60 percent of the television advertising revenue. Together with his other publishing holdings, Fininvest controls an incredible 36 percent of all advertising revenue in Italy.
Given Berlusconi's close ties to the Italian political class, the bribery scandal that began in Milan represented a major threat to the Fininvest empire. Craxi was forced to resign, and he eventually fled to Tunisia. Not surprisingly, Berlusconi's Fininvest -- along with many other prominent Italian businesses -- came under scrutiny for suspicion of bribery. The Italian left made no secret of its desire to finally pass antitrust legislation and break up the Fininvest monopoly.
"If I don't enter politics, they'll tear me to pieces," Berlusconi told Indro Montanelli, the editor of his newspaper, Il Giornale.
Along with his extraordinary media access, Berlusconi won because he succeeded in uniting Italy's conservative parties, winning over the center and outshining the country's lackluster and divided left. Like Reagan, Berlusconi exuded infectious optimism and proved a master in communicating simple, appealing messages. Like Ross Perot, he presented himself as a political outsider who could whip Italy's inefficient bureaucracy into shape, like a business executive's turning around a troubled company.
While Berlusconi has shown considerable political ability, the importance of his direct control of his media empire should not be underestimated. When he was preparing his campaign, he called the news directors of his three private television networks and the editors of his vast newspaper and magazine empire to his villa at Arcore and gave them marching orders. "We have to sing in chorus about the topics that interest us . . . we must respond to the artillery fire against us by concentrating all our artillery against them . . . If those who attack us unjustly . . . were assaulted simultaneously by all our media, the aggression would end."
Most complied, but Montanelli, the editor of Il Giornale, refused. Montanelli, 86, regarded by many as Italy's most respected journalist, was forced out after a series of public humiliations, including being repeatedly attacked by one of Berlusconi's networks for failing to support the man who paid his salary.
The imposition of total political control at his Fininvest networks was comparatively easy. Even entertainment programs on those networks have been put to work for the boss's cause. During the campaign, a teen-age idol, Ambra Angiolini, proclaimed on live television that "God the Father is rooting for Berlusconi," while Satan wanted the center-left to win. On the night of Berlusconi's victory, Emilio Fede, a Fininvest anchor, wept with joy on the air.
WHATEVER ROLE TELEVISION MAY have played during the election, enthusiasm for Berlusconi was genuine when he took office in the spring of 1994. But success may have gone to Berlusconi's head. Almost immediately on taking power, his Government acted to force the resignation of the board of directors of RAI, Italy's state television system, who were replaced with more ideologically sympathetic figures, some of them imported directly from the Berlusconi networks.
Berlusconi then decided to take on another of his perceived enemies, the prosecutors. In mid-July 1994, his Cabinet decreed that prosecutors could not issue arrest warrants for many nonviolent crimes, including political corruption -- just as the investigation in Milan was climbing up the Fininvest ladder.
But the decree provoked widespread public protest and was withdrawn. A few months later, prosecutors announced that Berlusconi was under investigation for allegedly authorizing bribes that his brother, Paolo, and others have admitted paying to tax authorities in exchange for favorable audits. Berlusconi's administration unraveled at the end of 1994.
But since his exit from government, Berlusconi has remained the pivotal figure of the center-right. Moreover, he appears to have achieved two of his principal political aims: securing the future of Fininvest and blunting the force of the anti-corruption investigations.
Last spring, Berlusconi defeated a national referendum that would have limited him to owning one national network. Before broadcasting films, the Fininvest networks warned viewers that they might not see movies if the referendum succeeded. Fininvest ran ads saying the referendum would effectively end commercial television.
After the referendum, Berlusconi is now gearing up for an even more important vote. The elections next month are a major crossroads. He is running with only one principal ally, the National Alliance, the former neo-Fascist party, so that a center-right victory will be seen as a clear political mandate. Berlusconi says that if he is re-elected he will change Italy's Constitution to give greater powers to the executive branch. He remains highly popular with voters, although his leadership of the right is being challenged from within his own coalition by Gianfranco Fini, who has moderated the National Alliance's image.
On the center-left, Berlusconi's chief opponent is Romano Prodi, a respected but uncharismatic economist. A month before the election, polls show the two sides neck and neck with one in three of the electorate undecided. Berlusconi's ubiquitous presence on all the television networks as the head of his party's ticket raises again the huge question of conflict of interest -- a problem not well understood in Italy and one I discussed at length with him in Rome.
"Given the fact that you're on trial," I asked, "and that your company has been under investigation from before you entered politics, do you believe that you can impartially administer the justice system?"
"But these charges against me are total inventions," he said.
"People in your company, including your brother, have actually admitted paying bribes," I replied.
"They were victims of a crime, not the perpetrators of a crime," he responded.
Revamping of Italy's state television and its generous public pension system is on the agenda of all the political parties. How can the chief owner of private television and a major insurance company handle that without conflict? Berlusconi reacted with surprise and indignation. "I could never do anything in office that could possibly benefit myself or my company," he said.
Precisely in that period, his group in Parliament was pushing an amendment to the budget that would have given Fininvest a tax abatement worth an estimated $400 million. The amendment failed, but Forza Italia did succeed in winning a valuable abatement for Fininvest's pay-television station. Leading the charge on both pieces of legislation was Vittorio Dotti, who is both the head of Forza Italia's group in Parliament and the chief corporate lawyer for Fininvest.
Berlusconi says he knows nothing of any such base horse-trading. "When I was in office, I detached myself from the day-to-day running of the company," he said. "And even if I wanted to help my company, I couldn't. There are so many checks, decisions are taken collectively."
A Fininvest executive who insisted that he not be identified explained: "He simply does not understand the concept of conflict of interest. When I mentioned to him that when Harold Macmillan had become Prime Minister of Britain he had sold off his interest in his publishing house, Berlusconi's only response was: Why?"
Berlusconi says he believes that he has made an enormous personal sacrifice by offering to lead the nation. "Before I entered politics, when I used to appear in public everyone would applaud; now half of the people applaud, and half of them boo," he said. "I have made a radical innovation in the moral and political climate of this country . . . Other politicians obtained advantages and money out of public life. I have received only disadvantages, and I have spent money, a lot of money." How much? I asked. "I can't say exactly. I have spent a small fortune supporting Forza Italia."
He is lavishly generous with his closest aides, who have displayed iron loyalty toward him -- even under the enormous pressures of the bribery investigations. He says he would be equally generous toward the entire nation, if it would only let him.
"You don't understand," he said as our talk came to an end, and he leaned back wearily on the white couch in his living room, as if gathering his strength for one final attempt to make me see the light. "I have achieved everything in life a man can hope for -- I have nothing left to gain personally," he said, suddenly coiling his body forward. "I have had this extraordinary, unique experience, and I want to make a contribution to the nation. I know how to create; I know how to lead people; I know how to make people love me."

HEADLINE: 'Don't Mess With Our Cultural Patrimony!'

BYLINE: By Andrew Solomon; Andrew Solomon is a contributing writer to the Magazine. His most recent article, a profile of Gore Vidal, appeared in October.

 BODY:
ON JAN. 20, SOMEONE suffering under the misapprehension that I was an employee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art hit me quite hard in the jaw. It was my last night in Taipei, and I'd gone with art-world friends for a late drink at an attractive bar near my hotel. On one side of us, some skinny young men with loosened neckties were using portable phones; on the other, two young women in chic Japanese eyeglasses giggled together. Nearby, a guy with jeans and a leather jacket was punctuating his Chinese sentences with snatches of California-style English. It was Saturday, around midnight, and we were drinking beer with salted prunes in it, as is done in Taipei. I was quietly describing my dinner that evening with Chang Lin-sheng, vice director of the National Palace Museum in Taipei; Maxwell Hearn, the Met's curator of Asian art; Shih Chou-chien, director of art history at Taiwan University, and others.
The guy with the leather jacket, who had overheard me, walked over and leaned heavily on our table. "Don't mess with our cultural patrimony," he said in a tone of voice that in America is not usually associated with the phrase "cultural patrimony." "We're onto your tricks." He was speaking loudly, and several people clustered around. They did not strike me as a museumgoing crowd. 
 "You'll never get the Fan K'uan," one of them taunted. "You'll never get any of the 27. You'll be lucky if you get a few Ch'ing bowls." The mobile-phone users, sensing trouble, had removed themselves to the other side of the room. The young women with the eyeglasses followed.
"The conservation status of works of art is awfully technical," I said gently. It seemed a harmless enough remark, but you could not have raised the tension more if you had advocated the subjugation of Taiwan to mainland rule.
"You Americans don't know a thing," a round-faced man breathed through clenched teeth. It was then that someone said, "What are you, a spy from the Metropolitan?" -- and socked me in the face. A friend grabbed my arm. "Come on, someone just said you do work for the museum -- there's going to be trouble," he said, and hurried me out into the damp night.
At dinner we had been talking about the exhibition of Chinese art from the Palace Museum that was to open at the Met in less than two months. The show was the flower of more than five years of careful negotiation and represented economic, social and cultural cooperation at the highest level.
Many museum shows require delicate international diplomacy, but this one was unusually loaded with political meaning. At a moment when the United States has been alternately currying favor with China and slapping its wrist over human rights violations, and when China is threatening to force a reunification with Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province, the exhibition would remind an American audience of Taiwan's presence and its increasing hunger for self-determination. The opening date of the Met show -- this Tuesday, March 19 -- would be just four days before Taiwan's first free presidential election, which constitutes a display of freedom that has led the mainland to rattle its sabers at an increasingly deafening volume. Moreover, the show would be the greatest exhibition of Chinese art ever mounted in the West, curated to tell its entire history -- a history that is Taiwan's, not China's, to offer because Chiang Kai-shek took all the pre-eminent monuments when he fled in 1949. The Chinese believe that the collection was stolen and should be returned to Beijing.
And so, on Jan. 3, two weeks before the art was to be packed for shipping, the protest movement began. The export of this "cultural patrimony" -- whether China's or Taiwan's -- had incensed many people on the island. By midmonth the situation had become a crisis. The question of whether the art should or would travel dominated the evening news and the front pages of Taiwanese newspapers, and became a rallying point on university campuses. Legislators and ministers, poets and painters found themselves in an unlikely alliance against the Palace Museum. It was a bizarre but telling display of Taiwan's deep identity crisis.
No one could say whether the show, the cornerstone of the Met's season, would be canceled. And no one could say what the protests meant for the future of Taiwan, either.
WEN C. FONG, 65, CAME FROM Shanghai to Princeton as a student in 1948, and when the revolution began back home he stayed on. He is now a professor of art and archeology at Princeton and the chairman of the Asian art department at the Metropolitan Museum. Fong, an imposing but cheerful man, is also a member of Taiwan's Academia Sinica and enjoys access to people at the highest levels -- the most coveted commodity in Chinese societies. Taiwan's art world is full of his former students, and being in Taipei with his blessing is like being in Oz with the kiss of Glinda the Good glowing on your forehead. Fong's scholarship is sterling; his opinions rigid; his passion for Chinese art exhilarating. When, in an early meeting about the Met show, Palace Museum officials tried to withhold some paintings, Fong suggested that it might be better to do just a ceramics show. The paintings went back on the list.
Fong has made the Met's Chinese collection first-rate, and his seminal book "Beyond Representation" narrates Chinese art history through that collection. He had always coveted the work in Taiwan, so when the Palace lent a few pieces to the National Gallery's "Circa 1492" exhibition in 1992, he told Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director, "This is our moment to strike." Fong went to Washington to press his cause with Chin Hsiao-yi, the director of the Palace Museum.
Chin, who was Chiang Kai-shek's amanuensis, is now extremely old and has the stiffly gracious manner of a minor deity. He and Fong have a friendship as carefully tended as a military alliance, within which the terms of the Met exhibition were negotiated. The contracts were finally signed in 1994.
Taiwan's politics caused trouble right from the start. Even though the $6.2 million show seemed an obvious blockbuster, Mobil backed out as a potential sponsor in 1994. In August 1995, under pressure from Beijing, Citibank withdrew its sponsorship; Acer America, a subsidiary of the Taiwanese computer company, pulled out when the protests began.
Protectionism in art is not unusual. There was popular protest in Mexico against the Met's big Mexico show, in Italy against the Vatican show, in Greece against "Greek Art of the Aegean Islands." Nor is it unusual or unproductive for exhibitions to have diplomatic goals: the King Tut show here in 1978 helped improve perceptions of Egypt as it was easing out of its aggressive stance toward Israel. For those societies whose history transcends their modern reality, the artifacts of that history are as potent as weaponry or wealth.
In this case, there was more than internal Taiwanese politics at stake: the very tenuous United States-China-Taiwan relationship had come into play. If Taiwan can sustain order and wealth and democracy, as it seems to be doing, then it becomes an Asian model and so increases the chances for democracy in China. American support of Asian democracy does more to accomplish our foreign-relations goals in China than a thousand economic boycotts or statements about human rights. Though China's militant Taiwan policy has many causes, hatred for that model is a major one. Being the host country for this show, then, would be the perfect cultural counterbalance to our economic support of Taiwan. So the emerging crisis over the Palace Museum show threatened to become our crisis as well.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO separate the history of the Palace collection from the history of China. Most of the work had political underpinnings when it was made, and it continues, amulet-like, to exert political influence today. Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, or Parliament, understanding the Met exhibition as a diplomatic matter, voted to allocate $3.1 million to help pay for it. "Since the current status of Taiwan prohibits the Government from making statements about politics to its primary ally -- the U.S. -- it must communicate with economics and culture," Fong said. "Cultural communication is about to rise to the same level as economic."
In October I attended the celebrations for the Palace Museum's 70th anniversary, during which the best work was trotted out. The museum's current building in Taipei opened its doors in 1965, but the Palace Museum was officially established in 1925 in Beijing under President Sun Yat-sen. The 70th anniversary was celebrated in both Taipei and Beijing; in Taipei, you felt as if you were at the Pope's birthday dinner in Avignon.
I was with a delegation from New York that included Philippe de Montebello and Wen Fong. We were shepherded into an auditorium for lectures and then to a party. President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, the Prime Minister and the most important legislators from the ruling party, the Kuomintang (K.M.T.), were in attendance, but there was virtually no one present from the art world. De Montebello called it "the most peculiar museum event I have ever attended." The officials whirled around Fong; I could little have guessed then what rage against him I was to encounter.
If there were an emperor in Taiwan, he would probably choose to live in the Palace Museum. Situated on a green mountain at the northern edge of Taipei, the 1960's hyper-Chinese building reigns over and embraces the city at its feet. A great flight of 130 marble steps leads to it, and if you lean over the carved bannister, you can take succor in the gardens below: the pools of carp, as happy as the Taoist Chuang-tzu could imagine; the pines, emblematic of the Confucian virtue of constancy; the tea-drinking pavilions, crowded with schoolchildren on field trips, and the beautiful rocks, to which young brides come daily to have their wedding portraits made.
The interior is miserable: ceilings oppressively low or pompously high, lighting hideous beyond belief, installation cases that obstruct views, wall labels stunningly uninformative. But you cannot linger on these inadequacies, because spread before you like a fool's supper is the greatest art of China: neolithic jades, Chou drinking vessels, Sung porcelains, Ch'ing treasure boxes and, most of all, an astonishing collection of T'ang and Sung painting and calligraphy. This work, accumulated by emperors over more than 11 centuries of dynastic rule, is still called the Imperial Collection. No Western museum has such a concentration of great work, but then no Western country has a history as immense as China's.
The Imperial Collection remained in the hands of the last emperor until he was evicted from the Forbidden City in 1924. The next year, when the Palace Museum was established in Beijing, the collection, unseen by the public for a thousand years, was finally exposed. When the Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931, however, the collection was sent in 20,000 wooden crates to Shanghai for safekeeping. It later went to a new storage facility in Nanjing, and when, in 1937, Nanjing was no longer secure, the crates traveled by boat down the Yangtze, by train over the Ch'in-ling Mountains, by truck to Han-chung. Every single object, despite a James Bond-like sequence of sinking ships and blown-up buildings, made it to a safe location.
At the end of World War II the collection was returned to Nanjing, still crated. But when the Communists drew near in 1947, Chiang simply took the bulk and the best with him to Taiwan, storing it in tunnels hollowed out of the side of a mountain.
There the work stayed except for one year, starting in spring 1961, when some 200 pictures and objects -- including Fan K'uan's "Travelers Amid Streams and Mountains" and Kuo Hsi's "Early Spring" -- toured the United States as "Chinese Art Treasures," the show that, Fong said, "single-handedly created modern Western scholarship in this field." Four years later Chiang finally opened the doors of the new Palace Museum in Taipei. Despite having lost China's great cities, and most of its population and land, Chiang still had one great treasure: the Imperial Collection.
People who work at the Palace Museum do not leave. They enter it young, their good doctorates barely sufficient for jobs as tour guides. They will grow old within this place, which will be the locus of their social and professional lives. Those lucky enough to become curators will have their books published by the Palace, and, directly or indirectly, their books will be about the Palace. They will be trained in the weird history of the collection and will live within the compass of the work. They will be allowed into the fabled storerooms, where at any moment 99 percent of the works lie in elegant silk boxes and carved wooden cases and great metal trunks. They will play on the Palace Museum badminton team. "It's the last vestige of the Chinese feudal system," one curator said.
This collection does not travel, even within Taiwan, which is why the decision to send its highlights -- 475 of the most important works of Chinese art in the world -- to the United States was so incendiary. Those items scheduled to go to the Met included 27 from the museum's "restricted list" of particularly exalted pieces, which are usually displayed for only 40 days every three years.
Whereas Americans tend to think of a museum primarily as an educational institution that mounts displays for the public, the Chinese think of a museum as a storehouse that safeguards cultural treasures. Though art lovers in China enjoy looking at paintings, beauty is considered incidental to historical value. Sending Fan K'uan's painting abroad is a bit like lending out the original of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.
The art at the Palace Museum still hangs with 18th-century attributions, despite recent scholarship suggesting that many such attributions are incorrect. "If they started reattributing paintings, they'd be accused of devaluing the collection!" one Taiwan art scholar told me. "Imagine the hysteria there would be in the Legislative Yuan if they said a certain work was not really Fan K'uan!" Instead, scholars at the Palace reattribute work in secret ways. In the Chinese tradition, important paintings hang in the autumn: if you see a Fan K'uan in spring, you know that Palace authorities believe it is not Fan K'uan. The phrase "This work is not characteristic of the artist's style" in a label also signifies a reattribution. One of Wen Fong's major negotiating triumphs was to be given permission to hang work at the Met with his own attributions.
ON JAN. 2, THE PALACE OPENED a preview exhibition of the works destined for New York. "We thought we should exhibit this material so that people could see it -- then we would show it again on return so they could see it was the same work in good condition," said Chang Lin-sheng, a pellucid woman who is the museum's deputy director and the force behind Chin's throne. The preview included everything going to the Met except the 27 items on the restricted list. A label on the wall explained that since these pieces had just been displayed for the 70th anniversary they did not need to be exhibited again now. Had this been more diplomatically phrased, it was to be pointed out, perhaps the protests wouldn't have happened.
The restricted list has very little to do with fragility. Scrolls must be remounted every couple of hundred years, but they are otherwise stable. Rolling and unrolling, however, must be done with care. At the Palace, this service is performed mostly by old soldiers who came over with Chiang and were retired as "technicians." There is one senior technician in particular who tends to create strain marks. ("He likes to do a final twist and hear them go 'ieieiek,' " said one horrified scholar.) The restricted list includes early works that were at one point being unrolled five or six times a week for examination. In the mid-1980's, Chin made up the restricted list to have an official excuse for refusing to accommodate visiting scholars. But the implication is that the pieces will vaporize if you breathe on them, and the wall label at the preview reinforced this perception.
On Jan. 3, as Chin escorted the Vice Director of the Legislative Yuan through the exhibition, a self-described "irate art lover" named T'ang Hsiao-li, a young woman with the sinister gleam of obsession that you see in old footage of the Red Guards, began yelling about fragility. "If director Chin had been polite to Miss T'ang, instead of ignoring her, perhaps this wouldn't have happened," one observer said later. "But director Chin is director Chin."
T'ang, who felt that art too fragile to hang in the Palace Museum should not leave the country, called around town, and on Friday, Jan. 5, The China Times quoted her invitation: "Please wear black and come and sit quietly at the Palace Museum to protest fragile paintings going abroad, starting Saturday morning at 10 A.M."
Saturday the 6th was a radiant, sunny day, and crowds gathered. ("If it had rained," one curator said, "perhaps this wouldn't have happened.") T'ang had rallied most of the people who would become key players in the conflict, including several former Palace Museum employees who had left "under a cloud," as is said there; a few people with personal grudges against Fong or Chin or both, and some genuinely concerned citizens. Chu Ko, an artist who previously worked at the Palace, wrote in The China Times, "I am absolutely astonished that these extraordinarily fragile paintings should be allowed to go." His Palace connection gave him great credibility. Shia Yan, an oil painter, also wrote an inflammatory article -- he had learned to mistrust the United States when a New York gallery dealt with him shoddily.
Estimates of the number of protesters ranged from 60 to 400; dramatic photos showed up the next day on front pages throughout Taiwan. "Lending these works of art is tantamount to betraying our ancestors," said the poet K'uan K'uan, subsequently photographed at the base of a pillar, positioning himself for a hunger strike.
By Monday, Jan. 8, politicians had seized the stage. Chou Chuan, the whip of the opposition New Party, dropped in on Chin with a dozen reporters in tow. She also brought Chu Hui-liang, who at the time still worked at the Palace (and was the star of the badminton team), had recently earned her doctorate from Princeton (advised by Fong) and had just been elected to the Legislative Yuan. Chu suggested to Chin that he replace the originals with high-quality reproductions. "How can you, a museum-trained person, even suggest this?" asked Chin, but he got short shrift in the press.
The same day, protesters gathered outside the Control Yuan, which monitors the various branches of Government. By now the Ministry of Education had been given responsibility for the Palace matter. In the Legislative Yuan, opposition party leaders banned the 27 restricted items from export and called a public hearing for Wednesday, Jan. 10, to consider how to proceed.
James C. Y. Watt, a gentle, scholarly Hong Kong-born Chinese man who dislikes confrontation, works under Fong at the Metropolitan Museum. He had come to Taiwan to oversee the preparation of condition reports and the packing of artwork. Now he found himself in the middle of a scandal. At the public hearing in the Legislative Yuan, he was the first speaker. As he ascended to the podium, the lights of 10 television cameras blinded him, and the protesters, who had packed the building, began screaming expletives as he tried to speak. "Shameless! Shameless! You're crazy!" they heckled. Quietly, decorously, he talked about the Met's commitment to this art and about the value of cultural exchange. No one listened. When Watt stepped into the corridor, a reporter collided with a protester; they ended up in a fist fight from which Watt narrowly escaped. "I felt like I was stuck in an Ionesco play," he said later.
By this time, "We had a war room in New York," Philippe de Montebello said. He and Fong and Emily K. Rafferty, the Met's vice president for development, stayed up most nights phoning Taiwan for news. Judith Smith, Fong's special assistant, consolidated information and wrote up detailed daily reports. The team drafted letters to Government officials and protesters -- anxious letters, conciliatory ones. Some were sent and some not. Every day Fong planned and canceled a trip to Taiwan; it was ultimately decided that his presence there would only inflame the matter. De Montebello managed to reach Chou Chuan, the New Party whip, "but she had no sympathy for our cause," he said. "For her it had become a matter of politics, the drama to be magnified for political ends, like Helms on Mapplethorpe, a populist stance that distracted voters from the real issues of the country."
There were also efforts at "back-room and corridor diplomacy," de Montebello said, discussions with lower-level Yuan staff members to be reported back to the higher-ups. Every personal connection, no matter how slight, was called into play.
On Saturday, Jan. 13, protesters gathered at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei. They had written slogans on strips of gauze and tied them around their foreheads, and they carried huge banners. There were politicians, including one independent presidential candidate, who suggested that the leaders of the ruling K.M.T. were exploiting their control of the Palace collection to reflect glory on themselves. There were young people to whom democracy was new, drunk on the power of their protests. And there were a surprising number of angry young men and women burning with Chinese nationalism. "We won't grovel before the West," said one. "We get the work 40 days every three years, and you get it for a year? And we pay half the expenses of the show?"
Aware of the growing anger, Fong declared in an open letter to the Ministry of Education that he would forfeit two of the top three paintings in the show, asking only for Kuo Hsi's "Early Spring," because it was on the cover of the catalogue (which had already been printed). "My grandmother or my maiden aunt would also say, to expose this is to destroy it," Fong would later concede about the Palace collection. "But the time for such sentiments is past." The increasingly hostile Taiwanese press quoted him as saying, quite arrogantly, that he would cancel the show if more work was withdrawn. "It wasn't a matter of my canceling it," Fong said later, "but of there being no show left with the cuts they'd proposed."
In the Met's war room, de Montebello and the others "made lists for ourselves of what we could not live without -- lists not of objects but of relationships among objects," he said. "We were willing to accept a show that was quantitatively reduced, but not one that was typologically reduced. No single major category of objects could be missing. It was necessary that the show sustain its goal of presenting a transversal history of Chinese art, that we not be forced to eliminate the T'ang, Sung or Yuan dynasties from our presentation, that the integrity of the curatorial vision be left intact. But being too pious in this matter would not have been public-spirited. It was important that we not in our disappointment cancel a remarkable show. One day I thought our chances were at 60 percent. The next day it was 30 percent."
The museum's press office, meanwhile, which had been organizing expensive preview trips to Taiwan and printing color brochures, moved into a state of hysteria. Interviews were forbidden, information given so much spin as to become implausible. Attempts to control journalists could hardly have been more stringent during the Cultural Revolution than they were during January and February at the Met.
At another protest, on Wednesday, Jan. 17, back in Taipei, the rumors flew: the Metropolitan Museum would lock the Chinese treasures in its basement and send back cleverly made copies; President Clinton would give the art back to the mainland. The United States Congress's guarantee of protection for foreign cultural treasures, someone asserted, was no more reliable than the diplomatic relationship with Taiwan it had terminated in 1978. "Neither at the Met nor elsewhere in the West do you know how to treat work on paper or silk," one anti-American protester told me. When a Chinese friend of mine countered that the Met's studio for the conservation of Asian art operates at a much higher standard than the Palace's, people screamed insults at him.
"This work is much too sophisticated for an American audience," another protester told me. "People in your country couldn't understand or appreciate it. Sending it to you is just a waste."
The Ministry of Education formed a committee to investigate the whole fiasco. At a big rally on Thursday, Jan. 18, demonstrators wrapped themselves in a petition with 20,000 signatures gathered in a single day at Kaohsiung University. Particular rage was directed against committee members associated with Fong -- though it would have been difficult to form a qualified committee free of Fong-trained scholars. Fong was still being advised to stay in New York. "You can do nothing but wait, and hope," he was told by a friend on the committee. "I hope there will still be a show to save by next week."
I was standing in the crowd outside the investigative committee's first meeting when a television camera suddenly pointed at me. "I'm told you've actually met Wen Fong," a journalist said. "Is he really as we understand him to be: greedy, arrogant, selfish and mean?"
BY JAN. 20, WHEN I MET with Chu Hui-liang, the new New Party legislator, she was expressing regret over the debacle. "I worried about sending 'Travelers Amid Streams and Mountains' -- I thought they were being irresponsible," she said. "People need to know what a 'restricted list' actually means. But I didn't intend that the whole show be destroyed."
Within the high walls of the Palace there was an air of frustration and sadness. "What is wrong with these people?" asked Chang Lin-sheng of the Palace Museum, who was handling the day-to-day trauma of the protests. I had had to sneak into her office, since she was avoiding interviews; she looked tired. "Don't they have jobs? Don't they have anything to do all day besides march up and down out there with inaccurate slogans?" The phone rang. She talked fast for 45 minutes, her tone conciliatory and irritable. "Wen Fong," she said when she hung up. "I told him I can't help him anymore." She picked up a copy of a popular magazine with "Travelers Amid Streams and Mountains" on its cover. "I suppose it's something that now everyone in the country has heard of Fan K'uan, when recently this population couldn't be bothered to see our 70th-anniversary exhibition. The truth is, we all worried about sending Fan K'uan. Maybe one or two others are best left here, as the Mona Lisa stays at the Louvre. But for the rest -- people should see it. Most of this, of course, is politics, but now the general public -- how can they be so suspicious of us? Don't they understand how much we love that work? We're all fragile. Should we never leave home again?"
Or, as Fong put it, "You don't stop eating because you might choke."
There would be a dozen more battles. The investigative committee and its subcommittees decided to reconsider every object, not just those on the restricted list. Some protesters threatened legal action against the Palace Museum.
De Montebello's "corridor diplomacy" did not seem to be working. Neither he nor the director of the American Institute in Taiwan, our "ambassador" there, was ever able to reach the Minister of Education. To those in power in Taiwan, the strong wishes of the Metropolitan Museum were of little interest, and the Met, realizing that posturing would not protect the show, lapsed into relative silence. But Fong remained confident. "The Government had to be seen to be responsive to the people," he explained. "So pieces would be withdrawn. But if the whole show had been canceled, the Government would have appeared to be helpless in the hands of some hysterics. It would have seemed that there was no Government policy. Such a display of weakness would have run contrary to their interests."
Still, the Met's situation was getting scary. The packing was already a week behind schedule, and the exhibition cases the museum had commissioned couldn't be built because no one knew what would go in them. The reserved cargo space on the planes had been forfeited; Acer had withdrawn its $1.5 million sponsorship, and now the protesters were trying to halt the Taiwanese Government's financing. The standard greeting in Taipei art circles was, "What news from Wen today?" But it had become clear that there was nothing that Wen Fong or anyone else in the United States could do.
By the end of January, reports of new Chinese threats to Taiwan pushed the art controversy off the front pages. On Jan. 23, the committee announced a compromise that left all sides frustrated: 23 items, including several landmark pieces, were withdrawn, and 19 other important works were restricted to 40 days of display. The Met took six of these works, and distributed the rest among the other American museums that the exhibit would visit.
The Met bravely decided to start packing without financial guarantees for one of the most expensive exhibitions in its history (although insurance and transportation costs were somewhat reduced by the exclusion ofkey priceless works). "We told the board of trustees we would be picking up the gap of $1.5 million left by the withdrawal of corporate sponsors," said Emily Rafferty, the museum vice president. "We also said there was a possibility that the $3.1 million from Taiwan would not come through. It was a gamble -- $4.6 million from our operating budget wouldn't have closed down the museum, but it would have been devastating." Now, "Taiwan's Foreign Ministry has begun paying," she said. "There is nothing on paper, but I believe they will pay according to their promises."
De Montebello asked wryly, "Whom should it make anxious to have the work here and the money not?"
So "Splendors of Imperial China" will open at the Met after all, but without 36 of its crowning splendors. Sadder even than the absence of "Early Spring" or "Travelers Amid Streams and Mountains" is that the exquisite narrative coherence and balance of the planned exhibit has been substantially undermined. It is still, however, a magnificent show, in many ways the greatest exhibition of Chinese art ever staged in the West, and the work will be displayed and lighted a thousand times better than it ever has been at the Palace. It may also be the last show of its kind: given the frenzied protectionist sentiment during January's fracas, much of this work is not likely to leave Taiwan ever again.
THE UNREST IN TAIWAN WAS strange for two reasons. First, Taiwan is hardly anti-American. An enormous number of Taiwanese travel to, and study in, the United States. Much of the population speaks English, and, the occasional bar fight about Fan K'uan notwithstanding, as an American you tend to feel at home in Taiwan more easily than in almost any other East Asian country. Seven of Taiwan's 17 Cabinet members hold Ph.D.'s from American universities. Taiwan is the world's third-largest purchaser of American armaments, our eighth most important trading partner. "The educated population here is as much American as anything else," a young artist told me.
But the second reason the protests were so surprising is more subtle and important. Taiwan has been in turmoil for a long time, and particularly in the last five years, about whether or not it is China. The "one China" policy is, in fact, the most pressing political issue of the day: will Taiwan at some point be reunited with the mainland -- by force or otherwise -- or will it eventually declare independence?
The official stance of mainland Communists and Taiwan's K.M.T. is that Taiwan is a province of China; both Taipei and Beijing claim to be valid rulers of China. To the casual Western observer, the situation seems ludicrous. Taiwan has a separate economy, political system and educational system; citizens carry Taiwanese passports. But Chinese nationalism is deep-seated. Some Taiwanese like to feel that they are part of a great nation and not, as one essayist wrote, "citizens of another piddling Southeast Asian provincial hole-in-the-wall country." To the many Taiwanese with ties to the mainland, declaring independence would be like cutting off their own arms.
Not that the mainland will countenance independence. Since President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan visited the United States in June to deliver a speech at Cornell, China has conducted ever-grander "standard military exercises" on the shores opposite Taiwan and in the sea off its northern coast. And so Taiwan, under constant threat from the mainland, must toady both across the strait and to the West. That the United States withdrew its ambassador in 1978 also provokes rage. There's Taiwan -- a peaceful democracy that the United States doesn't recognize because we do recognize another country with a terrible human rights record, one with which we do less than half as much trade and which snubs us in its foreign and domestic policies.
Taiwan's identity struggle fed the Palace protests. During the 70th-anniversary celebrations, I encountered more people in Taipei art circles who wanted to disavow the Palace than who praised it. Though the Palace has always attracted tourists, most locals have avoided it -- because of its forbidding air, because Taiwan has long been indifferent to art and, in large part, because the museum is, according to many Taiwan intellectuals, "alienatingly Chinese."
As Taiwan has stumbled along toward relative independence, the Chinese past has often been written off. The radical politics of the last 10 years has been about escaping China. The protests over the Palace Museum collection mirror the advent of democracy: they are about finding control where previously there was only the bulk of higher authority. So even though mainland China also objected to the artwork's leaving Taiwan, mainland leadership could hardly have smiled upon the protests.
There also exists within Taiwan today a powerful ethnic tension between the "mainlanders" (the "1949'ers" and their progeny, about 20 percent of the population) and the "Taiwanese" (whose forebears settled there earlier). It is a strange ethnic tension, since both groups are Han Chinese. But from 1949 until the end of the brutal "Chiang Dynasty," in 1987, the mainlanders of the K.M.T. ruled, and the Taiwanese, despite controlling much land and wealth, were treated as an underclass.
Chiang's Government, still claiming to rule China, and filling its legislature with representatives from every mainland district, was corrupt and often evil. But in the past nine years, the country has transformed itself, with remarkable fluidity, into a functional democracy with a highly educated population (the literacy rate is more than 90 percent, which in a character-written language is astonishing), enormous national wealth (Taiwan has one of the largest per capita cash reserves in the world) and open elections. The legislature no longer tries to represent all of China.
There are now three main political parties in Taiwan: the entrenched K.M.T., the Democratic Progressive Party (the D.P.P., the primary opposition party, which overtly stands for independence) and the mainlander-heavy New Party, which advocates long-term reunification with China. There are legitimate divides among the parties, though all three tend to use exalted rhetoric about the "one China" policy to mask simple power struggles.
For the New Party, the Palace Museum protests were a triumph. Some of its members, after all, including Chou Chuan and Chu Hui-liang, helped lead the protests -- which began shortly after an election in which the New Party had gained many seats, primarily at the expense of the K.M.T. And by consistently calling the Palace collection "the Chinese cultural patrimony," New Party leaders and other protesters were able to rally the sympathy of a surprisingly large population that identified such material as key to Taiwan's inchoate struggle for a cultural identity.
"The Palace Museum is a nice place, but it's too Chinese and insufficiently Taiwanese," said Chen Shih-meng, Deputy Mayor of Taipei and former Secretary General of the D.P.P. "Whether Chiang Kai-shek took that material rightfully or wrongfully, I don't know, but we need a Taiwanese place to complement the Palace Museum. We deserve to understand ourselves as Taiwanese. I was taught that I was a part of a Chinese culture to which I never truly belonged. We must raise the consciousness of our next generation. We must help them toward cultural freedom from the mainland."
And then, as is typical given the tense politics of Taiwan, Chen fused the topic at hand with the more essential matter of independence. "The leadership here has a clear destination for Taiwan, but says that to avoid irritating the mainland, they must speak with creative vagueness," he said. "This vagueness, meant to confuse Beijing, confuses the people of Taiwan more than it does the enemy. If China uses military force, we will counterattack. We could destroy their economic zones incredibly fast. We will not win by pitching threats against military experts in the Chinese leadership, but if we use our military capacities to sow fear among the economists, we can divide that leadership to triumph. We must build defense capacity and make our plans clear to the mainland. Developing a native cultural awareness is a part of this policy. The Palace Museum does not enable such objectives."
Chang Lin-sheng of the Palace Museum said of those who would advocate an autonomous Taiwanese art: "These are rootless people. Did you know that the aboriginal tribes the localists love so much have no word in their language for art?" She paused dramatically. "Democracy is not good for art," she continued, wringing her hands and laughing. "Communism is worse. Capitalism is a good approximation of an imperial system, and is very good for art. There is no Taiwanese culture. It's not like the racial problem in the U.S. -- we are all Han people, and our culture was at its greatest in imperial courts." The Palace Museum, she insisted, is the best answer to the Taiwanese search for dignity.
WHEN "SPLENDORS OF Imperial China" opens this week, the works that will be most noticeably absent are the greatest landscapes of the Sung Dynasty, 960-1279, which is to China what the Renaissance is to the West. But "Splendors" still has landmark Chinese paintings, including Huang Kung-wang's long hand-scroll "Dwelling in the Fu-ch'un Mountains," probably the greatest of Yuan paintings, created between 1347 and 1350. The Met's original plan was for it to be only partly unrolled, but the disappearance of 36 objects will allow it to be unfurled in its 20-foot glory.
Yuan painting is somewhat harder for a Western audience to understand than Sung painting; its refinement can be mistaken for obscurity. The Yuan painters were striving for complete simplicity of style and subject, the imagination given free rein within tight confines, greatness achieved through understatement. The painter Wu Chen spoke of "flavor within blandness" when he rejected the theatricality of Sung styles.
Huang Kung-wang made his masterpiece in his old age. "One leisurely day in the south pavilion I took up my brush and wrote out this scroll to the end," he later mused. "In my extreme exhilaration, I was not aware of time passing. . . . Three or four years later, it was still not finished. . . . Morning and evening, whenever I can catch a free moment, I put my brush to work!" In 1650 the scroll's owner wanted to take it beyond the grave, and ordered that it be burned. It was laid on the coals, but when the dying man turned away, his nephew substituted another scroll, and so was able to save six of the seven original sheets.
James Cahill, the leading scholar in the field, has written that more than three years passed before Huang decided the scroll was finished. "The somewhat arbitrary nature of that decision is suggested by the nature of the picture," he wrote. "It seems to be the product of a series of decisions, some of them a bit capricious, made by the painter at successive stages in the painting process, reflecting his state of mind at the moments when he made them. And yet, and paradoxically perhaps, it achieved the sense of 'rightness' or inherent order which the Chinese call li." Maxwell Hearn writes in the Met's catalogue: "Huang's painting presents a calligraphic landscape, in which the focus shifts from the representation of reality to the hand of the artist. . . . Nature has become a metaphor for the self, and the landscape, a reflection of the artist's inner world."
Sung artists had risen to the peak of naturalistic representation, hiding the brush stroke by using washes; they wished to delete themselves graphically from their work. Huang's brush strokes, like his sentiments, are everywhere apparent, as if he were writing the letters of his own heart, thoughtfully but without hesitation.
It is fashionable at the moment to speak of the failure of Western medicine to reconcile the mind-body split, and to look to the East for holistic cures. The Western division between word and image, between literary and artistic history, is no less troubling. Calligraphy is still the hardest of the Chinese arts for most Westerners to grasp: language is not metaphor but object, and what is signified is to some extent the process of signification -- the writing and the content are harder to dissever than the dancer from the dance. Fong calls calligraphy a "nonerasive medium." It can be epistolary and spontaneous, with an ink trace that is entirely expressive, or it can be formal and ritualistic.
Huai-su's "Autobiographical Essay," another extraordinary piece that has made it to the Met's show, is a self-congratulatory drunken celebration in cursive forms, dated 777. In it, Huai-su explains that he writes best when drunk. As he goes on and gets drunker, the text becomes less literary, but the quality of the writing is exalted. The characters flow into one another as the brush charges forward, making fluid patterns of line -- rhythmic, pulsing, almost erotic. Chao Meng-chien, writing in the 13th century, said that Huai-su "grasps his pen grandly like a frightened snake, rings it about roundly, and yet is very strangely spare." Huai-su himself wrote: "When I see extraordinary mountains in summer clouds, I try to imitate them. Good calligraphy resembles a flock of birds darting out of the trees, or startled snakes scurrying into the grass, or cracks bursting in a shattered wall."
The Met will also have Emperor Hui-tsung's "Two Poems," a fine example of his "slender gold" calligraphy. Done more than 300 years later than Huai-su's piece, it stands in sharp contrast to it. Cahill writes, "Each of the tense, reedy strokes, faultlessly executed, takes a predetermined shape; each character, occupying its assigned space, exhibits order and stasis, as if engraved in stone."
Hui-tsung was an incompetent Emperor, ambitious about building great public gardens and vague about running the country, but he was a glorious patron and practitioner of the arts. "Only through creativity," he wrote, "does one's merit remain behind."
WHAT IS INCLUDED in "Splendors" is the merit of Chinese emperors, which may lie more tangibly in works of calligraphy than in political achievement or military conquest. Fong's catalogue, significantly titled "Possessing the Past," is in some ways an embarrassment to the Met. The cover shows Kuo Hsi's "Early Spring," which is not in the exhibition. The copyright page thanks Acer for the corporate sponsorship it withdrew. And the text refers at some length to work that will probably never be seen again in this country, all of it illustrated in glowing color. ("Well, at least you have your book," de Montebello told Fong when it looked like the show would miscarry.)
Still, the book is a magnificent achievement. It uses techniques of connoisseurship to narrate a 1,000-year evolution of the idea of art. With grace and clarity, it balances social and formal art histories; it explicates the force that won these Chinese masterpieces their canonical position and the force that canonical position has afforded them.
"Possessing the Past" also seems to tell over and over the story of what happened in Taiwan in January. "How much high Chinese culture is there in China?" Fong asked me one evening this winter. "It's all Western. So much has been lost and forgotten by Chinese people in the last 150 years. What they still have is so precious, but being proud of your heritage and having the will to understand it are two different things."
Some protesters in January spoke of the need for an exhibition in Taiwan of European art, as grand as "Splendors," that would include everything from the Mona Lisa to "Guernica." A Chinese audience might want to call such an exhibition "Escaping the Past." In the West, meaning lies in where you are going; in China, in where you have been.
The Western press, when it describes the surging New Party, attributes its new power to the Taiwanese fear of the mainland. But in fact, the New Party -- which advocates reunification in the distant future, or possessing the past -- was founded by people who understand the world through Chinese eyes. The Taiwanese, it turns out, are more Chinese than we might have thought. The battle over the Palace Museum collection suggests that the next struggle may well be between that party and the K.M.T. over the terms of unification, and not about the sort of wide-eyed independence that has swept Eastern Europe, which so readily grips the American imagination and has brought about the current missile crisis. Like most historical art exhibitions, "Splendors of Imperial China" is about the past. More than most others, it may be about the future as well.

HEADLINE: CLASS IS NO LONGER A FOUR-LETTER WORD

BYLINE: By Jason DeParle; Jason DeParle is a staff writer for the Magazine, based in Washington. His last article was on Newt Gingrich.

 BODY:
The class content of a Pat Buchanan rally is so thick you can smell it. It smells like motor oil. Or so it does this February afternoon on the floor of a transmission factory in Fort Dodge, Iowa, where the air tools hiss, the employees wear coveralls and Buchanan confers upon them the proud title "worker." He issues his usual condemnations of corporate greed and pokes fun at Steve Forbes, his impossibly rich rival, for cooking up his ideas with "the boys down at the yacht club." He even solicits Democratic votes by mocking his own party's plutocratic past. "You can join the party of greed for one evening!"
But when I approach Buchanan and note, perhaps with a trace of grudging admiration, that he has brought a new class sensibility to the election, he blanches. Actually, he puckers. "Class sensibility?" he says, spitting out the phrase like a bad olive. Though Buchanan is rarely at a loss for words, this stops him cold. "I don't think I want to go anywhere near that one." Instead, he climbs back into his bus and resumes his underdog campaign, on behalf of those who "work with their hands and tools and machines." 
 Call it what you will, but class anger is back. Who could have imagined that a win in New Hampshire would come to the man who called the stock market "un-American"? Or that Bob Dole would pose, even fleetingly, as a critic of corporate America? For those who like their politics leavened with a little economic envy, it has been a soap-operatic delight, this spectacle of millionaires decrying one another's ill-gotten gain. These are, after all, Republicans.
Buchanan himself may be all but vanquished as a Republican contender, but Buchananism will continue to be scrutinized, feared, mimicked -- and heard. His early success is a reminder of (among other things) the enduring, if often convoluted, ways that class grievances play out, despite the common pretense that Americans don't mess with that class warfare stuff. Indeed, a notable aspect of the current skirmishes is that they are, by American standards, astonishingly straightforward: frustrated workers are complaining about the inequities of the market. In recent years, anger, especially blue-collar anger, has tended to flow the other way. It has pointed down -- toward welfare families, immigrants and beneficiaries of affirmative action -- even as the distribution of income has been flowing steadily upward. In railing at "corporate butchers," Buchanan hasn't abandoned these other forms of class warfare; he has simply opened a second front.
On the surface, it seems a boon for the Democrats, who have been trying to make "fairness" an issue for at least 15 years. President Clinton could have been cribbing from Buchanan earlier this month when he traveled to the blue-collar precincts outside Detroit. "People my age, 50-year-old men, are being told they're not important anymore -- 'Thank you very much for the last 25 years; you figure out how to send your kids to college,' " he said. Representative Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, goes as far as proclaiming a new era -- "the era of income politics." But an era of income politics is almost by definition an era of at least modestly assertive government. And wasn't that Bill Clinton himself claiming, in the State of the Union address, that "the era of big government is over"?
Campaign '96 promises less to inaugurate a new era than to underscore an old lesson. It shows how class sensitivity pervades American society, even as the national mythology -- and Buchanan himself -- pretends it does not. "I don't believe in class warfare," Buchanan says, while writing an instructive new manual in the art.
A WEEK AFTER HIS APPEARANCE AT THE TRANSMISSION factory, Buchanan is bouncing through a New Hampshire blizzard in a van, still contemplating the word "class." He says that when he first heard it from me in Iowa, his reaction was, "Uh-oh, this guy must be a Marxist." But returning now from an evening rally, Buchanan is warming to the term. "I mean, we win landslides among those under $30,000 and we've lost every time among those over $100,000," he says. "So there is no doubt we have great appeal to working people."
Buchanan quickly shows that he knows quite a bit about the politics of class. After all, he learned while writing speeches for two Republican Presidents, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who were masterful at stripping Democrats of their working-class base. They did it not with explicit economic appeals but by talking about "values" and cracking the cultural codes. George Wallace led the way, appealing to blue-collar resentments by painting the Democrats as the party of "pseudo-intellectuals" and pampered, unshaven hippies.
A story recounted by Michael Kazin in his book "The Populist Persuasion" is telling. "You young people seem to know a lot of four-letter words," Wallace once taunted a crowd of demonstrators. "But I have two four-letter words you don't know: S-O-A-P and W-O-R-K." Seeing how Wallace had pried loose the blue-collar vote from the Democrats in 1968, Nixon captured it with appeals to the "silent majority" in speeches that Buchanan himself wrote. "We stood up for the squares of America, if you will, the Middle Americans," Buchanan says. "It had a class component."
Though Reagan grabbed the lunch-pail voter with similar appeals, Buchanan complains that "Reagan had a very difficult time being critical of big business." Buchanan talks of pressing him to add to a speech a threat to prosecute profiteering defense contractors. "He wouldn't put it in," he says. When I ask why not, Buchanan shows that he can warm to an audience quickly. He says the corporate chiefs were part of Reagan's crowd -- "that was reflecting class sensibility, if you will."
Buchanan's playfulness with the language of class is more than mere semantics. "Class" is itself a class-coded word, with an academic, upper-income lilt; in simultaneously mocking and employing it, Buchanan straddles a class divide. More broadly, his ability to embrace and eschew what he calls "class warfare" with equal conviction -- appealing to class divisions even while pretending they do not exist -- is a characteristically American trait. Didn't the founders proclaim that "all men are created equal" while themselves holding slaves?
Historians insist that for a number of reasons, class consciousness has a relatively weak hold on American life. The country has more powerful sources of identity -- ethnicity, religion and especially race. It has enjoyed a history of real economic mobility. And the civil religion insists lives should be equal, even when they are not. That's why financial extremes can be as embarrassing to the rich as they are to the poor, and why those at both ends identify themselves as "middle class." A Fort Dodge farmer with a Buchanan button seems offended when I ask whether he considers himself working class. "Everybody's working class," he insists -- even Steve Forbes. "It's just that some do more manual labor than others."
So class anger just doesn't sell -- except when it does. That is, the country remains suffused with class feeling, even if it rarely takes on enough self-awareness to be called class consciousness. "The class aspect is not the dominant aspect of American politics, but it's a lot more significant than our mythology allows," says Kevin Phillips, whose 1990 book, "The Politics of Rich and Poor," predicted the decade would see the rise of populist passions. If there is so little economic identity in American society, how does a country singer like Sammy Kershaw sell a million records complaining, "I ain't Goldfinger and I ain't Joe Fashion/And you can't buy much with the checks I'm cashin' "?
In an economy where the dollars are migrating ever upward, more voters are singing that tune. In 1994, annual household income was $1.1 trillion greater than it had been 15 years earlier. But calculations by Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, show that the income received by those Americans in the bottom 53 percent of society actually declined. Average household incomes of the poorest fifth dropped 3 percent, to $7,800 a year. The next fifth, the blue- and pink-collar class? Down 4 percent, to $19,200. And what about the middle fifth, the bedrock of America, the true middle? Incomes dipped almost 2 percent, to $32,400, even though more families were relying on an additional wage earner. The only place the news is good is at the top, among the people whom Nashville songwriters mock for paying "their bills on home computers." The take of the top 5 percent soared to $183,000 a year -- a raise of 40 percent.
So it should come as no surprise that voters are irritable. The erratic politics of the 1990's might be thought of as a class brawl in search of a target. Playing the fairness card in 1992, Bill Clinton fingered the rich. "The rich get the gold mine and the middle class gets the shaft," he said. "It's wrong and it's going to ruin the country." Two years later, the Republicans captured Congress by insisting that the Government itself was the problem; the bureaucrat had become the boss. "We believe parents ought to have the money; they believe bureaucrats ought to have the money," said Newt Gingrich. But the Republicans played Robin Hood in reverse: taking from Medicare to finance reductions in capital gains. "The average voter read that as, 'The fat cats are back in charge,' " Kevin Phillips says. And Buchanan had an opening.
WHILE BUCHANAN TALKS OF "CORPORATE EXECUTIONERS," OTHERS find more subtle ways to advertise their class credentials. If roots were all that mattered, Dole would have it made. Coming of age in small-town Kansas during the Depression, he knew hardships not even imagined by Buchanan, who grew up as an accountant's son in a prosperous corner of Washington. "My father was a grain-elevator operator," Dole begins one evening last month in Oskaloosa, Iowa. "He wore his overalls to work every day for 42 years, and he was proud of it. Lived in a basement apartment. Rented out the upstairs to pay the bills. I grew up hardscrabble, know what it means to be at the bottom of the ladder economically."
Dole did indeed know hardscrabble, and he worked mightily to leave it behind. The symbols of his success are the very things his rivals use to raise doubts about him -- the corporate jets, the Senate pension, the apartment at the Watergate. Though he makes a wan effort to criticize corporate greed a few weeks later, Buchanan's remarks about that speech are more persuasive. "Everyone knows that one week after Bob Dole is there" -- at the White House, that is -- "he and Dwayne Andreas and Bob Strauss, they'll all go rolling over to Kay Graham's house and it'll be business as usual."
Still, Dole continues to talk on this evening in Iowa about the hardships of the past, and as he does, a new sort of double talk emerges. Suddenly Dole is saying kind things about people on welfare. "I used to sign checks for my grandparents when I was county attorney -- they were on welfare," he says. "Wasn't their fault. You can't take everything away from the poor and say, 'Oh, boy, we balanced the budget.' This is America." This is a pleasant sentiment, and Dole may even believe it. But it is wholly at odds with his recent votes to abolish Federal welfare guarantees. It is even at odds with his own campaign commercials, which label Forbes "too liberal" on welfare. Dole's ability to be on all sides of the class war may seem like a contradiction, but it's a classic American stance.
Forbes has no humble roots to market, but that doesn't leave him tone-deaf to class. Indeed, he has managed the counterintuitive feat of turning his wealth into a kind of populist credential: the people's candidate, too rich to be bought. What do strapped voters think of a man who lavishes $30 million on his own campaign? "It's better than taking PAC money," says a fellow in a billed cap, standing outside the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in Knoxville, Iowa. Focus groups conducted by Senator Phil Gramm's campaign concluded that most voters felt the same way. Thus the presence this winter of a candidate whose momentary support seemed to defy the laws of economic envy -- an heir, seeking to abolish the progressive income tax!
Gramm dismissed him as "Richie Rich"; Lamar Alexander taunted him as "Junior." But Forbes turned his campaign into his own version of a class war, running against the despised "insiders." So it is that a man who inherited an island in Fiji and a plane called the Capitalist Tool could attack Bob Dole for having a "Versailles mentality." Or complain that Alexander's self-enrichment "beats Hillary's commodities deal hands down."
The strangest thing about Forbes's stance as an outsider is that he may actually believe it -- "rich as hell and not going to take it anymore," as one cartoonist put it, may be how he really feels. At least it sounds that way when he talks about the tax code, his own explanation for falling incomes. "Scrap it, actually kill it, drive a stake through its heart and hope it never rises again to terrorize the American people," he says. With the I.R.S. as his foil, Forbes has mastered the unimaginable. He has managed to turn class anger into an equal-opportunity emotion: even the rich can apply.
BUT NO ONE KEEPS UP WITH BUCHANAN, WHO, DRUNK ON HIS early success, turns to medieval war cries. "The peasants are coming with pitchforks!" he bellows at every stop. It's comic, captivating, viscerally appealing -- and scary. Those black-leather bikers and gun nuts turning up at his rallies may not have mastered the concept of metaphor. Urging them to "lock and load" -- and take aim at "Jose" -- is virtually a request for violence.
Buchanan might seem less offensive if he dropped his coded references to Jewish bankers and stopped saluting the Confederate flag. But he would still have no program to satisfy the class resentments he roils. His impasse is like that of the country at large. His antipathy for Wall Street steers him toward government, but his antipathy toward government pushes him back toward the market forces he decries. He careens, railing against one and then the other, seemingly unaware of the dilemma.
Buchanan believes that tariffs are the answer, but most economists think that trade makes only a modest contribution to the nation's rising inequality. When 18 prominent economists gathered at the end of 1994 at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, they took an informal poll. On average, they attributed about 10 percent of the growing wage disparity to international trade. They gauged that another 10 percent came from declining union memberships, and 9 percent from the erosion of the minimum wage. By contrast, they attributed almost half of the increased income inequality to technological changes that benefit the better educated.
Consider General Motors, the kind of manufacturing behemoth that Buchanan wants to keep at home. Even if G.M. had not sent jobs to Mexico, it would be employing fewer blue-collar workers in Michigan. The company is painting more and more cars with robots. Or think of Microsoft, which isn't moving to Mexico but is making millionaires out of math-class nerds. Or picture, for that matter, the Buchanan campaign, where laptop computers and voice mail can do the work of dozens of clerks, who might have drawn salaries in an earlier campaign. "Buchanan's kind of like the little Dutch boy who puts his finger in the dike," says Gary Burtless, the Brookings economist. "If he puts in this tariff, he might reduce one source of downward pressure, but I and most economists don't think it's the major source of downward pressure."
In the short run, most economists argue that the inequality of the market can't be reversed, only ameliorated. "You don't want the Government saying that I.B.M. can't lay off people," says Sheldon Danziger, co-author, with Peter Gottschalk, of "America Unequal," a study of recent income trends. "I mean, you want technological change, since you need productivity. The market economy is going to generate big winners and losers, and there's not much that government can do in the short run but cushion these losses."
Cushion them, say, by insuring that those who lose their jobs can afford to buy health insurance. Or by expanding training opportunities. Or by raising the minimum wage. "The irony here is that Clinton had such a strategy," Danziger says. "And all these things were blown out of the water by the 1994 Congressional election."
But Buchanan, like his party, is locked into a reflexive hostility to government. Unless he finds a way to repeal the Information Age, strong minds will keep widening their advantage over strong backs. Yet here is Buchanan on the stump, calling the Department of Education "a $35 billion monster" and asking, "What's it doing?" In fact, it is using more than a third of its budget to help needy students attend college -- without which they would hold no passports to the new economy.
One minute, Buchanan frets that "capitalism, totally unbridled, is the law of the jungle." But ask which is causing more problems, the market or the Government, and Buchanan lurches back to Republican orthodoxy. "It's much more the Government. The American economy is an incredible machine for producing wealth, it really is. And if you get out of the way of it enough. . . ."
If you get out of the way of it enough . . . you're back to the law of the jungle. Which may explain why Buchanan makes this the rare sentence he chooses not to complete.
Can the Democrats capitalize? Unlike Buchanan, they don't choke on such modest Government endeavors as raising the minimum wage. Certainly the Labor Secretary, Robert Reich, makes that case. "I think the President and the Democrats can talk about the wage issue with a bit more confidence and authority than they talked about it before, because the Republicans will be doing the same," he says.
Gephardt is devising a strategy to make next fall's Congressional elections a referendum on issues related to income security -- like job training, portable health care and pensions, and a minimum-wage hike. He is even drafting a campaign document that seeks to unite House Democrats behind a common economic agenda. This is how he hopes to commence his "era of income politics." But if recent politics suggest anything, it should be reticence in proclaiming new eras. Still chastened by the 1994 elections, Clinton is wary of the Gephardt strategy and of anything that exposes him to more charges of being a big-spending liberal.
Clinton will continue to talk about wage stagnation as he did in Michigan, but he will do it gingerly, and without promising too much. "We've rejected a class-based argument out of here," says a White House official involved in the campaign. "Our message is going to be less divisive and more common-ground oriented."
Which means that even if Clinton wins, he won't have a mandate to do anything. Neither the Republicans' distrust of government bureaucracy nor the Democrats' distrust of the market is inherently misguided. The early primaries, in their unlikely splendor, showed the need to get beyond the ideological paralysis. By November, the talk of "peasants with pitchforks" will be gone, but class grievances will not.

HEADLINE: Putting Fabric Together, Putting Lives Back Together

BYLINE: By BESS LIEBENSON 

 BODY:
WHILE government is talking about getting people off welfare by starting training programs, Sue Westphal is doing something about it.
Her brainchild is South End Workshop, where women learn the art of sewing patchwork to create elegant, one-of-a-kind decorative accessories and has been operating at St. Luke's Community Services in the South End section of Stamford since August. 
 It started with a love of and collection of fabrics. "The germ of my idea goes back many years," said Ms. Westphal, an interior designer who has owned and operated three decorative accessory shops. "I've been exposed to beautiful fabrics from the time I was a student at the New York School of Interior Design and visited showrooms for samples of cuttings that were discarded."
Over the past 25 years, her collection and its appeal continued to grow. But only recently, when her children were grown and she felt relieved of financial pressures, was she able to develop a training program to teach women in transition from welfare to self-sufficiency to create high-quality patchwork home accessories.
"The women who come into the program have come to St. Luke's for a hand up, not a handout," said Gail Green-Singleton, director of training and employment support services at St. Luke's Community Services, a social services agency. "Our goal is to help people become as self-sufficient as they can."
St. Luke's provides two rooms in a 100-year-old building and a modest amount of support -- $1,200 for supplies.
"Right now it's a training program," said Ms. Westphal, who majored in economics at Smith College before design school and has long enjoyed sewing as a hobby. "The goal is to turn this into a for-profit business. Employment compensation will include an hourly wage with benefits, productivity incentives, profit sharing and the possibility of stock ownership. So it's more than creating jobs. It's offering an opportunity to become entrepreneurs."
In a rainbow-colored workroom where quilts decorate walls and shelves are filled with samples and yardage, Ms. Westphal is surrounded by three trainees. A work table is laid with a cutting mat and grid, one end used for ironing. In tandem, the women design, cut, piece and quilt on several donated sewing machines including a commercial machine designed for quilting.
Sandra Jerry, 36, who started here in September, described herself as formerly homeless and a crack addict. "I've been drug- and alcohol-free for four years," she said. Now, she said, "I'm on welfare and would love to get off it."
Ms. Jerry learned to sew her own clothes when she became interested in Islam 10 years ago. "I love to sew," she said, and wants "to learn everything that Sue knows."
In the long term, "I'd like to become a part-owner and manager," she said. "I have six children and have to figure out how to support them and send at least half to college."
Gloria Cuevas, 34, who came from the Dominican Republic six years ago and also receives assistance has been a trainee since October. "I love the sewing," she said. "I like everything about it, seeing the finished product and the regular work."
The group operates 9 to 5, five days a week, with Ms. Jerry working full time and the other two women part time. "From sales we had before Christmas we were able to distribute some funds without affecting their benefits," Ms. Westphal said. "We don't want to affect their benefits until this is a viable business. We want them to experience a long-term financial gain and independence but not be at any risk."
As well as quilts, they make pillow shams, table linens, place mats, napkins, runners, table squares, potholders and tea cozies. They have sold to Hoagland's in Greenwich and the Lion's Paw in Nantucket. They do custom work for clients with their own fabrics. And they display goods in space donated by Elizabeth Day Lawrence above her store on North Street in Banksville. In the space they have created sleeping and dining scenes to showcase their patchwork as well as refinished furniture.
Ms. Westphal, who studied decorative paint finishes at the Isabel O'Neil Studio in New York, said, "We're taking fabrics and recycling them and want to do the same for furniture, to do everything connected with the home -- apply paint finishes on walls and floors, and sew clothing and art pieces.
"The idea is to be a distinctive, creative task force with a reputation for creativity, style and quality workmanship. People can go on to do upholstery, slip covers and shades. There are unlimited possibilities."
Ms. Westphal said there is a new paradigm "which sees business as a force for social change and the welfare of those who work for the company as a priority along with a traditional bottom line."
