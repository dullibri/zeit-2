HEADLINE: A Dip to Close Out the Second Quarter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks ended a turbulent second quarter with a moderate decline yesterday as money managers, doing some last-minute adjustments, locked in gains from Thursday's big rally.
 Analysts attributed the sell-off to end-of-quarter ''window dressing'' by managers preparing quarterly reports and the annual reconstitution of the Russell 3000 index, with some stocks being added to the index while others were dropped.
''This was nothing attributed to market conditions,'' said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 40.58 points, or 0.36 percent, at 11,150.22. On Thursday, the Dow surged 217.24, its biggest single-day jump since March 21, 2003.
 Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.67 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,270.20, after Thursday's gain of 26.87. 
 The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.29 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,172.09 after rising 62.54 on Thursday, its largest point gain since July 27, 2002.
 Markets rallied Thursday after the Federal Reserve raised rates by a quarter-point and seemingly moderated its interest rate policy statement. But the Fed has still promised to keep a close eye on economic data.
 The day's economic data was, on balance, positive for stocks. The government said inflation, as measured by a price gauge tied to consumer spending, rose by 0.4 percent in May and was up 0.2 percent when energy and food prices were excluded. This measure of core inflation is up 2.1 percent compared with May 2005; that is slightly above the Fed's upper bounds for core inflation of 2 percent.
 The University of Michigan's June consumer sentiment reading was better than expected, but the government reported that consumer spending slowed sharply in May as rising gasoline prices left Americans with less to spend on other items. The Commerce Department said spending rose by just 0.4 percent last month after a 0.7 percent gain in April. Income growth also slowed to an advance of just 0.4 percent last month, reflecting weaker job growth.
 Bonds rose, with the 10-year Treasury up 14/32, at 99 29/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.14 percent, from 5.19 percent Thursday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies. Gold prices were higher.
 Crude oil futures rose. A barrel of light crude settled at $73.93, up 41 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Yesterday was the end of a difficult quarter for stocks. On May 10, the Dow Jones industrial index was just 75 points below the record close of 11,722.98 set in January 2000, but Wall Street abruptly reversed direction the next day, beginning weeks of losses as investors grew more anxious about the direction of interest rates. It was not until this week that stocks regained their footing.
 The Dow ended the quarter up 40.90 points, or 0.37 percent; the S.& P. lost 24.63 points, or 1.90 percent; and the Nasdaq lost 167.70 points, or 7.17 percent.
 For the month of June, the Dow gained 299.31, or 2.38 percent; the S.& P. eked out a gain of 0.11 point, or 0.01 percent; and the Nasdaq lost 6.79 points, or 0.31 percent.
 The Dow remains up 432.72 points, or 4.04 percent, for the year to date; the S.& P. is up 21.91, or 1.76 percent; and the Nasdaq is down 33.23, or 1.51 percent.
 In company news, General Motors rose $2.35, or 8.6 percent, to $29.79 after Renault and Nissan Motor said they were interested in purchasing a significant stake in G.M., according to a letter sent by a major holder, Tracinda, the investment company run by the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian. General Motors said it had not received an offer.
 Apple Computer fell $1.70, or 2.9 percent, to $57.27, after the company said late Thursday that an internal investigation discovered irregularities related to the issuance of certain stock option grants made from 1997 to 2001, including one, later canceled, to the chief executive, Steven P. Jobs.
 MasterCard closed unchanged at $48 after falling in earlier trading when the European Commission charged the company with fixing the fees retailers must pay for accepting MasterCard and Maestro branded cards, saying this limits competition between banks that use the service.
 The travel and real estate conglomerate Cendant rose 52 cents, to $16.29, after the company said it was selling its travel services unit, which includes Orbitz.com, to an affiliate of the private equity firm Blackstone Group for $4.3 billion in cash.

HEADLINE: I Got Millions For Writing This Article

BYLINE: By M. P. Dunleavey

 BODY:
I CAN'T decide if this is a new trend, or an old one that has become a lot more irritating. Call it price dropping: the annoying habit some people have of oh-so-casually letting you know how much they paid for that Weber grill, new digital camera, their Marc Jacobs shoes or the swish hotel they stayed at on Mikonos.
 These aren't the bargain hunters who can't wait to tell you the steal they found at a certain sample sale, or what they bought for a song on eBay. Nor are these the people who might sport a Patek Philippe or set their table with Frette, and let you draw your own conclusions. 
No, I'm talking about people who are so price-proud they're willing to elbow past social convention to tell you what they paid for things, even when you'd much prefer they didn't. In fact, you didn't even ask.
 Colleen Mastro, who works in film production in New York, said she once worked for a compulsive price dropper. Her boss would flaunt the cost of anything from suits to shoes to restaurant bills. ''And it wasn't just because I was an employee,'' Ms. Mastro said. ''I'd hear him dropping numbers into all his phone conversations.''
 There's nothing new about ostentatious behavior, of course; ''conspicuous consumption'' existed for eons before the economist Thorstein Veblen coined the term about 100 years ago. But a once-formidable taboo against talking about money, and specifically the price of things, seems to be eroding in America -- at least in certain circles.
 When I spoke to Joan Caraganis Jakobson, a woman familiar with high society and author of ''And One More Thing a Mother's Advice on Life, Love and Lipstick'' (WarnerBooks, 2005), she felt that those accustomed to wealth were more likely to rely on certain codes than to discuss actual prices. ''You would never say what you paid for a car''; people tend to know how much a Jaguar set you back.
 Alas, in other circles some people seem comfortable shrugging off these distinctions -- perhaps because we live in an era in which bling is king and the price tags of the lifestyles of the rich and famous are frequent TV fodder. 
 Erik Kolbell, a psychotherapist and author of ''Lifescripts for Family and Friends: What to Say in 101 of Life's Most Troubling and Uncomfortable Conversations'' (Pocketbooks, 2002), points to this trickle-down effect of affluence as one reason price-dropping behavior may be more common. Price droppers ''are becoming more brazen in their behavior,'' he said. ''The need they feel to let you know what something costs is more urgent'' because it's a way of broadcasting how well you're doing, at least financially.
 Sometimes a frank exchange about price has its place, especially when the information can help someone make a better choice or find a better deal -- whether on insurance rates, baby-sitting fees or furniture.
 But price droppers, like name droppers, aren't interested in offering financial insight. ''They're pulling rank,'' said Shekaiba Bennett, a photographer in New Canaan, Conn., who has a friend who manages to weave the price and pedigree of whatever she's wearing into a conversation -- sometimes even with people she doesn't know.
 Mrs. Bennett attributes this woman's behavior to a deep-seated insecurity about her appearance, whereas Mr. Kolbell feels that in many cases price dropping is about hubris. What the person bought ''is an extension of their ego, and the price is a measuring rod for that,'' he said.
 PRICE droppers are frustrating because so often the hapless listener has no idea how to parry the unwanted financial poke.
 ''It's embarrassing,'' said Olivia Mellan, a psychologist and the author of several books and a new audio CD set, ''The Secret Language of Money'' (MoneyHarmony, 2006). ''There's a subtext, but you don't know what it is.''
 Some price droppers aren't trying to be competitive; they may simply lack the appropriate social filter, Ms. Mellan said. Others may have developed the habit because they fear being judged. ''Let's say that person was a spender, but had a parent who was a hoarder. They may be looking for some approval that they didn't get. They want someone to say, 'It's O.K., you deserve it.' ''
 Is there a comfortable way to cope with this? 
 ''The kindest thing you can do is to validate the person,'' perhaps by offering a compliment, Ms. Mellan suggested.
 And when you can't say something nice, as your mother might have told you, the next best thing would be ''breathing deeply, looking pleasant and not saying a damn thing,'' Ms. Mellan added.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Slowed Slightly in May

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30 

 BODY:
Consumer spending slowed in May as rising gasoline prices left Americans with less cash for other items, the government reported Friday.
 The Commerce Department said that spending rose by 0.4 percent last month after a 0.7 percent gain in April. Income growth also slowed to an advance of 0.4 percent last month, reflecting weaker job growth. 
The report on personal incomes and consumer spending provided further evidence that the economy slowed in the spring as Americans dealt with rising gasoline prices, higher interest rates and a cooling housing market.
 In a second report, the University of Michigan said that its index of consumer sentiment rebounded a bit in June, rising to 84.9. While that was up from 79.1 in May, it was still well below the reading of 96 in June 2005.
 The government reported Thursday that the overall economy grew at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the January-March quarter, the fastest pace in two and a half years. Analysts say growth has slowed to just half that amount in the April-June quarter, reflecting a slowdown in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.
 Inflation, as measured by a price gauge tied to consumer spending, rose by 0.4 percent in May and was up 0.2 percent when energy and food prices are excluded. This measure of core inflation is up 2.1 percent when compared with May 2005, slightly above the Fed's upper bounds for core inflation of 2 percent.
 Many analysts said the inflation figure in Friday's spending report increased the odds that the Fed would increase rates at least one more time at the next meeting, on Aug. 8.
 ''We are not going back to the bad old days with regard to inflation, but it has crept up and the Fed needs to keep a lid on inflation expectations,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a private forecasting firm.
 The 0.4 percent increase in consumer spending in May -- in line with Wall Street expectations -- was the slowest increase in three months. Excluding price increases, spending was up an even weaker 0.1 percent in May, down from a 0.2 percent rise in inflation-adjusted spending in April.
 Americans' personal savings rate, the amount of money left from disposable income, dipped further to a negative 1.7 percent in May, from a negative 1.6 percent in April. The savings rate has been negative for 12 consecutive months, meaning that Americans are dipping into savings or borrowing more to finance a spending level that is exceeding their after-tax incomes.

HEADLINE: Life, Liberty And Open Lanes 

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
You may not be enjoying the roads this weekend, but in Washington we see cause to celebrate. You're not just sitting in a traffic jam. You're part of a national birthday party!
 Two score and ten years ago, our forefathers brought forth across this continent the Interstate highway system, which you could call America's pyramids except that the pyramids were so puny. Cheops was a piker next to Dwight Eisenhower, the creator of what is reverently known in Congress as the greatest public works project in history.
Eisenhower's granddaughter and great-grandson came to town this week to fete those 46,000 miles of pavement and to listen to speeches by master builders like Don Young, the Alaska congressman who rules the committee that rules the roads. He didn't mention his most famous achievement in the latest highway bill -- the ''bridge to nowhere'' serving a couple of his constituents -- but he did brag about the $286 billion cost of the bill. 
 ''I'll guarantee you next time I'm asking for 600 billion,'' he said, to ecstatic applause from the bureaucrats and highway contractors in the audience. And there, in that one moment of pure pork-barrel bliss, you could see where Eisenhower went wrong -- and why you're stuck in traffic today.
 The great debate in planning the system was, of course, how to pay for it. Roads had traditionally been a state responsibility, but the feds became more active during the New Deal, when a national system of freeways was drawn up. The planners meticulously calculated that a system of old-fashioned toll roads would never pay for itself because there'd be too little traffic. 
 A toll road across Pennsylvania, the planners informed Congress in 1939, would attract only 715 cars per day. The next year the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened. It was soon carrying 6,000 cars a day and more than paying for itself, but the federal bias against tolls persisted anyway.
 There were good political reasons for Eisenhower to insist that new Interstates be financed by federal gas taxes instead of tolls: drivers have always resented stopping at toll booths, and members of Congress have always enjoyed doling out money. To further win over critics worried about this new federal role, the program was justified on national security grounds (sound familiar?) and named the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. 
 Drivers loved the freeways at first, but then the roads deteriorated and the lanes clogged. Engineers wanted to ease congestion by adding lanes, but they couldn't even afford to maintain the existing roads. The gas tax revenue shrank because of inflation and because Congress began earmarking it for thousands of pet projects: parks, promenades, museums, streetcars and bridges to nowhere.
 Some road enthusiasts -- and their lobbyists -- have never stopped dreaming of new federal money, which explains the applause for Young. But more pragmatic engineers know that Young will never get his $600 billion, and that much of it would be wasted anyhow. They also realize that there's no way to prevent traffic jams unless you charge drivers -- like airplane passengers -- a premium at busy times.
 The best way to help drivers is to abandon the Interstate model and adopt two reforms. One is for states to keep the taxes paid by their drivers instead of sending the money to Washington -- an idea that has been endorsed by the conservative caucus in the House as a cure for their colleagues' earmarking mania.
 The other is to end the taboo against tolls. The highway of the future is the Pennsylvania Turnpike, only with electronic toll collectors instead of booths. By relying on drivers instead of Congress for money, road builders in congested places like Southern California and Houston have finally been adding lanes. By raising the tolls at peak times, they're making sure that traffic keeps moving even at rush hour.
 These changes are still tough to make politically because voters have gotten so used to the old toll-free Interstates. But once they see the cars speeding along in new lanes, their nostalgia tends to fade. 
 The Interstate system was lovely in its youth, and on its birthday I suppose we should fondly recall those days when the concrete was new and the lanes were clear and the price seemed right. But there is no such thing as a freeway. After 50 years, it's time to pay the toll.

HEADLINE: Back to the Garden, Minus the Mud

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN; Additional reporting for this article was contributed by Lisa W. Foderaro in White Plains.

DATELINE: BETHEL, N.Y., June 25 

 BODY:
This is hallowed ceremonial ground, a 37 1/2-acre sloping field that held the convulsive euphoria of a generation in its muddy embrace. Today just a Frisbee toss from the ''freakout tent'' that nursed hippies during the 1969 Woodstock music festival, the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts rises, a copper-sheathed concert pavilion that would have been a hallucinatory vision to the folks in sodden sleeping bags on Max Yasgur's farm.
 Bethel Woods makes its debut on Saturday night, not with Country Joe McDonald but with the New York Philharmonic with Audra McDonald and Lang Lang, symbols of the center's aspirations, and this town's, to become an international cultural destination.
 The center is just the warm-up act, the first of about 25 structures planned for 1,700 acres across the former Yasgur property and an adjoining farm. It is an ambitious $70 million roll of the dice, the consuming passion of 76-year-old Alan Gerry, an entrepreneur whose family foundation is subsidizing most of the cost. Mr. Gerry is known for another bold Catskills venture: As a high school dropout and ex-marine, he transformed a television repair store in Liberty, N.Y., into Cablevision Industries and then sold it to Time Warner Inc. in 1995 for $2.8 billion. 
 Next year a museum about Woodstock and the 1960's is to open, designed by an architect who speaks about a ''Woodstock viewshed'' and conceptualized by a team that includes the founding director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. It will include artifacts and oral histories from festival performers and participants like Wavy Gravy, and offer walking tours of the ''bowl,'' where the original stage stood. The complex will join a handful of new regional arts centers in New York that include Frank Gehry's Richard B. Fisher Center at Bard College and Dia: Beacon, both in Dutchess County. 
 What Cooperstown is to baseball, Bethel could be to the baby boom. Mr. Gerry, who dresses in the style of Johnny Cash, is gambling that the center will transform Sullivan County -- suffering from decades of economic decline -- into a land of B&B's and the 1,000-thread-count sheet. This summer's concert program features the Boston Pops, Wynton Marsalis, the Goo Goo Dolls, Counting Crows and, yes, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
 ''We're starting from scratch again,'' said Sam Yasgur, a Sullivan County lawyer whose father, Max, died in 1973 but still occupies an exalted place in counterculture history. ''For the county to become a destination like the Berkshires is going to require a major mentality shift.'' 
 The complex has also received $15 million in state funds, mostly for infrastructure. Anticipating growth, Bethel, which for years tried to forget the festival, has given $2.6 million for a new sewer system along Route 17B, the byway famously clogged with hippies in 1969.
 ''It's the 21st-century equivalent of protecting the battlefields of the Civil War,'' Dennis Barrie, a consultant and founding director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said of the site, which has had a contentious post-Woodstock history and which purists hoped would remain completely undeveloped. 
 Mr. Gerry is an unlikely savior. He forbade his eldest daughter, Annalise, to go to Woodstock, but she went anyway, and ''disappeared for five days,'' he said. He was persuaded to buy the property by another daughter, Robyn, now 48, who missed out on the festival. A behind-the-scenes player, Mr. Gerry had a fortune tied to the county's mountainous terrain, about 100 miles north of Manhattan, where television reception was poor. Many in these parts still remember him as their television repairman. He now runs Granite Associates, which manages the family's assets. (The center is not a business investment, he said.) 
 During the last decade Mr. Gerry quietly amassed property surrounding the Woodstock site, including a neighboring farm where the sleek concert pavilion is now. His architect, Paul E. Westlake Jr., is Mr. Gerry's third, after he dismissed Richard Meier, designer of the Getty Center in Los Angeles, for a concept that ''looked like a flying saucer,'' Mr. Gerry said. The interior of the Woodstock museum integrates local stone and wood beams in an attempt to recall the ad hoc, lashed-timber-and-canvas structures on the original concert site. 
 Mr. Gerry is taking a resolute, build-it-and-they-will-come stance. The son of Russian immigrants named Gorowitz, he still lives in the hamlet of Ferndale and has doled out beautification grants to nearby towns for roadside flower baskets and what seems like the country's largest concentration of gazebos. 
 ''Families used to come from somewhere, and that's where they stayed,'' he said. ''I can't imagine finding success and then moving to a building in Manhattan with 300 strangers, like a bunch of little ants going home at night. Not that I don't love New York,'' he added.
 Sullivan County is a patchwork of shuttered diners, faded billboards and dilapidated summer bungalow colonies that commune with New Age retreats and organic farms.
 For years the economy revolved around what are now mostly defunct Jewish resorts like Grossinger's that nurtured comedians like Alan King and Milton Berle. ''We sat shiva for these hotels for 25 years,'' said John Conway, the county historian, referring to the traditional Jewish period of mourning. ''It kept us from getting on with our lives.'' 
 In recent years a stream of Manhattanites seeking reasonable prices and a low-key vibe have snapped up weekend homes. The moneyed Orvis crowd casts bamboo fly rods into the fabled trout pools of the Beaver Kill.
 The new Bethel Woods center is inspiring a mini-gold-rush. Judith Maidenbaum, a Manhattan psychoanalyst and a cafe owner in Kauneonga Lake in Sullivan County, recently paid $100,000 for a handsome Colonial-era house she intends to turn into a B&B, anticipating that the area might finally take off. ''No one knew Woodstock was going to be Woodstock,'' she said. 
 But the Woodstock ethos remains deeply ingrained. Barbara Hahn, now 70, whose living room is a riot of Hummel figurines, sat with her Shih Tzu, Mickey, on her lap, and recalled being a nurse in the ''bad-trip tent.'' With a grandmotherly demeanor, she recalled as if it were just yesterday how she lifted off from Grossinger's airstrip in an Army helicopter, bearing thousands of tetracycline tablets.
 ''My first patient dove into shallow water and split his head open,'' she recalled. ''I asked, 'Are you still tripping?,' and he said, 'The trip is over.' '' 
 The festival site has become a Graceland-style pilgrimage stop, its reverential gathering spot the 5 1/2-ton monument erected by a local welder. Duke Devlin, the site's gray-bearded unofficial greeter, who came to the festival and never left the region, waggishly refers to the marker as ''the Tomb of the Unknown Hippie.'' 
 Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Tulane University, said the site would only grow in historical significance. ''It was where a generational wave gathered and broke,'' he said. ''It is the one spot a hundred years from now that will be identified with the 60's.'' 
 When Mr. Gerry's foundation bought the site in 1996, a small fraternity of preservationists rallied to protect it. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it was ''nationally significant'' and asked that permanent construction not be placed within the naturalamphitheater where the original concert was held. 
 In deference to history, the museum will look out over the sacred slope. Mr. Barrie and the exhibition team are on the prowl for coveted artifacts, like the yellow legal pads on which the co-producer Michael Lang scribbled the original site layouts.
 Some purists argue that the complex should have been completely concealed. ''The big preservation issue is, 'What is the true site of Woodstock?' '' said Michael William Doyle, an associate professor of history at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., who consulted with one preservation group. ''Is it the staging area or the place where 400,000 to 500,000 troops massed all the way to the thruway?'' 
 The end result is ''bittersweet,'' he said. 
 ''The site has been kept true to its original purpose,'' he said, although it no longer replicates the exact visual experience of 1969. That would be impossible: the Woodstock festival became free when gate-crashers famously dismantled the chain-link fences; Mr. Gerry has miles of elegant split rail. 
 Indeed, the litany of rules for Saturday's opening -- no hibachis or coolers, no lawn chairs at pop-music concerts, only one ''factory-sealed'' plastic bottle of water per person -- has sparked amused contempt among the aging flower children who still populate these hills, their drug of choice now Advil.
 ''It's the antithesis of the original spirit,'' said Jeryl Abramson, who with her husband, Roy Howard, has hosted an alternative Woodstock gathering since 1996. ''Six-dollar water and no lawn chairs for the geriatrics!'' 
 Blue, 55, whose real name is Robin S. Hallock and who was featured in a 1969 Life magazine article wearing love beads and what she called ''three days of mascara,'' said, ''Woodstock was beautiful, pure, sacred and natural.'' Now, she added: ''I picture limousines on one side and us old hippies on the other. It doesn't sound like much fun.'' 
 But Country Joe McDonald, who lives in Berkeley, Calif., and whose ''I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag'' was an antiwar anthem, said he thought it was ''wonderful'' that the site would again be used for outdoor music. 
 ''I got no dog with the guy who bought it, even if he is a capitalist pig,'' he said. ''It's not a sacred piece of land to me; the event is sacred. Woodstock happened. It will live on.''

HEADLINE: In Several Cities, a Push for Dailies Free of Absentee Corporate Owners 

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 30 

 BODY:
If the real estate billionaire Eli Broad had his way, The Los Angeles Times would run more photographs of donors at charity events. There would be fewer stories on movies and more about the city's museums and classical arts. And it would champion civic projects, becoming, in his view, the glue to unite a diverse and fractured city.
 Newspapers are the soul of a community and they should be locally owned, Mr. Broad said one recent afternoon on the 12th floor of an office tower here overlooking acres of million-dollar homes. And that is why he would like to see The Los Angeles Times, now owned by the Chicago-based Tribune Company, acquired by a group of local organizations, including his own $2 billion foundation.
 "A newspaper can provide a power base," he said. "If a publisher wants to get things done, they can get 30 of the most important people in the room. It's even more important in Los Angeles because of the diverse geography. I would see owning the paper as a way to get people more engaged from all parts of the city." 
 Mr. Broad, 73, is not the only one who sees the benefit of local ownership of newspapers. Increasingly, businesspeople and civic leaders are showing interest in owning their local papers again.
 In Philadelphia, a group led by a local public relations and advertising executive, Brian P. Tierney, recently bought The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News, two papers that went on the auction block after disgruntled investors forced Knight Ridder to sell. More recently, The Times Leader in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., was sold to local investors. 
 And beyond Mr. Broad, other potential local buyers are buzzing about The Los Angeles Times. The Tribune Company has come under pressure to break itself up by the Chandler family, the second-biggest investor in The Los Angeles Times and the paper's former owner. 
 In some ways, it is a return to the past, before local newspapers were rolled up into national chains. Local moguls seem less put off than other investors by the uncertainty of the newspaper business, which has experienced a migration of readers and advertisers to the Internet. 
 Potential local buyers also like some of the less-tangible benefits of owning a paper. Local newspapers remain trophies that confer power, prestige and influence on their owners. And some business leaders profess more idealistic goals: to make their community a better place, using the power that comes with owning a powerful institution.
 Of course, there can be a downside to local ownership, because buyers may not know much about journalism. And they may also have personal or business agendas that could surface in the newspaper and damage its credibility.
 ''Anyone who is buying a newspaper these days is rich,'' said Gary B. Pruitt, chief executive of the McClatchy Company, which acquired most of the Knight Ridder papers. That means they probably made their money in businesses already being written about -- and that would continue to be covered -- in the paper. 
 ''You have to be careful if you see it as a way to affect news coverage or affect the coverage of your friends,'' he said.
 Some civic leaders say returning the hometown newspaper to local ownership is a way to preserve a city's identity. Robert C. Embry Jr., president of the Abell Foundation in Baltimore, every year tries to get the Tribune Company to sell him The Baltimore Sun, which has had two long-distance owners in the last 10 years. 
 The foundation Mr. Embry runs was created by the families that once owned The Baltimore Sun. 
 Every year the answer is, No, thank you. Still, Mr. Embry persists. ''People come in, stay a bit, leave, and that is fine,'' he said. ''But they deal with things out of context. They have no loyalty to the community. I do think it's important that the people running a newspaper understand the history.'' 
 Jeff Reiter, a spokesman for Tribune Company, took issue with the notion that his company is a detached overlord ruling from afar. ''Yes, they may be owned by a large media company,'' he said of The Sun and The Times, ''but they do have autonomy.'' Neither paper, he added, was for sale.
 In Los Angeles, Mr. Broad sees local ownership as a way to unite a community that is not cohesive. Los Angeles is a sprawl of eclectic neighborhoods and wealthy gated communities, divided by strip malls, palm trees and traffic-clogged freeways. Many of the city's most prominent businesses have moved away. And as was aptly depicted in the Academy Award-winning film ''Crash,'' the city's social enclaves are so disconnected that the only way to connect may be to crash into one another. 
 Mr. Broad said he did not want to buy The Los Angeles Times by himself and was not interested in being a publisher. 
 ''As a business proposition, it doesn't make sense,'' he said. 
 Instead, he is interested in an ownership arrangement like one at The St. Petersburg Times in Florida, which is owned by the nonprofit Poynter Institute. Mr. Embry suggested the same strategy for any acquisition of The Baltimore Sun.
 In Mr. Broad's outlook, several local charitable foundations and trusts would pool their assets to buy The Times. They could include not only his own foundation, but perhaps also the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California or the Ahmanson Foundation. (Mr. Broad does not have other business interests, the foundation's spokeswoman said.) 
 He said he had not approached the other foundations yet, because it was unlikely there would be any discussion of a sale -- if at all -- for several months. 
 Others who have expressed interest in The Los Angeles Times have little in common; they are as diverse as the city itself.
 Peter V. Ueberroth, the former Olympics organizer, is said to be interested, but it is unclear if he is wealthy enough to finance a deal, people who know him said. (He did not return calls seeking comment.) But Mr. Ueberroth is well connected in Los Angeles and is one of the few leaders who might be able to pull together a group from various constituencies. 
 Ronald W. Burkle, another potential candidate, earned billions of dollars owning grocery stores but became better known recently for the headlines he made when he accused a New York Post gossip columnist of trying to extort money from him in a videotaped sting operation.
 Mr. Burkle, who attended the June 24 premiere of the Walt Disney Company movie ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,'' said then that he was interested in buying The Times. When asked if he had discussed a possible sale with other potential investors, he said he had discussed the idea with Mr. Broad that afternoon. 
 Another name to surface is David L. Geffen, the music impresario and a co-founder of DreamWorks SKG, who in the past told Tribune executives he was interested. Mr. Geffen did not return calls seeking comment, but colleagues say he remains interested. 
 Both Mr. Broad and Mr. Burkle said they had not talked with Mr. Geffen. ''We are very different people,'' Mr. Broad said of Mr. Geffen. 
 In Philadelphia, Mr. Tierney, who led an alliance of local investors to buy The Inquirer and Daily News for $562 million, said he believed that having a diverse group of investors softened criticism of his group's acquisition.
 ''I didn't just pick white Republican men like me,'' Mr. Tierney said. His investors are self-made executives in insurance, auto sales and media, among other industries, who subscribe to different political philosophies.
 ''If David Geffen or any other investor in Los Angeles just picks a bunch of his friends, they might not be taken as seriously,'' he added. ''People are out there, but they are harder to find.''
 When Mr. Tierney first talked to analysts and bankers about buying the Philadelphia newspapers, few took him seriously, he recalled. ''Locals have never been able to buy a newspaper and pull it off,'' he said he had been told. ''You can't put up the equity. You can't find unanimity in a group. When it gets down to the details, people split apart.'' 
 Some thought the local buyers were interested because of their vanity. ''This is not a charity,'' countered Mr. Tierney. ''This is a business and we expect it to make a fair return.'' 
 For the time being, all eyes will be on Philadelphia to see whether private owners and the public good can peaceably coexist. 
 ''There is going to be a time, a year from now, maybe two, when you are going to be upset and you're going to call me,'' Mr. Tierney said he told his investors. ''It's going to be hard if your friends call you up and say, 'I got arrested for drunk driving and I don't want to see it in the paper.' ''
 That is why each of the investors signed a pledge to stay out of newsroom business, he said. And if they do not, it is unlikely that reporters at the papers will keep quiet for long.
 ''Everyone in this group agrees that the way to kill the economic value is to tarnish the independence of the institution,'' Mr. Tierney said. ''Word would get out quickly if something happened that they didn't like. I know that would happen here.''

HEADLINE: At the Trade Talks, Threats to Book Flights Home 

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; Tom Wright contributed reporting for this article.; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 30 

 BODY:
Friday's session of global trade talks here began with government ministers like Kamal Nath of India preparing to abandon efforts to produce by Monday the outlines of an agreement aimed at improving economic growth and alleviating poverty.
 ''I am asking the United States and Europe, 'Please tell me how much you are willing to do,' '' said Mr. Nath, the Indian minister of commerce and industry, between talks at the World Trade Organization where groups of up to 70 ministers are meeting.
 ''I don't seem to get an answer,'' said Mr. Nath, who added Friday that he could take a flight home as soon as Saturday. 
 ''I am trying to get a seat tomorrow,'' he said.
 Illustrating the difficulty of reaching a global trade accord, European Union members were still unable to agree among themselves on a common position, with France challenging the chief European negotiator, Peter Mandelson, and claiming support from Germany.
 ''The French are the French,'' Mr. Mandelson said Friday morning.
 European officials said Friday that it was now up to the United States to alter its offer. But they expressed pessimism about the chances of American delegates making a significant overture because of the Congressional races in the fall.
 On Friday, the United States -- which has been criticized by countries like Brazil for its reluctance to sweeten an offer on cutting government subsidies to American farmers -- gave few signs of being ready to budge first.
 ''We've had a bold agriculture proposal on market access and domestic farm support out there since October, and it's been nine months and we're still waiting for similar proposals from key trading partners,'' said Neena Moorjani, the spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, Susan Schwab.
 Ms. Moorjani pledged that Ms. Schwab and other American officials would negotiate throughout the weekend and into next week. ''We're here until the end of these meetings, for the long haul,'' Ms. Moorjani said, adding that the United States would move only when ''we see bold movement from our trading partners.''
 Pascal Lamy, the director general of the trade organization, who is leading talks among the 149 member states, used unsettling language, saying the entire trading system was at risk if countries failed to put hard numbers on the table.
 ''We are well into the red part of the red zone for finishing the round,'' Mr. Lamy said, referring to talks that began in 2001 in Doha, Qatar, to alleviate poverty and bolster global growth.
 Mr. Lamy also scolded delegates for their ''apparent inability to negotiate in any real sense.''
 The dispute between France and Mr. Mandelson, which flared Thursday, was an early sign that last-ditch efforts to reach an outline agreement to cut tariffs and subsidies across the world were becoming stuck.
 The squabbling also provided further evidence of a bitter battle at the heart of Europe: whether to reduce traditional protections for industries like farming and textiles, which are struggling to compete with countries with low-cost labor, or to instead seek advantages for more competitive sectors in manufacturing and services.
 After meeting in Geneva with trade ministers from 25 member states, Mr. Mandelson said the European Union was prepared to ''significantly improve'' offers on tariff reductions on farm products to levels that would be close to what big developing countries like Brazil are demanding -- in the range of 50 percent.
 ''There is no room to maneuver in that direction,'' the French trade minister, Christine Lagarde, said minutes later during another news conference. Instead, France was holding fast to a previous proposal to cut tariffs by no more than about 38 percent. Further cuts were ''a path we are not prepared to take,'' she said.
 The French agriculture minister, Dominique Bussereau, said that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, supported the French position, showing that ''France is not alone.''
 On Monday, Ms. Merkel asked for ''massive improvement'' from the European negotiating partners on industrial tariffs. But it was not possible Friday to confirm whether her position was that the European Union had no further room to cut its own farm tariffs.
 By itself, France does not have the power during the negotiations to stop Mr. Mandelson from seeking whatever agreement he thinks is best for Europe. But he will need to avoid alienating big agricultural producers like France and Ireland because, European officials said, a final deal would probably require a unanimous vote among the union's members.
 Failure to make progress by Monday could mean that a deal to ease global trade flows could be delayed until the end of the decade.
 Time is tight because of coming elections in countries like Brazil and France make it more difficult for politicians to make sacrifices in trade negotiations. Midterm elections in the United States in the fall, and the expiration next summer of President Bush's special authority to negotiate a deal, are also crucial factors.
 Soon, trade experts say, countries will cease bargaining with the United States because Congress will be able to pick apart any deal.
 ''If we don't credibly advance our negotiations in the next few days, then I see no basis to come back in a few weeks,'' Mark Vaile, the Australian trade minister, warned delegates.

HEADLINE: Holiday Inn Sees Replay Of the 50's In China

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
Much has been said about the growing number of Chinese tourists traveling outside the country, but there's a huge increase in travel to and within China as well. And where will all these tourists stay? 
 They might be bunking in a Holiday Inn if Andrew Cosslett, chief executive of the InterContinental Hotels Group, has his way. The former Cadbury Schwepps executive once sold candy in the Asia Pacific region, but now he's got aggressive expansion plans for the familiar name in China, as well as for InterContinental's higher-end hotels like the Crowne Plaza. He discussed those plans during a recent interview. Following are excerpts: 


Q. How big are the opportunities in China for Western hotels?

A. In the next 10 years, China will become the largest in-bound travel destination in the world. There will be 180 million trips in China, and tourism will be huge. People will be coming from Europe and America, and will want to stay in brands they know. Meanwhile, the Chinese are registering 4,000 cars a day. As people start to get cars and drive, the potential is significant.

Q. What's the appeal of a Western hotel chain, particularly the Holiday Inn franchise, in China?

A. We built our first Holiday Inn in Beijing in 1984 -- and most people in China think it is a Chinese name, not one that started in the United States. So far, only 10 percent of the ''away from home'' market in China is branded. The rest are guest houses and independent lodging, and guest preferences are swinging away from those. Guests prefer a known quantity.

Q. How do you find the right locations and properties?

A. The government assigns subleases to companies, people and local governments. The challenge is to make sure you partner with the right people. Because we've been there the longest, we're getting excellent representation. Now everyone else is fighting to get into the market, but the Chinese value longevity. A lot of people say they're hugely focused on China, but they don't have an office there.

Q. Intercontinental has said the growth of Holiday Inn in China is similar to the chain's birth in the United States. How so?

A. Kemmons Wilson started Holiday Inn in 1952 after taking his family on a trip and finding nowhere suitable to stay. Within five years, there were 1,000 Holiday Inns, because starting the business had coincided with the expansion of the United States freeway network under Eisenhower. Now we're seeing the same thing in China. The government is driving economic growth westward, and building 85,000 kilometers of freeway, and opening 47 airports.

Q. So Holiday Inn is just following along behind the road work crews and opening hotels?

A. It's not as systematic as that. We're developing contacts and networks in the hinterlands. The capital of Szechuan Province, Chengdu, for example, is one of the biggest cities in the world that no one knows about. We're building a network of contacts there.

Q. How do you do that, exactly?

A. Meeting with developers, people who have contacts with real estate owners. If you're a company that's good and does what it says it will, people will seek you out. Thanks to our representatives, we see the majority of property deals that are done in China.

Q. What's the big difference between a Holiday Inn in the United States and in China?

A. If you walk into a Holiday Inn in Shanghai, you'll see the same sign, the same furniture as the United States. Because the ones in Shanghai are newer, the property standard might be a bit higher. Also, owners in China want to push the perceived quality a little higher. Nothing in the Holiday Inn guidelines says there should be marble in the bathrooms, but that's what they do. They add gilt, and fountains in the lobby. As things go on, we'll see more consistency.

Q. What's your advice to a Western company just trying to get established in China?

A. Don't use the number 4. More seriously, you should have come 10 years ago. Tread carefully and wisely. Really understand the importance of relationships. Have patience.

HEADLINE: Professor at Columbia Nominated to the Fed

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30 

 BODY:
President Bush on Friday nominated Frederic S. Mishkin, a professor of monetary policy at Columbia, to fill an open seat on the Federal Reserve Board.
 Professor Mishkin, 55, has been a prolific author of books and articles about central banking and would add weight within the Fed to backers of ''inflation targeting,'' a policy of basing decisions on explicit and publicly disclosed benchmarks for inflation. 
 On that issue, Professor Mishkin would be a close ally of Ben S. Bernanke, the new Fed chairman. Mr. Bernanke has been a champion of inflation targeting, an approach that his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, viewed as too rigid and that some Fed governors continue to oppose.
 Professor Mishkin and Mr. Bernanke collaborated on a book and several articles about the issue, arguing that the strategy would make the Federal Reserve's decision-making more open and predictable. 
 Professor Mishkin, who also served as executive vice president and research director at the New York Fed in the mid-1990's, would be joining a board that consists primarily of people nominated by Mr. Bush.
 But while several of Mr. Bush's recent nominees to the Fed worked in his White House, most have been better known for their views on monetary policy than on politics. 
 Professor Mishkin is believed to be a political independent, and has had almost no involvement with Republican politics. Donald L. Kohn, whom Mr. Bush recently named as vice chairman of the Fed, is a political independent who was a senior staff official at the Fed before being named a Fed governor in 2002.
 Mr. Bernanke, a longtime professor of economics at Princeton, joined the Fed as a governor in 2002, then moved to the White House Council of Economic Advisers and then succeeded Mr. Greenspan as Fed chairman last Feb. 1.
 Mr. Bernanke is a Republican. But like Professor Mishkin, he spent most of his career in academia and wrote almost nothing about political issues then, instead writing frequently about issues like central bank communications and the origins of the Great Depression.
 Two other additions to the Fed board are Randall S. Kroszner, a former professor at the University of Chicago who served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2001 to 2003; and Kevin M. Warsh, a former investment banker who worked on Mr. Bush's National Economic Council. rof

HEADLINE: 67 Pages of 'Must' Reading: Council Budget Adjustments

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Winnie Hu contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Shortly before approving a $52.9 billion budget at 12:40 a.m. yesterday, City Council members -- eyes bleary, neckties loosened -- each received a big yellow envelope. Excited lawmakers tore into the packages like children opening Christmas presents, in full view of the lobbyists and journalists who thronged City Hall despite the late hour.
 In the envelopes were details of the budget accord their speaker, Christine C. Quinn, had worked out with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, but most of that was old news. As Thursday passed into yesterday, the final day of the fiscal year, all eyes were trained on one document. Officially known as the Fiscal Year 2007 Adopted Expense Budget Adjustments Summary -- or Schedule C -- it lists all the pet items the Council successfully restored or added to the mayor's May budget proposal. 
At 67 pages this year, Schedule C offers a guide to the myriad programs that depend on municipal subsidies. It can also be a measure of political influence as measured by pork-barrel spending, but there is no explanation of which Council member fought for what, an accounting that takes reporters days to unravel.
 The document contains page upon page of lists with names of charitable, religious and ethnic groups and the sums appropriated for them. But it says nothing about what kind of work each group does, or what all the items add up to -- a figure in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 As in most years, the longest list by far is one that names 756 organizations that are getting money through the city's Department of Youth and Community Development.
 The roster is encyclopedic, from the Afikim Foundation, which provides Jewish online learning ($35,000), to the Zeta Zeta Zeta Lambda chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, a national African-American fraternity ($10,000). It includes the Filial Piety Society of Sunnyside, Queens ($3,500); the Ghetto Film School ($28,500); the Russian American Voters League ($7,500); and the Sister Power Organization ($10,000).
 And that's just one list.
 There are quite a few others: 23 volunteer ambulance and firefighter organizations; 46 groups that promote parks; 80 tenant associations; 146 agencies that serve the elderly; and 263 cultural groups.
 Groups that advocate transparency in government decried the process as unwieldy, irrational and open to abuse. 
 ''Does the public have any idea of the amount of money being distributed, and how?'' asked Rachel Leon, executive director of Common Cause New York, a watchdog organization. ''Is this a transparent and open part of the budget process, or do members of the City Council just get to divvy out the money, which helps the community but also helps their re-election efforts?'' 
 Since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, state law has required New York City to pass a balanced budget. But its contents remain a source of mystery. Lawmakers refer to pet projects as enhancements (one-time additions to existing programs), initiatives (programs financed for the first time) and restorations (spending the mayor proposed cutting, usually with the full expectation that the Council would restore it). 
 Others just call it pork.
 ''You can call them member items, earmarks or slush funds,'' Ms. Leon said. ''It's commonplace and we see it all levels of government. A lot of these are programs that deserve to be funded; it's just the way it gets done that I criticize.''
 James R. Brigham Jr., who directed the city's Office of Management and Budget from 1978 to 1981, said the pet projects were a time-honored ritual that he viewed as fairly harmless. ''It's really small potatoes, if you think about it,'' he said. ''This is really lubrication for the budget adoption process.''
 In a speech preceding the budget vote, Ms. Quinn once again assailed the annual ritual in which the mayor cuts programs, only to have the Council restore them. But she was silent on the Council's pet projects and how they get into the budget. ''We haven't ended the dance, but we have made tremendous progress toward that goal,'' she said.
 The publication of Schedule C also marked the culmination of months of lobbying, particularly by nonprofit groups that serve poor residents. Richard M. Greenberg, attorney in charge of the Office of the Appellate Defender, which represents poor defendants, was a fixture on the steps of City Hall, waiting day after day to accost lawmakers. 
 Mr. Greenberg said that the daily vigil by lobbyists was not the best way to finance programs but said that there was no alternative. ''I don't know what would happen if I weren't here, but I'm afraid to take the chance,'' he said this week.
 Around 12:40 a.m. yesterday, Mr. Greenberg learned the good news: his office had received $2.25 million, tucked into a section of Schedule C labeled ''miscellaneous budget.''

HEADLINE: Billions Spent on Deals and Billions Given Away 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
BIG. Bigger. Biggest. And then, something completely different.
 It was a week of ''can you top this'' deal making, not only in the banks and the boardrooms of Wall Street and London, but in the humbler settings of Omaha and Seattle. And the usual reason for deals -- creating value for investors -- was trumped by one billionaire's desire to put a lot of that value into service for the world's poorest people.

MINING COLOSSUS -- Phelps Dodge, the world's largest copper producer, agreed to buy two big nickel mining companies for $40 billion, creating a company big and powerful enough to reshape the metals industry as commodity prices continue to soar.
Phelps Dodge, based in Phoenix, stepped up with its offer just as the other companies, Inco and Falconbridge, both of Canada, were about to complete their own merger. The transaction will vault Phelps Dodge into the upper ranks of the world's diversified mining companies, alongside the British-Australian giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. 
 Consolidation in the mining industry is expected to accelerate if this deal goes through, analysts said. Xstrata, which had been trying to buy Falconbridge, may turn its sights on Teck Cominco, which had expressed an interest in buying Inco. 

STEEL LEVIATHAN -- Mittal Steel, a fast-growing metals company with mills from Trinidad to Kazakhstan, agreed to buy Arcelor, a giant rival with operations across Europe, for $33.5 billion, creating the world's largest steel maker by far.
 The combined company, to be called Arcelor-Mittal, will have three times the capacity of its nearest rival, Nippon Steel. It will have 320,000 employees, $70 billion a year in revenue, and be capable of producing more than 100 million tons annually. That is 10 percent of global market demand -- enough for twice the number of automobiles the world produces every year.
 Other big multinationals will probably accelerate their acquisition plans in light of this deal, particularly in the developing world, where labor costs are low, analysts said.

HEALTH CARE GIANT -- Johnson & Johnson -- which sells Tylenol pain reliever, Neutrogena skin products and Johnson's baby shampoo, among other familiar pharmacy fare -- agreed to buy the consumer-goods division of the drug maker Pfizer for more than $16 billion.
 The transaction gives Johnson & Johnson brands like Listerine mouthwash, Sudafed cold tablets, Rolaids antacid, Benadryl allergy medicine, Zantac antacid and Lubriderm skin lotion. It lets Pfizer focus more on prescription drugs, like Viagra, which are far more profitable.
 Analysts do not expect other drug companies to sell their consumer units because the businesses usually deliver consistent it not spectacular earnings without huge research and development costs.

TELEVISION TITAN -- A group of investors that includes the billionaire Haim Saban and four private equity firms -- Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, the Texas Pacific Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners -- agreed to buy Univision Communications, the nation's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, for $12.3 billion.
 The consortium's bid for Univision, the fifth-largest television network in the country, behind Fox, topped an offer from a rival group led by Grupo Televisa, the Mexican broadcast giant. Televisa was eager to expand north, and Univision reaches 98 percent of Spanish-speaking households in the United States.
 Hispanic lobbying organizations are expected to ask regulators to block the takeover so that Univision can be sold to an Hispanic owner.

A LIFETIME'S GAINS -- Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and one of the world's wealthiest men, signed over more than $37 billion of his personal fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and four other philanthropies.
 Most of the gift, about $31 billion, will go to the Gates' foundation, which is dedicated to health care and education in poor areas. The rest will be split among charities started by his late wife, Susan Thompson Buffett, and their children; they focus on family planning, abortion rights, nuclear proliferation, the environment, conservation, education and human rights.
 Mr. Buffett will join Mr. and Mrs. Gates as a trustee of their foundation, which with more than $60 billion in assets, will dwarf the country's second-largest charitable foundation, the Ford Foundation, which has $11.6 billion. 

BOOMING QUARTER -- The economy grew at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in two and a half years, as both consumers and businesses spent more freely than they did in the months after last year's hurricanes.
 At the same time, the Labor Department said the number of first claims for unemployment benefits rose 4,000 last week, to 313,000. Employers, meanwhile, created just 75,000 new jobs in May, the fewest since October.
 Analysts said economic growth in the second quarter, which ended yesterday, could slow to half the rate seen in the first quarter.

TAPPING THE BRAKES -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates another quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, and warned that ''some inflation risks remain.''
 Whether higher rates will be needed later this summer to keep price increases in check will depend ''on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth,'' the Fed said in its statement announcing the increase.
 Unemployment statistics, an important gauge of economic activity, will be updated next Friday. Economists expect the unemployment rate to increase.

SETTLING UP -- Tenet Healthcare, the big hospital chain, agreed to pay $900 million to settle accusations that it bilked Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly.
 Tenet next must resolve an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is looking into whether investors were deceived by the company's dealings with Medicare.

HEADLINE: Don't Know Much About History

 BODY:
Somewhere between the firing in 2002 of President Bush's first Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, and the Senate confirmation this week of his third Treasury chief, Henry Paulson, the administration changed its tune on budget deficits. In the early days, the line was, essentially, that deficits don't matter. Mr. O'Neill's ouster was due in part to his gall in suggesting otherwise. Now, officials dutifully declaim that deficits matter, but that Bush-era shortfalls are ''within historical norms.'' 
 Mr. Paulson apparently shares that view, having offered it repeatedly when asked about budget deficits during his confirmation hearing. That's a disappointment. It takes a narrow view of history to imply that the Bush-era deficits are ''normal.'' 
As a share of the economy, the Bush-era deficits have averaged 2.7 percent. That's the second worst record of any administration in the past 60 years, surpassed only by the deficits from the tenures of President Reagan and the first President Bush, which each averaged 4.3 percent. (Five years into the Clinton era, deficits averaged 1.2 percent of the economy, dropping to a mere 0.1 percent by the time Mr. Bush took over.) To imply that the current budget gap is comfortably within historical norms because it's not as bad as the worst deficits in modern memory is, to put it politely, a stretch. 
 Besides, size isn't everything when it comes to assessing the danger in budget deficits. Timing is also crucial. 
 The Reagan-era deficits occurred decades before the retirement of the baby boomers, when the post-World War II generation was in its peak earning -- and taxpaying -- years. The Bush deficits are uniquely alarming in that they're occurring on the eve of the baby boomers' retirement, leaving little time to recoup before the government has to meet large Medicare and Social Security obligations. 
 On top of that, and well outside the historical norm, is President Bush's insistence on continued tax cutting, despite the ongoing deficits and despite the fact that the economy has long since recovered from the last recession. From the end of World War II through the 1970's, various administrations hammered away at the nation's debt, reducing the burden from the wartime level of over 100 percent of the economy to about 25 percent. That effort was largely abandoned in the 1980's. But even Mr. Reagan backtracked on his budget-busting tax cuts of 1981 by raising taxes in 1982 and 1984. In 1990, a bipartisan deficit-reduction agreement raised taxes and cut spending, followed by another budget-tightening package passed by Democrats in 1993. In contrast, the Bush years have been marked by nonstop tax cutting, deepening debt, the abandonment of budget rules and increased spending, paid for by borrowing. 
 And not just any borrowing. The Bush-era deficits are also alarming in the extent to which they are foreign financed. Since 2001, 73 percent of new government borrowing has been from abroad. In total, 43 percent of the United States' publicly held debt of $4.8 trillion is in foreign hands, compared with only 14 percent at the peak of the Reagan deficits in 1983 and 30 percent in 2001. Debt owed to bankers in Beijing, Tokyo and elsewhere could destabilize the dollar and from there, drive up interest rates and prices. 
 If Mr. Paulson and other administration officials were to say that today's deficits were dangerous, it would logically follow to recommend scaling back the Bush tax cuts. By implying that the deficits are not so worrisome, they can continue to insist that spending cuts alone could fix the problem, even though that would mean deep cuts in Social Security and Medicare -- something they are not willing to advocate explicitly. One can only hope that in discussions with his new boss, Mr. Paulson has more to say about the budget deficit than he let on during his confirmation hearing.

HEADLINE: Craft Work

BYLINE: By Rob Walker

 BODY:
My Paper Crane
 Heidi Kenney is a married mother of two, and she likes to sew and make things. The fact that these things include dolls in the shape of giant tampons is perhaps the first clue that she is not exactly a housewife in the 1950's-sitcom mold. Kenney, who is 28 and lives outside Baltimore, makes and sells a variety of stuffed, anthropomorphized objects -- the tampon dolls are among her best sellers -- like doughnuts, toast and toilet-paper rolls. She does this under the auspices of her one-woman brand, My Paper Crane, making her part of a wave of independent businesses selling handmade toys, clothing, soap, jewelry, housewares and other items.
Do-it-yourself products are now at the center of everything from the DIY Network on cable television to Craft magazine, due out in the fall. All of this raises the question of what D.I.Y.-ism is really all about -- is it an ethic or just an aesthetic? While the phenomenon may be on the brink of producing a few craft-world celebrities -- the stars of ''Stylelicious'' on DIY, for example -- stories like Kenney's open a window on a sprawling community of small entrepreneurs and consumers, which seems to have a completely different set of goals. 
 Kenney says that she has always enjoyed making things, and sold some of her handmade items on consignment in one store, but didn't see the business potential until a few years ago, when she started a Web site. Her timing was good: selling online made it easier for her to reach more buyers, and it also made her one of a legion of individual creators and online stores that have sparked all kinds of crafty ''sharing'' and ''communing,'' says Leah Kramer, the founder of a site called Craftster. Kramer says that this online communing helped fuel the growing number of physical-world craft fairs, from the Renegade Craft Fair in Brooklyn to the Indie Craft Experience in Atlanta, whose popularity has in turn led to the founding of permanent indie-crafter stores. Kenney is among those who have used all these channels to reach her audience and now fulfills 100 to 150 orders a month (more closer to the holidays) for her home-sewn goods.
 Kramer and others figure that many craft consumers have borderline sociopolitical motives, seeking in these alternatives to mass-produced, corporate-made goods not just something unique but also a product with no murky labor or environmental-impact back story. Still, the more popular crafting becomes, the more crafters see mass goods in mainstream retailers that mimic the handmade look. This is part of the reason that Faythe Levine, who runs Paper Boat Boutique and Gallery in Milwaukee and coordinates that city's Art vs. Craft fair, has begun filming a documentary that frames the contemporary craft movement as being partly descended from the indie-driven culture of zines and punk rock. Levine views the story of D.I.Y. crafting as one of building an alternative to mainstream consumption -- not as a lifestyle trend. She also points out that this is an ''art movement'' that is dominated by female artist-entrepreneurs. ''We're talking thousands of women,'' she says. ''It's really impressive, and powerful.''
 This brings up the last striking point about the grass-roots version of D.I.Y.-ism. In the recent book ''The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs. Beeton,'' Kathryn Hughes, a scholar at the University of East Anglia, tells the story of a transitional cultural moment: in the industrializing England of the mid-19th century, manufactured products were replacing ''the handmade world,'' and ''new codes of gentility'' suggested that ''middle-class women should not engage in productive labor'' but should devote themselves to being household managers -- and, of course, consumers. As Hughes notes, many contemporary discussions of the supposed ''new domesticity'' trend exemplified by, say, Nigella Lawson, seem to imply that many career women secretly yearn for an idealized homemaker role. But that hardly describes Kenney, whose success with My Paper Crane allowed her to quit a cubicle job answering phones at an insurance company and spend more time being a working mom on her own terms. Her experience shows how the D.I.Y. craft movement offers a new way to resolve an old tension between traditional domestic skills and participation in the (economic and creative) marketplace: by combining them.

UPTON SINCLAIR AND THE
 OTHER AMERICAN CENTURY
 By Kevin Mattson.
 Illustrated. 294 pp. John Wiley & Sons. $25.95.
A hundred years ago, an American writer hurled these words at the world: '' 'Bubbly Creek' is an arm of the Chicago River, and forms the southern boundary of the yards; all the drainage of the square mile of packing house empties into it, so that it is really a great open sewer a hundred or two feet wide. One long arm of it is blind, and the filth stays there forever and a day. The grease and chemicals that are poured into it undergo all sorts of strange transformations, which are the cause of its name; it is constantly in motion, as if huge fish were feeding in it, or great leviathans were disporting themselves in its depths. Bubbles of carbonic acid gas will rise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide. Here and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding, and many times an unwary stranger has started to stroll across, and vanished temporarily. 
The packers used to leave the creek that way, till every now and then the surface would catch on fire and burn furiously, and the fire department would have to come and put it out. Once, however, an ingenious stranger came and started to gather this filth in scows, to make lard out of; then the packers took the cue, and got out an injunction to stop him, and afterwards gathered it themselves.''
 It might be Dickens in ''Our Mutual Friend'' (1865), tracing the vile kinship between the black Thames and the great city of Dust. The chickens walking on the gruesome paste are to die for -- Hollywood would sign a deal at that point, over a Chateaubriand dinner -- though that ''temporarily'' is awkward and innocent in the writing. In Dickens, the vanishing would have been utter. So, no, this author is not quite Dickens, even if he wrote with a similar fluency and need. Instead -- and Chicago has given it away -- this is Upton Sinclair, who lived longer than Dickens by far, and wrote so many more novels. Sinclair died in 1968, at 90. Dickens would have been 90 in 1902. Yet Dickens is the more awesome for dying in his 50's, taken by the dread that had made him so lively. Dickens didn't have to face being a living monument. Upton Sinclair lived on until such times as his ''Jungle'' had been cleared, and America -- it told itself -- was strong, healthy and wise from the bright red meat laid out in the chilled tombs of 10,000 supermarkets.
 Still, in this centenary year for his most famous book -- the readability of which is, I hope, established -- what are we to make of Sinclair? We have two new biographies on the table, beggingly lean and artfully digested, as if the publishers had told their authors: ''Show some moderation. Pick out the high points. If we get a hundred kids to look at 'The Jungle,' we'll have done honor by the old boy. How's your burger?'' Both Anthony Arthur's and Kevin Mattson's books are reasonable in length and tempered in passion. Pushed to choose, I prefer Arthur's. But to feel the wonderful nut and enthusiast in Sinclair, the intrigued newcomer should read ''The Jungle'' or ''King Coal.'' Then realize that this author was a very good and ardent tennis player! Eight thousand words a day and three sets -- with no tie breakers. 
 Upton Beall Sinclair wrote habitually, at the drop of a hat, and at the death of every sparrow. He produced more than 80 books, as well as countless speeches, letters, notes and proposals. I suspect that he talked almost as he wrote on paper, as if preparing for a public lecture, and that may account for his dismay over the way he and women didn't quite understand each other. He wrote about so many things that when his greatest test came -- in the California gubernatorial election of 1934 -- his opponents had only to hire researchers to go through his stuff to retrieve all the contradictory, crazy things ''Uppie'' had written. Not that they stopped at that tactic. 
 As 1934 made clear, Sinclair was a man of action, a writer who longed to act out his own dogma. Born into a comfortable Baltimore family, he entered City College of New York when he was 15. He began writing sketches for magazines to pay his expenses, and after graduation became a full-time writer. He was assisted by clean living, restrained socializing and an indefatigable eye for wrongs in the world as well as the confidence that good sense would surely see them corrected. His friend Charlie Chaplin never knew him without a smile, and one wonders if even the writing of ''Bubbly Creek'' was accompanied by a smile of wonder and satisfaction. He would be called a muckraker, but he loved muck in the way farmers love soil.
 The expose of the meat industry in ''The Jungle'' seems like the tirade of a lifetime, yet Sinclair needed just seven weeks of research. The book was a huge success. It prompted real reforms, including the Pure Food Act of 1906 But a pattern was set for his books, and it was strengthened by the spine of theoretical socialism -- public ownership, women's rights and taxes as a privilege reserved for the rich. ''The Jungle'' had its impact on Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis and Steinbeck, but Upton Sinclair is not in their class as a novelist because he does not see or inhabit character and emotional plot in the way that he editorializes over situation, grievance and muck. ''Oil!'' (1927) has more of a story than ''The Jungle,'' and it reflects Sinclair's crucial shift to Southern California, where he had moved in 1916. He loved the sun, the air and the political possibilities -- why not put an exiled czar on Catalina Island?
 In the early 30's, when Sergei Eisenstein came to Hollywood, Sinclair became one of his best friends and co-workers. A plan to film Dreiser's ''American Tragedy'' collapsed, but Sinclair joined in the partnership that would send Eisenstein to Mexico to shoot the footage -- poetic, repetitious, marvelous, mysterious -- that became ''Que Viva Mexico!'' In many ways, the innocent Uppie was trapped -- by the very slippery Eisenstein, who was looking for gay romance and pornography (as well as high art), and by the Soviet authorities whose plan it was that Eisenstein was doomed. So the picture was unfinished. Uppie cut his own version, and was accused of trampling on Eisenstein's art. The radical innocent had a way of getting himself into intellectual slapstick.
 Then came the 1934 election. Sinclair saw America in a crisis, and he was hardly alone. So he gave up his socialist ties, became a Democrat and announced a plan called EPIC (End Poverty in California), which called for turning all idle agricultural land over to unemployed farmworkers and combining factories and businesses into a giant state-run cooperative. He won the Democratic primary and opposed Gov. Frank Merriam, a nonentity. Sinclair was a terrific campaigner, and his early energy united every reactionary force against him -- including The Los Angeles Times and the picture business, both of which were terrified by his plans. Louis B. Mayer arranged ''newsreels'' in which every ''decent'' person said they were for Merriam while every wild-eyed, unwashed vagrant to be picked up for a quarter ranted into the camera about Uppie's plans. Late in the race, unable to get President Roosevelt to do a single thing in his support, Sinclair let slip the possibility that if he was elected ''half the unemployed'' might travel to California. On election day, he went down, losing 879,537 votes to 1,138,620.
 To this day, a great book or movie about Los Angeles could be set against the backdrop of the election. It looks increasingly like the last great outcry of the left in America, and it shows the ugly alliance of every rich and insecure entity that could make curse words out of ''socialist'' or ''liberal.''
 Sinclair was not really set back personally. But he began to behave more like a middle-aged or semi-retired workaholic. The year 1940 saw the publication of ''World's End,'' the first in what became known as the Lanny Budd novels, in which a well-raised young man confronts the problems of the world. They are as resolutely 19th-century as nearly everything Sinclair wrote, though they have a Dos Passos-like interest in reproducing famous figures. ''World's End'' sold half a million copies: Uppie's gravest warnings usually left him richer. The sequels spilled out, and one of them picked up a Pulitzer Prize to go along with the Nobel he had won in 1930. 
 Arthur and Mattson admire Sinclair, yet it's hard not to feel the strain in the enterprises. Can such an author be revived as someone to be read today? Haven't times changed out of sight? Does anyone eat beef today and think of the stockyards? Well, yes, I think beef is still under suspicion, along with just about everyone who feeds the enormous public. Eric Schlosser and others are still questioning the food culture. But the real thing about ''The Jungle'' is the way Sinclair saw the vicious link between ''them'' and ''us,'' a dramatic paranoia straight from Dickens. If Sinclair were here today, I'd send him to the San Joaquin Valley, where vegetables fit for Hockney and every farmers' market are produced through dire exploitation. I'd urge him to go to Salinas, John Steinbeck's hometown, where the public libraries nearly closed recently for lack of funding and where the prospects for Hispanics who work the valley are expatriation, gang warfare, a broken back in the sun and the chemicals or . . . the American dream. 
 There was a period in this country, from the 30's through the 70's, in which government caring seemed to ease away some of the muck. We think of it as the Great Society, and we recall people and politicians who voiced hope for it without irony. It's clearer now that the middle class -- the great force that made Dickens's England more benevolent -- is in retreat. We are getting back to them and us, in a country that has earned little but shame in its foreign affairs. We are not liked, we are not trusted, we are not respected -- and all those shortcomings are eroding our domestic souls. Katrina, that gust of nature, was the rehearsal for the revelation that ''they'' now have neither the means nor the intent of looking after us. We are on our own, and we may need to find our own Sinclairs.

HEADLINE: The Agony and Ecstasy of 18 Hours in the Air

BYLINE: By JOSHUA KURLANTZICK

 BODY:
BOARDING an overnight flight from Washington to Germany three years ago, I settled in, ready to sleep or dig into my bag of video and audio amusements, when a middle-age man climbed into the seat next to me. I closed my eyes -- and opened them again to the drumbeat of his knuckles on the window. 
 The man had brought nothing onboard, the movie screen wasn't working, and apparently all he could do for entertainment was tap on the window and sing to himself. Which he did, on and off, for eight hours.
The drum major doesn't have to worry anymore. Many airlines seem to believe that the longest flights, particularly those packed with business- and first-class seats -- and amenities -- may be their most lucrative routes. In the last three years, airlines have introduced a wealth of time-saving long-haul flights to the Middle East, Europe and Asia. 
 Singapore Airlines now flies nonstop between Newark Liberty and Singapore, Thai Airways between Kennedy and Bangkok, Emirates daily between Kennedy and Dubai, and Continental between Newark and India or China, among other permutations. Delta Air Lines has aggressively upgraded its longest-haul flights, adding digital TV and music and redesigning its seats for more comfort. Air Tahiti Nui even has a nonstop from New York to Papeete, for those who want a direct shot to paradise.
 This long-haul competition has spurred an arms race in onboard gadgets and services: movie channels, flat beds, more flight attendants, meals designed by prestigious chefs and exercise bars that can be used for yoga or stretching. 
 Over the last year, I've become a long-haul guinea pig, flying these new routes, sometimes one right after another, though I never made it to Tahiti. No flight allowed me to completely forget I was in a metal tube alongside strangers for as long as 18 hours. But the best ones helped me arrive at my destination with some sanity intact.
 I started my odyssey in the spring of 2005 on South African Airways. South African's trip from New York to Johannesburg is one of the longest in the world -- nearly 17 hours, with a brief refueling stop in Senegal. Since few other reliable carriers fly to Africa, S.A.A. enjoys a virtual monopoly, and sometimes it shows. 
 I greedily scanned the enormous variety of films on my economy-class personal video system, but even at 5 feet 5 inches, I felt cramped in the tiny seat. (When I arrived in Johannesburg, I checked out webflyer.com, the online gabfest for frequent travelers, and found other complaints about the lack of legroom on South African Airways.)
 Worse, the cabin staff often seemed to be missing in action. Midway through the flight, when I was able to flag down an attendant and request a soda, she brought me a can so small it barely filled a tiny airline glass. I asked for a second can and some ice. She simply shook her head and walked away. Pressing the call button got me silence.
 Several weeks later, when I boarded Thai Airways' new flight from Kennedy to Bangkok, the only nonstop from the East Coast to the Thai capital, the atmosphere could hardly have been more different. In 2001, Thai's fleet was criticized -- with an off-color invective -- by the country's own prime minister. The New York route was a major attempt to upgrade Thai's image.
 Onboard, in a spacious new Airbus A-340 fitted with just 215 seats -- it could hold over 300 -- the staff seemed jazzed to fly. I sensed, for a moment, what it must have been like to go Pan Am in the 1940's, back when flying was glamorous and the staff shared the fun. 
 ''I've never flown this far,'' one flight attendant told me, smiling. ''It's going to be amazing.''
 It was. In the premium economy cabin -- the New York-Bangkok flight offers Royal Silk (business), premium economy and economy -- I had more legroom than in many American carriers' business class, and the seats could recline enough to approximate a bed. The staff performed like waiters at a classy restaurant, attentive but never smothering.
 Once again, I found a multitude of choices in the personal video system, and meals that met the hardest-to-find adjective in airline food -- light. Even the vegetarian option -- which on Thai is normally a pile of greens blanched until flavor is just a memory -- was a pleasant mix of fresh Western and Asian salads.
 Six weeks later, I was heading over the Pacific again, this time on United. Though it has been operating in bankruptcy since 2002, United has made the expanding of its Asian network a key to escaping Chapter 11, and exited bankruptcy this winter. The airline has added flights to Japan and China, and started the first service by an American airline to Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, since the Vietnam War.
 I settled into United's business class to China, on the upper deck of the plane, and the space felt cozy and private. Fruit and sandwiches were always available, and the staff chatted amiably with customers. The personal video option, though, contained fewer than 10 films, and they all seemed to star Will Ferrell or Vince Vaughn.
 Returning from Asia, I sampled United's economy service. Sitting next to me, in the crowded warren of seats by the window, an experienced traveler with a stoic expression pulled out his own bag full of tricks -- a portable DVD player and a veritable library of novels.
 He knew what he was doing. United economy simply couldn't compare with the same class on the non-American carriers. At mealtime, the flight attendants yelled out ''chicken or beef,'' and several couldn't tell me what the chicken dish actually contained. There was no personal video: the entertainment consisted of an old-school screen in the front of the cabin, which I could barely see. When I stood up, my entire seat cushion peeled off.
 I decided to trade up, big time. Since Emirates inaugurated its New York-Dubai service in 2004, it's been winning raves from frequent travelers for its service and amenities. Much of that attention was lavished on Emirates' first class, where passengers travel in little suites, sleep on massaging beds and drink from personal minibars.
 But what about economy? In November, I flew Emirates' New York to Dubai route, on my way to Sri Lanka. The flight was full: Ken Campbell, North America manager for Sri Lankan Airlines, which has a code share agreement with Emirates, says the Dubai route is almost always 100 percent booked.
 A totally full economy cabin is never an entirely pleasant experience (I woke up drooling on the sari-clad shoulder of a woman next to me, who paid me back by prodding me in the gut while she slept), but Emirates, more than any other long-haul carrier, makes it tolerable.
 It does so with small touches: Leg rests in economy class that actually allow you to stretch out while sleeping. A 500-channel personal video system with a broader range of offerings than any I'd ever seen, from Arabic fashion shows to ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' to the latest news in Urdu to Hollywood oldies. 
 And it had the best airline food I've had: spicy Indian curries and fluffy rice that tasted as if it had actually been made onboard -- though I am sure it was not.
 Throughout the flight, staff members circled through the cabin, achieving a balance between the stiff formality of some Asian airlines and American carriers' casual friendliness, which can sometimes verge into inattention. 
 Several months later, I boarded another almost daylong flight, this time on Singapore Airlines, from Newark to Singapore. The flight lasts over 18 hours, yet Singapore's economy seats proved more comfortable than those in business class on most airlines. 
 The choice of films was smaller than on Emirates, but Singapore included far more art house choices, including Oscar nominees like ''The Constant Gardener'' and French and Italian offerings. The cabin staff was more polite than any other airline's, even delivering five extra meals to the fellow in front of me who just couldn't get enough airline food.
 In the back of the economy cabin, there was a small walk-up station where you could get fruit, drinks, granola bars and other snacks, and attendants hung around to chat up passengers. By the end of the flight, the station felt like a city bar at happy hour, with passengers drifting to the back to swap airline stories, complain about their jobs, and even swap phone numbers. 
 The flight was, dare I say it, almost fun. 

WHERE TO GO TO GO THE DISTANCE
 Long-haul nonstop flights tend to be slightly more expensive than alternative routes that include a connection, and they also can book up quickly. Tips on the best deals can often be found on Web sites like Flyertalk.com.
 Not all the long-haul carriers allow you to reserve specific seats. Emirates allows seat reservations only for members of its frequent flier club so you may want to arrive at the airport on flight day far in advance. 
 For more information, see the airlines' Web sites, including thaiair.com;airtahitinui-usa.com; emirates.com; ual.com (United), and flysaa.com, for which South African Airways has won plaudits for the online booking service.
 Flying 12 to 18 hours nonstop requires caring for your body. Health experts suggest that you avoid the temptation to try all the wine offered, and stand up at least every two hours if you can. And even on the cushiest flights, always take your own entertainment, just in case. JOSHUA KURLANTZICK

HEADLINE: Her Lonely Voice

BYLINE: By Darcy Frey. 
Darcy Frey is the author of ''The Last Shot'' and has written for the magazine on music, science, medicine and the environment.

 BODY:
Katell Keineg is a singer-songwriter who was born in Brittany, raised in Wales and now lives in a top-floor flat overlooking the slate rooftops and cobbled alleys of Georgian Dublin. When she's not at home, which is more than half the year, she makes restless pilgrimages back to Brittany or Cardiff, or to South America, the Caribbean or the northern rim of Africa, where she invariably picks up sonic influences -- the sound of Bolivian parade drums, the open-throat singing of the Bulgarian state radio choir, the shouting and clapping of slave songs from the Georgia sea islands -- that resurface, in ways large and small, in her music. At any given performance, she may sing in English, French, Spanish, Welsh or Breton and create a set from an astonishing diversity of songs: the insistent, hip hop-driven wordplay of ''Partisan''; or the haunting, liturgical ''O Iesu Mawr,'' which she sings a cappella and in Welsh; or the Latin-inflected ''Ole, Conquistador,'' with its anti-imperialist lyrics and aural collage of lyre, castanets and thunder; or the simple, childlike ''Old Friend,'' a new song that, after a brief precis, confines its melody to repeated versions and inversions of a single three-note phrase and manages to break your heart in a minute and 40 seconds. 
Keineg is tall and long-limbed, and when she walks up to the mike with her guitar, loose blond hair framing a round, seraphic face, she can seem so uncertain, so diaphanous that you half-expect a strong gust from the side to blow her right offstage. As her spare, hastily-assembled backup band sets up, she tunes her guitar in a state of nerve-racking disarray -- she once had to ask a member of the audience for help. But when she begins to sing, the protean richness of her voice -- now low and throaty, now high and chimelike -- rises from her body as easefully as breath, and she embraces her musical narratives with such intensity of feeling that, despite their many literary allusions and mysterious elisions, she sometimes enters what appears to be an almost trancelike state, brought on by the primal candor of her singing. 
 In the spring, at a small Lower East Side club called Sin-e, I watched Keineg perform a song called ''There You Go,'' which tells of a woman parting company with the man she loves, though how long she has known him or what passed between them is left unsaid. Opening in a mood of quiet resolve, Keineg used a tender, delicate register to speak, as it were, to the back of her receding lover: ''There you go now -- swinging down the boulevard, a miracle, that's what you are.'' As the narrator faced the brute fact of her impending loss, however, Keineg's voice grew more fervent, and rhymes and repetitions served the darker purpose of reminding her of all she once possessed: ''I held out my hand and you gave it to me -- on a plate, all I could take, I could take more of that.'' Halfway through the song, as the woman struggled to absorb the fullness of the blow, Keineg replaced her serene refrain of ''there you go'' with the rhythmically similar but utterly devastating phrase -- the plea -- to ''bring it back,'' which she kept repeating in a voice soaked with pain: bring it back, bring it back. It was an extraordinary moment: Keineg sang with such ecstatic desperation, so in thrall to the rapture of her loss, she might have been weeping. As the man disappeared for good -- ''down the boulevard, the avenue, the runway, the white lines'' -- Keineg murmured: ''I turned. I don't know why I did it, but I did,'' over and over, until she declared, enigmatically, ''Now I must return to the underworld.'' Had she just performed a heart-rending modernization of the parting of Orpheus and Eurydice?
 Keineg's live shows -- what one critic called her ''nearly beatific sense of joy in performance'' -- have won her a small, devoted following in Dublin and New York. ''It's Katell's intensity,'' says Nancy Jeffries, who as an artists-and-repertoire executive at Elektra signed Keineg to her first recording contract. ''She projects this combination of strength and fragility. It's really quite spellbinding: there she is, climbing these heights, and you have this fear she won't get there, but she always does.'' Keineg's three full-length albums (''O Seasons O Castles,'' ''Jet'' and ''High July'') and her one EP (''What's the Only Thing Worse Than the End of Time?'') have also earned her enviable critical acclaim: Entertainment Weekly described her as a ''stunning singer of boundless invention''; Esquire called her 1997 album ''Jet'' among ''the greatest overlooked pop masterpieces of the decade.'' This summer, she plans to finish recording 11 new songs, which she says she will compile into a fourth full-length album, due out this fall. Keineg will appear at the Living Room in New York City on Thursday.
 But despite the bold and sustained originality of her talent, and a moment of early recognition in the mid-90's when her career seemed about to take off, Keineg has not yet succeeded in finding a steady, widespread audience. In fact, 12 years after her sparkling debut, I learned that she was working under much diminished circumstances: After protracted negotiations, she parted ways with Elektra; she was operating without the help of a regular agent or manager; and she was financing her own recording, going into the studio one song at a time whenever she could borrow equipment or the instrumental services of her friends. At this point, she said, she was so frustrated by the whole ''multinational'' music industry that she was looking for any way she could to avoid the major labels altogether, perhaps by licensing her new album to a small distributor or releasing it exclusively online. 
 ''I'm someone who gets lots of praise from lots of quarters,'' she wrote in an e-mail message, ''but have found it very difficult to fit into the structures that determine people's progress in the music world.'' In February, I went to Dublin to meet Keineg and to learn how an artist with such prodigious gifts could have slipped so thoroughly through the cracks.
 It was a raw, overcast afternoon, a few days before Keineg's 41st birthday, and she was sitting in her living room in Dublin, talking with easy exuberance and impassioned debate about this business of making a musical life, despite the vicissitudes of critical response and the marketplace. Above the rooftops across the street, we could see low clouds scudding over the bald, brown hills of the Dublin range. Inside, it was cold as well -- Keineg and I sitting in sweaters and scarves, passing a teapot back and forth and scooting our chairs closer to the space heaters. She saw me look around -- at her worn armchairs, the sofas covered with sheets, the fireplace that gave her carbon-monoxide poisoning not long ago. She waved her hands about. ''Don't go into the whole cold-garret thing, O.K.? Or the fact that the fridge doesn't work and there's no food in it anyway!'' 
 She laughed and settled back into her chair. ''Things didn't turn out exactly the way I'd hoped,'' she went on to say, ''but I'm not sorry, really. I'm actually quite happy -- until I run completely out of money, that is. I suppose I could always do soundtracks -- you know, like the woman who ruined Eastern European singing forever by doing that whole faux-Balkan thing for the movies -- but for half the price!'' She laughed again and shrugged. ''The whole point is to make a life out of music, isn't it? The people I admire most are the ones who kept going, who kept doing their thing. I mean, Johnny Hooker worked in a car factory. Nina Simone -- you hear her music a lot more now that she's dead.''
 Keineg got her start in the early 1990's, playing gigs along with Jeff Buckley and David Gray at Sin-e, though it was Keineg back then who developed the cult following and packed the house. ''Those were wildly popular, almost legendary shows,'' recalls Jeffries, the former Elektra executive. ''Word would get around: 'Oh, my God, Katell's going to be there! You have to go!''' During that time, Keineg played at a Dublin show with U2 and opened for Natalie Merchant at Town Hall, and she appeared with Merchant (who covered one of Keineg's songs, ''The Gulf of Araby'') on ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''Letterman.'' A half-dozen labels bid for Keineg's first record contract, and she eventually signed a generous six-album deal with Elektra, largely to work with Bob Krasnow, the chairman who had a reputation for being artist-oriented and turning risk into brilliant success -- during his tenure, he made hits of, among others, Anita Baker, the Pixies, Bjork, 10,000 Maniacs and Metallica. 
 He had a similar vision for Keineg. ''Katell fell into an elite group of singer-songwriters like Tracy Chapman and Jackson Browne who had a certain elevated way of expressing themselves,'' Krasnow says. ''I was a great believer.'' Jeffries, who worked at Elektra for 11 years before leaving in 2000 to become a manager, explains: ''When I went to Bob to do the Katell deal, his arms were open wide. He was convinced she was going to be the Next Great Artist. She had everything -- great voice, literary ability, emotional capacity, and she happens to be beautiful! I mean, in the musical world I grew up in -- the world in which there were artists like Dylan and Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, and a public devoted to following them -- along came Katell, and she was perfect.''
 But fate -- in the form of personnel changes known to any artist who must use the corporate structure to distribute her work -- intervened: in 1994, three weeks before ''O Seasons O Castles'' was released, Krasnow and most of the other executives who signed and supported Keineg left Elektra; a new regime whose tastes ran toward pop rock and hip-hop took over; and like so many ''alternative'' artists -- Aimee Mann and Wilco, most notoriously -- Keineg found herself contractually bound to a label that was plainly indifferent to her music and apparently mystified by how to market albums so defiantly undefinable that they are sometimes filed in record stores under ''Folk,'' ''Rock,'' ''Celtic,'' ''World,'' ''Lilith Fair'' and even ''American Roots.'' 
 Certainly, Keineg's rigorous code of aesthetic purity has not helped her in the commercial sphere. She has refused to work with well-known producers whose sound might have guaranteed some radio play because, as she said to me, ''I never wanted to make a record where I was just the voice inside someone else's musical envelope; then your record sounds like everything else that producer did, and I wanted my records to sound like my records.'' When she was under contract to Elektra, the marketing department put no small pressure on her to trade on her appearance, which she resisted as best she could, although for the cover of ''Jet'' she did finally agree to be photographed by a fashion photographer in the South of France. And while two of her songs were used on movie soundtracks (''Hestia'' in ''I Love You Don't Touch Me!'' and ''On Yer Way'' in ''Virgin''), she has also refused to license her songs for commercial use. Oddly, one company wanted to use her eerie, Bulgarian-accented ''Enzo 96'' to market its domestic appliances. 
 Her aversion to the business end of the musical enterprise has also led to a certain indifference to the demands of managing a career. ''To do this kind of thing, you have to have the goal and work steadily toward it over the months,'' she said to me in Dublin, using the inflections of a motivational speaker. ''There's a big difference between that and a person who needs all her energy just to get out of bed in the morning!'' Indeed, her Web site (katellkeineg.com), which is four years old, is almost never updated; video feeds are perpetually ''coming soon.'' And that neglect of detail sometimes works its way into the music-making itself. When Keineg played on the bill with U2 in front of 50,000 people, she walked onstage and discovered that the battery to her guitar was dead. She is always forgetting to bring extra strings to the studio, and for someone looking to the online world to save her from the corporate maw, it is notable that when I met her, she didn't even own a computer. ''I want to kick Katell sometimes,'' says Jack McKeever, a musician, engineer and producer who has been working with Keineg in his New York studio. ''In her day, she could bewitch anyone. But she can be so stubborn and defensive.''
 Nancy Jeffries, however, argues that Keineg's musical career must be viewed against the backdrop of the decline of the pop-music industry over the last 10 years. ''Even after the regime change at Elektra, there wasn't a single person at the label who didn't believe Katell was a great artist,'' Jeffries says. ''But by then, everything was changing. Remember, this was 1994. Everyone was going through that period of worrying their artists weren't pop enough, and Katell is the antithesis of pop. In fact, I think she scared them. The people at the top -- the ones who made the decisions about retail marketing and radio money -- were just too frightened to put their budgetary priorities behind her.
 ''Katell was a victim of that, no question,'' Jeffries concludes. ''Pop music was such a vital part of the culture for a long moment in time because there were all these artists who had important things to say and companies realized they could make a lot of money off of them; art and commerce came together, and it was fantastic. But by the time Katell came along, we were at the tail end of that. She was the artist on the fulcrum -- this amazing talent who walked in a princess and walked out not a princess.''
 Between marketing disputes and wrangling with Elektra, seven years would pass before Keineg could exit her contract, win back the rights to her first two albums and return to the studio to make ''High July.'' The album, which has several beautiful songs, nevertheless suffers from its lower-budget production; and when it was released only through a small distributor in the U.K. and Ireland in 2004, it received far less attention than her first two albums. Unhappy with its distribution, Keineg says she hopes to rerelease the album through another distributor in the U.S. this summer. All her music will finally be available on iTunes this month.
 ''O Seasons O Castles'' and ''Jet'' were lavishly-produced, lushly-arranged collections that explored musical traditions as disparate as punk, country, bossa nova, traditional Welsh hymn and even spoken poetry; and on both albums, Keineg pushed to the outer limits the range and dexterity of her voice. Beginning with ''High July,'' Keineg's songs have grown sparer, and she is recording her current album on eight-track to two-inch tape, which offers less overdubbing flexibility than digital technology but produces a rich, capacious sound that replicates live performance. ''More and more, I like a minimum of ego in a singer,'' she said to me in Dublin. ''I mean, you're trying to get something across, right? If there's a lot of ego, or you're singing through a persona, there's not much transmitting, not much connection.'' 
 Keineg may believe ardently in the promise of communication through music, but that doesn't mean she particularly wants to talk about her songs, which are often narrated by a first-person figure who may or may not be the singer herself and which shade at all times toward the elusive: ''I've been sleeping in a passageway under the sea,'' she sings in ''Hestia.'' ''I've been crouching in the fireplace, safe amongst the flames.'' Actually, it's hard to know if those are even her exact words, given her sliding intonations and her insistence on neither including her lyrics in her liner notes nor posting them online, which has prompted some of her more devoted fans to congregate on the Internet to parse their meanings. When asked about her songs, Keineg will often frown, look away or simply shrug, as if she, too, might like to know what they're about. ''Oh, you should just make it all up,'' she said at our first meeting. The idea made her eyes light up. ''You could do that, you know! In fact, I could invent a pseudonym and a story for myself, just like Dylan. That's quite appealing, actually!''
 Now, sitting in her living room during that cold, gray afternoon, she said: ''My songs are personal, but they're also hidden, obscure. They're sort of'' -- she laughed and waved her hands about her ears -- ''Dance of the Seven Veils, you know?'' 
 Figuring that if the veils would come down, they'd come down only with time, I moved away from the specifics of her songs and asked what impelled her to keep writing, especially in the face of hard times; lately, she'd been playing small scale gigs and teaching a songwriting workshop in the west of Ireland and considering turning to an old law degree for extra income.
 Keineg looked away. Then she wrapped her scarf tighter around her neck. Outside, the gray sky was losing light, and lamps were appearing in the apartments across the way. ''Well, I'd like to think that musicians have a function in society,'' she said carefully. ''I studied preliterate music in college, and back then they didn't have a concept of music as an aesthetic pleasure. For them, music had a function -- for healing, or to make the rains come, or to exorcise someone.'' She laughed and clapped a hand over her mouth. ''Oh, stop me before I start sounding completely naff!''
 I said nothing, hoping she'd go on. 
 ''Well, for me, listening to music is akin to a religious experience; it's the closest thing to a religion I have. I mean, I wouldn't put it in terms of God, because I'm an atheist, but I think humans are hard-wired for religion, hard-wired with a sense of divinity, however you interpret that. There's probably some evolutionary advantage to it -- this urge for meaning.'' 
 Gingerly, I asked how her own music fit into this. 
 She tucked her chin beneath her scarf and remained in general territory. ''Well, music happens over time the way emotions do. It's an emotional intensifier, isn't it? And the music I love -- great qawwali singers like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan or the shouters from Georgia -- there's an ecstatic element in it, an element of intense emotionality. To me, that's an antidote to ironic, postmodern detachment, which is creeping into pop music and which really frightens me -- it strips everything of meaning.'' 
 Outside, the line between the mountains and the sky had disappeared, and Keineg and I found ourselves sitting nearly in the dark. ''So if music has a function,'' I said, ''what's the function of your music?''
 Just then, she stood up, went over to her desk and picked up a book she'd been reading: ''Music and the Mind.'' ''Well, the music I like is music a singer needs to sing,'' she said, idly flipping the book's pages. ''You can always tell when someone needs to write and sing.'' 
 ''What makes you need to write and sing?''
 She closed the book and went to her window, gazing down at the street lamps below. ''Oh, gosh, I really can't go into that.'' She frowned and rubbed her forehead. ''It's just too internal. I mean, I tend to write about love and loss, and I'm just not going to talk about who I've loved and who I've lost.''
 Our conversation seemed to throw into sharp relief the central tension of her creative life: how to mine the emotional depths from which her songs derive their power without violating -- for marketing, publicity or even a magazine profile -- the anonymity she feels is crucial to her ability to write and perform. And her reticence was catching; I was drifting off into abstraction myself. When I finally put it to her bluntly -- how could a reader (and, by extension, a wider audience) ever come to know her if she wouldn't talk about the substance of her art? -- she put it more bluntly still: ''Well, that might be your goal,'' she said with a half-smile and a determined gaze. ''But I'm not sure it's mine. I mean, a part of me just doesn't want to be known by people I don't know.''
 One day in Dublin, Keineg went over to a friend's home studio to work on songs for her new album. She spent the afternoon recording a cover of a Welsh song called ''Y Gwyneb Iau,'' which was written by the Cardiff band Super Furry Animals. She employed an almost nasal, vibrato-less timbre for the song, which, considering she hadn't written it, she seemed surprisingly reluctant to translate: ''Well, it's about loss and, um, heartbreak,'' she said, looking down at a printout of the lyrics. ''The first verse -- 'cwyd dy bentan a dos lawr i'r de' -- that's about leaving your home. And this line, that means, 'Hey, younger face, the doors are closed to you.''' She laughed. ''It's a pretty sad song, but it all ends O.K., because -- 'golchi'r clwyf sy'n cadw dod yn' -- that means, 'Cleanse the wound that will only recur.' You know: You're moving on.'' It was hard not to hear in this Welsh song an echo of her own peripatetic wanderings through life.
 Keineg never had any formal musical training -- she can't read music -- but in Brittany, where she spent her first nine years, and Wales, where she lived throughout her adolescence, music (mainly as an accompaniment to radical politics) was the air she breathed. Her father, Paol, a Breton poet and playwright of some renown, was a founding member of the Breton Democratic Union party. Her mother, Judith, was a Welsh schoolteacher and, later, an elected representative to Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party. ''They were militants, socialists struggling for Breton and Welsh independence, and in my early years the revolution was imminent; it was very exciting,'' Keineg told me. Constantly organizing rallies, conferences and fund-raising gigs, her parents would play the music of what Keineg calls ''small struggling countries'' -- Catalonia, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Brittany and the Basque region -- and put on fest-noz, night festivals, that featured traditional Breton music and dancing.
 When Keineg was 8, her parents divorced, and her father moved to the United States to teach French at a succession of American universities. A year later, Keineg and her older brother moved with their mother to Penpedairheol, or ''top of four roads,'' a small coal-mining community in the valleys north of Cardiff. Then, as now, the valleys were insular, and as a French-speaking immigrant with a foreign-sounding name, Katell was considered ''somewhat strange,'' she says. ''Like my mother, I just learned to do my own thing.'' But she went to a Welsh school, where she became fluent in a third language, and sang constantly -- in school choirs, which were hugely popular in Wales, and also in eisteddfod, a cultural competition for singers, instrumentalists, poets and other performers. Meanwhile, her father, trying to preserve a connection with a daughter he never saw and could barely afford to phone, would send her music: Smithsonian Folkways Recordings of folk music from the 50's and 60's, compilation tapes on which he would include everything from Cisco Houston and Woody Guthrie to Joni Mitchell and Amalia Rodrigues. 
 Critics, looking for analogies to convey Keineg's singular sound, have often compared her with female singer-songwriters like Mitchell, Merchant and Sinead O'Connor, but in fact the musicians who most inspired her when she was young were George Harrison, whose guitar licks Keineg tried to emulate with her own electric guitar, and Robert Plant, whose music she first heard when she sneaked off to the Scala Cinema in Merthyr Tydfil to see ''The Song Remains the Same.'' ''It was that pure rock 'n' roll energy,'' she says. ''I was completely transformed. That's what made me want to be a singer.'' 
 Mostly to please her parents, Keineg went to the London School of Economics and earned an undergraduate law degree. But as soon as she finished college, she moved back to Cardiff to form a songwriting duo, to play at Sunday night open-mikes and to see if she could get some gigs of her own. Sending off her tapes, she was booked at the Glastonbury Festival, played the international music festival Womad and split her time between Cardiff and London until, having found an agent who managed to line up a month's worth of gigs for her in Dublin, she packed up all her belongings and moved to Ireland at 25.
 Keineg has lived in Dublin for the last 16 years, but though the city has had a vibrant musical scene for many years (U2, the Hothouse Flowers, Damien Rice), Keineg has stayed on the fringes of that community and used the city less as a home than as a base of operations for a musical life that regularly takes her to New York, Los Angeles, Cardiff, Brittany, London, Paris and beyond. ''I'm part of several communities, really, and so it's hard to choose between them,'' she said that day in her living room. ''My solution has been to move in this never-ending circuit, but that's kind of weird, too.'' She laughed, lifted her shoulders and brought her hands to her ears in a gesture of surrender. ''It's commitment-phobia, I'm afraid. One of my friends always says to me, 'Have you picked a continent yet?''' She looked off, a bit wistfully. ''I grew up between two countries, so I suppose duality is in my bones, but more and more I think that I travel too much. I mean, I'm always in transition. Honestly, I don't know what to do with myself when I'm not traveling. But another part of me craves the one place. Frankly, I'm a bit confused.''
 At the Sin-E Gig in the spring, Keineg was getting ready to play two songs in a group show that had drawn a noisy, capacity crowd. (The last time she played a group show in New York, the singer before her was chased off stage before his encore by an audience member yelling: ''Enough! Katell's here!'') When she opened with ''There You Go,'' it silenced the crowd and brought even the bartenders to a standstill. For her second offering, Keineg sang a medieval Breton drinking song. Perhaps five centuries ago, this song might have inspired boisterous thumping of wood-planked tables with mugs of ale. Keineg used it to evoke a different mood. Singing a cappella, thrumming the body of her guitar for accompaniment, she converted it into a kind of wild, guttural dirge. With her eyes half closed, her body nearly convulsing with the effort to produce the sounds of medieval Breton, she seemed to be wailing some ancient lament, channeling five centuries of sorrow.
 ''Have you read 'Technicians of the Sacred'?'' she asked me a few weeks later when I mentioned her performance of the song. Throughout the time I spent with Keineg, both in Dublin and New York, I noticed that whenever I asked about her songs, she'd refer me to a book: ''Music and the Mind,'' ''Technicians of the Sacred''; once, it was a study on the convergence of Cubism and Einstein's theory of relativity. ''Anyway, it's an anthology of poetry from preliterate societies. It's quite beautiful. A lot of it is incantatorial, like music.''
 We were sitting in the lobby lounge of the Algonquin Hotel. The next day, Keineg would be heading back to Dublin, and from there she wasn't quite sure -- maybe she'd stay in Ireland, maybe she'd move back to Wales or London. Still thinking about her performance of that medieval Breton song, I asked why her reticence didn't seem to interfere with the emotional openness of her writing and performing.
 ''Well, I guess it is a bit weird, getting up onstage and emoting -- not that my songs are autobiographical!'' she cried, holding her palms out. ''But at a gig, the exposure, the emotion, is through the conduit of a song. And, most important, it's not just me; there's an audience participating; we're all there in the room together. That's where the contact is. That's where the religious element is.'' 
 ''What does that mean, 'the religious element'?'' 
 Keineg screwed up her face and tugged at her hair. ''Oh, God, it's impossible to talk about this without sounding completely New Age, you know?'' She drew in a breath. ''O.K., well, it's something beyond words, really. It's about altered states. For me, a great gig is one where, when it's over, I'm elated but I can't recollect any of the details. And hopefully it's a two-way thing: if I'm there and present and open -- deeply absorbed, that is -- then others will be, too. It's all about the communal presence.'' 
 ''So is that the function of your music -- to create a communal presence?'' 
 She smiled and paused, seeming to measure out her words in advance. ''Oh, God, this will sound terrible, and I'm sure I'll regret saying it -- I guess the whole Dylan thing's never going to work now! -- but I guess the function of my music is.. . .'' She looked down and covered her face with her hands. Then she looked back up and said, ''Well, I guess its function is to transcend loneliness.''
 Whose, I asked, hers or the audience's?
 ''Both, really. I mean, loneliness is the great disease of our society, isn't it? Western capitalist society is so atomized, so fragmented; it's all about the individual.'' Her eyes were wide, and she was tapping the tabletop with her finger. ''And as a result we're sinking into a deeper and deeper state of anomie. But that goes against our social natures. We're apes. We're made to live in groups, to live collectively.''
 She took a sip from her drink and, finding herself perhaps beyond where she'd intended to go, plunged ahead. ''I remember when I was 11, my stepfather had a 45 of 'Eleanor Rigby.''' She laughed at the memory and talked right through it: ''I listened to that song over and over. I was utterly fascinated, I kept picturing Father McKenzie and Eleanor Rigby, these two desperately lonely people, which is a bit strange, if you think about it, for an 11-year-old. That was the year I got my guitar, and the first song I wrote was an hommage to 'Eleanor Rigby.' I called it 'All the Lonely People.'''
 At the Algonquin, music had been playing in the background, and suddenly Keineg looked up. ''Oh, God, I love this song! It's Etta James's 'At Last.' It's just so beautiful.
 ''Anyway,'' she went on, leaning forward, ''it's like those gigs my parents used to organize in Brittany. Alan Stivell -- he'd come and perform rock versions of traditional Breton songs, and you'd see literally thousands of people -- all of them chain-dancing, all of them linking arms and dancing the same steps.'' Her eyes were shining, and she held her hands up, conjuring the scene. ''It was completely exhilarating. And at end of the night, the kids' job was to go around and stack the metalchairs.'' She smiled and placed her hands, one on top of the other. ''I just loved to stack those chairs.''

HEADLINE: For Older Americans, Money Advice Is Just a Start

BYLINE: By STACIE Z. BERG

 BODY:
DON W. NICHOLSON SR., a certified financial planner in Wilmington, Del., once shopped for rubber-soled shoes for an elderly client to help her walk without slipping on the wood floors of her own home. He drove another woman to Bible study, and escorted a third to buy a car.
 Mr. Nicholson, 59, is a financial gerontologist -- a new breed of financial planner who caters to the elderly with services that may go far beyond portfolio management and estate planning. ''If all we focused in on is finances and how to make money,'' he said, ''then we're only doing half the job.''
Taking care of the finances of older Americans is a huge and potentially lucrative field, and the market is growing. As of July 2004, according to the Census Bureau, 36.3 million Americans were 65 and older. That number is expected to reach 86.7 million by 2050. In a 2004 report, the Investment Company Institute, which represents the mutual fund industry, found that fund shareholders born in 1945 and earlier had mutual fund portfolios worth an average of $247,400. 
 The wealth of some older Americans, of course, is enormous. Attracted by this market, many financial planners have shifted their focus to it -- and bring widely varying attitudes and professional training to the consultation table. Training and certification in financial gerontology is now being offered by at least four groups.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission does not regulate these groups -- or any other groups that provide financial planning certification, for that matter. ''The S.E.C. does not endorse any professional designation,'' said Susan Wyderko, director of the office of investor education of the S.E.C. 
 The absence of government supervision is a problem, said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. ''There's an opportunity for fraud,'' he said, adding that older people need to be very careful about whom they trust for advice.
 Financial planners disagree about the usefulness of this specialized training, on the importance of providing nontraditional services for the elderly and even on basic approaches to investing.
 Mr. Nicholson, for example, who helped found the Delaware Valley chapter of the Alzheimer's Association after his mother died of the disease in 1980, doesn't have certification in financial gerontology and doesn't believe it would be useful, at least not for him. ''I've been in business 36 years and I could teach the courses,'' he said. 
 He believes strongly in the importance of providing services for the elderly outside the traditional bounds of financial planning. ''The industry is so insensitive to individuals,'' he said. It's important to build trust by talking to clients about ''who they are and what they want,'' he said, and then helping them achieve their goals, calling in a geriatric care manager and other appropriate professionals when his clients need them.
 On the other hand, Shane M. Chavez, 35, a certified financial planner in Denver, holds a certificate in financial gerontology -- he earned the Chartered Advisor for Senior Living designation -- but does not provide nontraditional services to clients. Fundamentally, he said, such services are a form of ''client-relationship building.''
 ''I'm pretty busy, so I don't do a lot of that stuff,'' he said. Instead, he said he builds trust by educating his clients and by ''being a resource to them,'' relying, in part, on what he learned in the training program. ''A lot of it is about preservation of assets,'' he said, so that people don't exhaust their money prematurely.
 Not every planner takes his approach. Kathleen Lenover, who is also a certified financial planner in Denver, holds a Certified Senior Advisor certificate, another professional gerontology designation. She says that many older people are so fearful of tapping savings that they aren't living comfortably, so she gives them ''permission to spend their savings, shifting their attitude from frugality to prosperity.''
 ''I raise their conscious level about their old thinking, and I invite them to embrace the new way,'' she said. Ms. Lenover said she used software to project the probability of various financial outcomes for her clients. ''We can make them and their money run out at the same time,'' she said. If clients want to leave a legacy for their heirs, she said, she can help plan for that, too.
 Other certifications include Registered Financial Gerontologist and Certified Retirement Financial Advisor. It takes more than a year to complete the requirements for the Chartered Advisor for Senior Living certificate -- the designation held by Mr. Chavez -- while the others can be earned in a few days. Training in all of the programs includes topics like long-term-care financing, ethics, taxes, estate planning, communications and marketing. 
 According to the organizations that grant these certificates, there are about 150 Registered Financial Gerontologists, 260 Certified Retirement Financial Advisors, 3,500 Certified Senior Advisors and 1,000 Chartered Advisor for Senior Living graduates now active in financial management. In addition, people in fields like health care and insurance sometimes hold these certificates. 
 Only a small fraction of the thousands of financial planners in the United States hold any of the gerontology certificates. For example, more than 50,000 people are certified financial planners, another professional designation. Certified financial planners are required to have three years of experience in facets of financial planning and must meet certain educational requirements and pass an examination. Beginning next year, a bachelor's degree will be required.
 Several granting organizations have programs to investigate complaints. The Society of Certified Senior Advisors, for example, has a board of standards for that purpose, said the society's president, Ed Pittock. Of 13,000 active certified members -- a figure that includes people working in fields other than financial management -- about 20 have had C.S.A. certifications revoked over the nine-year history of the organization, he said.
 Regardless of any planner's credentials, the S.E.C. and consumer organizations say the best approach is ''buyer beware.'' 
 Do due diligence, said Clare Hushbeck, an economist at AARP. Investing poorly ''can have many, many years of repercussions,'' she said. Older people who need help with nonfinancial issues may find assistance by contacting a local Area Agency on Aging. These are private, nonprofit organizations with community referral services. 
 Investors can learn how to check the background of a financial planner, including any disciplinary actions, at the S.E.C.'s Web site, www.sec.gov. Such background checks, along with a discussion about an adviser's approach to investing, are well advised before signing up with a planner. 
 ''We see too many investors who might have avoided trouble,'' Ms. Wyderko of the S.E.C. said, ''if they had asked basic questions right from the start.''

HEADLINE: On Lake Michigan, a Global Village 

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

DATELINE: RACINE, Wis. 

 BODY:
GARY BECKER, this city's mayor, remembers handing out fliers at local factory gates as a 10-year-old campaigner in Hubert H. Humphrey's ill-fated presidential bid in 1968. Mr. Becker, 48, is still a Democrat, but the factories and the traditional blue-collar jobs that filled the streets of his childhood are mostly gone, replaced by condominiums, restaurants and shops along Lake Michigan as well as an increasing number of service-sector jobs.
 As Racine has changed, so have its politics. Once, a ritual antagonism for business was a sure vote-getter among Democrats. But Mr. Becker was elected three years ago with a pro-development message, pledging to trim jobs from the public payroll to free resources to attract new residents and businesses.
Racine's future, Mr. Becker believes, lies in forging stronger links with the regional economy and global markets. Reinvention can be unnerving, he acknowledges, but he says it is his hometown's best shot at prosperity and progress. ''In the past, Racine was a self-contained economy,'' he said. ''But that is not an option anymore.'' 
 No local economy truly mirrors the nation. But for Racine and its surrounding suburbs, the last few years have been marked by gradually rising prosperity, in step with the national trend. And the recent history of Racine, like that of the nation as a whole, is also the story of how a community comes to grips with the larger forces of globalization and technological change. 
 This continuing transformation helps explain why the people of Racine, like people everywhere, often appear apprehensive about the seismic changes that surround them. In a world where new technologies can quickly upend an industry and China and India loom large on the economic horizon, nobody knows exactly which businesses and skills will prove to be winners.
 ''If you're not somewhat anxious, you don't understand,'' Mr. Becker said. ''And the businesses and people who are still here and doing well have sort of figured that out.'' For Mr. Becker, his neighbors and his constituents, figuring out the proper marriage of policymaking and personal choice to nurture a vibrant economy is a delicate task -- an uncertain balancing act that will determine Racine's destiny.
 IF there is such a thing as a median in a complex nation of vast distances and differences, the Racine metropolitan area is close. Home to a diverse population of 196,000, living in urban, suburban and some rural districts, it ranks near the middle of 379 metropolitan areas that Moody's Economy.com, a research group, tracks according to several statistical measures like income, job growth and increased housing values. 
 For better or worse, what is happening to the Racine area, and how the community is responding, offers a window to economic realities that resonate across the country. ''The Racine economy is very similar to the broader nation,'' said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com.
 Talk to people here about their personal finances and the usual subjects come up. Higher interest rates have cooled the local housing market, and higher gas prices mean fewer weekend fishing trips and second thoughts about owning a sport utility vehicle. Those same forces -- more expensive products and more costly loans -- have dampened consumer sentiment during the last year nationwide. The University of Michigan's index of consumer expectations slipped to 82.4 in June from 86.9 a year ago, but the current level is well above the mid-to-low 60's associated with an imminent downturn or recession. 
 So, for now, higher gas prices and interest rates seem to be only irritants for many people here. But they also represent worrying trends. ''Sure, I'm feeling the impact,'' said Willie Poole, 50, a factory worker. ''It costs me $75 to fill up the tank on my Chevy Tahoe now. But there's not much I can do about it.''
 Personal concerns like these, especially when they dovetail with a political campaign season, make it hard for politicians of all stripes to address voters' underlying fears about jobs, competitiveness and their place in the world. This may partially explain why the Bush administration and Republicans in general have not benefited more from a brisk economy that is adding jobs, while Democrats have been unable to build a message exploiting voter anxiety.
 ''The Democratic challenge is to tell a global economic story about the future that is credible and positive,'' said Robert B. Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, who was labor secretary in the Clinton administration. ''We haven't really done that.''
 Perhaps the national parties can look to Racine, where politics cuts right down the middle. Mr. Becker, the mayor, is a Democrat. The Congressional representative for Wisconsin's First District, which includes Racine County, is a Republican, Paul Ryan. In the last two presidential elections, George W. Bush won Racine County by razor-thin margins. Politics here tend to be pragmatic and cooperative, without deep ideological rifts between the parties. Mr. Ryan praises Mr. Becker as a ''business Democrat,'' while Mr. Becker says Mr. Ryan's track record and likeability all but ensure his re-election this fall.
 Political and business leaders consistently advise that the best course in an uncertain economy is a pragmatic blend of self-reliance and community support. To succeed, they say, companies and individuals must keep climbing the economic ladder to upgrade products, services and skills. But they also emphasize the importance of public investment in redevelopment projects, government training and education programs, and government courtship of new businesses.
 ''We have to be honest with people, delivering a kind of cold wake-up call about the need for change in a fast-shifting economy,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''But we also have to help produce a climate where people and companies can survive and thrive.''
 Across Racine, the appeal to self-reliance is heard, and seems to have sunk in. ''One of the things we try to do is prepare people for this new world of work, where you have to keep reinventing yourself and it's all about lifelong learning and being able to adapt,'' said Alice Oliver, head of the Racine County Workforce Development Center. 
 The development center offers remedial math, science and English training for high school dropouts as well as job placement assistance in the region for unemployed professionals. Ms. Oliver says local employment has gained steam in the last few years, with hiring spread among jobs like cashiers, nurses' aides, human resources professionals and engineers. In the last year alone, businesses in the county added 1,500 jobs.
 Ms. Oliver defines the development center's role as ''delivering services to the business community,'' an attitude that reflects the increasingly close cooperation between government and business here. And Ms. Oliver, 48, is pursuing further education herself. Her Saturdays are spent at Marquette University in Milwaukee, where she is studying for a master's degree in public service leadership. ''You've got to practice what you preach,'' she said.
 Olatoye Baiyewu runs a program to train young, inner-city men as apprentices to electricians, plumbers, carpenters and cement masons. A Nigerian who came to the Midwest in the 1970's as an agricultural export broker, Mr. Baiyewu eventually shifted his career to training programs because, he said, ''we need to do a better job of exposing young African-American men to the opportunities of America.''
 Besides offering basic education on the construction trades,his six-week program requires his trainees to get a library card and to read books like ''Animal Farm'' and ''Silas Marner.'' Workplace etiquette and personal finance are part of the curriculum. His training program is run on a shoestring budget with support from the city and state governments and local foundations.
 Darnell Mason is a recent graduate. A 28-year-old father of three, he was originally steered toward Mr. Baiyewu's program from the local child support office. Mr. Mason, a high school graduate and a Navy veteran, seemed particularly impressed by the reading requirement. ''They were real books that spark your intellect and get you thinking,'' he said. ''In everyday society, all kinds of things are going to be thrown at you, so you have to be flexible, think things through and adapt.''
 Mr. Mason is now applying for jobs as an apprentice cement mason. The pay would start at about $14 an hour, plus benefits, and over three or four years could rise to $35 an hour -- a long way, Mr. Mason said, from his $7-an-hour warehouse jobs. 
 ''I got into this because I want a career, not just another job,'' he said. ''I'm 28 years old, I'm not getting any younger and I've got responsibilities.''
 With the region's construction businesses doing well, he has an excellent chance of being hired. Manufacturing jobs are a different story. Although manufacturing still accounts for more than 20 percent of the employment in the Racine metropolitan area, about twice the national figure of 11 percent, the number of local manufacturing jobs has been falling for years as companies failed or fled to lower-cost production sites in the South or overseas. 
 The Modine Manufacturing Company, for example, has its headquarters here, employs more than 700 people, pays $60 million in payroll taxes and buys $33 million in goods and services locally. Yet Modine, a big supplier of high-end radiators to companies like BMW and Caterpillar, and heat-transfer systems for computer data centers, does not manufacture in Racine anymore. Its facility here houses wind tunnels, workshops and clusters of white-coated scientists at computers doing thermal-imaging and climate simulations. 
 Stephen B. Memory, who holds a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, joined Modine as a researcher in 1997, having moved from Florida, where he was a professor at the University of Miami. His first visit to Racine was during a winter blizzard; his initial reaction, he recalled, was ''what a bleak place.'' Still, he and his family stayed, he won a promotion, and Racine became more attractive. The downtown area sprang back to life and the local economy is now on the upswing. Signs of changing times, he says, are all the new ethnic restaurants in town. ''It's a sure indicator of the shift from blue collar to white collar,'' he said.
 STANDING as proof that innovative manufacturers can still flourish here is S. C. Johnson & Son, the maker of Windex, Pledge and other household products. The company, which is family-owned, has plants worldwide, but the largest, known as Waxdale, is about five miles west of downtown Racine. Waxdale covers an area the equivalent of 36 football fields and employs 1,200 people. Since the late 1990's, the plant's production has jumped more than 40 percent, but the size of its work force has remained the same. 
 ''It's highly automated, highly competitive and works great for us,'' said H. Fisk Johnson, chief executive of S. C. Johnson. 
 Mr. Poole started working at Waxdale nearly three decades ago on the loading docks, and he marvels at how much things have changed. For one thing, machinery has supplanted much of the manual labor at the plant, as his own history shows. He has become proficient in a new, computerized warehouse management system, which he mastered after a six-month training course. To help maximize efficiency, he works closely with planners, production-line leaders and others to refine inventory and manufacturing flows, notifying his team with instructions he transmits wirelessly from his computer to forklifts on the factory floor. Skilled jobs like his pay well, typically $60,000 a year or more. 
 Technology has also changed the terms of trade for many small, local companies. Herbert Katt, 45, a building contractor, started his business in 1989 from his garage when his versions of information processing tools were a phone, a fax machine and a typewriter. Today, Mr. Katt uses software to continually update blueprints and plans, which he then shares with clients and architects via e-mail attachments. Digital photographs, also sent by e-mail, keep everyone up to date on how work is progressing. He uses project management software and e-mail to coordinate the work of subcontractors and shipments from suppliers.
 Mr. Katt bids on projects like schools, warehouses and downtown renovations, and the competition is often complex and fast-paced. In their small office, he and a colleague work at computers juggling Excel spreadsheets, bid proposals, blueprints and Web searches, while negotiating over the phone. Each workstation has two flat-panel screens -- a setup once used only by those at the leading edge of technology adoption, like computer scientists and Wall Street analysts. Technology has quickened the pace of his work and improved quality, Mr. Katt said; he catches mistakes before building begins, while other changes that once took days to work through with a client can be handled in hours. ''It's a different world now, much faster,'' he noted.
 Mr. Katt's business suffered as manufacturers closed or moved away. But things have picked up in the last two years, he says, helped by a lot of work renovating storefronts and public squares downtown. His business now employs 12 people, up from 8 in 2004. And he wants to hire a couple more skilled craftsmen.
 Technology and economic change have caused the tides to shift on the political front as well. And Mr. Becker's hope is that Racine will become a more prosperous community straddling a residential, industrial and service corridor along Lake Michigan, within commuting distance of both Milwaukee to the north and Chicago to the south -- a diverse, balanced local economy. Help toward that goal should come from a planned 32-mile extension to a commuter railway, underwritten with public funds, that will link Racine to Milwaukee and Chicago. It is expected to be completed in the next few years. Racine is prepared, having already completed a $1.4 million station. Projects like this, Mr. Becker said, are crucial if Racine wants to forge stronger links with the regional economy and global markets.
 He says that even with the successful public investments Racine has made, luring new businesses has been a challenge. The unemployment rate in Racine County is declining, though at 5.6 percent it is above the national rate of 4.6 percent. In the city itself, unemployment hovers at about 9 percent. Parts of Racine are pocked with former factory sites, known as brownfields, which can take years to refurbish to meet strict environmental standards and to equip with new roads and utilities. 
 A corporate vote of confidence came in May when private developers announced plans to build the $200 million Pointe Blue, which will include more than 500 condominiums and apartments, green space and parks. The project will be situated along Racine's waterfront, on land where an auto parts plant once stood.
 The lead developer on the project is the KeyBridge Development Group. The company's president, Scott C. Fergus, was born and raised in Racine. KeyBridge, based in Waukesha, Wis., has focused on development projects in Milwaukee and Madison. But Mr. Fergus says he has been impressed by Racine's efforts to integrate with the wider economy, in the region and beyond.
 ''Racine is beginning to thrive because it is looking outward,'' he said. ''That's why I'm coming back.''

HEADLINE: Does This Goo Make You Groan?

BYLINE: By MELANIE WARNER

 BODY:
EVERY time Marie Cabrera goes shopping, she brings along her mental checklist of things to avoid. It includes products with artery-clogging trans fats, cholesterol-inducing saturated fats, MSG and the bogeyman du jour, high-fructose corn syrup. That last one, she says, is the hardest to avoid unless she happens to be shopping in the small natural-foods section of her supermarket.
 As she pushed her shopping cart down an aisle of the Super Stop & Shop near her hometown of Warren, R.I., recently, Ms. Cabrera, a retired schoolteacher, offered her thoughts on why she steers clear of high-fructose corn syrup: ''It's been linked to obesity, and it's just not something that's natural or good for you.''
This is the perception that many consumers have of the syrup, a synthetic sweetener that has replaced plain old sugar and become a ubiquitous ingredient in American processed foods. High-fructose corn syrup provides the sweet zing in everything from Coke, Pepsi and Snapple iced tea to Dannon yogurt and Chips Ahoy cookies. It also lurks in unexpected places, like Ritz crackers, Wonder bread, Wishbone ranch dressing and Campbell's tomato soup. 
 In the news media and on myriad Web sites, high-fructose corn syrup has been labeled ''the Devil's candy,'' a ''sinister invention,'' ''the crack of sweeteners'' and ''crud.'' Many scientific articles and news reports have noted that since 1980, obesity rates have climbed at a rate remarkably similar to that of high-fructose corn syrup consumption. A distant derivative of corn, the highly processed syrup was created in the late 1960's and has become a hard-to-avoid staple of the American diet over the last 25 years. It spooks foodies, parents and nutritionists alike. But is it really that bad?
 Many scientists say that there is little data to back up the demonization of high-fructose corn syrup, and that links between the crystalline goop and obesity are based upon misperceptions and unproved theories, or are simply coincidental. 
 ''There's no substantial evidence to support the idea that high-fructose corn syrup is somehow responsible for obesity,'' said Dr. Walter Willett, the chairman of the nutrition department of the Harvard School of Public Health and a prominent proponent of healthy diets. ''If there was no high-fructose corn syrup, I don't think we would see a change in anything important. I think there's this overreaction.''
 Dr. Willett says that he is not defending high-fructose corn syrup as a healthy ingredient, but that he simply thinks that the product is no worse than the refined white sugar it replaces, since both offer easily consumed calories with no nutrients in them. High fructose corn syrup's possible link to obesity is the only specific health problem that the ingredient's critics have cited to date -- and experts say they believe that this link is tenuous, at best.
 Even the two scientists who first propagated the idea of a unique link between high-fructose corn syrup and America's soaring obesity rates have gently backed off from their initial theories. Barry M. Popkin, a nutrition professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says that a widely read paper on the subject that he wrote in 2004 with George A. Bray, a professor of medicine at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., was just meant to be a ''suggestion'' that would inspire further study.
 ''It was a theory meant to spur science, but it's quite possible that it may be found out not to be true,'' Professor Popkin said. ''I don't think there should be a perception that high-fructose corn syrup has caused obesity until we know more.''
 Professor Popkin says that he and Professor Bray both decided not to raise the issue of high-fructose corn syrup for a beverage panel that they and four other scientists formed last year at the University of North Carolina. The panel was convened to provide clear guidelines to consumers about the nutritional risks and benefits of various beverages.
 Rather than single out high-fructose corn syrup for derision, the panel focused on the proliferation of beverages with added sugars, regardless of what sweetener was used. Those beverages, the panel said, should be consumed at the lowest possible level, no more than eight ounces a day. ''We felt there were much bigger issues and it would be a distraction,'' Professor Popkin said of high-fructose corn syrup.
 AS America's obesity problem has evolved into a major public health concern over the last five years, singling out high-fructose corn syrup as a singular culprit reflects, perhaps, society's early response to a vexingly complex issue. Scientists say part of the confusion about the ingredient's role in the nutrition debate stems from a basic misunderstanding: the idea that high-fructose corn syrup is actually high in fructose.
 Studies have shown that the human body metabolizes fructose, the sweetest of the natural sugars, in a way that may promote weight gain. Specifically, fructose does not prompt the production of certain hormones that help regulate appetite and fat storage, and it produces elevated levels of triglycerides that researchers have linked to an increased risk of heart disease.
 But the name ''high-fructose corn syrup'' is something of a misnomer. It is high only in relation to regular corn syrup, not to sugar. The version of high-fructose corn syrup used in sodas and other sweetened drinks consists of 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose, very similar to white sugar, which is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose. The form of high-fructose corn syrup used in other products like breads, jams and yogurt -- 42 percent fructose and 58 percent glucose -- is actually lower in fructose than white sugar.
 Even if high-fructose corn syrup is no worse than sugar, it may never be popular with consumers like Ms. Cabrera who routinely seek out natural and organic foods. Most manufacturers of natural products shun the syrup, in part because many of them consider it an artificial ingredient. Among natural-foods enthusiasts and many nutritionists, there is a belief that the foods humans have been consuming for hundreds or even thousands of years are better handled by our bodies than many of the modern and chemically derived concoctions introduced into the food supply in the last 60 or so years. 
 Among producers of organic products, there is a similar prohibition against high fructose corn syrup in favor of regular sugar, although one ingredient company, Marroquin International of Santa Cruz, Calif., sells organic high-fructose corn syrup. 
 Michael F. Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group that often criticizes the food industry, says that unlike sugar molecules, which reside in the stalks of sugar cane or the beets that are used to make sugar, high-fructose corn syrup is artificial because it is not found anywhere in corn.
 ''You're causing a change in the molecular structure, and that shouldn't be considered natural,'' he said, adding, however, that he never supported the notion that high-fructose corn syrup was a unique contributor to obesity.
 Produced in large manufacturing facilities scattered mostly across the flat, golden expanse of the American corn belt, high-fructose corn syrup is not a product that anyone could cook up at home using a few ears of corn. The process starts with corn kernels and takes place in a series of stainless steel vats and tubes in which a dozen different mechanical processes and chemical reactions occur -- including several rounds of high-velocity spinning and the introduction of three different enzymes to incite molecular rearrangements. 
 The enzymes turn most of the glucose molecules in corn into fructose, which makes the substance sweeter. This 90 percent fructose syrup mixture is then combined with regular corn syrup, which is 100 percent glucose molecules, to get the right percentage of fructose and glucose. The final product is a clear, goopy liquid that is roughly as sweet as sugar.
 The major manufacturers of high-fructose corn syrup -- the farm giants Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and Corn Products International and the ingredients company Tate & Lyle -- say that their product is natural because it is made from plain old corn (though some of it is genetically modified) and contains no synthetic materials or color or flavor additives.
 The Food and Drug Administration has never established rules on what, exactly, ''natural'' means, allowing companies to pitch products as natural even if they contain high-fructose corn syrup. Cadbury Schweppes recently began promoting 7-Up, which is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, as ''100 percent natural.'' Capri Sun fruit-flavored drinks from Kraft are also promoted as all-natural, although they, too, are sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. Cadbury and Kraft both say they believe that high-fructose corn syrup is natural because it is made from corn.
 Sugar is considered natural because there are no chemical processes involved in its production and no molecular changes occur as it is processed. The Sugar Association, which represents sugar growers and producers, filed a petition in February with the Food and Drug Administration asking the agency to define ''natural,'' but the association says the agency has not yet responded.
 THE modern supermarket, of course, is stocked with artificial additives and the highly processed products of modern food science, most of them unknown outside of food technology circles. Still, even with this cacophony of indecipherable, hard-to-pronounce ingredients, few have been singled out for the scorn heaped upon high-fructose corn syrup. 
 Yoshiyuki Takasaki, a scientist, patented high-fructose corn syrup in 1971 while working for a government-affiliated laboratory in Japan. But it wasn't until 2001, shortly after the United States surgeon general issued a landmark report on obesity, that the brouhaha over the substance began. Warning that America's expanding waistline could reverse many health gains achieved in recent decades, the report prompted new research into the causes of obesity.
 Professor Bray of the Pennington research center -- a lean, bespectacled man who had spent much of his career studying obesity and diabetes -- said he had been pondering the obesity problem for several years when, in early 2002, he had a sudden insight. Charting federal data on the consumption of high-fructose corn syrup against data on obesity rates, he found amazing parallels between his two graphs.
 Starting in 1980, around the time that manufacturers started replacing sugar in sodas with a more cheaply produced sweetener -- high-fructose corn syrup -- there was a sharp increase in male and female obesity in the United States. From 1980 to 2000, the incidence of obesity doubled, after having remained relatively flat for the preceding 20 years, the data showed. Could high-fructose corn syrup be making us fat, Professor Bray wondered? After all, according to his analysis of government consumption data, per capita intake of the syrup had increased by more than 1,000 percent from 1970 to 1990, exceeding the changes in the intake of any other food group tracked by the Department of Agriculture. 
 Professor Bray's theory received enormous attention when he teamed up with Professor Popkin to publish the idea in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in April 2004. Around the same time, a breezy and provocative book about America's obesity problem, ''Fat Land'' by Greg Critser, generated more awareness of high-fructose corn syrup. Mr. Critser proposed that the syrup made consumers fat because it was so cheap, and thus food makers could afford to offer more products with it and more copious portions. 
 Manufacturers had always been able to buy the sweetener at prices 20 percent to 70 percent less than those of sugar. In a 1983 article in Fortune magazine, one beverage analyst estimated that by switching to high-fructose corn syrup, Coca-Cola gained a cost advantage over Pepsi and its bottlers of $70 million a year. A year later, Pepsi followed in Coke's footsteps and also began using the sweetener. Mr. Critser argued that the cost savings allowed soft-drink companies to create larger sizes that were only marginally more expensive, thus propelling people to drink more soda. It also freed up extra marketing money, he said. ''High-fructose corn syrup really allowed companies to transform their brands and to become some of the biggest brands in the world,'' Mr. Critser said in a recent interview.
 There is little question that after beverage companies began adding high-fructose corn syrup into soda in the early 1980's, soft-drink consumption soared. From 1980 to 2000, per-person consumption of sweetened soda rose by 40 percent, to 440 12-ounce cans a year, according to the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service. During roughly the same period, the inflation-adjusted price of soda declined by about one-third, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. 
 Also in the 1980's, supersizing began in earnest. In 1983, for example, 7-Eleven rolled out its 44-ounce soda and, in 1988, the huge 64-ounce. And McDonald's began supersizing its drinks in the late 80's. But whether all of this would have happened anyway, even if sodas still were sweetened with pricier sugar, is hard to say, according to analysts.
 John Sicher, publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest, says he thinks that the lower cost of soda today, versus 20 years ago, is attributable largely to the advent of bigger packaging, which lowers distribution and manufacturing costs. He cited several reasons for soda's dominant presence in the American diet: ''I think that the higher consumption of soft drinks today is more about the increased prevalence of product,'' he said. ''It's the growth of fast-food restaurants, much more availability in supermarkets, the growth of convenience stores with coolers in them and a huge build-out of new vending machines in the 1990's. I don't think it has anything to do with high-fructose corn syrup.''
 Dave DeCecco, a spokesman for Pepsi, says the company's decisions over the years about package and portion sizes were based on the changing desires of consumers -- and had nothing to do with the price of high-fructose corn syrup. ''The cost of the sweetener in the product is extremely minimal to the point of not even mattering,'' he said. 
 Mr. Critser, the author of ''Fat Land,'' says that John Peters, a scientist at Procter & Gamble and a founder of America on the Move, a foundation devoted to obesity prevention, was the first person to get him thinking about a link between the cheap cost of high-fructose corn syrup and obesity.
 Reached three weeks ago at his office at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, Mr. Peters said the idea was ''just a hypothesis, without any data to back it up.'' Asked if he thought that high-fructose corn syrup had played a unique role in America's obesity problem, he said, ''I don't think we know.'' 
 Few scientists and nutritionists are willing to believe that the small amount of additional fructose in high-fructose corn syrup, as opposed to sugar, makes a difference in people's weight. Dr. Peter J. Havel, an endocrinology researcher in the department of nutrition at the University of California, Davis, said he did not think that the replacement of sugar, or sucrose, with high-fructose corn syrup in the food supply was, by itself, responsible for the increase of obesity in the population.
 ''I don't think it is likely that things would be very different if people consumed increased amounts of either sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup,'' he said in an interview. ''Overconsumption of either sweetener, along with dietary fat and decreased physical activity, could contribute to weight gain.''
 THE recent backlash against the ingredient, which has enjoyed more than 20 years of uninterrupted sales growth, has caused its corporate sponsors to take notice. Audrae Erickson, president of the Corn Refiners Association, a trade group in Washington that represents the biggest makers of high-fructose corn syrup, put up a Web site, HFCSFacts.com, three years ago to blunt criticism of the sweetener. The site includes information about the amount of fructose in the syrup and charts showing sharp increases in obesity in countries that use very little of the liquid. (Outside of Canada, the United States is the only country with a significant consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, largely because other countries have erected successful trade barriers to protect sugar.)
 But Ms. Erickson says her arguments that high-fructose corn syrup is a safe ingredient have gained little traction. She says her trade group recently entertained the idea of changing the sweetener's name. ''It really does have this negative connotation,'' she said.
 Manufacturers of high-fructose corn syrup, however, may have more than an image problem to deal with. Annual per capita consumption of the sweetener is down 7 percent, to 59.2 pounds in 2005, from its peak of 63.7 pounds in 1999, according to the Agriculture Department. Ms. Erickson says that this is attributable less to the negative perceptions of high-fructose corn syrup than to the popularity of drinks with fewer calories, such as diet soda, bottled water and sports drinks. Annual per capita consumption of refined sugar has also declined, falling 4 percent from 1999 to 63.4 pounds, in 2005.
 All of which suits Ms. Cabrera just fine. Regardless of what experts say about high-fructose corn syrup, she says she will still try to avoid it. But now, after learning that many experts say the substance is handled no differently in the body than sugar, she says that she will probably let some products with high-fructose corn syrup slide. 
 ''I guess I don't need to be so hard-core about it,'' she said.

(pg. 1) Chart/Diagram: ''Creating a Ubiquitous Sweetener''Corn syrup is found in many food products, including ''all-natural products.'' Though demonized by many as a leading cause of obesity in the United States, evidence suggests that it may be no different than the refined sugar it often replaces. Although the components of high-fructose corn syrup occur naturally in foods, it takes a number of mechanical and chemical processes to turn corn into it.Corn to Cornstarch A corn kernel is roughly 80% starch. The extraction of its starch is largely a mechanical process.Preparing corn for processing -- Dry kernels are cleaned and then steeped in water. Once softened, the corn is coarsely ground to break apart the germ.Separating corn's components -- After a cyclone separator removes the corn's oil-rich germ, fine grinding releases starch from the fiber, which is then caught in screens. A centrifuge separates the gluten (protein) from the starch.Purification and preparation -- The starch is further purified and hydrated for processing.Diagram highlights the aforementioned process.Cornstarch to High-Fructose Corn SyrupCornstarch is a complex carbohydrate composed of very long chains of glucose sugars. Chemical processing is needed to convert the starch to fructose and glucose, the main components of high-fructose corn syrup.Processing with enzymes -- The hydrated cornstarch goes through three enzyme processes that break down the long chains of starch into simple glucose. The last enzyme changes some of the glucose into fructose, making 42% high-fructose corn syrup.Separation and blending -- The fructose is separated from the glucose. Blending the two creates a 55% fructose solution.HFCS-42SWEETENER FOR PROCESSED FOODS42% fructose, 53% glucoseHFCS-55SWEETENER FOR SOFT DRINKS55% fructose, 42% glucoseDiagram highlights the aforementioned process.(Sources by Corn Refiners Association

HEADLINE: The Economy May Be Global, But Not Languages or Culture

BYLINE: By DAVID KOEPPEL

 BODY:
Precision, skill and a tendency toward perfection are what earned the Swiss watchmaker Vincent Roberts a customer service job with the luxury jeweler Harry Winston in New York.
 So it came as something of a shock to Mr. Roberts, a French-speaking 28-year-old, when his craftsmanship was overshadowed by an inability to communicate effectively with his boss and colleagues.
Before Mr. Roberts moved from Geneva to New York in 2004, he took English classes in London; conversationally, they served him well. But when he entered the American workplace, he discovered that he was unprepared for the language of work -- the industry's technical jargon and lexicon. 
 ''I was thrown in here by myself, and it was difficult to make myself clear,'' he recalled. ''I was very limited in the language when it came to technical words and expressions. It was not easy to confront someone or defend my decisions. I had few resources, and I felt like a failure. It was frustrating, and I ended up letting people walk all over me.'' 
 Many recent and not-so-recent immigrants can sympathize with that sinking feeling. Language barriers and cultural chasms both large and small are more predominant as the workplace becomes increasingly multicultural and a global economy requires increased interaction with foreign-born bosses, subordinates and co-workers. 
 Culture clashes and language barriers can sometimes result in miscommunication and conflict and, in some cases, formal complaints and lawsuits, workplace experts say. 
 In 2005, foreign-born workers accounted for about 15 percent of the civilian work force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since 2000, the foreign-born have accounted for 46 percent of the total gain in the labor force. 
 Mr. Roberts, for one, says he was ''forced to adjust'' or risk losing his job. His command of English improved in the first year, and he admitted to letting go of his ''Swiss behavior.'' To Mr. Roberts, that meant becoming less obsessive about ''tiny scratches'' while still upholding the company's high standards. 
 While Mr. Roberts said he felt alone in his job, some new immigrants find comfort by working alongside others from their home country, or even family members. At an upscale Brooklyn restaurant, Maricarmen Lopez, 25, born in Mexico, buses tables alongside her husband, brother-in-law and stepfather, who have kitchen and delivery jobs. 
 After working at the restaurant for just over a year, Ms. Lopez has developed a better command of English, but is still easily confounded by customer requests. 
 ''I still get confused sometimes,'' she said. ''If I don't know what something is, I ask a waitress to explain it to me. Sometimes I have to ask a customer to repeat what they've said. I'm afraid to make a mistake.'' 
 Suzanne Stillenger is the restaurant manager who hired Ms. Lopez and admires the fierce work ethic of the predominantly Latin American kitchen staff, even though the pay is low and there is no vacation or health plan. 
 Ms. Stillenger is not fluent in Spanish but said there had always been enough bilingual workers to maintain functional communications. Still, some things get lost in translation. Two well-regarded Mexican chefs found it difficult to accept Ms. Stillenger as their supervisor, and what they regarded as playful banter she considered unwanted verbal harassment.
 Some of their banter, she said, translated into sexual innuendo. After years of being warned to stop, the chefs were finally fired. 
 ''I'm not easily offended,'' she said. ''General banter is not a big deal. But translated, what they were saying was pretty raunchy. I said, 'I hope someone says that to your daughter someday so you know how it feels,' and the response was, 'I hope so too, she's a beautiful girl.' '' 
 Just such confrontations are what diversity consultants and organizational experts want to avoid. Consultants for MeridianEaton Global, a consulting company based in San Francisco that specializes in diversity training, say that in recent years clients have started hiring them before a multicultural team or workplace becomes dysfunctional. 
 ''In earlier interactions, it was about how to fix foreigners to fit us,'' said Pamela L. Leri, the company's New York-based director of global outsourcing. 
 Ms. Leri has discovered that foreign-born executives are often baffled by American expressions like ''Let's hit the ground running'' or ''Let's wing it.'' Europeans, Latin Americans and Asians, she said, often perceive such phrases as ''unnecessarily risk-oriented.''
 Anita Zanchettin, the company's Chicago-based director of global inclusion, provides diversity training and consulting for corporations and executives. She advises American executives to avoid using slang, to slow down the pace of conversation and to check frequently to make sure foreign-born business partners, colleagues and employees comprehend what is being said. 
 They advise executives to be sensitive to the needs of ''face saving'' cultures like China and India, where people are taught not to speak out in front of managers. 
 Benjamin Dattner, the principal of Dattner Consulting, an organizational and research firm based in New York, says foreign-born workers who are ''culturally reluctant to share'' often irritate American employers, who may misinterpret the silence as lack of interest or belligerence. 
 But even with an apparent increase in diversity training, lawsuits based on national origin are still a staple of labor law, said Lawrence Z. Lorber, a lawyer specializing in labor and employment law at Proskauer Rose in Washington. At the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, private-sector complaints, which include charges of discrimination by national origin, language or accent, rose 8 percent from 1992 to 2005, to 8,035 complaints, from 7,434. Such complaints accounted for 11 percent of the cases filed in 2005, half of those by Hispanics.
 ''These kinds of lawsuits rip things apart,'' said Mr. Lorber, whose firm represents corporate defendants and, like the employment commission, usually settles such cases before they go to trial. ''It's like Humpty Dumpty; once it's broke it can't be put back together.'' 
 Belen Lopez-Garrido, 32, a Spanish-born television producer, enjoys New York's professional corporate culture but at first was taken aback by the city's fast pace and her blunt-speaking colleagues. 
 ''American workers are totally wired, 100 percent of the day,'' she said. ''I don't think wired translates into being more effective. I think Americans see Europeans as being lazier, not taking their work as seriously. Just because there's a different attitude doesn't mean we're not as serious.''

HEADLINE: Haves and Have-Nots by the Sea

BYLINE: By Daniel Wolff. 
Daniel Wolff is the author, most recently, of ''Fourth of July, Asbury Park: A History of the Promised Land.''

DATELINE: Nyack, N.Y. 

 BODY:
THIS Fourth of July on the Jersey shore, fireworks will bloom over a little city called Asbury Park, as they have for more than 130 years. The rockets' red glare will show whole blocks in ruins, as if they had been bombed or washed away. And here and there, between the rotting casino and the welfare motels, you will be able to make out the vague outline of new luxury condos rising, of restaurants bustling with valet parking. It's an all-American landscape. In a nation that's taken to measuring its economic health by the number of housing starts, Asbury bears all the marks of a city that's coming back. But as what? And for whom?
 Those questions have echoed throughout Asbury Park's history. Back in 1870, the city's founder, James Bradley, a New York industrialist, set out to create a residential resort that was a ''moral community.'' A strict Methodist, Bradley dotted his beachfront with hand-painted signs calling for ''modesty of apparel.'' He ran beer wagons out of town to make sure Asbury stayed dry. And he argued for keeping ''coloreds'' off the beach. 
Bradley claimed to have nothing against ''colored people.'' But his resort catered to a certain class of tourist. If he allowed the races to mingle, it wouldn't do ''justice,'' as he wrote, ''to the huge amount of capital invested in Asbury Park.'' For him, it wasn't an issue of prejudice; it was just good business sense. Why, the same would apply to Italian ditch-diggers. Bradley was against what he called ''all nuisances white or black.''
 The novelist Stephen Crane grew up in Bradley's city, rebelling against his widowed mother's own fervent brand of Methodism. Crane believed Asbury's ''elementary sanity'' would lead to a particular kind of American ruin: a ''mental death.'' To thrive, Crane thought, democracy needed the lively, honky-tonk mix he saw on July 4, 1888: ''It was almost impossible to move. Baby carriages made confusion; babies made noise; likewise the torpedoes and firecrackers, rockets, candles and toy pistols. The Pier was alive with people.'' 
 Bradley's vision won out. He built what today we would call a service economy, with a gated community on the city's east side. ''Asbury Park creates nothing,'' as Crane put it, explaining how out of place working people looked in the resort town. ''It does not make; it merely amuses.'' 
 Inland, across the tracks and out of sight, lived the black cleaning women, the Italian laborers, the Jewish merchants who made the city work.
 As it turned out, an economy based on exclusivity functioned in fits and starts -- and only for some. It was the developers and the city officials who got rich. From the powerful influence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920's through the race riots that leveled the West Side on the weekend of July 4, 1970, the city's divisions only grew. By the time Bruce Springsteen was using the imagery of Asbury's boardwalk to sing about ''the runaway American dream,'' middle-class whites had mostly fled to the suburbs. The 2000 census found three-quarters of Asbury's roughly 17,000 residents were members of minority groups, and 30 percent of its citizens lived in poverty. It had become a miniature, seaside version of inner cities across the nation. 
 Today, Asbury is betting its future on high-end development. It plans to secure its beachfront with more than 3,000 luxury condos. The Palace Amusements park has been torn down and in its place are town houses advertising ''secure garages.'' There's a $1.5 billion plan to remake the boardwalk as a retail and entertainment complex that, according to Asbury Park development literature, will ''preserve the area's historic character.'' 
 As Asbury Park celebrates its past, it hopes not to repeat it. But the assumption is that the beachfront will have to cater to those who can afford million-dollar apartments. That's just good business sense. And it's not clear how the anticipated flow of revenue is supposed to reach inland to the empty blocks of the West Side. Can a city determined to do justice to capital also do justice to the people who live there today? Or are they, in the new Asbury Park, the same old nuisance?
 ''Rise up,'' Bruce Springsteen calls out in his most recent song about Asbury, ''My City of Ruins.'' After 9/11, the lyrics took on new meaning. And as he sang it in New Orleans this spring, the crowd swayed and wept in recognition. The questions at the heart of the Asbury Park story are as old as Independence Day, as familiar as fireworks. How do we build a nation with liberty and justice for all?

HEADLINE: Paradise Bought

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
WHEN Irena Medavoy decided to build her dream home, on two flat acres above Beverly Hills, one thing was really important. ''I wanted it warm, cozy, informal,'' she said, before demonstrating how the living room converts into a screening room. At the push of a button, a 20-foot-wide screen descended from the ceiling and three huge speakers rose from beneath the wood parquet floor. At the other end of the room, a floor-to-ceiling bookcase sank -- Batcave-like -- revealing a projection room hidden behind it.
 By the standards of North Beverly Park, the gated community where Mrs. Medavoy and her husband, the Hollywood producer Mike Medavoy, live, their home -- 11,000 square feet in an East Coast traditional style -- actually is cozy.
 That's because other houses in this intensely private, security-obsessed community for Hollywood potentates, business tycoons and movie and sports stars are even larger, more on the order of small hotels: 20,000, 30,000 or, in a couple of cases, more than 40,000 square feet. When Eunice Kennedy Shriver visited the Medavoys during a reception for President Vicente Fox of Mexico, she said of their spread, ''I didn't even know they built houses like this anymore,'' her hostess recalled. 
 In an age of gilded real estate excess, massive homes are nothing new. Still, the scale of Beverly Park is striking, with one palacelike home next to another like a billionaires' Levittown. East Coast visitors often react with wonder-cum-horror at the neighborhood, while even in Hollywood's monied upper echelons, some consider Beverly Park to be too much.
 ''You won't find anywhere a concentration of such large homes,'' said Joyce Rey, who heads the estates division for Coldwell Banker on the West Side of Los Angeles. ''You'll find a large estate in Bel Air, or a few large estates. But you won't find a concentration of houses, and new houses, with such large square footage.'' 
 How did it happen? ''We've had a concentration of the rich getting richer, and that's really propelled the construction of these homes,'' she said. 
 But there's also the question of keeping up with the neighbors, when the neighbors are a Who's Who of show business elite. Eddie Murphy lives in a 45,000-square-foot Italianate compound (alone, apparently, since his divorce in April). Nearby are the homes of Barry Bonds, Reba McEntire, Rod Stewart, Sylvester Stallone, Denzel Washington, the Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone, the billionaire Haim Saban and Avi Arad, the recently retired Marvel chairman who is now a producer.
 What binds this group together is not so much work or leisure pursuits, but a baseline of stratospheric wealth or fame and a keen desire for privacy. In a city where paparazzi roam like packs of wild dogs, you will never see one in, or even near, Beverly Park, whose main entrance is hidden down a long road to a secure gatehouse off San Ysidro Drive. A second entrance is off Mulholland Drive, that winding road that traces the ridge above the wealthy West Side.
 In many ways, the neighborhood is a testament to the power of changed perspective, providing Los Angeles's micro-club of superrich and superfamous a place to feel normal. In a gated community like this, what may be too much to outsiders is validated by neighbors, whose own choices suggest that huge feels just right. 
 ''When you come here, you can see everyone creates his own environment,'' Mrs. Medavoy said. ''The Stallones' is very Italian. Denzel's is like a small Hotel du Cap. Jami Gertz has a Southern colonial.'' 
 Residents insist that their gated paradise is a real neighborhood and a true community, if a wealthy one, with Halloween shindigs for the kids, friendly movie screenings and dinner parties.
 ''This isn't Versailles, and I'm not Marie Antoinette,'' insisted Joyce Arad, who might have made the remark because her house, completed in 2003, is a three-story palace built in classical 18th-century French style. The kitchen has two vast stone islands with copper pots hanging around each of them, though Mrs. Arad confesses that she doesn't cook much. Outside is an elegant swimming pool designed to look like the reflecting pond of a chateau, along with several outdoor living areas, with fireplaces and fountains. ''I wanted it to be homey and authentic-feeling,'' she said.
 The culture of Beverly Park is secretive, even paranoid, and a couple of residents who gave interviews urged caution and begged anonymity, so as not to arouse the wrath of the homeowners' association. In the center of Beverly Park is an elaborate four-acre children's park, usually empty. Indeed, there are almost no people visible in Beverly Park, except for domestic workers, gardeners and construction workers, as building continues apace on the handful of remaining lots, watched only by the hidden security cameras that are everywhere. Mrs. Medavoy, who once disdained the impulse of the wealthy to hide behind gates, now says she wouldn't live anywhere else. ''There is nothing that compares to this in the world,'' she said. ''It would be like the Hamptons, gated.'' 
 Created 16 years ago, North Beverly Park began as a 250-acre swath of flat, empty scrub. A pair of developers divided the land into 64 lots of two acres, selling for $3.5 million to $6 million each (though they now go for much more). The location -- less than 10 minutes by car to Rodeo Drive -- along with the guarantees of privacy, were an immediate draw. The lots sold to Hollywood insiders and stars with big, big money, some of whom have bought additional lots to create compounds.
 Even Brian Adler, one of the two developers, has been surprised at the size of the homes. ''I purposely cut the lots so they would be two acres, level,'' he said in an interview. ''At that point I wasn't sure if people would be happiest at 12,000, 16,000 or 20,000 square feet. But with the economy doing as well as it has, people built bigger.''
 He went on: ''When you bring in your wish list -- a major gym, a major home theater, the wife wanting an office, the husband wanting an office -- and then frustration over not using the lot for a garage,'' you end up with massive homes. That, anyway, is how Mr. Adler ended up building a 10,000-square -foot underground garage in the last spec house he built in Beverly Park, a 35,000-square-foot mansion. The home sold in 2004 for $30 million, the largest sum yet paid for a home in Beverly Park. (He said he was barred from disclosing the identity of the buyer.) 
 Avi and Joyce Arad moved from Connecticut and landscaped their property not just with full-growth trees but with many tons of dirt to create a hillside for a Provencal-style garden. To the Arads, who made their first fortune from Mr. Arad's toy inventions, Beverly Park was an adjustment from the East Coast sensibility. But they too built a dream house to scale. 
 ''I was kind of shocked at first -- how big it is,'' said Mrs. Arad, a sculptor. ''But you get used to it. Now all the closets are full.''
 ''There is a real sense of community here,'' Mrs. Arad continued. ''We know our neighbors. We've had dinner with them: Sumner Redstone and Paul Reiser.'' 
 On a recent Friday, Mrs. Medavoy set the table for her weekly dinner and a movie, mostly for neighbors. That night's feature was ''The Break-Up'' with Jennifer Aniston, just out in theaters, which a messenger from Universal had just delivered in metal movie cans.
 Mrs. Medavoy screeched as she glanced at the delivery. '' 'United 93'?'' she said in horror. ''I have 20 people coming over -- Sumner, everybody --and they're expecting to see 'The Break-Up.' '' She ran after the delivery man, who checked his truck and found the comedy. All was well in the neighborhood. 
 There is, however, a dark side to Beverly Park, and Jeanette and Robert Bisno -- next-door neighbors of the Medavoys -- have glimpsed it. In 2002 the Bisnos were sued in Los Angeles Superior Court by the North Beverly Park Home Owners Association for infractions of the community's convenants. 
 What did the Bisnos do? One big problem was their overdone gates. Also, their dinosaur topiary peeked above their hedge to the street, and there were some problems with ''the installation and maintenance of trash cans,'' according to court papers. 
 Along with its unique benefits -- the exclusive list of neighbors, security cameras, constant patrols by guards -- Beverly Park expects residents to abide by a 70-page homeowners' covenant. A sample rule: ''No dwelling shall be constructed or maintained on any residential lot which has a floor area less than 5,000 square feet.''
 In testimony in 2003 by Cindy Adler, a member of the architectural review committee and Brian Adler's sister, the Bisnos' gates were deemed too ''Vegas'' for Beverly Park. 
 But the Bisnos's main infraction was installing an eight-foot abstract sculpture in their front courtyard of what some interpret to be a woman on her back with her legs in the air. The Bisnos bought the sculpture, which is called ''A Bras Ouvert,'' or ''Open Arms,'' on a trip to France, where they saw it on the Place Vendome in front of the Ritz. 
 The sculpture seemed to offend a powerful member of the homeowners association, Christine Hazy, who lives across the street from the Bisnos in one of Beverly Park's largest estates. (Her husband, Steven Udvar-Hazy, runs a multibillion-dollar airline leasing company, International Lease Finance Corporation.) 
 In a three-and-a-half-week trial in 2004, accusations flew, feelings were hurt. ''Rod Stewart and Sylvester Stallone have, or had, yellow houses,'' and no action was taken against them, the Bisnos' lawyer complained in court papers. 
 Mr. Bisno is convinced that Mrs. Hazy has a vendetta against him. ''We've had previous disagreements,'' he said this month. ''When we first moved in, she rejected my yellow paint and my gate. And I told her in words and substance that she was crazy.'' 
 Mrs. Hazy's lawyer, Marc Rohatiner, said the case was a garden variety instance of a resident breaking the rules, but with someone who would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees to make the point. 
 ''The kind of allegations Mr. Bisno made is typical of so many cases, but in this case you had someone willing to pursue it to such lengths over something not very significant,'' he said, though he acknowledged that it was the association that sued Mr. Bisno before sparking a countersuit. 
 Mrs. Bisno said that her family had been harassed during the dispute, with the sculpture and surrounding gardens toilet-papered, trampled and strewn with debris. Given Beverly Park's security, she wondered, who could have done such a thing?
 But in the end the Bisnos lost the case and an appeal. They have filed a motion to vacate the judge's decision.
 Still, there may be a silver lining. The Bisnos were in the middle of a divorce at the time of the lawsuit. Now all that seems behind them. They have bought a larger property two doors up from the Hazys, where they intend to build their next dream home. 
 With all the hassles, they want to stay in Beverly Park? ''It's a great place to live,'' Mr. Bisno said. As for the sculpture, which they will take with them, he said, ''Hopefully we'll get the same treatment as the rest of our neighbors. And if we don't, we'll take her to court.''

BYLINE: By Jeff Colt. 
Jeff Colt is a narrator for television documentaries.

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago, my terrier, Sam, and I went for our usual walk in Central Park. Several minutes later, as we were racing down the steps from the park drive leading to Bethesda Fountain, my heart stopped. To the right of the sacred winged monument was one of those glass-enclosed wheeled delis you see on street corners, the ones with hundreds of bagels and muffins crammed against dirty windows with stacks of blue and white coffee cups. Emblazoned on the green facade of the rolling restaurant, in black letters was a single word: crepes.
 The welcome solitude of one of the few precious and pristine square feet of real estate that New Yorkers could once count as commerce-free had become just like everywhere else in the city. It just wasn't right. 
Take a walk in Central Park's Ramble, up to the brook, to the pond where the birdwatchers gather and you can almost forget you are in the middle of one of the largest cities in the world. I know I'm not the only New Yorker who feels his shoulders relax and his pace slow down once he enters one of the city's parks. As people come and go, it is the city's green spaces that have remained in the neighborhoods in which they were born, refusing to move in a city where nothing ever seems to stop moving.
 The parks provide breath for a city that often begs for more air. But I fear we might begin to start choking.
 Bryant Park has four kiosks operated by 'Wichcraft, a New York sandwich shop. One is unnecessary, four verges on hostile. Madison Square Park is no better. It has surrendered hundreds of precious square feet to Danny Meyer's Shake Shack. Why? The streets that surround both parks are teeming with places to eat. What New Yorkers hunger for is more space, not more snacks.
 Commerce has been in the parks for years, and, according to the Department of Parks and Recreation, vendor licensing adds about $60 million annually to the city's balance sheet. But the money from the park vendors doesn't go to the parks -- it's funneled into the city's operating budget, which in 2006 was a little more than $36 billion. Put another way, the economic benefit to New Yorkers of allowing shakes, sandwiches and crepes into their parks is just under 0.17 percent of the city's annual revenue.
 Is it worth it? No. After all, it's hard enough in this city to escape the vendors, and the increasing viral franchising is cause for concern. To get away from it all, we only have the parks. That's why crepe stands and 'Wichcraft kiosks and Shake Shacks bother me. They should bother all New Yorkers. They simply don't belong in our gardens.
 So why don't we just get rid of them? I bet there are an awful lot of New Yorkers, like me, who would be willing to pay a park assessment fee of about $20 each as part of their city tax bill, which could replace the lost licensing revenue if the city took a do-or-die stance, in return for thousands of square feet of vendor-free land. 
 Is it a utopian dream in a practical society? Of course. But the initial creation and continued protection of park sanctuaries amid what often feels like concrete chaos is in itself a utopian aspiration. Why not fully commit to the dream instead of blindly accepting the presence of park menus and cash registers, which we frankly have enough of in this city? If we don't do something, I fear that our parks will become just another place to put businesses. 
 So what if my worst fears come to pass? Would it really be so bad?
 Turning my back on the crepe cart, I thought of one sunny morning last July. I was standing with Sam, watching the other dogs jump in and out of Bethesda Fountain, splashing around like children at a summer camp. A tourist asked me to take his photo. 
 ''Get the fountain in there,'' he said, in thick Cockney English. 
 Afterward, he told me that he had never seen such a well cared for park in his life, and that it was one of the most beautiful things in all of New York City.
 He didn't say anything about it needing more crepes.

HEADLINE: Keeping Delinquencies at Bay

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
THE other shoe has not yet dropped. Mortgages have gotten more costly for some homeowners as interest rates have climbed steadily since early last year, but borrowers are generally keeping up with their payments, the Mortgage Bankers Association says. Of course, that could change as interest rates on adjustable mortgages rise next year and beyond, but analysts say a growing economy could also mitigate any problems.
 Late last month, the association released figures showing that in the first three months of this year, delinquencies on one- to four-unit residential properties rose slightly from the same period a year earlier, to 4.41 percent from 4.31 percent, but dropped slightly from late 2005, when delinquencies reached 4.7 percent. Delinquencies are defined as loans 30 days past due. 
Douglas Duncan, chief economist for the association, based in Washington, sees strong employment as the key factor in keeping delinquencies at ''quite low levels, historically.'' In the first three months of this year, he noted, roughly 176,000 jobs were added nationally. ''That counteracts the forces that tend to drive foreclosures up,'' he said.
 Meanwhile, he added, housing prices are still expected to rise by about 6 percent this year, giving many homeowners enough equity to maneuver out of financial peril.
 Had it not been for Hurricane Katrina, delinquencies and foreclosures would have been the same as a year ago, Mr. Duncan said. Louisiana's rate was 13.73 percent; Mississippi's was 12.86 percent. 
 In the Northeast, delinquencies were below the national average. New York reached 3.35 percent, New Jersey's 3.14 percent and Connecticut 2.87 percent. 
 Among the hardest-hit states outside of the hurricane region were Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, where about 5.5 percent of loans were past due. 
 Mr. Duncan said that in such states manufacturing jobs were giving way to less lucrative service jobs. Population decline is also an issue, because it causes housing surpluses and price declines.
 ''If you have employment problems and no equity in the home,'' he said, ''the homeowner will simply walk away.'' 
 Some analysts expected a gloomier picture for delinquencies than the Mortgage Bankers Association report showed, in part because so many homeowners have relied on adjustable-rate mortgages in recent years to keep up with housing prices.
 There were some consumers who did find adjustable-rate mortgages challenging to maintain, the association report showed: so-called ''subprime'' borrowers, who typically pay higher rates than those with excellent credit, had a delinquency rate of 12.02 percent. But only about 18 percent of homeowners have adjustable mortgages, and of those, most are in the prime category.
 Anyone expecting a gloomier delinquency picture, Mr. Duncan said, doesn't have ''a full picture of the risk distribution of the outstanding loan portfolio.''
 A wider array of mortgage products has also done its share in staving off borrowers' troubles. Someone having difficulty paying an adjustable mortgage can refinance into an interest-only mortgage that, for several years at least, keeps payments low.
 Companies that service mortgages are also helping borrowers to avoid foreclosure, said Warren Kornfeld, an analyst with Moody's Investors Services. In the last two years, he said, such companies have been more willing to modify loan agreements or lengthen payment plans. 
 ''Servicers have to do what makes sense, in terms of minimizing their overall losses,'' Mr. Kornfeld said, adding that while delinquent borrowers shouldn't expect generous treatment, there should be flexibility.

HEADLINE: Adding On the Upgrades, With a Little Room to Splurge 

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: DOVER, Del. 

 BODY:
FOR Brittany Campbell John, the high point of buying her first home, a newly constructed town house, was the day she had to make dozens of choices involving the fixtures and finishes that would go into it. 
 Instead of poring over carpet and tile samples in the garage of a model home, Ms. John, 27, spent several hours alone with the builder's representative in a private showroom that resembles a high-end retail store.
Located in a strip shopping center near the Dover Air Force Base, the six-month-old Robino-Corrozi design center employs all the unconscious triggers that say Home Sweet Home. A brick-faced hearth burns in the model kitchen. In the bathroom, the walls are finished with wainscoting reminiscent of grandma's old Victorian.
 ''They had a whole room of wood floors and tiles; it just helps you see all the possibilities,'' said Ms. John, who with her husband, Gregory, 29, added $8,800 in upgrades to their $143,500 town house in a subdivision built by the Frank Robino Companies of Wilmington, Del. The Johns will pay for those improvements, including an upgrade to their kitchen cabinets, through their mortgage. 
 ''We didn't want to go overboard, but we still got to splurge,'' said Ms. John, who is a social worker.
 As the housing market softens, stand-alone design studios could give builders the competitive edge. The galleries, where dozens of options are featured in appealing room settings, add juice to the balance sheet, pump up sales and raise the level of buyer satisfaction, housing experts say. 
 ''Anything that makes it easier for somebody to buy a product is a good thing,'' said Georgette Chapman Phillips, chairwoman of the real estate department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''Gone are the days when you put it up and it sold. Builders are going to have to start working for their dollars.''
 Although the nation's top builders began opening design centers in the late 1990's, the recently unveiled Dover gallery is unusual in that it represents a $700,000 investment by an old-line local builder. Robino built some of Wilmington's first suburban subdivisions after World War II to house workers for the expanding DuPont Company and other growing businesses.
 Today, Robino, with its Jack Corrozi Builder division, puts up about 300 homes annually in Delaware, including condominiums, town houses and detached homes. Prices range from $149,000 for a condo to $1.5 million for a semicustom home built by Corrozi Builder.
 While Robino is tiny compared with the nation's publicly traded builders, it is a sizable company in a small state whose single-family housing production in 2005 totaled 7,281 houses. With help from the design center, the company expects sales of about $100 million in 2006, said Jack Corrozi, the managing partner who spearheaded the design center project. 
 Stephen J. Melman, director of economic services at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, said: ''I'm sure every builder in the Delaware market is looking at it. Builders are going to have to be able to deliver exactly what the buyer wants.'' 
 KB Home in Los Angeles, which opened its first gallery in the late 1990's, is credited with popularizing the design-center concept, said Alex Barron, a housing analyst with JMP Securities in San Francisco. KB, one of the country's largest builders, now has 30 centers and plans to open several more this year.
 Today, four out of five of the nation's top home builders have these selection centers. They tend to be in shopping centers or business parks, or next to a division office.
 Only Pulte Homes in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., has moved away from design centers.
 ''We found that the majority of our home buyers were choosing the same key options over and over,'' Melanie Hearsch, Pulte's corporate communications manager, wrote in an e-mail message. ''As a consequence, we were spending considerable time dealing with a wide array of less-popular options that were driving up our costs and reducing our construction efficiency.'' 
 Others are embracing the concept. The Ryland Group of Calabasas, Calif., is pushing ahead with a new retail-inspired layout for its design centers and expects to have them rolled out in all 28 of its markets in the next 12 months. 
 ''Personalization is what the consumer wants,'' said Eric Elder, Ryland's senior vice president of marketing and communications. ''It's the high point of the purchase.''
 The 9,000-square-foot Dover center holds its own with the major players, featuring two dozen styles of fireplace mantels, 20 kinds of hardwood floors and 100 varieties of ceramic tiles and marbles.
 K. Hovnanian Homes in Edison, N.J., has a new design center in Langhorne, Pa., that covers 6,800 square feet. Its gallery in Edison occupies 17,000 square feet.
 By appealing to the buyers' desire for more choice, design centers can serve as separate profit centers because the margins are higher on upgrades to a standard builder's package. Profit margins on options run about 50 percent, Mr. Barron said.
 Daniel Guadalupe, an Air Force sergeant stationed here, said he knew he was paying a premium for the $20,000 or so in upgrades to his $150,000 semidetached home to be built by Robino. ''But I may not be here that long and I want to avoid the disruption,'' he said. 
 Another advantage is that the options come with a warranty from the builder, Ms. Phillips said. Buying through the builder also makes it easy to finance the extras over the life of the mortgage. 
 Working with buyers, Bonnie Embry, the lead design consultant at the Robino-Corrozi design center, calculates how much the improvements will add to the monthly mortgage payment. ''Once they know their payments are only going to increase by a small amount, it gives them a comfort level and they relax,'' said Ms. Embry, who works on both commission and salary.
 Over all, a typical buyer at the Dover design center adds 10 to 20 percent to the base price of a house in options, Mr. Corrozi said.
 Separate design studios also make the buying experience fun for customers, builders say. In surveys done by Ryland, buyers said the design center was one of the most enjoyable parts of buying a new home.
 Builders even customize centers to accommodate differences in customer design preferences by geographic region.
 Lisa Homiak, manager of the design center for the Charlotte, N.C., division of D. R. Horton (which is based in Fort Worth), noted, for example, how historic Williamsburg, Va., about 300 miles away, had influenced her area. ''We have brick everywhere,'' she said. ''We just don't crown mold, we two-piece or three-piece crown mold.'' 
 For buyers, the room settings help visualize how something will look in their home.
 ''I sort of know some things I like, but it helped to have guidance,'' Ms. John said.
 A week after moving in, she was tickled with her selection of cherry wood kitchen cabinets. ''I was afraid I was being too extravagant, but now I love it and I think I got just what I wanted,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Lonely American Just Got a Bit Lonelier

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
FOR as long as humans have gathered in groups, it seems, some people have been left on the outside looking in. In postwar America in particular, the idea that loneliness pervades a portion of society has been a near-constant. Only the descriptions have changed: the ''lonely crowd'' alienation of the 1950's; the grim career-driven angst of the 70's and 80's; the ''Bowling Alone'' collapse of social connections of the 90's.
 There is a new installment in the annals of loneliness. Americans are not only lacking in bowling partners, now they're lacking in people to tell their deepest, darkest secrets. They've hunkered down even more, their inner circle often contracting until it includes only family, only a spouse or, at worst, no one. 
And that is something the Internet may help ease, but is unlikely to cure. 
 A recent study by sociologists at Duke and the University of Arizona found that, on average, most adults only have two people they can talk to about the most important subjects in their lives -- serious health problems, for example, or issues like who will care for their children should they die. And about one-quarter have no close confidants at all.
 ''The kinds of connections we studied are the kinds of people you call on for social support, for real concrete help when you need it,'' said Lynn Smith-Lovin, a sociologist at Duke and an author of the study, which analyzed responses in interviews that mirrored a survey from 1985. ''These are the tightest inner circle.''
 The study ''should provide a wake-up call to our society,'' said Bill Maier, a vice president and psychologist in residence with Focus on the Family, the evangelical Christian group. ''We're missing out on deep, meaningful interpersonal relationships.''
 Yet within the analysis there was at least a suggestion of hope. 
 ''The one type of relationship that actually went up was talking over personally important things with your spouse,'' Dr. Smith-Lovin said.
 Like ''Bowling Alone,'' the essay and, later, book by Robert D. Putnam, a public policy professor a Harvard, the Duke study suggested that a weakening of community connections is in part responsible for increasing social isolation. More people are working and commuting longer hours and have little time for the kinds of external social activities that could lead to deeper relationships. 
 So the closest ties increasingly are limited to family members, in particular to spouses.
 ''That's probably a result of the fact that men's and women's lives are more structurally similar now than in 1985,'' Dr. Smith-Lovin said. It's more likely that both spouses are working at jobs that are important to them, and men are more involved around the house. ''Spouses literally have more to talk about,'' she said.
 Dr. Maier, for one, sees that as cause for at least some optimism in a society whose fast pace generally bodes badly for family life. ''To hear that people are investing more in their nuclear family is a positive thing,'' he said.
 The Internet is also cause for some optimism, because it has made it easier to maintain ties among family members who have become scattered. Those ties inevitably developed over long-term, face-to-face contact, but e-mail can help keep them strong.
 ''E-mail really does help maintain your social networks,'' said John Horrigan, associate director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project. Recent Pew surveys, he said, found that ''when you contact family by e-mail, you share important and serious things.'' 
 Still, Dr. Smith-Lovin said, any optimism must be tempered. For one thing, having only one confidant, even if that confidant is a spouse, leaves a person extremely vulnerable if the spouse dies or the marriage disintegrates.
 And in the end, she and others pointed out, e-mail or instant messaging is no substitute for face-to-face contact. ''E-mailing somebody far way is not the same as them going to pick up your child at daycare or bringing you chicken soup,'' she said.
 Dr. Putnam said the new study reinforced much of what he had reported in ''Bowling Alone,'' which had been criticized by some academics as a faulty analysis that ignored other social and economic trends. And even if the new study points to a rise in spouses as confidants, that is not especially cause to rejoice, he said. ''It's like with global warming, if we learn that temperatures are going to rise slightly less than we thought,'' he said. ''It's still a problem.''
 ''Sure, you might say, we've still got our wives or husbands or mothers,'' he said. ''That's true. But gosh, the number of friends you have is a strong predictor of how long you live.''
 The impact goes beyond the individual, as well. ''There are effects on my neighbors of my not knowing them,'' he said. For one thing, ''If I don't know them well and they don't know me, that has a demonstrable effect on the crime rate.''
 Dr. Horrigan said there was anecdotal evidence that some members of a community use e-mail and the Internet ''to keep up with people very close by.'' The Internet can help expand social networks, although the ties it creates are not as strong as those the Duke researchers are concerned with. Yet they can be useful. 
 His group's research has shown that the Internet is increasingly being used during life's ''major moments'' -- to gather information or advice when making a big financial investment, deciding where to live, or choosing a college for a child. The research has shown that ''people were more likely to get help through their social network'' for those kinds of decisions.
 Still, Dr. Putnam said, ''The real interesting future is how can we use the Net to strengthen and deepen relationships that we have offline.''

HEADLINE: The Many Ways to Study and Learn

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Chinese Medicine for American Schools'' (column, June 27):
 Nicholas D. Kristof has found the essential reason that this century belongs to China.
As a professional born and educated in America, I have seen our national desire to excel in math and science plummet. Americans extol the importance of a good education, but then I see our children focusing on sports, movie stars and a yellow sponge who lives under the sea!
 Parents and students have been up in arms about cellphones in New York City public schools. Go ahead, American kids, make those soccer games and chitchat on your cellphones, because in China, they are burning the midnight oil and laughing all the way to their really bright future. 
 I'm telling my kids the same thing my immigrant parents told me: Go study! 

Jane Chew, M.D.
Ellicott City, Md., June 27, 2006

To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof strikes another strident note in the cacophony on education, pushing the twin notions of hard work and science as crucial to sound education. He uses the China scene as an example. 
 But education is not an additive function. You don't necessarily have better when you have more. The crucial element in the process is derived from ''inspiration,'' an attitude that is not fostered by the notion that hard work is the necessary driver. On the contrary, hard work comes when the student learns to be self-driven. 
 The role of science is more important today than ever before, but it is not close to the center for the majority of students. Education that leads to understanding the world we live in is what we used to mean with the term ''liberal education'' -- until the word liberal became disreputable. 
 In a market-driven society like ours, the best way to improve this educational function is to attract the best talent to teaching with higher salaries. The last best example of this was in the pre-World War II 1930's, when higher relative salaries drew the best to the profession.

To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof writes: ''Yet, there isn't any magic to it. One reason Chinese students learn more math and science than Americans is that they work harder at it.''
 But the mystery enters when we probe into underlying beliefs and ask, Why do they work harder?
 After teaching mathematics for more than a quarter-century, I know that what separates the successful students from the unsuccessful is far less how quickly they ''catch on'' and far more what they do in the moments of not catching on.
 Do they persevere, or do they give up because they have decided, consciously or otherwise, that persevering would be futile?
 Cross-cultural attitudinal studies concerning beliefs as to what is most crucial to learning mathematics have consistently shown that typically, while American students and their parents believe it is innate ability, their Chinese counterparts believe it is sustained effort. Which belief will lead to working harder?

To the Editor:
 There's no doubt that our public education system is in serious if not critical condition (especially in our urban centers). 
 But I have watched my children occupy themselves during these first few weeks of deprogrammed, 100 percent structure-free summer vacation. 
 I have witnessed the conception, planning, design, manufacture and playing of an original board game; the design and assembly of a fictitious animal made from ordinary household material; the planning and development of a community service project; scientific self-study of the actions of toothpicks as they float down a stream of water -- and on and on. 
 The Chinese may know how to foster highly productive repositories of knowledge, but I still think a less regimented approach is the ticket to true creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit -- the engines of economic as well as personal growth.

Rebecca Spence
New Providence, N.J., June 27, 2006

To the Editor:
 I'm an American high school student. My summer assignments at my private school consist simply of a medley of required and recommended readings, a majority of which I will never discuss in class. 
 But I cannot imagine what would put me off learning faster than ''several hours of homework a day'' during a shortened summer vacation. I value my few months of respite to regroup and explore all of my interests -- yes, even the academic ones. 
 Not all American students will fill the coming months with dating and TV-watching. Some will find internships, enroll in classes or get jobs. Others will apply themselves to reading, writing and practicing math exercises with the same rigor that characterizes the Chinese. 
 The difference between American and Chinese students is that we must often be creative and resourceful to receive a top-notch education. Information is not force-fed to us, hammered into our skulls or squeezed through our ears; the highest achieving students are the ones who seek their education willingly.

Rachel Cromidas
La Jolla, Calif., June 27, 2006

To the Editor:
 I went through the Chinese education system from elementary school to university. I have a niece in seventh grade in China. My son is about to start kindergarten this fall in the United States. Our experience is quite different from that portrayed by Nicholas D. Kristof. 
 While Chinese students may spend much more time in school and studying, Chinese students are not learning. Studying and learning are two very different things. 
 I do not believe that Chinese students know how to learn. In most cases, they study for tests and prepare for furious competition, but they have a lot less love and passion for knowledge or acquiring knowledge. 
 In contrast, my son, who is in the American education system, loves to learn. Before he turned 5, he asked me to Google something on the Internet. He watches good public TV programs designed for children and has learned a lot from them. He loves music and loves learning how to play the piano, even though he complains when he has to practice a piece of music the sixth or seventh time. 
 I am not saying there is no room for improvement in the American education system. But I also don't think that the Chinese education system is superior to ours.

HEADLINE: History Under Construction in Florida

BYLINE: By Mary Beth Norton. 
Mary Beth Norton, a professor of American history at Cornell, is the author of ''In the Devil's Snare: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692.''

DATELINE: West Tisbury, Mass. 

 BODY:
AS a historian, I love facts. I especially love facts about early America, the subject I have researched, taught and written about for more than 40 years. The Florida Legislature would seem to share my enthusiasm. An education law it recently enacted insists, ''American history shall be viewed as factual, not as constructed'' and ''shall be viewed as knowable, teachable and testable.'' The statute places particular importance on the facts of the Declaration of Independence, which was adopted by the Second Continental Congress two days after its vote for independence on July 2, 1776 -- 230 years ago today. 
 Yet the wording of the law befuddles me. Facts mean little or nothing without being interpreted -- another word for ''constructed.'' All historians know that facts never speak for themselves. 
Take an example from my own experience. Several years ago I was delighted to uncover proof in the British Public Record Office that an accused male ''witch'' in 1692 Salem, Mass., had been trading with enemy French and Indians, just as a young accuser had charged. That document confirmed my developing conviction that the Salem witch trials were linked to New England's hostile relationships with the French and Indians. But to many other scholars who previously had encountered that document, it meant no such thing.
 The Florida law, while claiming to eschew constructed interpretations, is itself an obvious construction. The statute specifically defines what the term ''American history'' includes: ''the period of discovery, early colonies, the War for Independence, the Civil War, the expansion of the United States to its present boundaries, the world wars, and the civil rights movement to the present.''
 Among the multitude of omissions from that list is any discussion of the religious development of the country or the transformation from an agricultural to an industrial economy. The statute thus constructs an American past that values certain aspects -- especially wars and the civil rights movement -- more than others.
 Nowhere is this construction more obvious than in the law's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as a key founding document. ''The history of the United States,'' it asserts, ''shall be defined as the creation of a new nation based largely on the universal principles stated in the Declaration of Independence.'' Elsewhere, it lists those principles: ''national sovereignty, natural law, self-evident truth, equality of all persons, limited government, popular sovereignty and inalienable rights of life, liberty and property.''
 Reading that made me wonder if Florida's legislators had familiarized themselves with the Declaration and the context of its adoption. Thomas Jefferson's famous phrase, after all, was ''life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'' -- not property. 
 The Declaration ended, rather than created, a government. It forcefully asserted the right of the people to alter or abolish a polity unresponsive to their needs, a ''universal principle'' overlooked by Florida's legislators. Delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 -- who drafted the document on which the nation is actually based -- rarely mentioned the Declaration in debate. Indeed, as Pauline Maier, a historian, has pointed out, we owe the current interpretation of the Declaration to 19th-century commentators, especially Abraham Lincoln.
 What, then, is to be made of the stress on the Declaration in the new Florida law? An earlier version of the law had emphasized study of the Constitution and the Declaration equally, describing each in general terms. In the new version, only the description of the Constitution retains its non-prescriptive character. The Constitution, after all, is an inconvenient vehicle for setting forth universal principles; it concerned itself with nitty-gritty details about federalism, separation of powers and the like. Further, the Constitution supported the continuation of slavery, thereby undermining the notion that the nation from its earliest days adhered to Florida's list of universal principles, prominently including ''equality of all persons.'' 
 In short, a class learning about the drafting of the Constitution would confront the unpleasant reality of founding fathers who either owned slaves themselves or protected the right of others to own them. How much simpler and less troubling to present young people with a rosy picture based on modern understandings of the language of the Declaration of Independence! Under the guise of returning to a factual teaching of history in the state's schools, Florida's legislators have mandated an ahistorical construction that paradoxically distorts the very facts they purport to revere.
 The Florida law highlights a growing tendency in the United States to substitute easily grasped absolutes for messy and ambiguous realities. (Another example of the same type of thinking is the quest of certain judges to capture the ''original intent'' of constitutional clauses.) A stress on facts, not constructions, superficially appears to be ideologically neutral. Yet the choice of which facts to stress, and which to omit, is crucial. In the end, history can never be ''factual not constructed,'' as the language of the Florida statute itself demonstrates.

HEADLINE: Of Human Bonding

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
If I had $37 billion to give to charity, I'd give some of it to a foundation that would invent an Oxytocin Meter. That way we could predict who is headed for success and who for failure. We could figure out which organizations are thriving and which are sick.
 Oxytocin is a hormone that helps mammals bond. Female rats injected with oxytocin nurture newborns placed in their cages, which they would otherwise attack. Prairie voles with oxytocin receptors form lifelong monogamous bonds, whereas other varieties of voles without the receptors mate promiscuously. 
 In humans, oxytocin levels rise during childbirth, breast feeding and sex. Humans with higher oxytocin levels are more likely to trust other people. They are more resistant to stress and social phobias. Humans seem to experience delicious oxytocin floods in the brain after being with someone they love. It's no wonder neuroscientists -- displaying the branding genius for which they are famous -- have nicknamed oxytocin ''the affiliative neuropeptide.''
 I figure if we can hang Oxytocin Meters around people's necks, we can tell who is involved in healthy relationships and who isn't. If you walked into an office where nobody is having an oxytocin moment, then you'd know you're in a dysfunctional organization and it's time to get out of there.
 Now I'm not really trying to reduce all human relationships to one hormone. But I am trying to emphasize the importance of human attachments. We in the policy world debate education, incarceration rates, poverty, productivity and competitiveness, and we try to figure out which qualities individuals need to thrive in the new economy. But often it's the space between individuals that really matters, the nature of their attachments.
 Attachment theory has been thriving for decades, but it's had little impact on public policy. That's because the policy world is a supermagnet for people who are emotionally avoidant. If you go to a Congressional hearing and talk demography, you are treated like a serious policy wonk, but if you start talking about relationships, people look at you as if you're Oprah. 
 But everything we're learning about the brain confirms the centrality of attachments to human development and the wisdom of Adam Smith's observation that the ''chief part of human happiness arises from the consciousness of being beloved.'' (Brain research rarely reveals anything new about human nature; it just tells you which of the old verities are most important.)
 And so maybe it's time to focus a little less on individual capacities and more on nurturing attachment. Let me give you an example of what I mean.
 Over the past few decades federal and state governments have spent billions of dollars trying to improve high schools. Much of the effort has gone into trying to improve individual math and reading scores. But the effects have been modest and up to 30 percent of students drop out -- a social catastrophe. 
 The dropout rates are astronomical because humans are not machines into which you can input data. They require emotion to process information. You take kids who didn't benefit from stable, nurturing parental care and who have not learned how to form human attachments, and you stick them in a school that functions like a factory for information transmission, and the results are going to be horrible. 
 The Gates Foundation recently sponsored focus groups with dropouts. The former students knew how detrimental dropping out would be. Most were convinced they could have graduated if they wanted to. But their descriptions of school amounted to a portrait of emotional disengagement: teachers were burned out and boring; discipline was lacking; classes weren't challenging; there weren't enough tutors and wasn't anyone to talk to; parents were uninvolved.
 If school is unsatisfying but having a child or joining a gang seems as if it would be emotionally satisfying, then many students, especially those with insecure attachments at home, are going to follow their powerful drive to go where the attachments seem to be. 
 If I had $37 billion, I would focus it on the crucial node where attachment skills are formed: the parental relationship during the first few years of life. I'd invest much of it with organizations, like Circle of Security, that help at-risk mothers and fathers develop secure bonds with their own infants, instead of just replicating the behaviors of their own parents. I'd focus on the real resource crisis that afflicts the country. It's not the oil shortage. It's the oxytocin shortage.

HEADLINE: African Union Urges Action to Ease Crises in Somalia and Sudan 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BANJUL, Gambia, July 1 

 BODY:
A two-day Africa summit meeting opened near here on Saturday with a call for urgent action to defuse conflicts in Somalia and the Darfur region of Sudan, but diplomats said there was little chance of much progress on either issue. 
 ''Today we are urgently and seriously called to address the situation in Darfur and in Somalia,'' said Alpha Oumar Konare, a former president of Mali and the chairman of the African Union Commission, in his opening address to the 53-member African Union.
The official theme of the twice-yearly meeting is regional economic integration, but the crises in northeast Africa seemed uppermost in the minds of leaders here. Mr. Konare called for a peace agreement between the Sudanese government and one Darfur rebel movement, signed on May 5, to be carried out urgently.
 The agreement has been undermined by two other rebel groups that have rejected it, and bloodshed has continued in the huge western region of Sudan, where tens of thousands of people have died in a three-year-old rebellion. 
 Mr. Konare said the Darfur situation had been strongly influenced by tensions between Chad and Sudan, which have accused each other of supporting rebels.
 Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, also mentioned Darfur in his speech, referring to it as ''one of the worst nightmares in recent history.''
 Mr. Konare said the African Union should give ''large-scale support'' to Somalia's weak interim government, and encourage dialogue with Islamists now controlling Mogadishu and a large swath of the country after defeating secular warlords supported by the United States.
 He called for talks based on ''tolerance, justice, respect for freedom, respect for human rights and nonviolence'' to end rising tension between the sides.
 Despite the strong desire of African leaders to deal with Somalia and Darfur, big obstacles are preventing a breakthrough on either issue.
 In Darfur, the African Union wants to hand over peacekeeping duties from its own weak force of 7,000 soldiers to United Nations forces by Sept. 30. 
 But on Thursday, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, who is attending the meeting, issued the latest in a series of uncompromising rejections of any United Nations peacekeeping force.
 Western and African diplomats in Banjul said that despite widespread revulsion over massacres, rape and pillage in Darfur, the international community had hardly any leverage to pressure Mr. Bashir, whose consent would be needed for a United Nations force.
 There seemed little chance of doing anything more at the meeting about Somalia. Despite the power of the Islamists, who this week said they would extend the authority of Islamic law throughout Somalia, the African Union said it would not deal directly with them.
 The Islamist side does not appear to be present at the meeting. Somalia's internationally recognized interim government, too weak to enter Mogadishu, is represented here.

HEADLINE: Soggy Weather Compounds Misery of Beleaguered Dairy Farmers in Vermont 

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Vt. 

 BODY:
Cows in Vermont, and there are a bunch, can usually count on a few things.
 Quaint-seeking tourists snap their pictures. Trinket shops sell their likenesses on needlepoint pillows and welcome mats. And there is plenty of prime food to eat because in spring and summer, dairy farmers literally make lots of hay while the sun shines.
 But the sun has not been shining this year. Not for much of May and June, anyway. And record rainfall, combined with dismally low milk prices and rising fuel prices, has Vermont's dairy farming industry in a crisis.
 ''It's what I call the trifecta: It's low milk prices, bad weather and the cost of staying in business,'' said Gerry Audet, 54, of Orwell, Vt. 
 Mr. Audet, a dairy farmer for 37 years on a farm his family has run since 1936, gave up a few weeks ago and sold his cows. His is one of at least 46 dairy farms, out of 1,200 in the state, that have folded in recent months, a higher than usual number, farm economists say. ''I'm running a hundred-cow dairy here,'' Mr. Audet said, ''and it's just gotten to the point where I can't stay in business.'' 
 Statewide, the situation for dairy farms, which make up 85 percent of Vermont's agriculture, has gotten so tough that on Monday, the federal Department of Agriculture declared the entire state a disaster zone, making cheap emergency loans available to farmers.
 And Gov. Jim Douglas convened an emergency ''dairy summit'' on Thursday, announcing that the state would give farmers $8.6 million in cash assistance because the situation was so dire that federal help was not enough. ''I refuse to let the agricultural industry of Vermont slip away,'' Mr. Douglas, a Republican, said at the summit.
 In an interview, the governor said: ''A number of farmers have lost over half their crops, and we estimate about $53 million or $54 million in reported losses. It's part of our culture, our way of life. They are the stewards of the land, and they maintain the working landscape that's so important to our natural beauty and our tourism. I believe this is a particularly critical time for them, and that's why we need to do everything we can to help them.''
 Virtually every dairy farmer has been affected. 
 ''It's just been so wet that we couldn't do anything,'' said Henry Magnan, who milks 550 Holsteins with his four sons in Fairfield, where rain has twice flooded his street (Chester Arthur Road, after the president who spent his infancy here) and made it impassable.
 For weeks, the fields have been so wet that the Magnans, members of a dairy cooperative that supplies the milk for Ben and Jerry's ice cream, could not plant corn to feed their cows. Some 85 acres of hay they had also counted on became so moldy, rotten-smelling and infiltrated by mushrooms that the Magnans had to chop it up and let it molder on the ground. Tractors trying to work their land are getting mired in mud. 
 All this will mean mounting costs to buy feed they would have grown, said one son, Mark Magnan. And assuming they get a crop of hay and corn later in the summer, the quality will be poorer, which will cause cows to produce less milk to sell and require farmers to buy protein to supplement the poor feed.
 Add to that the price of fuel, which increases the cost of operating tractors, transporting milk to market, trucking in supplies and even using fertilizer made from natural gas. With milk prices low, the Magnans said they had been recouping only about $11.50 of the $15 it cost them to produce 100 pounds of milk.
 ''Most dairy farmers weren't exactly rolling in cash when these problems started,'' said Matt Harvey, who milks 140 cows in Florence. ''A lot of us are living off of our reserves or at least tapping into them.''
 The number of dairy farmers has been declining in Vermont and elsewhere for years, with small family farms selling to larger ones and young people opting out of agriculture. But Robert L. Parsons, an economist at the University of Vermont, said the current situation seemed particularly difficult, with more farms folding this year than before.
 Although there has been no decline in the number of cows or the amount of milk produced, Professor Parsons said a decline in dairy farmers had hit the state hard.
 ''Vermont is the most dairy-dependent state in the country,'' he said. ''People say the top five agricultural products in Vermont are dairy, dairy, dairy, dairy and dairy. This image of the independent small farmers grazing their cows on the hillside, is that a disappearing picture? Many of the people are afraid that it is.''
 Farmers trying to keep their business afloat have taken a variety of steps. Some have shifted to producing organic milk, which draws a higher price but also requires an investment of time, money and land that not every farmer can afford.
 A few are going the route of the Blue Spruce Farm in Bridport, which has found a way to wring greater value out of a commodity it produces in abundance: manure. 
 The farm extracts methane gas from the manure and sends the methane through a generator, which makes electricity. The Central Vermont Public Service Company sells the electricity to customers for 4 cents per kilowatt hour more than regular electric power (which sells for 11.4 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers), and the farm pockets the 4 cents. So far, about 3,000 customers have signed up.
 Marie Audet, part of the family running Blue Spruce, said there was another benefit: removing the methane also removes that classic manure smell, so ''the separated manure solids can be used as bedding for the cows instead of sawdust.''
 Governor Douglas said one of his wife's brothers, Robert Foster, had augmented his dairy income by selling potting soil made from manure. ''He calls it Moo Doo,'' the governor said, ''and it's sold up and down the East Coast.''
 But many farmers are struggling to make the economics work. Harvey Smith, a state representative, sold the cows on his farm in New Haven, Vt., a few months ago.
 Chris Fay, who milks 200 Jersey cows in Maidstone in northeastern Vermont, where fields have been swimming in rain, said he was taking austerity measures: cutting fertilizer use and giving up some power in his tractor by ''shifting up a gear so you don't burn as much fuel.''
 Mr. Fay, 26, who farms with his father, said, ''We try never to talk about it too much, but at some point in time we got to figure out whether it's feasible or not'' to stay in business.
 Steve Kerr, Vermont's agriculture secretary, who has been lobbying Congress for more aid, said: ''We're very, very, very worried about this. Dairy farmers, they don't give up easily. But you can only take so many shots to the torso before you're done.''

HEADLINE: Ryutaro Hashimoto, 68, a Tough Former Prime Minister of Japan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 1 

 BODY:
Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister who stood up to the United States in trade negotiations and helped defuse tensions over American military bases in Japan, died Saturday in Tokyo. He was 68. 
 Mr. Hashimoto, who was prime minister from January 1996 to July 1998, died at the International Medical Center of Japan, said Hajime Takayama, a hospital spokesman. He had been in critical condition after suffering abdominal pain and undergoing surgery to remove a large part of his intestines.
His son, Gaku Hashimoto, a legislator, said his father died from multiple organ failure.
 Mr. Hashimoto's prominence in Japanese politics rose when he demonstrated rare toughness against Washington in a bitter automobile sales dispute as trade minister in 1995. But his political career ended under the shadow of controversy.
 A political donation scandal prompted him to resign last year as leader of what was then the largest faction in the governing Liberal Democratic Party. He retired in September, citing poor health.
 Mr. Hashimoto, known for his slicked-back hair and chain smoking, was first elected as a member of the lower house of Parliament in 1963. His policy making and analytical skills won him several top cabinet positions in the Trade, Finance and Transportation ministries. He also won praise for his diplomacy in settling several delicate issues.
 In 1997, he helped quell opposition to American military bases on the southern island of Okinawa, arranging to return to the local government land that had been leased to the Marines. He also promised aid to strengthen Okinawa's struggling economy.
 But his toughness -- he was an expert swordsman and a mountain climber -- also got him into trouble.
 Like Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Mr. Hashimoto supported visits to a Tokyo shrine dedicated to the war dead, including convicted Japanese war criminals. The visits have continued to be a strong irritant in Japan's relations with its Asian neighbors, especially China and South Korea, which suffered under Japan's brutal wartime occupation.

HEADLINE: Pledging to Revive Newark and Reduce Crime, a New Mayor Goes to Work

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; John Koblin contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 1 

 BODY:
Cory A. Booker, an Ivy League-educated lawyer from the North Jersey suburbs, was sworn in as mayor of Newark Saturday, ending the 20-year run of Mayor Sharpe James and pledging to revive a struggling, perseverant city long synonymous with urban failure. 
 Mr. Booker won office on May 9 with 72 percent of the vote, and as he stood before a crowd of about 2,000 supporters at a downtown auditorium, he seemed anxious to get started. His legs twitched. His eyes seemed to squint away tears during a 40-minute speech that included grievous tales of young men gunned down by gangs and proposals that Mr. Booker said would move Newark from dangerous to safe, poor to prosperous. 
''Newark must now lead our nation in an urban transformation,'' he said, ''resulting in secure communities, economic prosperity and a nurturing environment for families, elders and children. As mayor, I will not shrink from this challenge.''
 Mr. Booker, 37, came to Newark 11 years ago as an idealistic student at Yale Law School. He started out ''big for my britches,'' he said in his speech, and won support from voters only because longtime residents (''my professors of Newark'') taught him to see the city's potential beyond its flaws. 
 The plans he laid out Saturday reflected both that local education and the political ambition that has already made him a rising national star of the Democratic Party. 
 His focus landed squarely on crime. Citing the city's rising murder rate, and naming victims who died young, he said, ''We have work to do in America when any child is killed.'' 
 Specifically, Mr. Booker said his administration would immediately implement zero-tolerance policing. Reiterating his campaign promise to add hundreds of officers to the streets, he said, ''I will enforce all laws, from traffic laws, with people speeding down our suburban streets, to littering laws.''
 He said his administration would also expand recreation and summer job opportunities, add drug treatment programs and help former prisoners re-enter the community. He did not mention how the city would pay for these services.
 But with the help of his Municipal Council -- all nine members sworn in on Saturday were on the new mayor's ticket -- Mr. Booker said Newark would soon re-emerge as one of the nation's greatest cities. 
 ''America is calling us,'' he said. ''Newark's history is calling us.''
 Mr. Booker's version of history, however, seemed to overlook the contributions of his predecessor. Mr. James, who dropped out of the race in March and did not attend the inauguration, was never mentioned by name during the two-and-a-half-hour ceremony at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. 
 Even as Mr. Booker traced Newark's history from its founding in 1666 and offered a lengthy tribute to Kenneth Gibson, the city's first black mayor, Mr. James remained invisible, as if airbrushed away. 
 All that was left were veiled criticisms. Mr. Booker, who lost a bitter race to Mr. James in 2002, said his new government would ''make our city not one based on politics and patronage but on professionalism.'' He added, ''If we continue to do what we did yesterday, we will get the same results we have today.''
 After the inauguration, Mr. Booker said he never intended to diminish Mr. James's record. 
 ''Well, he wasn't there, and it just didn't match the flow of my speech,'' Mr. Booker said. ''It was not purposeful, and there will be plenty of times to thank him in the near future. There's certainly no enmity.''
 Not everyone seemed convinced of that, however. 
 Clement Price, a professor at Rutgers University in Newark who teaches a course on city history, said he was surprised by Mr. James's absence and by what he saw as the lack of appreciation for his two decades in office. Even though Mr. James, 70, is still a state senator representing Newark, neither he nor Mr. Booker seemed willing to let their rivalry fade, Professor Price said.
 As a result, the city was denied a chance to see its two political heavyweights come together. 
 ''The torch was not passed in a civic-minded fashion,'' he said.
 Mr. James could not be reached for comment. In a letter he wrote to Mr. Booker, Mr. James congratulated him and promised to work with him, according to The Associated Press, which said it had received a copy. 
 But at the inauguration and the parties afterward, there was less talk of the past than of the future. 
 Like Mr. Booker, many supporters acknowledged that there would be challenges. Newark, after all, is a city of 280,000 where the average household median income is only $26,000 and the city budget is dependent on state aid. 
 But that did not mean the introduction of a new mayor was not worth celebrating.
 ''Cory has elevated the hopes of a lot of people,'' said the Rev. Edwin Leahy, the headmaster of St. Benedict's Preparatory School near downtown. ''That's a big deal for us. It's a big deal and a big challenge.''

HEADLINE: Giving It Away, Then And Now

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
THE announcement last week that Warren E. Buffett, the nation's second-richest man, would donate most of his $44 billion fortune to a foundation created by Bill Gates, the nation's richest man, sent reporters to the history stacks.
 After all, the philanthropic pairing invited comparisons to Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. As the wealthiest men in the country at the turn of the 20th century, Carnegie and Rockefeller embarked on huge, independent philanthropic efforts. Each gave away hundreds of millions of dollars in the last decades of his life. And each endowed a foundation that is still a philanthropic force. 
The comparisons are apt, said Ron Chernow, author of ''Titan,'' the magisterial biography of John D. Rockefeller. ''Rockefeller and Carnegie were pioneers in big business, and so it was a natural and inevitable transition that they would be pioneers in philanthropy,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''And, like them, Gates and Buffett, who were also pioneers, are focusing on issues with broad appeal and universal support.'' As Carnegie and Rockefeller did, Mr. Gates is focusing on areas like education, scientific research and health care -- attacking the root causes of deeply impacted global problems.
 Despite the similarities, Mr. Gates is approaching philanthropy in a fundamentally different way -- call it Philanthropy 2.0. Just as Carnegie and Rockefeller were influenced by the vertically integrated, industrial economy they helped to create, Mr. Gates's philanthropic efforts are defined and affected by the less hierarchical, networked economy that he helped to create. With its small staff, strategy of creating partnerships and focus on research and development, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation more closely resembles a 21st-century software company than a 20th-century philanthropy. 
 ''It's a conscious attempt to create a different style of foundation, a strategy of intervention and networks,'' said Lester M. Salamon, director of the Center for Civil Society Studies at Johns Hopkins University. 
 Carnegie and Rockefeller were pioneers in bricks-and-mortar philanthropy. After Carnegie sold his steel company to J. P. Morgan in 1901, he plowed his nine-figure fortune into limestone. He built the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and the Carnegie Institution in Washington and seeded the nation with more than 2,800 libraries. ''His focus was to uplift humanity, and libraries for him were the best way to reach the broadest spectrum of the people,'' said Peter Krass, author of ''Carnegie.''
 Libraries have also been a centerpiece of the Gates Foundation's work. But instead of building them, Mr. Gates is wiring them. Working with private-sector partners like Microsoft and Gateway, the Gates Foundation has helped provide computers and technology to 11,000 libraries.
 John D. Rockefeller created educational institutions from scratch, building both the University of Chicago and Rockefeller University in New York -- the first major institution devoted purely to medical research. But Mr. Gates has a taken different approach to education reform. ''The Gates Foundation isn't building schools,'' said Peter J. Frumkin, professor of public affairs of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas and author of the forthcoming book ''Strategic Giving: The Art and Science of Philanthropy.''
 ''They're giving money to school systems and telling them to restructure, to reduce the size of their schools,'' Professor Frumkin said. 
 The Gates Foundation has given more than $100 million to New York City's public school system alone, to encourage the creation of smaller schools within existing school buildings. The foundation says its programs currently touch about 8 percent of the nation's public high schools.
 THE networked approach to philanthropy recognizes that it's hard to make a huge impact on your own, no matter how much money you have. The Gates Foundation gave out $1.3 billion in 2005. With Mr. Buffett's pledges, it will be able to double its philanthropic output, to about $3 billion a year. 
 That sure sounds like a lot. But it represents only about 1 percent of annual charitable giving in the United States -- which was $260.3 billion in 2005, according to Richard T. Jolly, chairman of Giving USA, based in Glenview, Ill. The Gates Foundation has $30 billion in total assets; the National Institutes of Health has an annual budget of $28.6 billion. 
 So philanthropists who want to make a difference today must find strategic partners. Thanks in part to the process that Carnegie and Rockefeller helped to institutionalize, there's a huge base of like-minded organizations for the Gates Foundation to tap into.The Gates Foundation has approached its central focus -- developing cures and treatments for diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis -- much as its founder treated software development: as a long-term process that requires research and development. (Of the $10.1 billion in grants that the foundation has made since 1995, $5.9 billion of them have been in the area of health.) 
 Rather than build hospitals or health organizations from scratch, ''for the most part, the foundation tries to work with established institutions, private pharmaceutical companies,'' said Ruth Levine, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a research organization in Washington. The foundation, which supports programs run by the World Bank and the World Health Organization, is also working with Path, an international nonprofit based in Seattle that was formerly known as the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, to finance malaria vaccine research.
 The outlook evident here is not that of a utopian like Carnegie, or of a moralist like Rockefeller, but of a practical engineer. Whether it's wiring libraries, stimulating the creation of smaller schools or paying for fundamental research, the Gates Foundation is trying to create products and systems that can be replicated and expanded with little marginal cost. 
 As Mr. Gates put it at a news conference this week, ''If you want to deal with billions of people, you need scale.'' In other words, he's trying to give away his money (and Mr. Buffett's) the same way he made it.

HEADLINE: The Poor Are More Numerous 

 BODY:
As Gov. Jon Corzine and some of his fellow Democrats in the Assembly stared down a July 1 deadline to pass a new budget, a startling bit of news broke through the bombast and gamesmanship: poor children in New Jersey are worse off today than they were six years ago. 
 The number of children living below the poverty rate in New Jersey is up by an astonishing 20 percent since 2000, according to a survey by the Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation. Twelve percent of the state's children were living in poverty as of 2004, the last year for which figures are available. The figure was 10 percent in 2000.
Meanwhile, the number of unemployed parents with minor children increased by 8 percent over the same time period.
 The foundation's study, based on census records, is a sobering reminder that poverty has not been abolished even as New Jersey's median family income climbed in recent years to its current level of about $75,000.
 While this may seem obvious, the recent deliberations in Trenton offered little to suggest that lawmakers are aware of the presence of poor people and their children in the midst of New Jersey's plenty. Many of the objections to Mr. Corzine's proposed sales tax increase, from 6 percent to 7 percent, were based on political calculations -- Assembly Democrats did not want to be tagged as tax-raisers -- rather than concern for the tax's regressive impact on the poor.
 New Jersey is paying the price for shoddy fiscal schemes and monumental inefficiencies during the last decade, and may do so for years to come. But as this year's budget talks showed, the true cost of waste, corruption and folly can be measured not just in dollars but in lives made harder, in struggles made more burdensome.
 When Governor Corzine unveiled his budget in March, he included a provision to ease the plight of the state's poor even as he struggled to close a $4.5 billion budget gap. Some 414,000 households with annual incomes less than $25,000 would have seen their state tax liability disappear. Married taxpayers earning $30,000 or less, and single people earning $20,000 or less, would have received a tax cut. The governor's budget document referred to this proposal, which would have cost the state $105 million a year, as a ''signature initiative.''
 But signature initiatives have a way of becoming disposable when budget talks begin to resemble wrestling matches. Mr. Corzine has decided to postpone the tax-relief plan until next year in an effort to save $105 million this year. While his intentions seem sincere, there are no guarantees the poor will see relief in 2007 -- the budget forecast for next year is grim, too.
 And so, at a time when property tax reduction is all the rage, a tax cut for the poor fell by the wayside as New Jersey's politicians tried to scramble out of a mess years in the making.
 Surely this is nobody's idea of shared sacrifice.

HEADLINE: Hopes Fade For Deal to Cut Trade Barriers 

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 1 

 BODY:
The chances of reaching a new accord to lower trade barriers across the globe seemed more remote than ever on Saturday as major World Trade Organization powers signaled their failure to make progress during two days of talks and postponed a resumption of serious discussions. 
 ''The experience of the last several days has been somewhat disheartening,'' Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, told a news conference. ''Clearly, we have reached an impasse.''
Ms. Schwab's aides said she would return to the United States on Sunday. India's trade minister, Kamal Nath, left the meeting, which was scheduled to last until Monday, on Saturday afternoon.
 Pascal Lamy, the director general of the W.T.O., said the talks were in crisis but pledged to engage in shuttle diplomacy ''so that we can fill the gaps primarily between the big players so that we can unlock the rest of the issues.''
 The so-called Doha round of trade talks, named for the Qatari capital where they began in 2001, has already missed a series of deadlines. The window for reaching a deal is narrowing with coming elections in Brazil and France, where politicians will soon be more preoccupied with domestic affairs than global issues, and in the United States, where there is a Congressional race this fall.
 Perhaps the most important factor is that President Bush will lose his mandate next year to strike a deal without it being picked apart by legislators. Soon, trade experts say, other countries will cease negotiating with the United States because deals struck abroad are unlikely to be honored by Congress.
 The talks are mainly stuck over agriculture. Before making additional pledges to reduce subsidies and tariffs, the Americans and Europeans are calling for developing countries like India and Brazil to agree to open their markets to more imports of manufactured goods and services. The developing countries want the United States and the European Union to move first.
 The European trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, said six of the world's largest trading partners -- the United States, the Europen Union, Brazil, India, Australia and Japan -- were likely to meet again in July to discuss solutions. He also called for national political leaders to intervene to break the impasse.

HEADLINE: Last Stop, Lhasa: Rail Link Ties Remote Tibet to China

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 1 

 BODY:
This weekend, China opened the world's highest railway, a 710-mile line that crosses the vertiginous Tibetan Plateau and forges a steel bond with the once-secluded Buddhist holy city of Lhasa.
 The railway, inaugurated on Saturday by President Hu Jintao and top Communist Party cadres on a deluxe opening run, is an engineering marvel that traverses unstable permafrost and reaches more than 16,000 feet above sea level, higher than Mont Blanc in France.
Party officials have hailed the $4.1 billion project, which was decades in the making, as a milestone in its efforts to develop its vast, poor western region and bring an infusion of people and prosperity to remote Tibet. 
 But Tibetan and foreign critics say that the railway benefits Han Chinese, China's dominant ethnic group, at the expense of Tibetan natives. They argue that enhanced transportation links will accelerate a trend of Han-led economic development and smother Tibet's ancient spiritual culture, while undermining the pristine natural environment of its highlands.
 ''The overwhelming opinion among Tibetans is that the railway will consolidate Chinese control and bring in huge numbers of Han Chinese,'' said Tenzin Tsundue, an independent Tibetan writer who lives in India. ''It will mean less employment and more destruction for Tibetans, not more opportunity.'' 
 On Friday, three women from the United States, Canada and Britain were detained briefly after they climbed through a second-floor window at Beijing's main train station and unfurled a black-and-white banner that read, ''China's Tibet Railway, Designed to Destroy.'' 
 Chinese officials defend the railway as vital to stimulating Tibet's development. They project it will double tourist revenues and reduce the cost of cargo transport by up to three-fourths.
 ''The completion of the Qinghai-Tibet railway is a significant piece of good news longed for by the people in Qinghai Province and the Tibetan Autonomous Region,'' Zhu Zhensheng, executive vice director of the Qingzang Railway Office of the Chinese Railway Administration, said in a news briefing this week. ''The railway provides capacity for the quick flow of people, goods and information and will directly contribute to the development'' of the area.
 Mao proposed extending a railway to Tibet after the People's Liberation Army invaded the territory and brought it firmly under Chinese control in 1951, sending the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, into exile.
 The first section, from Beijing to Golmud in Qinghai Province, was completed in 1984. 
 But the 710-mile section connecting Golmud to Lhasa was delayed indefinitely. That section had to cross the Tibetan Plateau, survive extreme temperatures and stay fixed in the shifting permafrost of the highlands.
 The plan was revived in 2001, when it was promoted as a crucial element of the Communist Party's Go West campaign. Engineers designed bridges to span the most treacherous area of permafrost and sank naturally cooled piping into the ground to keep the track bed frozen year-round, reducing instability. 
 Canada's Bombardier Inc. supplied specially outfitted train carriages that have artificial oxygen, like that used in aircraft, to prevent sickness among passengers at high altitudes.
 A direct Beijing-to-Lhasa luxury train was officially unveiled Saturday to coincide with the 85th anniversary of the founding of the governing Communist Party. State news media have been promoting the train for weeks as a new feather in the cap of state engineers who also celebrated the formal completion of the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest dam, this spring.
 But the event is being tightly controlled by Chinese officials to ensure favorable coverage. They handpicked 40 foreign journalists to ride the first train. Other news organizations, including The New York Times, that bought train tickets independently were denied requisite permits to enter Tibetan territory.
 Even at the official price of $4.1 billion, the railway is hard to justify in economic terms alone. Tibet's total gross domestic product in 2005 was $3.12 billion, so the payoff for the railway in terms of lifting economic activity would appear to lie decades in the future, if it ever comes.
 Moreover, foreign engineers who have been involved with elements of the project, but asked not to be identified because they did not wish to offend their Chinese sponsors, say the railway will require heavy expenditures on maintenance and may be hard to run for more than a decade without an extensive overhaul.
 Tibetans who have voiced reservations say they do not oppose the railway in principle but argue that it was conceived mainly to enhance China's economic and military control over the Tibetan region. They say it will also aid Chinese exploitation of mineral resources in the Tibetan highlands.
 They say Chinese investment in other vital infrastructure, like roads to connect Tibetan towns and electrification of rural villages, remains a lower priority.
 Even as they promote the rail line, Chinese officials still focus heavily on combating what they call Tibetan separatism, especially the resilient loyalty there to the Dalai Lama.
 Zhang Qingli, who was recently appointed as the Communist Party's top official in Tibet, told party leaders there in May that they were engaged in ''a fight to the death'' against the Dalai Lama, according to The Tibet Daily.

HEADLINE: Markets Soar on Hint of End to Rate Increases

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market surged to its biggest weekly gains in months last week on optimism that the Federal Reserve had nearly finished tightening interest rates. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.2 percent on Thursday, its biggest daily gain in three years. Federal Reserve policy makers on Thursday raised short-term rates for a 17th consecutive time. But a statement released after their meeting said that further rate increases depended ''on the outlook for inflation and economic growth,'' signaling, perhaps, that the central bank might not increase rates again at its next meeting.
The market gave up some ground on Friday, however, with technology companies falling particularly hard, after Apple Computer said that it was reviewing stock options grants made between 1997 and 2001. One of the grants had been made to Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, the company said. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 161.13 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 11,150.22. The S.& P. 500 gained 25.70 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 1,270.20. The Nasdaq composite index rose 50.62 points, or 2.4 percent, to close at 2,172.09. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 5.14 percent from 5.22 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Jay-Z Puts a Cap on Cristal

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS CENTURY; Lola Ogunnaike and Paula Schwartz contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
HIP-HOP made Cristal a household name. Can it also unmake it?
 Since the rapper Jay-Z called for a boycott of the Champagne after its maker seemed to sniff at its popularity with rap stars, some in the music, night life and beverage industries are predicting a long-term flattening of the $300-a-bottle bubbly.
The first evidence of any effect the boycott might have come Tuesday night in Los Angeles at the BET Awards, which drew an A-list of African-American entertainers like Kanye West, Sean Combs, Mary J. Blige, Prince and Jamie Foxx. But something was missing.
 ''You normally see Cristal around these festive events, and it was noticeably absent this year,'' said Marvet Britto, the head of a New York public relations and brand strategy company specializing in the African-American market. ''If you saw Champagne on a table, it was Dom Perignon and Veuve Clicquot.'' Ms. Britto said this was in stark contrast to last year's MTV Music Awards in Miami, where ''you saw people walking the red carpet with Cristal like a badge of honor.'' 
 ''That's Jay-Z's influence as a tastemaker,'' she added. ''He's the E. F. Hutton of hip-hop.''
 And what exactly did this E. F. Hutton say about Cristal, whose name he once liberally dropped into his songs as a symbol of the plush life? Two weeks ago, the rapper announced that Cristal would no longer be served at his chain of 40/40 nightclubs, and he called for a consumer boycott. He was reacting to a quotation by Frederic Rouzaud, the president of Champagne Louis Roederer (maker of Cristal) in The Economist magazine.
 Asked by an interviewer if the association with rap's bling-bling set could hurt the brand, Mr. Rouzaud was quoted as saying: ''That's a good question, but what can we do? We can't forbid people from buying it.'' (Mr. Rouzaud later issued a statement saying that the company had ''the utmost regard for, and interest in, all forms of art and culture.'')
 In a phone interview last week, Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, said he didn't appreciate the tone of Mr. Rouzaud's initial remarks. ''Surely he meant to say, 'Thank you,' right?'' Mr. Carter said, referring to the free publicity his and other rappers' music and videos have given the brand over the years. ''Anything but a 'Thank you' is racist.''
 MR. CARTER had also vowed to expunge references to Cristal from his songs at a concert at Radio City Music Hall last Sunday that marked the 10th anniversary of his first album, ''Reasonable Doubt.'' He did so in some songs, but in others -- perhaps because it's harder to come up with rhymes for Dom Perignon -- he left the mention of the brand.
 ''When I was conscious, I could change them,'' he said by way of explanation. ''When I perform sometimes I go in so far. That's where you're supposed to really operate the whole time, on an unconscious level.'' 
 Mr. Carter, who once famously rapped, ''I'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man,'' was ranked at No. 16 in Fortune magazine's ''40 Under 40'' list in 2004 with a net worth of $286 million. Largely retired as a performer, he keeps busy as president of Def Jam records and as a part-owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team. He is keenly aware of the power of music to build brands. The materialistic mid-90's school of rap he championed, along with Notorious B.I.G. and others, was a beat-heavy version of the Robb Report, full of references to luxury products. Of his then-favorite Champagne, he rapped in 1996: 
 ''I keep it realer than most, 
 I know you're feelin' it
 Cristal on ice, I like to toast, 
 I keep on spillin' it.''
 ''Every beverage company would like to attract more African-Americans to their brand,'' said Gary Reagan, an author and a beverage expert who runs ArdentSpirits.com. ''If one beverage company has turned off a prominent African-American, I would imagine that will not make the company particularly happy.'' (Maison Marques & Domaines, the American importer of Cristal, did not respond to requests for comment.) 
 Other corporations that have experienced a strained relationship with African-American consumers have paid a price. In 1993, after an executive of Timberland, whose boots were popular with urban youths, said in an interview with The New York Times that the majority of its customers were not hip-hop fans but ''honest working people,'' the company was forced into aggressive damage control.
 The fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger undertook an image adjustment campaign in 1996, after rumors spread that he did not want young blacks or Asians wearing his preppy clothing. Though the rumors were unfounded, Mr. Hilfiger responded with a marked outreach, and now has leading rap stars as models and licensing partners. 
 In Cristal's case, Ms. Britto and others spoke of the effect that this boycott may have beyond the hip-hop scene. ''African-Americans are responsible for so much of the adoptive, contagious behavior patterns that spread globally,'' Ms. Britto said. ''We're the igniters of trends and brand acceleration, or in the case of Cristal, brand deceleration.''
 Several nightclub owners and managers, however, said they were not certain whether the boycott would spread beyond a handful of millionaire musicians, athletes and movie stars. ''I think I've noticed a slight drop-off in Cristal in the club,'' said Noel Ashman, the owner of the Manhattan celebrity haunt Plumm, where Cristal served at a table is $550 a bottle. ''You have to recognize how deeply respected Jay-Z is, so his position definitely will have an effect.'' 
 But because Cristal is produced in very small quantities and only in vintage years (1999 is the latest), the bad publicity may have little overall effect on sales; plenty of drinkers are more attracted by its 98-point ratings from wine critics than by its mention in rap songs. 
 Cristal accounts for a tiny drop in the American market for Champagne. Its maker, Louis Roederer, ranked eighth among imports of Champagne houses to the United States in 2004, according to Frank Walters, research director at M. Shanken Communications, which publishes Wine Spectator magazine. Roederer had 3 percent of the import market, behind Moet & Chandon, with 41 percent, and Veuve Clicquot, with 20 percent.
 And Mr. Walters said less than 20 percent of Roederer's sales were for its Cristal bottling, its top-of-the line cuvee, which the house says was first created in 1876 for Czar Alexander II.
 Precisely because of its scarcity, with a price to match, Cristal has enjoyed its cachet with rappers. ''Hip-hop has always been an aspirational lifestyle,'' said June Ambrose, a fashion stylist who has worked with Mariah Carey, Jay-Z and Ms. Blige. ''In the beginning, the goal was just, 'Give me the most expensive watch, the most expensive car, the most expensive bottle of Champagne.' '' 
 In hip-hop's formative years, rappers like the Cold Crush Brothers, Melle Mel and the Sugarhill Gang dropped names like Rolex, Cadillac and Moet & Chandon. Club patrons would often fill an empty Moet bottle from the bathroom sink to impress fellow partygoers. Twenty-five years later, multimillionaire rappers and their acolytes no longer have to play-act. The car of choice is now the $300,000 Mercedes-Benz Maybach, the watch is a diamond-encrusted Audemars Piguet and Moet (which can be had for under $100 in many clubs in New York and Los Angeles) has been way outpaced by Cristal, typically the top-dollar bottle in any nightspot.
 Mr. Reagan said he expected that other prominent Champagne producers ''will be tempted to woo Jay-Z to their brand.''
 But Jay-Z said he has not yet been approached by Cristal's competitors. ''I'm not championing a specific brand,'' he said. ''I'm experimenting with a lot of roses now. I've always loved Dom P. rose, but Krug rose is also excellent right now.''
 ''I hope they're cool with us drinking it,'' he added. ''I would hate to have to go through this again.''

HEADLINE: The Ultra-Rich Give Differently From You and Me

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
PHILANTHROPY, like foie gras, is an acquired taste. And Warren Buffett embraced charity with extraordinary gusto last week, announcing that he would give away 85 percent of his $44 billion fortune. 
 His megagifts, like many of his investments, buck the popular trend. Giving by the richest Americans has fallen in recent years, with the biggest declines at the very top, based on deductions Americans take on their tax returns. Among Americans who at death left a taxable fortune of $20 million or more, the average charitable bequest fell by $2 million, or 9 percent, from 1995 to 2004.
 Almost alone among rich Americans, Mr. Buffett has argued that estate taxes should be increased, not eliminated. Mr. Buffett says the estate tax helps build a vibrant economy of innovators and strivers -- a true meritocracy -- and that repealing it would risk a stunted economy controlled by aristocratic inheritors. Repealing the estate tax, he has said, would be the economic equivalent of ''choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics.''
 Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft and close friend of Mr. Buffett, has not taken a public position on the estate tax, but his father leads the movement to keep it. Few ultrarich families agree, and 18 have spent $500 million since 1994 lobbying for estate tax repeal, according to disclosure records examined by Public Citizen and United for a Fair Economy, which want to keep the tax.
 How do they give compared with the Gates and Buffett families? In some prominent cases, not nearly as generously. The Walton family owns Wal-Mart stock worth more than $90 billion, more than twice the value of the Gates family's Microsoft stock. But the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is 35 times larger than the Walton Family Foundation, tax records show.
 The Mars family, known for its candy company, has an estimated net worth of $12 billion. The Mars Foundation gave away $795,000 in 2004 -- 97 grants averaging $8,200 each. The Walton Foundation gave away 127 times as much, the Gates Foundation more than 1,900 times. ''The Waltons have said they will increase their charitable giving in the future,'' said Jay Allen, a family spokesman. The Mars Foundation said the family did not comment on such matters.
 Of course, until last week, Mr. Buffett was not known for his giving, either.

HEADLINE: Buffett Children Emerge as a Force in Charity 

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: DECATUR, Ill., June 28 

 BODY:
The three middle-aged children of Warren E. Buffett watched along with the rest of the country last week as their father, the celebrated investor, told the world that he would pass the bulk of his $40 billion personal fortune to the charitable foundation of Bill Gates, a fellow billionaire, and his wife, Melinda.
 But Susie, Howard and Peter Buffett -- who, like their self-effacing father seem little affected by money -- spent the week focusing not on what they might have received. Instead, the siblings said in interviews, they were already at work trying to figure out how to manage a gift from their father valued at about $1 billion each that will go to their own charitable foundations.
That will propel them, along with a larger foundation named for their late mother, into the top ranks of philanthropy -- dwarfed, to be sure, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the $60 billion or more endowment from the Gates and Buffett fortunes. 
 The younger Buffetts, given their current interests, could emerge as powerful forces in the areas of early childhood education, safe drinking water and the well-being of Native Americans.
 The foundation named for their mother -- Warren Buffett and two of his children are on the board -- will roughly double in size to about $5 billion. It will be able to greatly increase spending on birth control and on making abortions available, a cause supported by both Warren Buffett and his late wife, Susan Thompson Buffett. He has spoken relatively little about the issue in public, and neither did she.
 The Buffett children have long been aware of their father's contempt for inherited wealth. ''He signaled early and often to his children what his intentions were. They built their lives accordingly,'' said Sherry S. Barrat, who manages money for rich families as president of personal finance at the Northern Trust Company.
 Indeed, Howard Buffett said, ''It was always clear we were not going to get a lot of money. If my dad said, 'either you can have $50 million a year personally or $50 million a year for the foundation,' I'd put it in the foundation. What would you do with $50 million if you didn't give it away?''
 All of Warren Buffett's gifts are planned to be stretched out over about 20 years. (He declined to be interviewed for this article.)
 The Buffett siblings said they support the large gift, valued at about $31 billion, to the Gates' foundation. ''Gates is geared up, doing all sorts of worldwide stuff,'' Howard Buffett said. ''They're prepared to handle it.''
 Like their father, who despite his wealth could easily pass for an insurance man (which in the simplest terms he is), the younger Buffetts stand in stark contrast with so many other children of wealth.
 They live comfortably, though not lavishly. They get some money from their father. And they appear to be working hard at their foundations and at other pursuits. In interviews, they returned again and again to their upbringing.
 ''When I was little, every night my dad rocked me to sleep and sang 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow,' '' said Susie Buffett, the oldest, who is 52. She lives 10 blocks from her father in Omaha and still calls him Daddy, she said.
 ''I just think of him as my dad,'' said Howard Buffett, 51. Howard looks like his father, sporting big 1970's-style glasses and the beginnings of a sandy-colored comb-over. The son of a technophobe, Howard said he won't touch e-mail. He lives here in Decatur, near an 800-acre farm he owns, and spends much of his time traveling the world to photograph wildlife and poor people.
 Peter Buffett, 48, is a new age musician and composer who plays the keyboard. He has just moved from Milwaukee to New York City, where he finds people are far more impressed by wealth than in his native Midwest. 
 His mother was an occasional nightclub singer, but he credits his father, too, for his musical success. ''He would always sing and whistle around the house,'' Peter Buffett said, who went to Stanford for about a year and a half.
 As children and young adults in the 1960's and 70's, the siblings said, their father was not yet famous. ''We did not grow up with Warren being No. 2 on the list'' of richest Americans, Susie Buffett said. ''We grew up in a normal situation.'' 
 The family housed high school foreign-exchange students. As teenagers 18 months apart, Susie and Howard fought over the family car.
 The investing genius's children went off to college and all three dropped out before graduating. ''I had a great run in high school, academically, and then I got to college and just struggled,'' said Howard, who spent one year at Augustana College in Sioux Falls, S.D., and one year at University of California, Irvine. When he told his parents he was quitting school, he said, ''neither of them was very happy about it.''
 Howard loved heavy machinery. He bought a bulldozer and began doing residential excavation work around Omaha. His father got him a job at See's Candies, a Berkshire-owned company, in California. There, Howard met his future wife, Devon, who already had four daughters, and they all moved back to Omaha. ''I missed the Midwest,'' he said. They also had a son together.
 Howard is the only Republican in the Buffett family, he said. Asked who is the most liberal of the Buffetts, Howard rolled his eyes. ''They're all liberal,'' he said.
 Susie initially majored in home economics. ''If we didn't have foundations to run, Howie would farm. I would be sewing, knitting and quilting,'' she said. 
 She dropped out of the University of California, Irvine, just shy of an undergraduate degree because she was enjoying work as an administrative assistant, making $525 a month. ''I thought, boy, it just doesn't get any better than this.''
 She moved to Washington, working at magazines, initially as an assistant. There she met her husband, Allen Greenberg, a lawyer for Public Citizen, a liberal public health advocacy group. Warren Buffett? ''I had never heard of him,'' Mr. Greenberg said in an interview.
 The business mogul and public interest lawyer, however, came to admire each other. Susie said her husband told her in the late 1980's, '' 'I think the smartest, most interesting person you could work for is your dad, but I don't want you to tell him that.' ''
 Mr. Buffett, she said, in turn asked his daughter, '' 'If Allen could do anything, what would it be?' '' Soon, the couple moved to Omaha and Mr. Greenberg went to work at the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation.
 Mr. Greenberg and Susie Buffett divorced, amicably, about 10 years ago. They have two children. Susie currently runs her foundation and serves on the board of the trust named for her mom.
 Warren Buffett's original plan was to leave most of his fortune to that foundation. He expected his wife to outlive him and that she would oversee the charitable work. But she died in 2004.
 That same year, the foundation gave away about $21 million. Planned Parenthood and some of its local chapters received large grants. So did some other providers of, and advocates for, reproductive services, including abortion. The foundation also seeks to finance nuclear nonproliferation efforts. But it has found few chances for nongovernment entities to exert influence in that field, Mr. Greenberg said.
 He declined to comment on grants involving birth control. The foundation is wary of anti-abortion sentiment. Pampered Chef, owned by Berkshire, was the target of a boycott organized by anti-abortion advocates displeased that some Berkshire contributions went tothe abortion-rights foundation. So, in 2003, Mr. Buffett ended the charitable contribution program at Berkshire.
 Mr. Buffett, however, is giving that foundation almost three times as much as he is giving each foundation run by his children. He did not explain why. And it also has $2 billion to $2.5 billion from the estate of Mrs. Buffett. Its gifts could increase to more than $200 million a year.
 Peter Buffett and his wife, Jennifer, 40, run his foundation together, and they are slowly educating themselves on what it will take to run a bigger institution. They are proud of their early-education grants, following his sister's lead, and of a small grant that helped a Canadian Indian tribe recover one of its totem poles that ended up in Sweden.
 They plan to consult with philanthropy experts, Bill and Melinda Gates included. ''We're going to do great things,'' Jennifer Buffett said, citing basic human needs like clean water, education, health care and nutrition. As for specifics, ''ask us in a year,'' she said.
 All three siblings may find a $1 billion foundation significantly more work than one a tenth that size. ''It takes some work. They're going to have to find some staff to help them,'' said Michael Cawley, president of the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation in Ardmore, Okla., which has about $1 billion in funds.
 To pursue its founder's goal of improving agriculture, the Noble Foundation employs more than 300 people and directly conducts research. By closely managing operations, ''our comfort is higher,'' Mr. Cawley said.
 The Buffett children each said they plan to operate with just a handful of staff members, giving to groups that then directly perform charitable work. Their father, after all, runs one of the country's biggest corporations with an office staff in Omaha of fewer than two dozen.

HEADLINE: How to Educate Young Scientists

 BODY:
The United States could easily fall from its privileged perch in the global economy unless it does something about the horrendous state of science education at both the public school and university levels. That means finding ways to enliven a dry and dispiriting style of science instruction that leads as many as half of the country's aspiring scientists to quit the field before they leave college. 
 The emerging consensus among educators is that students need early, engaging experiences in the lab -- and much more mentoring than most of them receive now -- to maintain their interest and inspire them to take up careers in the sciences.
Some universities have already realized the need for better ways of teaching. But this means revising an incentive system that has historically rewarded scientists for making discoveries and publishing academic papers, not for nurturing the next generation of great minds. 
 The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the country's largest private supporter of science education, is well ahead of the curve, and has been pushing universities in this direction for several years under the leadership of Thomas Cech, a Nobel laureate. The institute recently announced its latest batch of 20 ''million dollar professors,'' who will use their grant money to explore and expand innovative approaches to teaching science. 
 The institute has also awarded grants to 50 universities aimed at providing richer undergraduate science education as well as mentoring and early research experiences with working scientists. Many of the grants will be used partly to advertise the virtues of scientific study not just at universities but also in high schools and middle schools.
 These programs send a powerful message at a time when the country needs to be paying attention to remaking science education. Congress, which has been casting for ways to address this problem, would do well to emulate them.

HEADLINE: Retreat at Valley Forge

BYLINE: By Judith H. Dobrzynski. 
Judith H. Dobrzynski is a former reporter and editor at The Times.

 BODY:
FOURTH of July weekend is justly renowned for its celebrations of beaches, barbecues, baseball and, of course, fireworks. But if you're yearning for a slightly more soul-stirring way to celebrate our nation's independence, perhaps you should make a trip to the national Revolutionary War museum. 
 Unfortunately, you'll need patience. Though the idea was first proposed more than a century ago, a national Revolutionary War museum still does not exist. Thank the federal government for that. 
For years, a nonprofit group has worked to create an American Revolution Center at Valley Forge, Pa., the place where, 18 months after independence was declared, Gen. George Washington transformed a collection of amateurs into a military corps capable of defeating the mighty British.
 Valley Forge is surely the right location. The National Park Service already operates the Valley Forge National Historical Park, which includes hundreds of archaeological sites, extensive archives and even the stone building Washington used as headquarters during that fateful winter. But unlike nearby Gettysburg, Valley Forge is now more of a recreational park than hallowed ground. To remedy that, Congress in 1999 approved the creation of a public-private partnership between the Park Service and the American Revolution Center. The State of Pennsylvania put aside $20 million for the project, and the center's board, along with its chief executive, Thomas M. Daly, set out to raise $100 million or more. In addition, the center recruited an impressive advisory board , including historians David McCullough, Thomas Fleming and Richard R. Beeman. It commissioned the architect Robert A. M. Stern to design a 108,000-square-foot building that suits the landscape's contours while providing 30,000 square feet of galleries, as well as a theater, cafe and educational space. 
 The center planned to fill those galleries with a trove of items, including an enormous private collection consisting of letters from Valley Forge, a soldier's discharge signed by Washington, a gold-and-silver presentation sword that had belonged to Louis XVI, a large archaeological collection, muskets, uniforms, documents, historic art works and more. The Valley Forge Historical Society agreed to donate the tent used by Washington at Valley Forge. When combined with the Park Service's own collection, the center's assemblage of Revolutionary War items would almost certainly be the largest in the world. 
 Initially, everyone seemed pleased, with the center setting a target date to open in 2006. Then it all fell apart. While the reasons remain unclear, they smack of politics and turf battles. 
 In 2004, the House of Representatives passed legislation requiring Congressional approval of any Park Service partnership costing more than $5 million. Fearing meddling in its affairs, the Park Service ordered the center to stop raising funds -- just as it was about to receive a $10-million gift from the Oneida Indian Nation, whose ancestors had fought alongside the Continental Army. 
 Then the Park Service, already constrained by shrinking budgets, began questioning its ability to sustain the extra maintenance costs associated with the center, which it expected to attract an additional 700,000 visitors to the park each year. Park Service administrators talked of scaling back the center by half. Partisans of the center, meanwhile, suspected the Park Service secretly wanted control of the museum and its collections. 
 Mounting his own rebellion, Mr. Daly canceled the center's partnership with the Park Service last fall and began exploring other options. In December, Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, whose state had ceded Valley Forge to the National Park Service only 30 years ago, asked for it -- or at least a part of it -- back. Writing to Gale Norton, then the interior secretary, he said the state would agree to swallow any operating shortfalls at the center. But in March, the director of the Park Service, Fran Mainella, rejected the governor's offer. 
 Such is the sad state of affairs at the site where, nearly 230 years ago, a ragtag bunch of rebels changed the course of world history. 
 Yet their inspirational story deserves to be told and retold. The new interior secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, could make himself a hero by ordering the Park Service to work out a deal allowing the center to go forward with its plans. The museum's estimated operating costs of $9 million a year could be covered by admissions and other income sources, like concessions. 
 While federal spending must be reined in, iconic Valley Forge seems an odd place to fall victim to small economies and petty politics. Considering the many earmarks members of Congress sneak into legislation each year, it seems there ought to be room for an earmark to finance something truly worthwhile. 
 A museum at Valley Forge was an idea whose time had come 100 years ago. Building it should not require the kind of stamina and perseverance exemplified by the site's famous winter encampment. There's simply no excuse for that.

HEADLINE: In Canada, the Torch Is Passed on a Quiet but Profitable Legacy

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 2 

 BODY:
The Thomson Corporation may be the biggest media company most people have never heard of. 
 Those with long memories may recall it as the owner of The Times of London and a string of newspapers in small-town America. But Thomson, based in Toronto, sold those papers a long time ago and has turned itself into a major purveyor of media of a different sort -- specialized, high-end electronic information sold by subscription to lawyers, financial traders, academics and physicians.
Last year, Thomson posted revenues of $8.7 billion, exceeding the $7.59 billion reported by the newspaper leader Gannett.
 ''If you ask most people in the financial community if they know Thomson, they won't,'' said Andrea Horan, a media company analyst with Genuity Capital Markets in Toronto. ''But they all know their products.'' 
 Equally low key are the primary owners of Thomson, the Thomson family, who hold 70 percent of the company's shares. When he died last month, Kenneth R. Thomson was worth $19.6 billion, according to Forbes magazine, making him the ninth richest person in the world. Following a plan mapped out decades ago by Roy Thomson, the company's founder, control of the family's money passed to David K. R. Thomson, Kenneth's oldest son and the chairman of Thomson for the last four years. 
 While Kenneth, an art collector, was famously publicity-shy, he was still well-known in Canada for his comparatively modest life, which included flying economy class, doing his own shopping and taking a keen interest in almost every dog that crossed his path. David, 48, whose ascent in the family business began about a decade ago, has surpassed his father in terms of avoiding publicity. David has rarely granted interviews, and would not comment for this article. 
 The question now for Thomson is whether David can continue the company's unusually successful, if low-profile, growth. When Kenneth took over at Roy's death in 1976, Thomson was worth about $500 million dollars. The company is now valued about $29.3 billion.
 ''I personally think that the family's support has been one of the keys, if not the key, to the spectacular performance of Thomson,'' said Roger L. Martin, a Thomson director and dean of the University of Toronto's Joseph L. Rotman School of Management. ''So many companies have tried to transform and crashed and burned, failed miserably. I challenge anybody to show me someone else who has done this kind of transformation.''
 Under the system established by Roy, the Thomson family operates through two companies. The publicly traded Thomson operates mainly from Stamford, Conn. The Woodbridge Company, based in Toronto, owns most of the family's 70 percent stake in Thomson as well as other properties, including a 40 percent stake in Bell Globemedia, which now owns The Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto as well as CTV, Canada's largest commercial television network. David, along with his brother, Peter J. Thomson, became co-chairmen of Woodbridge after their father's death.
 In the same way that Kenneth and now David automatically inherited Roy Thomson's British title of Lord Thomson of Fleet, both had little say about their futures.
 ''David, my grandson, will have to take his part in the running of the Organisation and David's son, too,'' Roy Thomson wrote in his 1975 autobiography. ''With the fortune that we will leave to them go also responsibilities. These Thomson boys that come after Ken are not going to be able, even if they want to, to shrug off these responsibilities.''
 In a recent interview, W. Geoffrey Beattie, the president of Woodbridge and deputy chairman of Thomson, dismissed the commonly held view in Canada that David Thomson mainly devotes his time to art and leaves the family business in the hands of professional managers.
 ''We're all engaged,'' he said of the executives at both companies and the family members. ''We all work together, and that's what gives the whole thing its strength.''
 Mr. Beattie, 46, was once a lawyer with Torys, a large corporate law firm in Toronto that has advised the Thomson family for decades. His predecessor at Woodbridge, John A. Tory, whose father founded the law firm, not only set up the dual company structure but also guided both Roy and Kenneth Thomson on most of their major investments.
 Unlike some family holding companies, Woodbridge's role is utterly unsentimental. 
 ''The only mandate Woodbridge has is to create value for its shareholders,'' said Mr. Beattie, who has worked with the family for about 20 years.
 Many family companies, Mr. Beattie said, attempt to maintain the traditional family businesses and end up effectively becoming prisoners of those assets.
 By contrast, Mr. Beattie said that in the last 40 years, the Thomson family has found itself changing at least half its holdings through the course of each decade. In addition to newspapers, Thomson has withdrawn from the oil and gas business, the travel industry and department store retailing among other things.
 The latest transformation of Thomson began 10 years ago when Thomson acquired the West Publishing Company, a legal information supplier based in Eagan, Minn., for $3.4 billion.
 The idea behind the move, Mr. Beattie said, was to get into a business that was not much affected by swings in the economy -- delivering ''information people absolutely have to have to do their jobs.'' 
 The Justice Department filed an antitrust complaint against the West purchase. To win approval for the deal, Thomson agreed to sell nearly two dozen of West's publications.
 At the same time, many investors were alarmed about the debt that Thomson took on to acquire West. The solution, Mr. Beattie said, which came from the family, was to reinvest all of the dividends into the company for a minimum of five years. The company's rapid growth, and the resulting dividend boost that followed West's acquisition, meant that the debt was paid off in about two years.
 A major player in Thomson's move out of newspapers and into professional information has been Richard J. Harrington, who became the chief executive and president of Thomson around the time of the West deal. Under Mr. Harrington, an accountant, Thomson has come to dominate somewhat arcane businesses. Thomson First Call, for example, compiles stock analysts' earnings estimates. Its legal and regulatory group is a provider of case law for lawyers and other information like trademark histories.
 Except for its educational division, which still publishes a substantial number of conventional textbooks, Thomson had the good fortune to move into these businesses as customers were demanding electronic delivery of their information. In some markets, Thomson was able to move past other players who were more cautious about digital conversion.
 While Thomson dominates some fields, it is still notably absent in others. Ms. Horan, the analyst, said the company's scientific and health care group was nearly absent from the business of publishing scholarly journals.
 While Thomson's operations lack glamour, they are much more profitable than, say, making movies. But even Mr. Beattie acknowledges that they do little to raise the overall company's profile.
 That may explain why about 80 percent of the shares not owned by the family are in Canadian hands. While Canadian investors may not know the details of all of Thomson's holdings, they certainly know about the family's wealth.
 Mr. Beattie insisted that the public's perception of David as a distant and sometimes irritable aesthete was wrong, though David himself has done little to fill in the blanks. The only substantial interview he has given was to James FitzGerald, who wrote a book about the elite private school they both attended in Toronto. In his comments to Mr. FitzGerald 12 years ago, David had little positive to say about many people in the business world.
 ''When you try to live a more balanced life, traditional businessmen think that you are not a real man,'' Mr. Thomson said then. ''But who is not the real man? You are telling me? You have not taken a weekend with your wife, you have no spare time that you use constructively, you do not have any hobbies, you do not know how to spell Mozart. And here you are telling me that I am weak?''
 This spring, his particularly bitter divorce action against his second wife was given detailed cover treatment by Maclean's, a Canadian news magazine, although it was largely ignored by other media outlets. Mr. Thomson's son from that marriage, who was born after the couple separated, is the company's designated heir. David Thomson also has two daughters from his previous marriage.
 Mr. Beattie said that David's style was different from his father's ''but his core values are the same.''
 Those style differences, it seems, are unlikely to extend to raising the profile of the Thomson brand, but the company's record to date suggests that is not an issue.

HEADLINE: TOP EXECUTIVES RETURN OFFICES TO MANHATTAN 

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
For the last half of the 20th century, New York City's status as the national capital of business steadily eroded as companies fled to the suburbs and to other cities where costs were lower and the streets safer.
 But in the last several years, New York has regained its magnetic force and is re-establishing its claim as the city of big bosses. If decision-making were an industry, it would be one of the main engines driving New York's economy.
 The number of corporate headquarters and subsidiaries in Manhattan has more than doubled since 1990, according to the federal Department of Labor. In the last few years, the number of Fortune 500 companies based in the city has been inching upward, reversing a long, steep decline that accelerated during the financial crisis of the early 1970's.
 But those new arrivals are not the monolithic corporate headquarters of the past, packed with thousands of middle managers and supporting personnel. They have been pared to hold only those people whose presence in the high-priced corridors of New York is considered essential. 
 That evolution has been made possible by technological advances that allow corporate generals to stay in touch with their troops from afar. The bosses can network face to face with their peers in the hub of the financial, legal and communications industries, while keeping the rank and file in less expensive quarters in suburbs or other cities.
 The trend is a turnabout from the urban exodus that the sociologist William H. Whyte denounced in 1976 when he railed against the ''move-outs'' by dozens of companies, including General Electric and PepsiCo. The chief executives of Alcoa, Federated Department Stores and CIT Group have all set up offices for themselves in Manhattan in the past few years, while leaving the bulk of their administrative operations elsewhere. 
 More corporate leaders have come to believe that ''they need to be in a global city,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, the chief executive of the New York City Partnership, a business consortium.
 ''They can't afford to be in the boondocks,'' she said. 
 And with the pay of senior executives rising rapidly, they can afford to pay New York rents, restaurant tabs and private-school tuitions.
 Indeed, the city's surveys have shown that the personal preference of the chief executive is one of the most important factors in determining whether a company moves to or from New York, according to Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding.
 The Bloomberg administration has courted chief executives to move to the city, in the hope that they will eventually bring large numbers of jobs with them, Mr. Doctoroff said. But luring chief executives no longer guarantees big additions to local payrolls and tax revenues. Some of the new arrivals came without receiving any tax incentives, which are usually reserved for attracting or retaining large numbers of jobs.
 In contrast, when Goldman Sachs threatened last year to cancel plans to build a new headquarters in Lower Manhattan to house 9,000 employees, the city and state promised at least $150 million in tax breaks to persuade it to stay.
 ''We are a headquarters city,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, adding that the city had not lost the headquarters of any big corporations in five years. ''Our ability to continue to make that claim is dependent on forward movement and success in attracting more C.E.O.'s.''
 Michael L. Dolfman, the regional commissioner of labor statistics, said that the number of company head offices in Manhattan has risen at a fast pace since the last major recession in New York.
 The category of corporate, subsidiary and regional managing offices, which Mr. Dolfman said comprised stand-alone bases of operations for corporate enterprises, grew to 602 last year from 274 in 1990, adding more than 12,000 jobs. 
 In New York, he said, corporate management is an industry unto itself -- and a lucrative one.
 The average annual salary of the people working in those head offices jumped during the past 15 years, to about $160,000 from about $64,000, Mr. Dolfman said. But the average number of jobs in those head offices declined to 78 from 127.
 ''You don't see a great increase in the number of jobs,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''You see a great increase in the average salary.'' 
 Alcoa, the giant aluminum producer, and Federated, which owns the Macy's and Bloomingdale's retail chains, are prime examples of the new form of disembodied head offices, economic development officials said. In each case, the establishment of headquarters in New York was somewhat stealthy, in part because of the political sensitivities and threats to morale that surround any corporation's move from its historical hometown. 
 Alain J. P. Belda set up his office on Park Avenue shortly after he became Alcoa's chairman and chief executive in 2001. He and about 50 executives and their assistants operate from space in the Lever House building, where their presence is unmarked: no Alcoa signs or logos are visible outside the building. 
 Back in Pittsburgh, about 2,000 people work in the Alcoa Corporate Center, a six-story landmark that was completed in 1998. Many Alcoa shareholders may well have believed that the building was the company's headquarters; only in the spring of this year did the company acknowledge for the first time in its annual report that the head office had moved to New York after a half-century in Pittsburgh. 
 ''In some sense, it's almost a relic to talk about the corporate headquarters,'' said Jake Siewert, a vice president at Alcoa. He said that the company's senior executives were frequently on the move and ''do deals all over the world.''
 Mr. Belda, the chief executive, could not be reached for comment for this article. But in a speech to the New York City Business Summit, he explained the benefits of having the company's top-ranking executives in close proximity to their peers.
 ''We need access to the best and the brightest,'' Mr. Belda said. ''We need it when we need it, not a week from today when they can lose a whole day to come and meet with us in Pittsburgh. We need them for breakfast meetings, for just a five-minute break, when the idea or the need comes. We need it every day.''
 Alcoa appeared on the Fortune 500 list as a New York-based company for the first time this year, as did CIT Group, a financial company that was based in Livingston, N.J., before it built a flashy high-rise on Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street.
 Jeffrey M. Peek, who has been CIT's chief executive for two years, lives on Park Avenue and is treasurer of the New York City Ballet. Mr. Peek declined to comment for this article, but when CIT opened its new building in late April, he said, ''The opening of our global headquarters in the financial capital of the world will establish a global footprint from which CIT can better serve our clients.'' The company kept its Livingston campus, which it calls its ''corporate center.'' 
 The Fortune list, by definition, captures activity only among the very largest corporations -- and not even all of those. Because Federated puts a Cincinnati address first on its financial reports, the magazine still lists it among Ohio-based companies, even though its chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, has his office in the Macy's building on Herald Square.
 Even without credit for Federated, New York dominates the list compiled by Fortune, which ranks the biggest American companies by revenues. This year, the magazine said that 44 of them had headquarters in New York City, up from a recent low of 40 in 2002. (Houston, with 23, ranked second as a home for the Fortune 500.) 
 Among the recent immigrants that escaped Fortune's attention is Weight Watchers International. The company moved its headquarters to the Flatiron district from Woodbury on Long Island last summer, to be closer to the firms that provide professional services to it, and ''to draw from a wider pool of talent,'' said Meredith Shepherd, a senior vice president.
 ''It just makes for closer relationships and more synergy,'' Ms. Shepherd said. She added that the company ''has benefited from the energy and the pace the city has to offer.''
 Linda Huett, the chief executive of Weight Watchers International, also changed her residence to Manhattan, a company spokeswoman said. 
 Peter J. Solomon, a veteran investment banker who was the city's deputy mayor for economic policy and development in the late 1970's, cited several reasons for New York's renewed appeal to chief executives.
 ''One is it's fun,'' he said. ''People enjoy being here. It's totally different than the 1970's.''
 Mr. Solomon recalled those days when city officials spent much of their time fretting over the prospect of another company announcing a move to White Plains or Greenwich, Conn. ''We were desperately worried about losing brand names,'' he said. 
 Felix G. Rohatyn, another financier who worked to keep the city solvent back then, recalled how Paul Moore Jr., the Episcopal bishop of New York, stood in the pulpit of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine ''pleading with C.E.O.'s not to leave the city.''
 During the Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations, Mr. Rohatyn said, ''the reputation of the city and city government has really improved so dramatically'' with business leaders.
 ''There's kind of a fraternity of C.E.O.'s,'' he said, ''who think of themselves rightly or wrongly as the keepers of fiscal sanity.''
 Mr. Rohatyn and Mr. Solomon said the comings and goings of chief executives and their corporate offices did not carry the weight they once did because the economy was so much healthier now and because the rank and file of many companies no longer went with the chief executive.
 ''What would be awful would be if Goldman Sachs decided to put their headquarters in New Jersey,'' and shift hundreds or thousands of highly paid investment bankers and traders out of the city, Mr. Solomon said.

HEADLINE: Working For a Pittance 

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT; Paul Krugman is on vacation.

 BODY:
''We can no longer stand by and regularly give ourselves a pay increase while denying a minimum wage increase to the hardworking men and women across this nation.''
 -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, to her fellow senators.
The federal minimum wage, currently $5.15 an hour, was last raised in 1997. Since then, its purchasing power has deteriorated by 20 percent. Analysts at the Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities jointly crunched the numbers and determined that, after adjusting for inflation, the value of the minimum wage is at its lowest level since 1955. 
 For those who don't remember, Eisenhower was president in 1955, the Dodgers were still in Brooklyn, and Barack Obama hadn't even been born.
 If you're making the minimum wage, you're hurting. If Congress and the president don't raise the minimum wage by Dec. 2, it will have remained unchanged for the longest stretch since it was established in 1938. (The longest period previously was from January 1981 to April 1990 -- a span that saw the entire Reagan administration come and go.)
 Senate Republicans recently blocked a Democratic bill, sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy, that would have raised the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour over the next two years. Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, noted that while Republicans in Congress are standing like a stone wall against this modest increase in the poverty-level wage, ''they are working as hard as they can to repeal the estate tax.''
 ''That,'' he said, ''is just vicious class warfare.''
 The most important pay increases for most members of Congress are their own, and they are diligent in that regard. Senator Clinton, in a floor speech supporting the minimum-wage hike, said, ''During the past nine years, we've raised our own pay by $31,600.''
 Mrs. Clinton has introduced a bill that, in addition to raising the minimum wage to $7.25, would link Congressional pay raises to hikes in the minimum wage. Under the bill, the minimum wage would be increased automatically by the same percentage as any increase in Congressional pay.
 Polls have shown that Americans overwhelmingly favor an increase in the minimum wage. But the low-income workers who would benefit from such an increase are not part of the natural G.O.P. constituency. Thus, the stonewall.
 A separate study by the Economic Policy Institute found that in 2005, with the pay of top corporate executives up sharply, and with the minimum wage falling further and further behind inflation, ''an average chief executive officer was paid 821 times as much as a minimum wage earner.''
 That C.E.O., according to the study, ''earns more before lunchtime on the very first day of work in the year than a minimum wage worker earns all year.''
 ''The reality,'' said Senator Clinton, ''is that a full time job that pays the minimum wage just doesn't provide enough money to support a family today. We have to acknowledge that fact and do something about it. As a country, we cannot accept that a single mother with two children who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year earns $10,700 a year -- let me say this again: $10,700 a year. That is almost $6,000 below the federal poverty line for a family of three.''
 During the 1950's and 60's, the minimum wage was roughly 50 percent of the average wage of nonsupervisory workers. It has now fallen to 31 percent -- less than a third -- of that average.
 As the Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Budget pointed out in their study: ''Each year that Congress fails to raise the wage floor, its purchasing power erodes. The fact that the minimum wage has remained the same for nearly nine years means that its real value has declined considerably over that period. As inflation has accelerated recently due to higher energy costs, the real value of the minimum wage has fallen faster.''
 There is no justification -- none -- for condemning the nation's lowest-paid workers to this continuing slide into ever deeper economic distress. ''No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty,'' said Senator Kennedy.
 It's very telling that in the most prosperous nation in the world, that kind of comment actually sounds radical. We have a very long way to go.

HEADLINE: A New Survey Suggests That Britons Take a Dim View of the U.S.

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, July 2 

 BODY:
Most Britons asked in a new poll say that the United States is doing a bad job in Iraq, is indifferent to what the rest of the world thinks of it and, among its social characteristics, is racially divided, dominated by big business and obsessed with money. The results are in Monday's Daily Telegraph.
 The poll indicates that ''there has probably never been a time when America was held in such low esteem on this side of the Atlantic,'' Anthony King, a professor of government at Essex University, wrote in an analysis of the results published in The Telegraph. The Telegraph provided a copy of the data and commentary in advance of its publication to The New York Times. 
The ''special relationship'' that British leaders have long believed exists between their country and the United States ''may still thrive in Downing Street and at Camp David, but it has obviously atrophied among the British public,'' Professor King wrote in a reference to Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Bush.
 Online surveys of 1,962 adults were conducted by YouGov, a British polling organization, and weighted with demographic data to reflect a broad picture of the views of Britons. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points. 
 Those polled had more favorable attitudes toward Americans as individuals, with 70 percent of respondents saying they liked Americans ''a lot'' or ''a little.''
 But more than two-thirds said their overall opinion of the United States had worsened in recent years. The survey was taken between June 26 and 28. Its results seemed to reflect trends emerging since early 2003, when Mr. Blair defied much of British public opinion by siding with Mr. Bush on Iraq.
 The United States Embassy in London took issue with the poll's results, saying the world had become a safer place with the removal of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq. 
 The Daily Telegraph quoted an embassy spokesman as saying the United States had not successfully communicated America's ''extraordinary dynamism,'' but also blaming the British news media for ignoring stories about the successes of the American society and its economy.
 Among the respondents in the new poll, 77 percent did not see America as a ''beacon of hope for the world'' and, compared with similar categories in a 1975 Gallup survey, had markedly less confidence in ''America's ability to deal wisely with present world problems.'' 
 Asked to rate President Bush as a leader, more than three-quarters described him as either ''pretty poor'' (34 percent) or ''terrible'' (43 percent). Seventy-two percent said his foreign policy, instead of being driven by a desire to build democracy, was merely a cover for American interests.
 About two-thirds of respondents said they believed that American troops were doing ''a bad job'' in trying ''to win hearts and minds'' in Iraq, while 54 percent used the same term to describe the American effort to bring democracy to Iraq.
 ''From this side of the Atlantic, America appears to be a class divided and racially divided society and one that fails to offer its citizens anything approaching equality of opportunity,'' Mr. King wrote. ''Nearly three-quarters of Britons, 72 percent, believe American society is essentially 'unequal.' ''
 Among other findings of the survey: 83 percent of respondents said the United States ''doesn't care what the rest of the world think,'' 65 percent thought America ''vulgar,'' 84 percent said Americans are ''preoccupied with money'' and 90 percent said the United States was ''dominated by big business.''

HEADLINE: A Search Engine That's Becoming An Inventor 

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL and JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
When Google was a graduate-school project being run from a Silicon Valley garage, its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, built their own computers out of cheap parts meant for personal computers. They wanted to save money, and they felt that they could design a network of computers that would search the Web more efficiently than those available from traditional manufacturers.
 Google no longer needs to pinch pennies. It is a solid member of the Fortune 500 with $9 billion in cash. Still, it is stubbornly sticking to its do-it-yourself approach to technology. Even as it spends more than $1.5 billion this year on operations centers and technology, most of the hundreds of thousands of servers it will deploy are being custom-made based on Google's own eccentric designs.
To be closer to its users and speed response time, it is building a worldwide string of data centers, including a huge site in The Dalles, Ore., with technologies it designed to reduce its ravenous need for electricity. These computers in turn use software developed with advanced tools that Google also designed itself. There are signs that Google is even preparing to create its own custom microchips. 
 ''Google is as much about infrastructure as it is about the search engine,'' said Martin Reynolds, an analyst with the Gartner Group. ''They are building an enormous computing resource on a scale that is almost unimaginable.'' He said he believed that Google was the world's fourth-largest maker of computer servers, after Dell, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. 
 Google's biggest rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo, certainly write much of their own software, and they work to configure their computers and data centers to their own needs. But they largely buy machines from existing manufactures like Dell, Sun Microsystems and Rackable Systems. 
 ''At some point you have to ask yourself what is your core business,'' said Kevin Timmons, Yahoo's vice president for operations. ''Are you going to design your own router, or are you going to build the world's most popular Web site? It is very difficult to do both.''
 Google, in fact, has decided it will do both. In many ways, it still has the head of an graduate-school project grafted onto the body of an multinational corporation. The central tenet of its strategy is that its growing cadre of world-class computer scientists can design a network of machines that can store and process more information more efficiently than anyone else.
 Mr. Reynolds estimated that Google's computing costs are half those of other large Internet companies and a tenth those of traditional corporate technology users. 
 Google will not comment on its costs, but it does claim an advantage. ''We don't think our competitors can deploy systems cheaper, faster or at scale,'' Alan Eustace, Google's vice president for research and systems engineering, told analysts in March. ''That will give us a two-, three-, five-year lead.''
 Despite those boasts, some argue that Google's home-brew approach is unnecessary and inefficient, a headstrong indulgence masked for now by the growth and profitability of its advertising business. And Google's rivals say their networks are plenty efficient and powerful.
 ''Google doesn't have anything magic here,'' Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, said in an interview. ''We spend a little bit more per machine. But to do the same tasks, we have less machines.'' 
 Google is notoriously secretive about its technology. Yet it also has published papers on some of its developments and been granted patents on others. These, along with the public statements of Google executives and interviews with current and former employees, vendors and other technology executives, paint a picture of a company devoted to pushing the boundaries of modern computer science, and applying those concepts on a vast scale. 
 ''Google took the best ideas from the supercomputer research community and wove them into a working system,'' said Stephen E. Arnold, a technology consultant to investors and the author of ''The Google Legacy'' (Infonortics, 2005), a book on Google's technology. 
 Some of its innovations are designed to wring pennies from its growing spending on technology. Last year, it was granted a patent (06906920) on a ''drive-cooling baffle,'' meant to funnel air into a rack of computers held together with Velcro, a Google design signature. 
 But some innovations are bolder, like a series of software tools that simplify the way it can divide a problem to be handled by thousands of processors simultaneously, an approach called parallel processing.
 One such program, called MapReduce, is based on ideas discussed in computer science literature for decades, according to Urs Holzle, Google's senior vice president for operations. ''What surprised us was how useful it turned out to be in our environment,'' he said.
 MapReduce, he said, ''allows Joe Schmo software engineer to process large amounts of data and take advantage of our infrastructure.''
 Mr. Arnold, the consultant, said these tools created a significant cost advantage. ''If you talk to guys who work in massively parallel computing operations, as much as 30 percent of their coding time is spent trying to figure out how to get the thing to run,'' he said. Google ''has figured out how they can reduce a lot of the hassle and work of creating parallel applications.''
 Mr. Gates acknowledged that MapReduce was a significant technology, but he asserted that Microsoft was building its own parallel processing software, opening another front in the technological war between the two companies.
 ''They did MapReduce; we have this thing called Driad that's better,'' Mr. Gates said. ''But they'll do one that's better.''
 Moreover, Google's focus on building general purpose tools and systems is different from that of most companies, which develop systems tailored to specific applications. And it is building these systems rapidly, with the billions of dollars in cash it generates and the thousands of engineers it hires each year. It hopes that it can build a lead that will allow it to create products that do more, for less money, than its rivals.
 ''If they can get a 30 percent cost advantage, in operating a service on the Internet that is a huge difference,'' said John M. Lervik, the chief executive of Fast Search & Transfer, a Norwegian search company. 
 Google's academic approach can be traced not only to its founders' graduate work in computer science, but even to their early home life, Mr. Arnold said, noting that Mr. Page and Mr. Brin come from families with expertise in computer science and mathematics. 
 ''The stuff they did in 1996 to 1998 was not as immature as it should have been,'' he said of the Google founders. He said that told him the two men learned a lot ''when their parents were talking at the kitchen table.''
 By the time Mr. Page and Mr. Brin were designing Google, parallel processing was more than an academic dream; it was enabled on a large scale by the low prices of processors, memory and disk drives used to make personal computers. These components were hardly of the highest quality and could be counted on to fail often.
 Mr. Page designed the initial Google servers, with the assumption that parts would fail on a regular basis. At first he tried to simplify assembly -- and reduce the presumed repair time -- by not fastening components to the servers at all but simply laying them on a bed of cork. This proved to be unstable, and so parts were connected with Velcro. 
 ''Nobody builds servers as unreliably as we do,'' Mr. Holzle said in a speech last year at CERN, the Swiss particle physics institute. Google is reducing cost while maintaining performance by shifting the burden of reliability from hardware to software -- individual hardware components can fail, but software automatically shifts the local task and the data to other machines. 
 For example, Google designed a software system it calls the Google File System that keeps copies of data in several places so Google does not have to worry when one of its cheap servers fails. This approach also means that it does not have to make regular backup copies of its data as other companies do.
 Another system, called the Google Work Queue, allows a big pool of servers to be assigned to various tasks as needed and reassigned to other projects later. This concept, called ''virtualization,'' has become a trend among large data center operators, which also want to reduce the expense of having separate servers dedicated to each system. But most companies buy commercial software to track which computers are doing what, a complex process. 
 While Google's servers are built on inexpensive parts, the designs it uses have been modified every year or so, to improve their efficiency and increasingly to customize them to Google's applications. The current generation uses the powerful Opteron chip from Advanced Micro Devices, which uses less power than the Intel chips Google had used. 
 Google is among Advanced Micro's five largest clients, and the largest that does not make computers to resell, according to a semiconductor industry executive with knowledge of Advanced Micro's business. 
 Google is increasingly doing business with Sun Microsystems as well. Sun, known for systems that are both reliable and expensive, would not seem a natural match for a company that emphasizes economy and self-sufficiency. But Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, is a former Sun executive, and Sun has developed a new microchip that is especially efficient in electricity use. 
 Moreover, Google increasingly needs systems that are less likely to fail than those it uses for its search engine in order to handle important information, like e-mail and payments in its new Google Checkout service.
 Beyond servers, there are signs that Google is now designing its own microchips. The company has hired many of the engineers responsible for the Digital Equipment Corporation's well-regarded Alpha chip.
 ''Google's next step is to build high-performance silicon,'' said Mark Stahlman, an independent technology analyst.
 Mr. Holzle said Google had considered custom semiconductor design, but he declined to say if the company had built any. He said that, in general, Google did not want to build anything from scratch if it could buy something that was just as good.
 But he added that Google continued to believe that its approach to designing its own cheap and fast computer networks gave it an edge.
 ''Having lots of relatively unreliable machines and turning them into a reliable service is a hard problem,'' Mr. Holzle said. ''That is what we have been doing for a while.''

HEADLINE: On the Mississippi, a Vision Steeped in an Industrial Past 

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS 

 BODY:
For fans who prefer that their heroes remain predictable, Jean Nouvel has been a bit of a puzzle lately. 
 Two decades ago he established his reputation with the Institute of the Arab World in Paris, whose southern facade, an enormous grid of filigreed steel apertures, suggested inscrutable camera lenses. In the ensuing years this architect could generally be counted on for big, bold forms; a fetishistic obsession with technology; and a magician's bag of optical tricks.
His most recent projects, however, like the phallic, candy-colored Agbar Tower in Barcelona and the anarchic mix at the Musee du Quai Branly in Paris, have drifted toward the wildly eccentric, as if Mr. Nouvel, now 60, were more interested in letting his imagination roam unfettered than in impressing critics and academics. 
 The new Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis should offer comfort to those who miss the 1980's Nouvel. Rising at the edge of the Mississippi, its confident forms are rooted in a vision of a muscular industrial America, and its structural bravura will certainly please the techno-fetishists. As a thoughtful response to the American city's evolving role as a haven for cultural tourism, it also coaxes new meaning out of a haggard landscape.
 The site is a Modernist heaven on a former industrial strip along the riverfront. Just next to the complex is a grain elevator, similar to those that Le Corbusier once lauded as the American equivalent of the Parthenon, the ''magnificent first fruits of a new age.'' An electric generating plant looms across the river; to the north, water rushes through a series of locks beneath an industrial bridge.
 Like so many cities, of course, Minneapolis has gradually undergone an economic transformation. Most of the city's old flour mills were shut down long ago. The concrete grain elevator alongside the theater complex has been preserved as a historic monument, and a nearby row of warehouses has been converted into co-ops. Mr. Nouvel's design takes its initial cues from the city's early history. The complex's scale fits nicely with the structure next door. The boxy, piled-up forms echo the electric power plant across the street, anchoring the theater in the city's early industrial ethos rather than in the shopping centers and office towers downtown.
 Yet that virile image of a landscape ruled by men and machines is tempered by Mr. Nouvel's typical subversiveness. The metal cladding is coated in midnight blue, a symbol of buttoned-down conservatism that suggests a killer in a pressed suit. A small terrace in a bright police-tape yellow juts impudently from the building's riverfront facade. 
 Enormous mirrored panels frame a restaurant terrace, snatching up refracted images of the surrounding city. Orange-colored LED images climb two towers that rise from the complex like high-tech smokestacks.
 Mr. Nouvel's biggest gesture is a 175-foot-long cantilevered form that projects toward the river, its end abruptly sliced off at a sharp angle. Viewed from across the river, it looks like a bridge leading nowhere. Yet as you approach the main entrance along Second Street, as most visitors will, the cantilever reads as an extension of a walkway bridge that runs from the theater complex to a parking structure on the other side, an echo of the skywalks found elsewhere in downtown Minneapolis.
 The cantilever houses a bar and an outdoor terrace. But its main role is symbolic. In embarking on such a spectacular structural effort for what most would consider a secondary space, Mr. Nouvel is upholding the value of the tangential experiences that are often the most important in life. 
 Inside, the main 1,100-seat hall, a nod to the liberal Modernism of the 1960's, pays homage to the underappreciated original Guthrie designed by Ralph Rapson with a thrust stage that bridges the distance between the performers and the audience. Seats spill down toward the stage from three sides. Above, a sweeping balcony is set just off center, giving the room a wonderful edginess.
 Mr. Nouvel has also designed a more conservative 700-seat proscenium theater -- albeit in an erotic lipstick red that plays off the stiff formality of the space -- and a 300-seat black box for experimental work.
 But the true heart of the building is its connective tissue, like a two-tier public foyer where theatergoers will mingle during intermission. A large window at one end overlooks the area where workers assemble the stage sets; from the other side, people can amble out to the cantilevered bar and terrace.
 Here and there, the images of past performances, faint as shadows, are imprinted on the foyer wall, ghosts from the Guthrie's past. But once you drift out to the cantilevered bar, a sense of flux returns. The windows are framed in a mirrored steel that blends city views with refracted images of nearby buildings. In warm weather, a breeze wafts in through a large open window, carrying the scent of the outdoors.
 Suddenly we're not altogether sure where we find ourselves, and that's part of the point. The city, too, is a theater, a vast unstable laboratory that is constantly being reshaped by economic, political and imaginative forces. Seldom does that reality seem this seductive.

THE CLAIM -- Reading in the dark will damage your eyes.

THE FACTS -- Everyone who has ever held a flashlight to a book at night has probably heard the dire warnings about reading in the dark. It will weaken your eyes. It can ruin your vision. 
 But according to most ophthalmologists, while reading in the dark might strain your eyes and give you a headache, the notion that it can cause lasting damage is wrong. Most people can expect to experience some decline in their vision as they age, and genetic research shows that it is family history above all else that determines to what extent your vision will weaken.
But some researchers argue that putting too much strain on your eyes as a child or young adult, like the kind caused by reading in the dark, or simply reading for prolonged periods in general, might contribute to the decline of your eyesight later in life.
 Population studies in the United States and other countries have shown, for example, that the rates and severity of myopia are always greatest among people who attain the highest levels of education, as well as those whose occupations require them to do a great deal of reading, like lawyers, editors and doctors.
 But most of those studies have not taken into account economic factors like limited access to eye doctors. 
 One ophthalmologist who has studied the claim, Dr. Robert Cykiert at New York University Medical Center, is adamant that the strain reading puts on your eyes -- in poor light or not -- is safe. ''It may create fatigue,'' he said, ''but it cannot hurt your eyes in any way.''

THE BOTTOM LINE -- Most experts say reading in the dark is safe, despite circumstantial evidence that constantly straining your eyes can weaken your vision. ANAHAD O'CONNOR

RATING THE AIRLINES -- Continental Airlines was ranked first in overall customer satisfaction among the eight so-called traditional airlines in the 2006 J. D. Power & Associates North America Airline Satisfaction Study. Delta, American, Alaska, US Airways, United, Northwest and Air Canada followed in that order. Among low-cost carriers, JetBlue ranked first, followed by Southwest, AirTran and Frontier. 


GOODBYE DC10's -- Northwest Airlines is retiring its remaining 12 workhorse-like but fuel-inefficient DC10-30 international aircraft and replacing them with new Airbus A330's and with Boeing 747-400's currently in storage. Northwest's 273-seat DC10-30's first entered service in 1989. The DC10's are currently used on seven routes.

TOUR DE FRANCE ALOFT -- JetBlue passengers can watch live coverage of the Tour de France in flight during July on the airline's in-flight video system. To celebrate the 23-day endurance race, JetBlue is also waiving the $50 fee for taking a bicycle along as checked baggage on its flights in July.

EVERYBODY INTO THE POOL SITE -- Trade shows and other business travel in Las Vegas can be exhausting, especially in summer. Now you can find the best place to jump in the pool: a Web site, VegasHotelPools.com has descriptions and user reviews of major hotel pools. Photos are included. Reviews can range from raves to pans. "This is a boring pool," one review says of a major Strip hotel's swimming hole.

ET CETERA -- How rapidly are airline fares really rising? Operating results in May for Delta Air Lines provide a clue. Passenger revenue per available seat -- a rough measure of fares -- rose 18.5 percent in May over the previous May, Delta said Expedia.com has two new features: a downloadable Fare Alert program that sends out bulletins on airfares and hotel-air packages within a specified price range, and a gas station locator with information on gas stations with the lowest prices closest to car-rental drop-off locations International air traffic was up 7 percent in May over May 2005, the International Air Transport Association said. Load factors -- the percentage of seats filled -- averaged 73.6 percent, slightly higher than May 2005. For the first five months of 2006, the Middle East continued to lead international growth, with a rise of 17.8 percent over May 2005, the trade group said. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Down by the Boardwalk, A $1 Billion Revival Plan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Joey Coney Island is making a stand at the corner of Stillwell and Surf Avenues, amid the fortune tellers, the freak shows, the bumper cars and the Boardwalk.
 It is here that Joey, better known in the business world as Joseph J. Sitt, chairman of Thor Equities, unfurls his grand $1 billion plan to revive what is left of Coney Island's historic amusement district.
There are drawings of high-tech arcades, a glass-enclosed water park, hotels, restaurants and waterfront condominiums. He describes an entertainment complex that features the most far out, ''over the top'' attractions, from an indoor ski hill and a giant Ferris wheel to a dirigible and helicopter landing station atop a tower. 
 ''I view Coney Island as a national and international treasure,'' said Mr. Sitt, 41, who lives only blocks away. ''The trick is to create a venue that will entertain families and young adults. My mission is to create a one-stop amusement complex that would have great rides and interesting retail.''
 Like any carny barker's patter, Mr. Sitt's dreams for Coney Island can sound far-fetched. He is at least 18 months away from construction and needs city approval for some elements of his plan, including a proposal to build luxury apartments in the amusement district.
 But unlike previous promoters, Mr. Sitt has spent more than $100 million buying property here. He has the deep pockets to develop the project, and at least for now, some support from city officials, local politicians, the community board and old-timers on the Boardwalk.
 ''There'll be a lot of debates, no doubt,'' said Chuck Reichenthal, the longtime district manager of Community Board 13, which covers Coney Island. ''But everybody is looking forward to things happening that can help the community and the amusement district.''
 Mr. Sitt, whose company buys and develops commercial, residential and retail properties nationwide, grew up nearby, frequently ducking out of school to hang out at the amusement parks, earning him the nickname Joey Coney Island.
 Despite the beaches that still draw millions of visitors on summer weekends and a minor league ballpark that attracts sell-out crowds, Coney Island does not look like a treasure. It can be ghostly quiet in the winter. The amusement district has shrunk. There are many empty storefronts along Surf Avenue, which parallels the waterfront, and vacant lots covered in weeds.
 The heyday of Coney Island dates back to the first half of the last century, when it was the most popular resort in the country. The subways brought visitors by the millions to Steeplechase and Luna Parks, as well as the beaches, restaurants and hotels. The area fell into decline after World War II. Since then, developers have periodically presented plans for a revival, or a gambling hub, that have quickly disappeared. 
 The Bloomberg administration, however, has focused on Coney Island, completing a $240 million renovation of the Stillwell Avenue subway terminal and committing $83.2 million for neighborhood improvements, including new parking, a community center and a facelift for Surf and Mermaid Avenues. Residential developers have moved in, driving up land prices.
 And the Coney Island Development Corporation has spent several years devising a zoning plan to preserve and expand the amusement district, while encouraging new apartments houses and stores nearby. The corporation expects to put the plan through the city's approval process this fall.
 With a residential building boom on the city's waterfront, Mr. Sitt began buying property in Coney Island three years ago, much of it, he said, from the descendants of Nathan Handwerker, who founded the Nathan's Famous hot dog stand, and George C. Tilyou, whose Steeplechase Park was a prime Coney Island attraction from 1897 to 1964. 
 Mr. Sitt is now focused on more than four blocks south of Surf Avenue, from 12th to 15th Streets. After complaints from residents and city officials, he scrapped earlier plans for an indoor mall with warehouse-style stores and a theater for Cirque du Soleil in favor of designs that are more open to the neighborhood and in line with Coney Island. 
 ''Too Bellagio,'' Mr. Reichenthal said, referring to the Las Vegas resort.
 Nathan's would remain in place. But Mr. Sitt plans to replace the bumper boats and go-cart track with a year-round water park on the east side of Stillwell Avenue that would be connected to a family-oriented, S-shaped hotel, which would include apartments and time-share units.
 On the west side of Stillwell, there would be a second, more luxurious, 500-room hotel and a condominium tower on the Boardwalk. Plans call for a dramatic entrance to the complex. The towers, ranging from more than 20 stories to more than 30 stories, would sit atop a shopping center, a modern game arcade and a multiplex theater.
 ''Our approach to regenerating Coney Island amusements is to make them an integral part of an authentic urban district,'' said Mr. Sitt's architect, Stanton Eckstut, who was the master planner for Battery Park City and for the MGM Mirage project in Las Vegas. ''It will be year-round, mixed-use, with real streets.'' 
 Mr. Sitt says he is talking to Nickelodeon about a family-oriented hotel and to the race car driver Mario Andretti about a racing attraction. But his proposals for high-rise towers and housing in the amusement district are not what the Coney Island Development Corporation had in mind when it devised its plans. 
 Joshua J. Sirefman, chairman of the Coney Island Development Corporation and interim president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the administration was willing to consider Mr. Sitt's proposal ''if it makes the project more viable and we can ensure the amusement and entertainment uses are protected.''
 The project has won an endorsement from Anthony Berlingieri and Carlo Muraco, co-owners of Shoot the Freak, a shooting gallery on the Boardwalk where patrons fire paint balls at a heavily padded ''freak'' who sprints around a courtyard wedged between a food stand and a souvenir stand. Although they say Mr. Sitt is a fan, they are also worried that Coney Island's traditional attractions may be squeezed out.
 ''We're for anything good for Coney Island,'' Mr. Muraco said. ''We just want to be part of it. I question, will we be able to afford the rent? Nobody's getting rich here.''

HEADLINE: For $1, a Collective Mixing Art and Radical Politics Turns Itself Into Its Own Landlord 

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
For decades the stretch of Rivington Street running east from Essex Street was a largely forgotten and gritty pocket of the Lower East Side, home to bodegas, nail salons and blue-collar residents. Over the last 10 years, though, the area has evolved into one of Manhattan's trendy neighborhoods, with new restaurants, bars and boutiques. Roaming heroin dealers have given way to throngs of young, noisy visitors.
 Standing on the north side of Rivington, between Suffolk and Clinton Streets, is one of the few buildings that have barely changed in two decades: a crumbling, four-story structure that at one time was inhabited by squatters and now houses ABC No Rio, a community and cultural center that seeks to explore the interaction of art and radical politics. The building has a prominent place in the lore of the Lower East Side, and at times has had a rocky relationship with City Hall. 
Some of the artists who helped found the group first came together with the unsanctioned takeover of an abandoned building on Delancey Street. A little later, when members of the group moved a block north to a vacant building on Rivington Street, they battled attempts by the city to evict them.
 Those days of disagreement have finally come to an end. 
 Last week, the city sold the building, 156 Rivington Street, to ABC No Rio for $1, said Neill Coleman, a spokesman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The transaction came after years of negotiations, and one of the conditions was that the nonprofit collective that runs the building had to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to begin renovations. Mr. Coleman said the city sometimes sells buildings for a dollar to community or cultural organizations because such groups provide a benefit to the public. 
 ''ABC No Rio exists as a resource for people with a diverse set of politics and a very broad sense of what is art,'' Eric Goldhagen, a collective member, said. ''They can exchange ideas in a nondogmatic atmosphere out of which dynamic and interesting projects tend to grow.''
 The group raised its money primarily in small donations, some from local backers and some from artists and musicians in other cities and countries who had never visited the center but admired its history of surviving amid political and economic struggles; many of them faced similar difficulties in running performance spaces in expensive urban areas. 
 Susan Howard, a board member, said the collective was planning several phases of construction work over four years. The building's foundation will be reinforced, she said, and joists, staircases and the roof will be replaced. She said that the work would begin early next year and that the group would continue raising money to pay for it. 
 A sign near the front door of the pale brick building bears the motto ''Culture of opposition since 1980.'' Collective members said the building was meant to be a place for people to share ideas about how to create their own models of community while rejecting what they consider the commercial aspects of mainstream society. The group's Web site says its constituency includes ''nomads, squatters, fringe dwellers, and those among society's disenfranchised who find at ABC No Rio a place to be heard and valued.'' 
 Upstairs, the rooms include a computer center, a photography darkroom, a screen printing room and a '' 'zine library'' holding comic books and self-produced periodicals. All the center's operations are run by volunteers and can be used at little or no charge. There is also a kitchen used by a group called Food Not Bombs, that distributes free vegetarian dishes in Tompkins Square Park. 
 The center has been the site of improvised jazz performances and ear-shattering punk rock shows. Musicians like Beck and Michelle Shocked have played there. A ground-floor gallery has shown work by artists, both celebrated and obscure. A benefit last year included work donated by Yoko Ono, Claes Oldenburg and Hans Haacke. 
 As landlords have raised rents on Rivington Street and as new businesses and tenants have moved in, the rickety edifice that houses ABC No Rio, replete with murals, graffiti and a handmade metal entryway constructed out of old rebar and gear wheels, has stood out physically as well as culturally. 
 Even the name of the center is drawn from a part of the neighborhood that is gone. When collective members first moved in, letters on a Spanish sign across the street for a lawyer and notary public had disintegrated until it spelled the name adopted by the group.
 While newcomers may think the building looks odd, older residents view it as a reminder of days when living below Houston Street required more savvy than savings. 
 ''It was our original intention to be open and integrated into the community,'' said Alan Moore, an art historian who was one of the founders of the collective. ''That has been a continuous thread.''
 Mr. Moore and his colleagues began with a form of expression that commented on local changes. On Dec. 31, 1979, artists took over a vacant city-owned building on Delancey Street and organized an exhibition about gentrification called the Real Estate Show. The next day, collective members said, the city shut down the show and threw the artists out of the building.
 Soon afterward, the city invited the group into 156 Rivington Street, where the group formed a collective, started a cultural center and adopted its name. Some members began living there. In 1994 the city stopped accepting rent checks, and soon filed eviction papers and prepared to sell the building to a developer. 
 The occupants held demonstrations on the Lower East Side and a sit-in at the Housing, Preservation and Development office on Gold Street. In 1997 the agency stopped the eviction proceedings and announced that if the group raised $100,000 for repairs, it could have the building for a dollar. Those squatting in the building agreed to move out, though many of them, including the current director, Steven Englander, who moved into another squatter building on Avenue C, continued to work there.
 Over the years the city increased the amount of money it wanted ABC No Rio to raise, saying that construction costs had risen. Once the collective had saved close to $300,000 by October 2004, the long transfer process began. 
 Although there is plenty of difficult construction work to be done, Mr. Englander said he was thrilled that the longtime goal of buying the building had been realized.
 ''It's a pretty powerful feeling of ebullience,'' he said. ''We're going to start planning the future in a new facility.''

PERSON: Philip Rieff

HEADLINE: Philip Rieff, Sociologist and Author on Freud, Dies at 83

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Philip Rieff, an influential sociologist, author and cultural critic who wrote well-known books on the impact of Sigmund Freud on society and on the direction of morality and Western culture, died on Saturday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 83.
 The cause was heart failure, said his son, David, the only child of Dr. Rieff's eight-year marriage in the 1950's to the writer Susan Sontag, who died in 2004. 
Dr. Rieff, who taught at the University of Pennsylvania, was best known in scholarly circles for three early works on Freud and culture, published from 1959 to 1973, and for a book that appeared last January, ''Sacred Order/Social Order: My Life Among the Deathworks: Illustrations of the Aesthetics of Authority'' (University of Virginia Press), which was to have been the first of several volumes on related cultural themes.
 The book, which uses works by Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, James Joyce and other artists and writers to explore what Dr. Rieff portrays as a battlefield on which culture is under attack, mounts a counterattack and is generally dismissive of feminism, gay rights, the television channel MTV and much of what has come to be regarded as social progress.
 In an interview last year with David Glenn for The Chronicle of Higher Education, Dr. Rieff spoke of the emptiness of modern ''anti-culture'' and voiced deep pessimism for the future. ''He does not believe that any restorative project is actually feasible,'' Mr. Glenn wrote. ''When asked what he believes scholars might do to slow down the process of cultural decline, he says, 'They can become inactivists. They'll do less damage that way. Inactivism is the ticket.' '' 
 In an academic career that began after World War II, Dr. Rieff taught at the University of Chicago; Brandeis University; the University of California, Berkeley; and from 1961 until his retirement in 1992, at the University of Pennsylvania. 
 Dr. Rieff often dazzled and occasionally puzzled students with multilayered but always authoritative lectures that blended philosophy, theology, economics, history, literature, psychology and dashes of poetry and Plato like ingredients in a sociological mulligatawny.
 Readers often found his prose style difficult but the ideas behind it rewarding.
 Dr. Rieff's first book, paradoxically titled ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (Viking Press, 1959), established him as an important sociologist. It argued that Freudian ideas, which gave rise to the idea of the ''psychological man'' as the dominant moral type in the 20th century, had had a corrosive effect on Western morality and culture because such an individual tended to relate all public questions not to received traditions of communal morality, but ''to himself and his own emotions.''
 After editing a 10-volume edition of Freud's papers that appeared in 1961, Dr. Rieff completed his second book, ''The Triumph of the Therapeutic: Uses of Faith After Freud'' (Harper & Row, 1966), which said that Freudian therapies had gone awry in modern society, aiming not at a healthier life but at ''better living,'' with rationales to replace virtue with value and sidestep consequences. 
 In ''Fellow Teachers'' (Harper & Row, 1973), Dr. Rieff explored the role of teachers in higher education and argued for a ''feeling intellect'' that avoids preaching or espousing doctrines to students. 
 ''My re-educated friends, with their ardor for innovation and the perverse, are too influential as things are,'' he wrote. ''This psychosocialism may destroy what remains of our received culture in order to replace it with permanent therapies.'' 
 Philip Rieff was born in Chicago on Dec. 15, 1922, the son of refugees who had fled political violence in Lithuania in 1921. Some members of his family who remained behind died in the Holocaust. He entered the University of Chicago in 1939, and after military service in World War II, he resumed his studies and earned a bachelor's degree in 1946, a master's in 1947 and a doctorate in 1954.
 He joined the faculty in 1947 as a teaching instructor. In 1950, Ms. Sontag, then a 17-year-old sophomore at the University of Chicago with a brilliant academic record, audited a class taught by the 28-year-old Dr. Rieff. They talked, were captivated by one another -- she later wrote that he was the first person with whom she could ever really talk -- and they were married 10 days later. 
 In 1952, the couple moved to Boston. Dr. Rieff joined the faculty at Brandeis, Ms. Sontag began graduate work at Harvard, and their son was born. After earning two master's degrees and completing course work for a doctorate, Ms. Sontag received a fellowship to Oxford and Dr. Rieff a fellowship at Stamford; the couple went their separate ways for one academic year, their son was looked after by Dr. Rieff's parents, and the marriage unraveled. 
 In 1959, the couple divorced, and Ms. Sontag reclaimed her son and moved to New York to begin her celebrated career.
 Dr. Rieff joined the faculty at Berkeley, where he taught until moving to Pennsylvania in 1961. Biographers have suggested that Ms. Sontag contributed significantly to Dr. Rieff's first book, ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist,'' although she was not listed as a co-author.
 In 1963, Dr. Rieff married Alison Douglas Knox, a Philadelphia lawyer. Besides his wife and son, of New York, a journalist and author who specializes in foreign affairs, Dr. Rieff is survived by one grandchild.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on July 4 about Philip Rieff, a sociologist and expert on Freud who was once married to Susan Sontag, referred incorrectly to his academic record and misspelled the name of the university that awarded him a fellowship. At the time that he met and married Ms. Sontag, in 1950, he held a master's degree; he did not receive his doctorate until 1954. His fellowship was at Stanford, not Stamford.

HEADLINE: Identity Thief Finds Easy Money Hard to Resist

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.; Kassie Bracken contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
By the time of Shiva Brent Sharma's third arrest for identity theft, at the age of 20, he had taken in well over $150,000 in cash and merchandise in his brief career. After a certain point, investigators stopped counting.
 The biggest money was coming in at the end, postal inspectors said, after Mr. Sharma had figured out how to buy access to stolen credit card accounts online, change the cardholder information and reliably wire money to himself -- sometimes using false identities for which he had created pristine driver's licenses.
But Mr. Sharma, now 22, says he never really kept track of his earnings.
 ''I don't know how much I made altogether, but the most I ever made in a quick period was like $20,000 in a day and a half or something,'' he said, sitting in the empty meeting hall at the Mohawk Correctional Facility in Rome, N.Y., where he is serving a two- to four-year term. ''Working like three hours today, three hours tomorrow -- $20,000.'' 
 And once he knew what he was doing, it was all too easy. 
 ''It's an addiction, no doubt about that,'' said Mr. Sharma, who inflected his words with the sort of street cadence adopted by smart kids trying to be cool. ''I get scared that when I get out, I might have a problem and relapse because it would be so easy to take $300 and turn it into several thousand.''
 That ease accounts for the sizable ranks of identity-fraud victims, whose acquaintance with the crime often begins with unexplained credit card charges, a drained bank account or worse. The victims' tales have become alarmingly familiar, but usually lack a protagonist -- the perpetrator. Mr. Sharma's account of his own exploits provides the missing piece: an insight into both the tools and the motivation of a persistent thief. 
 Identity theft can, of course, have its origins in a pilfered wallet or an emptied mailbox. But for computer-savvy thieves like Mr. Sharma, the Internet has forged new conduits for the crime, both as a means of stealing identity and account information and as the place to use it. 
 The Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have invested millions of dollars in monitoring Internet sites where thousands of users from around the world congregate to swap tips about identity theft and to buy and sell personal data. Mr. Sharma frequented such sites from their earliest days, and the techniques he learned there have become textbook-variety scams.
 ''Shiva Sharma was probably one of the first, and he was certainly one of the first to get caught,'' said Diane M. Peress, a former Queens County prosecutor who handled all three of Mr. Sharma's cases and who is now the chief of economic crimes with the Nassau County district attorney's office. ''But the kinds of methods that he used are being used all the time.''
 As far back as 2002, Mr. Sharma began picking the locks on consumer credit lines using a computer, the Internet and a deep understanding of online commerce, Internet security and simple human nature, obtained through years of trading insights with like-minded thieves in online forums. And he deployed the now-common rods and reels of data theft -- e-mail solicitations and phony Web sites -- that fleece the unwitting. 
 Much of this unfolded from the basement of a middle-class family home in Richmond Hill, Queens, at the hands of a high school student with a knack for problem solving and an inability, even after multiple arrests, to resist the challenge of making a scheme pay off.
 That is what worries Mr. Sharma's wife, Damaris, 21, who has no time for the Internet as she raises the couple's 1-year-old daughter, Bellamarie. 
 ''I hate computers,'' she said. ''I think they're the devil.''

A Thief's Tool Kit
 Mr. Sharma is soft-spoken, but he does not shrink from the spotlight. He gained fleeting attention after his first arrest, as the first person charged under a New York State identity-theft statute -- and later, at his high school graduation at the Rikers Island jail, where he was the class valedictorian.
 For a prison interview, he has applied gel to his mane of black hair. He is Hollywood handsome, with deceptively sleepy eyes and smiles that come as tics in reaction to nearly every stimulus -- a question, a noise. Prosecutors interpreted those smiles as evidence of smug indifference. 
 A tattoo of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and his namesake, is just visible on Mr. Sharma's right arm, under the short sleeve of his green prison jumpsuit.
 Recalling his youth, Mr. Sharma said he was not unlike many other young people growing up with the mating calls of modems and unprecedented access to people, sounds, software and other thrills streaming into the family's home over the Internet. 
 As the youngest of three children in a family of immigrants from Trinidad -- his parents brought the family to Queens when he was 6 -- Mr. Sharma said sibling battles for access to the computer were common. He studied programming at Brooklyn Tech, one of New York's most selective public high schools, where he met Damaris. 
 He enjoyed chatting on AOL and was drawn, along with millions of his peers in the early days of file sharing, to downloading MP3's. 
 As he got older, he began hanging out on Internet-based chat channels that dealt with bigger game, like bootleg software. And amid the chatter were whispers of other something-for-nothing sites -- ones where thieves had set up bazaars involving credit cards, banks and account numbers. 
 ''So I ended up registering and then I started just looking, really,'' Mr. Sharma said. ''Not really taking anything in, just looking and seeing what's going on there.''
 Mr. Sharma said he chiefly visited two such sites, Carderplanet.com and Shadowcrew.com, where he was known by the screen name sniper5984 (the number denoted his birthdate). The sites were shut down in 2004, but many others have sprung up to replace them.
 ''For the aspiring little computer hacker in the United States, they're an excellent opportunity to learn,'' said Greg Crabb, the assistant director for economic crimes at the United States Postal Inspection Service's international group in Washington. On Carderplanet, for example, ''a person could learn how to set up a drop, receive packages, develop other relationships and generally get started in the business.'' 
 Mr. Sharma got started with phishing -- sending e-mail meant to dupe recipients into revealing their personal or financial data, which can then be exploited. He told investigators that he paid $60 to someone he had met on Carderplanet to buy a program designed to harvest AOL e-mail addresses. 
 ''I pretty much stuck with AOL because I knew AOL is most likely people new to the Internet,'' Mr. Sharma explained, ''people who don't use the Internet for much but chat rooms.'' 
 He managed to gather about 100,000 addresses, and crafted an e-mail message that told recipients, ''We regret to inform you, but due to a recent system flush, the billing information for your account was deleted.'' Recipients were instructed to follow a link to a Web page to remedy the situation. 
 The Web page, which mimicked AOL's look and feel, including a bogus AOL Web address, had form fields requesting everything from name and address to mother's maiden name, Social Security number, date of birth, credit card number, expiration date and bank. 
 The ''submit'' button sent the data to Mr. Sharma's e-mail account. He then went shopping.
 From the 100,000 phishing e-mails Mr. Sharma sent, investigators say, about 100 recipients were duped into clicking through to the phony AOL Web page he created and filling out the form. Mr. Sharma said he did even better, with about 250 to 300 responses. 
 And Mr. Sharma went on to more elaborate and lucrative schemes. By the end, he said, he had become well known at Carderplanet and Shadowcrew for being able to ''cash out'' victims' credit accounts by making large wire transfers from their accounts to himself. 
 ''I cash them out all the time,'' sniper5984 wrote at Carderplanet on July 5, 2004. ''Here's two examples of Citi Cards I have used last month just to show.'' 
 Sniper5984 then provided links to two images of the account statement of the victim, a California resident, showing, amid various legitimate charges, nearly $10,000 in Western Union wire transfers made over three days in June 2004. 
 There were also two charges for Domino's pizza in Ozone Park, Queens. 
 ''There was always a challenge,'' Mr. Sharma said. ''You know, like it's always something like, wow, can I take it to the next step, you know?'' 
 Ms. Sharma recalled that on trips to a Six Flags amusement park, her husband rarely took to the rides, preferring instead the games of chance. ''The ones where you win a giant stuffed animal if you can throw some ball into a bucket or something like that, but there's obviously some trick to it,'' she said. ''Well, he would always know the trick.''
 She also recalled one evening in the summer of 2004, when Mr. Sharma came to her apartment with $27,000 in cash and asked her to hold onto it overnight. The next morning he picked up the money and returned later with a new Acura RSX. 
 ''He liked to race cars,'' Ms. Sharma said.
 Back at the correctional facility, Mr. Sharma struggled to find a clear explanation for his crimes. At times he suggested he was taking aim at a usurious banking industry. At other moments he offered that it was simply a game, that he was young, that he was not thinking clearly. 
 ''Well, you know -- I mean there's no, there's no justification behind it at all,'' he said. ''You know it was wrong, and I did it -- it was wrong.'' 
 He also suggested it all became too easy too fast. 
 ''The challenge was really stopping, you know?'' he said. ''That was the hardest challenge of them all.'' 

'It's Sharma Again'
 The tools that allowed Mr. Sharma to profit from his thievery were also his undoing, more than once. 
 On Sept. 19, 2002, William Robertson, a 73-year-old retired physical education teacher in Ormond Beach, Fla., received one of the 100,000 e-mail lures that Mr. Sharma's had sent out from Queens, and he fell for the scam.
 ''I don't know what made me fill out that whole form,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''At that time I was a fairly new user of the computer. And after I did it, I just didn't feel right. But it wasn't until after the credit card company called me that I knew I'd done anything wrong.'' 
 A $3,000 Eltron photo ID printer had been bought on his Chase credit card from an online store in Buffalo. He canceled the card and made a report to the Flagler County police. The police determined that the printer had been shipped to a Brent Sharma in Queens. 
 Just over a month later, on Nov. 8, Peter Ruh, a United States postal inspector, arrived at Mr. Sharma's parents' home wearing a postal delivery uniform and carrying a box of high-end racing car parts that Mr. Sharma had ordered using another credit card account he had hijacked. When Mr. Sharma identified himself and signed for the package, Mr. Ruh, wearing a wire, gave a pre-arranged signal and his fellow inspectors, along with New York City police officers, moved in. 
 Among the items seized from his parents' basement were a computer, two digital cameras, a scanner, nearly 500 blank plastic identity cards with magnetic strips, two Marine Corps ID's -- with Mr. Sharma's name and photo -- and a newer model Eltron photo ID printer. A search of his computer revealed personal identifying information on hundreds of people from across the country. 
 ''We were surprised at how forthcoming he was,'' Mr. Ruh said. ''He was very proud of his accomplishments.'' 
 It was the first of many encounters that Queens postal investigators would have with Mr. Sharma over the next two years. ''I'd get a call from someone over at Postal and they'd say, 'You're not going to believe this,' '' Ms. Peress said. ''And then they'd say, 'It's Sharma again.' ''
 Even with charges of identity theft pending in the AOL case, Mr. Sharma was arrested and charged again, in May 2003, for schemes involving the hijacking of Amazon.com accounts, moving fraudulently bought merchandise through auctions at eBay and Yahoo, and enlisting the father of a friend to receive shipments at his home in exchange for a digital camera. 
 Four months later, as part of a combined plea agreement, Mr. Sharma was permitted to plead guilty in the first case as a youthful offender, avoiding a felony designation. He pleaded guilty in the second case to two felony counts of identity theft and unlawful possession of personal identification information. In November 2003 he was sentenced to five years' probation and 350 hours of community service and was ordered to pay $5,000 in restitution.
 But within a month, on Jan. 21, 2004, sniper5984 was active again at Carderplanet. ''I am looking for partners,'' he wrote. 

Logging Off
 By the summer of 2004, investigators had begun piecing together a string of complaints from out-of-state consumers whose credit card accounts had been hijacked for tens of thousands of dollars in bogus charges, and they quickly recognized the modus operandi. 
 Mr. Sharma was arrested again in October while accepting a package under the watch of postal inspectors. A search of his apartment in Ozone Park on Oct. 16, 2004, the day after his final arrest, turned up consumers' credit bureau reports, assorted hand-written notations of credit card accounts and Social Security numbers and printed chats showing him negotiating online for the purchase of FirstUSA and MBNA credit cards. 
 Mr. Sharma remembers making heavy use, just before his last arrest, of the credit card of a commercial airline pilot from Florida. 
 Receipts show that a Jean Pascal Francis, presenting a Michigan state identification card, signed in Queens for nearly $5,500 in Western Union cash transfers charged to the pilot's account on a single Friday afternoon in July 2004. A Michigan state identification card with that name and Mr. Sharma's photograph was among the documents later found in Mr. Sharma's apartment. 
 ''I thought it was horrible,'' recalled the airline pilot, who did not want to be named because he feared it would invite other thieves to take a crack at him. ''You just feel violated in terms of your privacy.''
 Meanwhile, Mr. Sharma, whose family had moved to Florida, was largely on his own in New York and was burning through cash like rocket fuel. 
 ''I tried every five-star hotel in Manhattan,'' he said. ''That's why they say, 'Oh, he stayed at the Parker Meridien, the Regency, the Waldorf-Astoria.' You know, I went to all those and just stayed. The Mandarin Oriental is by my wife's house, and that's supposed to be the nicest one and the newest one, so I went there and it's like $3,500 a night.'' 
 ''The more you make,'' he added, ''it's like, it becomes a different kind of lifestyle.'' 
 The question now is whether Mr. Sharma, who has a parole hearing in August, can adapt to a less lucrative lifestyle when he gets out. 
 He says he is determined to stay clean long enough for his knowledge of fraud techniques to become obsolete. ''I've just got to stay with my daughter and just try and stick it through another year or two,'' Mr. Sharma said, ''because by then things have changed so much that it will be kind of hard for me to just go back in there and do everything.'' 
 His wife understands the temptations that will lurk in the meantime. 
 ''I do worry a whole lot because -- I don't want to say I agree, but I understand his mentality,'' Ms. Sharma said. ''People work really hard for eight hours a day and make minimum wage. And he knows he can get out and make the same thing with the computer in half an hour.''

Stolen Lives
 The first article in this series, on May 30, looked at the factors fueling identity theft in the Phoenix area.

HEADLINE: Taliban Kill Afghan Interpreters Working for U.S. and Its Allies

BYLINE: By RUHULLAH KHAPALWAK and CARLOTTA GALL; Ruhullah Khapalwak reported from Kandahar for this article, and Carlotta Gall from Kabul. Sultan M. Munadi contributed reporting from Kabul.

DATELINE: KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, July 3 

 BODY:
Troops of the American-led coalition in this country are taking a hard look at their security procedures after the deaths of at least 10 Afghans working as interpreters for the coalition in the last month, a military spokesman said Monday.
 Some were killed while accompanying foreign troops during combat, but others seem to have been singled out by Taliban insurgents for working for the coalition, other interpreters said. 
Most of them are young Afghans who have taken English language courses in Afghanistan.
 Taliban-led violence has increased significantly in the last six months, with insurgents making a determined show of force as NATO prepares to take over military command of southern Afghanistan from the United States later this month. 
 Many civilians have been caught in the violence, including more than 100 employees of the United States Agency for International Development in the last three years, according to the departing chief of the agency's mission in Afghanistan, Alonzo Fulgham. Most of those killed were Afghans, he said.
 A spokesman for the coalition forces in southern Afghanistan, Maj. Quentin Innis of Canada, said that it was not clear if the interpreters had been killed specifically because of their work, but that coalition officials were concerned about the trend. 
 ''It is a concern for us when any Afghans get killed,'' Major Innis said. ''We are looking at how we can step up security.'' 
 Five of the interpreters were killed in a bus bombing on June 15 on their way to work at the American base outside Kandahar, the major said. Two were killed during combat operations in southern Afghanistan in the last month, he said, one on Saturday while working with British troops in Helmand Province, and the other in Zabul Province while working with American troops a month ago.
 Three others were killed this week when they were driving west of the city of Kandahar and reached a Taliban checkpoint, Major Innis said. The interpreters were armed and engaged in a gun battle, he said. 
 A fourth interpreter managed to escape, a colleague said. The four were working at an American Special Forces base on the north side of the city.
 One interpreter interviewed by telephone, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals, said he had resigned on Saturday because of the threat of violence. Taliban supporters spread leaflets warning people not to work for the foreign military, he said, adding that he knew of two additional colleagues who had been killed in the last week.
 One, named Ahmed Shah, was shot and killed by Taliban insurgents while picnicking with friends in Sangesar, a town west of Kandahar, last week, the interpreter said. When the Taliban came across the group, they accused Mr. Shah of working for the American military. When he told them he would quit immediately, they reportedly said, ''It's too late,'' and shot him dead in front of his friends, the interpreter said, citing witnesses at the picnic.
 He added that another interpreter was shot dead in the street in the past week in Loya Wala, a northern district of the city. He said the victim, whom he did not identify by name, had received threats from the Taliban to give up his job with the coalition but had continued.
 The interpreter who resigned on Saturday said he had felt under threat for some time and always covered his face with a scarf as he entered and left the Americans' Kandahar base. He said he had noticed men sitting on motorbikes outside the entrance watching who was going in and out of the base and suspected that they were Taliban spies.
 A translator working for The New York Times in southern Afghanistan has also received indirect threats from people known to be close to the Taliban. The people said he had been spotted driving into the Kandahar base, described his car and cited the license plate. 
 The message from the Taliban, passed to a relative: ''Tell him to stop working for the Americans.''
 The Taliban have killed aid workers, teachers, mullahs, tribal elders and civilian government officials in the last two years, in a campaign the insurgents say is aimed at undermining confidence in the government and the foreign forces.
 A suicide bomber blew himself up in Kandahar outside a government guesthouse at 9 p.m. Monday, killing one policeman and wounding three other people.
 Another bomb exploded in a women's classroom at the University of Herat on Monday, killing one student and badly shaking six others, a police official said. The bomb was left in a trash can, but it went off after the class had finished, when most students had left the room, said Nisar Ahmad Paikar, chief of the criminal department of the police in Herat.

HEADLINE: A Tax on the Sick 

 BODY:
Poor countries have long claimed that their people suffer needless sickness and death because the price of medicines is too high. They are right. But in many cases, part of the fault lies in their own policies, which jack up prices by taxing medicines, raw materials for drugs and medical devices. 
 Six years ago, African leaders pledged to stop putting taxes and import duties on bed nets. These nets protect people from mosquitoes that carry malaria, but are often slapped with high textile tariffs. In many countries, government taxes at least double the price that consumers pay for nets. In Tanzania, for example, the retail price dropped from $6 to $2.50 when taxes were eliminated, a huge help for families that live on less than a dollar a day. Usage of bed nets soared. But many governments that made the pledge have not followed through so far.
 Adding sales tax or value-added tax to medicines is the most regressive form of taxation, and no country should do it. India charges up to 100 percent for medicines on its list of lifesaving drugs. Morocco's tariff is 12 percent. Nigeria adds a 20 percent tariff to the price of vaccines.
 The United States, Singapore and Switzerland have proposed to the World Trade Organization that countries eliminate tariffs on medicines. This makes perfect sense. Only India seems to be using tariffs to protect local generic industries, a strategy that in some limited situations could indeed lower costs to consumers. The rest apply tariffs simply to raise revenue.
 A study by the World Health Organization showed that governments make very little money from these charges, which can really squeeze the sick, as even a small tariff adds to the price that forms the base for later markups. Some countries probably retain tariffs only because their health ministries, which know how noxious they are, don't communicate with their finance ministries, which won't let go of any tax without a fight.
 The proposal to the World Trade Organization would probably have gotten a lot more support by now if it weren't coming from Washington, allowing some countries to dismiss it as a way to help American drug makers while scoring public relations points. It may be that, but it's also a good idea.

HEADLINE: Adjusting for Inflation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Estate Tax Bill Could Hurt Charities'' (Business Day, June 29):
 I couldn't help but notice that while House Republicans recently approved an estate tax bill that indexes the estate tax exemption to inflation, their friends in the Senate have voted down any such adjustment for inflation for the federal minimum wage, which has remained the same since 1997. I guess this goes to show what ''family values'' mean to these people.

HEADLINE: Value of Airbus Stake Down, BAE Has Less Money for Deals 

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, July 3 

 BODY:
BAE, Europe's largest military contractor, may be forced to curtail its trans-Atlantic expansion plans temporarily after learning that a big stake it holds in Airbus is worth a little more than half what it expected. 
 BAE's 20 percent share in Airbus, maker of the delayed jumbo aircraft the A380, is worth 2.75 billion euros (about $3.5 billion), BAE said Monday, lower than all market estimates. A sale of the stake would bring BAE 1.65 billion euros (about $2.1 billion) after the company paid back loans and transaction costs.
Excluding the Airbus stake, BAE would be purely a military contractor, and its executives have said they plan to expand in the United States. Many analysts expect BAE to make deals in the United States in coming months, snapping up smaller contractors. 
 That may need to wait. Analysts had previously estimated that the Airbus stake could be worth more than 5 billion euros. The new valuation will make BAE's ''war chest smaller than they hoped'' to make acquisitions, said Tom Chruszcz, an analyst with Fitch Ratings in London. 
 BAE directors recommended in June that the company sell its stake in Airbus. Since then, Airbus has been hit by a series of problems, including the plane delays that culminated in the ouster of a top executive from Airbus's other parent, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, over the weekend.
 What exactly led to the lower valuation was unclear on Monday. Rothschild, the bank that evaluated the stake, had no comment, though bankers usually look at factors like cash flow when making their assessment. 
 The value of Airbus has always been ''shrouded in secrecy,'' Mr. Chruszcz noted.
 Airbus, one of the world's largest manufacturers of airplanes, is not publicly traded, though its parents, EADS and BAE, are. Shares in both companies fell on Monday. 
 BAE cannot sell the stake in Airbus to any other company but EADS, but the two have been unable to agree on a price and have called in Rothschild to arbitrate. Rothschild's estimate is even lower than the offer from EADS. EADS, a French-German company, was offering 3.5 billion euros, but BAE wanted more than 5 billion euros, analysts said. The lower-than-expected valuation means that BAE may delay selling the stake until May 2007, the next time it has an option to do so. 
 BAE said Monday that it was considering its options and would send out a circular with more details to shareholders ''shortly.'' The company's board is expected to meet in the next several days, and could call a special shareholders' meeting this month to vote on whether to sell the Airbus stake. 
 BAE responded angrily to the EADS announcement that some Airbus planes would be delayed, saying it had not been informed of the delays. Relations between the companies are strained, leading many to think that BAE will hold on to its Airbus stake. 
 ''If management thinks they are being stiffed here, they will recommend that shareholders hold on to the stake until next year,'' said Andy Lynch, a fund manager with Schroders in London. Then, when the A380 is delivered to the market, Airbus might ''go back towards the valuation they were expecting,'' he said. 
 Still, the unexpectedly low valuation does not mean that BAE will ultimately lose out on deals in the United States, Mr. Chruszcz said. ''At the scale that BAE is looking, I don't think another European defense company can come in and take acquisitions from them,'' he said.
 Dozens of military companies in the United States have been listed as possible targets for BAE.

EUROPE SUGGESTS RUSSIA PACT -- Two European Union officials unexpectedly floated the idea of opening talks with Moscow on forming a free trade area encompassing Europe and Russia. A European Union spokesman, however, said a free trade deal with Moscow was a distant prospect, though one that could not be ruled out. [C3.]

HEADLINE: June Sales Were Painful For the Big 3

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 3 

 BODY:
Stubbornly high gasoline prices sapped June sales of the profitable pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles made by Detroit's automakers, while Asian rivals reaped the benefits because of their reputation for fuel efficiency.
 Sales data for June, released Monday, showed that General Motors and Ford Motor hit new lows for market share in the first six months of the year, while Toyota and Honda posted record sales for the period.
The top 10 Asian manufacturers accounted for 37.3 percent of the American car market in June, just shy of the record 40 percent they recorded in May.
 G.M.'s sales fell nearly 26 percent from last June, when it was the only automaker offering employee discounts to all customers and posted a 19-year high. Ford's sales last month declined 7 percent and DaimlerChrysler's sales were down more than 15 percent. 
 At the same time, Toyota's sales in June rose 14.4 percent from a year ago, and the company outsold DaimlerChrysler for the third consecutive month.
 G.M.'s market share fell to 24.1 percent for the first half of the year. Ford's share dropped to 17.3 percent and DaimlerChrysler to 13.5 percent.
 ''The products that Toyota has, as well as Honda, are just right for the times,'' said Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, the industry statistics firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. ''Toyota and Honda couldn't be in better shape today.'' G.M. is in the midst of a six-day, ''72-hour'' promotion offering no-interest financing on many of its vehicles. A G.M. official hinted on Monday that the company was considering more discounts after the promotion ends on Wednesday. 
 Ford acknowledged the response to its no-interest loan and free gas program had not met expectations.
 Industry analysts said both companies would have to roll out better deals in light of the numbers reported on Monday. The Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler has already reintroduced the employee discounts for everyone that first appeared last summer.
 Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief sales analyst, would not say specifically what the automaker had in mind to entice buyers. ''We're not going to reveal our hand yet but we'll stay competitive,'' he said.
 Jesse Toprak, executive director of industry analysis for Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives consumers advice about buying cars, said that G.M. would probably offer more discounts on 2006 models but try to maintain prices on 2007's. 
 G.M. has said that it is moving away from deep discounts as it goes through a major restructuring, but Mr. Toprak said G.M. could not afford to abandon that strategy quite yet.
 ''They're going to have to come out with something to get rid of their excess inventory,'' he said. ''They will try to protect the 2007 pricing as much as they can.''
 Chrysler, meanwhile, hopes its latest incarnation of employee pricing, offered through July 31, will help clear dealer lots that have become crowded. Dealerships had a 91-day supply of vehicles in June, up from 77 days in May, and 50 percent more than the ideal level of 60.
 Chrysler ended June with nearly 550,000 unsold S.U.V.'s after sales plunged 15 percent for the month. The vice president of the Chrysler Group, Steven J. Landry, said the current incentive program was aimed specifically at reducing its light truck inventory.
 The deal is being promoted in an extensive advertising campaign featuring DaimlerChrysler's chairman, Dieter Zetsche, in a series of offbeat television commercials and a Web site called ''Ask Dr. Z'' in which Mr. Zetsche responds to questions posed by consumers.
 Ford was the only Detroit automaker to increase its market share in June, to 16.7 percent from 16.1 a year ago. It sold 8.6 percent more passenger cars but 14.8 percent fewer trucks and S.U.V.'s, according to Autodata.
 ''We're continuing to make progress toward our goal of slowing the rate of market share decline,'' said Ford's sales analyst, George Pipas.
 Still, Mr. Pipas said Ford's ''Drive on Us'' promotion, which gives buyers no-interest loans for up to five years and at least $1,000 toward gasoline purchases, ''didn't drive the volume in June that we were hoping to drive.'' The promotion began June 1 and is to expire at the end of July.
 ''We could make some adjustments, but I don't anticipate we're going to move off the overall promotion,'' he said.
 In all, industry sales dropped 10.5 percent compared with 2005, according to Ward's InfoBank, largely because of the fall-off at G.M. 
 Despite the decline in overall sales, G.M. experienced its first month-over-month increase in market share since August. Its share rose to 26.9 percent in June from 22.7 percent in May, but is still below the 32.4 percent it posted a year ago.
 G.M.'s June sales came in better than executives had projected last week. ''We had a very good push at the end of the month with our 72-hour sale,'' Mr. Ballew, the G.M. analyst, said.
 On Friday the last day of June and the second of six days in G.M.'s sale, a dealership in Novi, Mich., Marty Feldman Chevrolet, planned to close at 6 p.m., but its sales representatives remained on duty until nearly 11 because customers kept arriving. The dealership's sales in the last part of June were triple the usual numbers. Extra salespeople were called in Saturday to handle the crowds.
 ''We're seeing a lot of customers we might not normally see,'' said Ryan Joseph, the dealership's finance director. ''Ford owners, Chrysler owners, people who might be in the market for a Corolla or a Civic but opted for a Cobalt or a Malibu because it was more affordable.''
 Even with the big drop in overall sales in June, G.M.'s passenger car sales held steady over the year before. The Chevy Impala, the best-selling American-made car, had its best month since being redesigned for 2006. Impala sales rose 85 percent from last June.
 Only three American brands reported sales increases in June: Pontiac, Mercury and Saturn. Pontiac posted a 12 percent gain, largely because of an increase in G6 sales and sales to rental agencies, while the other two reported slight gains of about 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Tapping the Latent Power in What's Left Around the Barnyard 

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
In a sense, it is the ultimate renewable source of fuel. Weather anomalies can kill off corn crops, calm the winds, obscure the sun -- but through rain or shine, gusts or stillness, cows and hogs and turkeys spew forth a steady stream of manure, one of nature's richest sources of methane, a principal component of natural gas. 
 And now, farmers and entrepreneurs are recognizing that this immutable fact can yield a steady stream of revenue and profit, too. Slowly, but steadily, they are replacing the malodorous lagoons used to treat the waste with machines that can wrest energy from excrement.
 According to AgStar, a federal program that promotes the conversion of manure to energy, there are more than 100 anaerobic digesters -- devices that create an oxygen-free atmosphere in which bacteria digest manure and release gas -- operating in the United States today, with another 80 on the drawing boards. 
 ''These are the only kinds of waste management systems that can actually put money in farmers' pockets,'' said Kurt Roos, program manager of AgStar. 
 There are a number of reasons for the new spotlight on what is called brown energy. Oil and gas prices have soared, even as environmentalists have sounded alarms about climate change. In the last two years, various state and federal agencies have subsidized purchases of digesters, since they capture methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- before it escapes into the atmosphere. Many utilities operate in states that require them to include environmentally aware energy sources in their portfolios. They will often accept manure gas, since many farms have installed equipment to clean it. 
 In fact, more utilities are thinking of buying the gas outright. Pacific Gas and Electric has agreed to transport gas from a big digester that Microgy, a digester manufacturer, is building in California. Right now Microgy plans to sell the gas on the open market, but Robert Howard, vice president for gas transmission and distribution, said P.G.& E. may buy some gas itself. ''This technology provides pipeline-quality gas and reduces carbon emissions, so of course we're in favor it,'' he said.
 The environmental boons are many. According to Agstar, digesters are already keeping 66,000 tons of methane from escaping each year into the atmosphere, while generating enough energy to power more than 20,000 homes. 
 And technologies, some of which have been around for decades, have finally grown more reliable. ''There's been a lot of time and energy spent on making these as effective and efficient as possible, so anaerobic digestion will be a growing business,'' said Daniel J. Mannes, vice president of Avondale Partners, a securities research firm that recently initiated coverage of the Environmental Power Corporation, the company in Portsmouth, N.H., that owns Microgy.
 The potential market is huge. Agstar officials say that at least 70,000 dairy and swine farms are big enough to support a commercial digester and could collectively provide enough energy to power more than 560,000 homes, while keeping more than 1.4 million tons of methane out of the atmosphere. 
 ''The business model of producing energy along with food will transform the economics of rural America,'' said Michael T. Eckhart, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, based in Washington. 
 Indeed, anaerobic digestion yields not just methane, but leftover liquids that farmers can use or sell as fertilizer, waste heat that can heat their homes and barns, and fibrous solids that make excellent bedding for cows. Farmers also save the costs of controlling odors and treating waste. ''Two years ago I couldn't even convince farmers that digesters work,'' said Melissa Dvorak, marketing manager for GHD, a company based in Chilton, Wis., that sells digesters. ''Now, all they ask is what the payback will be.''
 The deals are struck in different ways. In most cases, farmers buy digesters and either use the gas themselves, sell it to a utility, or use it to power a generator that feeds electricity to the utility's grid. In another model, the manufacturer owns the digester and sells the gas. In those cases the farmers provide the manure and the land, and get the fertilizer, bedding and a cut of revenues from sales of gas. Last year, for example, Hunter Haven Farms in Pearl City, Ill., paid $960,000 -- half of it subsidized by state and federal grants -- for a GHD digester that processes waste from 600 dairy cows. Hunter Haven then pipes its methane into a generator, and sells the resulting electricity to Commonwealth Edison for 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
 Douglas R. Block, Hunter Haven's president, said the farm was saving $60,000 annually by using fibrous solids from the digester as bedding, and sells $12,000 worth of bedding to other farmers. And he anticipates at least $16,000 in added revenue from carbon credits, the tradeable units for reducing methane emissions. 
 Five Star Dairy, a 900-cow dairy farm in Elk Mound, Wis., anticipates a similar profit stream from the $1.2 million Microgy digester it installed in 2004. Lee Jensen, Five Star's general manager, said the Dairyland Power Cooperative pays him about 5 cents per kilowatt hour for energy, and that he is saving money on bedding and fertilizer.
 ''We're not taking any risk, the reduction in odors is huge, and we're powering 600 homes with 900 cows,'' he said. ''You've got to admit, that's pretty efficient.''
 The digester companies are betting their futures that more farmers will agree with him. Environmental Power is phasing out an older business in burning waste coal to focus on its Microgy subsidiary, which uses a technology that it licensed from Xergi, a Danish company. Microgy, whose digesters can accept used cooking grease as well as manure, has already sold three of its machines in Wisconsin, and is building one in Huckabay, Tex., that will process waste from 10,000 cows. It will own that one itself, and hopes to sell the resulting gas on the open market.
 GHD is cutting back on its business of cleaning up pollution from underground gas tanks to concentrate on the anaerobic digestion patents it has held since the late 1990's. It has sold 15 small manure digesters and is building 6 more. 
 Intrepid Technology and Resources, based in Idaho Falls, Idaho, is discontinuing its engineering services business to concentrate on its digester processes. Dennis D. Keiser, Intrepid's chief executive, said that in five or six years, he expects Intrepid will be collecting manure from 100,000 cows on 50 farms, and generating enough gas to serve 40,000 homes. ''We're not profitable yet, but in the next 12 months we will be,'' he predicted. That may yet depend on the utilities that accept the processed gas, particularly since Agstar and some states have cut back on subsidies.
 ''Digesters need to get at least 6 cents a kilowatt hour to break even, and too many utilities want to pay 2 cents,'' said George Sterzinger, executive director of the Renewable Energy Policy Project, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. 
 But utilities are coming around. Dairyland is taking enough manure-generated electricity from Microgy projects in Wisconsin to power 1,800 homes, and John M. McWilliams, the utility's resource planner, said he hoped to have 30 digesters linked to his grid soon. Mr. McWilliams called manure-to-energy systems one of the few environmental technologies that can offer guaranteed supply and stable prices. 
 ''Wind blows intermittently, people don't want more rivers and streams dammed up, there aren't many new landfills to tap, and we're captive to railroads to transport coal,'' he said. ''Manure digestion is probably the only way we can expand.''
 Central Vermont Public Service is letting its customers choose. In October 2004 it gave its 151,000 customers an option to pay a few cents more for ''cow power,'' so that the utility could pay for the more expensive electricity generated from manure. More than 3,000 customers have agreed to do so, and David J. Dunn, a senior energy consultant at the utility, said more keep signing up. 
 The utility is buying gas from one farm now, but Mr. Dunn said two others are installing digesters, and two more plan to do so soon. 
 ''We've already got more customers signed up than cow power to sell them,'' Mr. Dunn said. ''Cow power is really a market-driven program.''

HEADLINE: The Face of the Shutdown

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 3 

 BODY:
When Gov. Jon S. Corzine looks back at the Budget Crisis of '06 and begins to ponder re-election, he may be able to say that his tough-medicine plan to increase the sales tax was the right way to turn around the state's troubled finances.
 But as New Jersey braced for the fourth day of a government shutdown ordered on Saturday by Mr. Corzine -- at a cost of several million dollars a day to the state coffers -- he is the person residents seem to be holding responsible for the loss of services. 
Some have been heard to grumble that Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs whose personal wealth has been estimated at several hundred million dollars, can afford a tax increase and a government shutdown, an interesting conundrum for the governor who is considered a liberal Democrat and a bit of a populist.
 Can't get that driver's license renewed or play the lottery? Angry about the possibility that Atlantic City's casinos will close on Wednesday morning? Or worried about being able to put food on the table if you are a state worker who has been furloughed?
 Who else are people going to blame, at some point, but the governor?
 Never mind that the bond-rating agencies have generally had good things to say about Mr. Corzine's budget framework, which includes increasing the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent, to help stabilize the state's finances. And never mind that many Trenton veterans -- including Assemblyman Kevin J. O'Toole, a Republican from Essex County who has been closely involved with budget negotiations -- say that the Assembly Democrats are more to blame for dragging their feet.
 At a certain point, the lasting image of New Jersey's first government shutdown will no longer hinge on such political nuances or footnotes. Instead, it will be remembered by the faces and actions of those in charge.
 In a state where the governor is the only statewide elected official, Mr. Corzine is that face.
 Perhaps that is why Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr., at least to this point, seems to have had few qualms about adamantly refusing to go along with the tax increase proposed by Mr. Corzine, a fellow Democrat. ''Most voters associate their governor directly with the good things and the bad things that happen to their state government, so it's impossible for him to escape the public's judgment, whether it's praise or wrath,'' said Larry J. Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. ''And in this case it could easily turn into wrath. Sure, he says he's standing up for principle, which makes him a profile in courage. But virtually everybody in J.F.K.'s book lost his next election.''
 Of course, some governors have gambled on high-risk initiatives and won. In the 1970's, Gov. Brendan T. Byrne felt strongly that New Jersey needed an income tax. Although there was a great deal of opposition, Mr. Byrne prevailed and was ultimately re-elected.
 Then there is Gov. Jim Florio, whose name has been mentioned almost daily in connection with the budget standoff between Mr. Corzine and a sizable bloc in the Assembly. In 1990, Mr. Florio got his $2.8 billion tax increase, but he also returned to private life four years before he would have preferred -- as did a substantial number of fellow Democrats in the Legislature defeated in re-election bids. One Democrat who survived that purge was Mr. Roberts, who, like Mr. Florio, comes from Camden County.
 A tantalizing question that has been percolating in Trenton as the budget standoff has escalated is the role -- if any -- that another influential Democrat from Camden County, George E. Norcross III, may have over Mr. Roberts and Assemblyman Louis D. Greenwald, the chairman of the Budget Committee who is also from Camden County.
 If nothing else, Mr. Corzine has already demonstrated that he has few concerns about alienating leading Democratic constituents like urban school districts or Democratic power brokers. And unlike former Gov. James E. McGreevey, who was always careful when it came to dealing with political benefactors, Mr. Corzine has acknowledged that some of his decisions have been politically unpopular, and that he may not win if he runs again in 2009.
 But when asked on Monday whether he should be held responsible for the shutdown, he responded: ''I believe that the people of this state expect that their leadership, their governor, will do those things that will lay down a foundation for economic well-being over a longer period of time. And I think the vast majority over a period of time will understand that if we have fiscal stability, we will be able to invest in our children.'' 
 For now, Mr. Corzine still has the crucial support of many state workers as well as the sympathies of some leading Republicans. Indeed, members of Local 1033 and Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America staged another rally outside the State House on Monday, criticizing the Legislature for failing to come up with a budget.
 ''To those who watch it closely, it is the leadership in the Assembly that has failed to bring a budget to the budget committee,'' Assemblyman O'Toole said. ''When people do their Monday morning quarterbacking, they will find that it was a breakdown in leadership that led us to this crisis.''

HEADLINE: Corzine Calls Special Joint Session to Resolve Budget Crisis

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES and LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 3 

 BODY:
When New Jersey residents return to work on Wednesday after the long holiday weekend, they may find much of their state paralyzed by a government shutdown that began Saturday morning for lack of a budget and that is eroding more services with each passing day.
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine ordered lawmakers on Monday, the first workday affected by the shutdown, to return to the State House on Tuesday for an unusual joint session of the Senate and Assembly on the budget.
During a midafternoon news conference here Monday, a visibly angry Mr. Corzine, who occasionally pounded the lectern, assailed the lack of progress in negotiations on his $31 billion budget, which has been stalled over a proposed sales tax increase that he says is needed for the state's long-term economic stability. The Assembly speaker has insisted such an increase is not the way to balance the budget.
 The governor -- in an executive order issued Saturday -- called for the government shutdown after the State Legislature missed the June 30 mandated deadline for adopting a budget for the new fiscal year. 
 ''People of our great state are being imposed on because there's not a budget to consider,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''There's no budget to veto, no budget to amend and no budget to sign.''
 Although essential operations like prisons, mental hospitals and the state police are still operating, the shutdown has led to the closing of the Motor Vehicle Commission, and road construction projects have been stopped. Courts have been ordered to stop all but emergency operations. 
 In all, about 45,000 of the state's 80,000 employees have been ordered to stay home without pay.
 Unless the Legislature reaches an agreement on Tuesday, all 12 Atlantic City casinos are to be shuttered at 8 a.m. Wednesday, a move that a State Supreme Court justice affirmed on Monday by rejecting the industry's appeal. Gambling will not be allowed but hotels and restaurants will remain open. 
 The closings will cost the state more than $1 million daily in tax revenue in addition to the $2.2 million a day that is being lost by the closing of the state lottery. 
 As the budget standoff stretched into its third day Monday, the two sides appeared to have moved slightly farther apart. Negotiations between Governor Corzine and top legislative leaders lasted less than a half-hour with neither side encouraged that the impasse could be broken any time soon.
 Asked if a compromise was imminent that might end the shutdown, Senate President Richard J. Codey, who attended the meeting, replied, ''I don't think so.''
 Mr. Codey and the Senate Democrats have generally supported Mr. Corzine on the critical item in Mr. Corzine's proposed budget, an increase in the sales tax. 
 However, Mr. Corzine's main adversary, Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr., stepped up his opposition to the governor's proposal to help balance the budget by raising the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent.
 In a day of several unusual moves, Mr. Roberts -- who has led the opposition among Assembly Democrats to the tax increase -- challenged the governor to identify the members of the Legislature who support the tax increase.
 ''If the governor can demonstrate that legislative support is there, then I will post his sales tax bill in 24 hours,'' Mr. Roberts said in a statement that was made public moments after he entered the meeting with Mr. Corzine and Mr. Codey.
 Mr. Roberts questioned whether Mr. Corzine had sufficient support in either chamber for the increase to be approved, even though Democrats have a 49-to-31 advantage in the Assembly and a 22-to-18 edge in the Senate.
 Mr. Corzine dismissed Mr. Roberts's demand to identify legislators who support the measure, saying that he remained committed to keeping government closed until the Legislature approved a budget that he felt was fiscally sound.
 ''He's asking for a vote,'' Mr. Corzine said of Mr. Roberts's demand. ''I think the budget committee should put a bill on the floor. It won't be everything that I want. But let's see whether it meets the general principles of recurring revenue matching recurring expenditures.''
 Later, Mr. Corzine said that if a budget has not been voted on, ''one has to ask why that isn't happening.''
 Mr. Roberts said in an interview that the Assembly Budget Committee -- which must report out a budget bill so that it can voted on by both chambers -- had not acted in part because the governor had asked several Democratic members not to release a bill unless it had a proposal to increase the sales tax in it. 
 However, the speaker declined to identify the committee members who had been approached by Mr. Corzine.
 Mr. Corzine's press secretary, Anthony Coley, said that Mr. Corzine had not made any such requests. 
 The speaker's challenge to Mr. Corzine underscores the persistent bitterness of the budget talks, which is particularly noteworthy because all of the major players are Democrats.
 The dispute has exposed a rift in the party, prompting rampant speculation about the political consequences for Mr. Corzine and Mr. Roberts. Because Mr. Corzine is the de facto leader of the party in New Jersey, some have questioned whether Mr. Roberts -- a veteran of nearly 20 years in the Legislature -- might be replaced as speaker, a post he assumed in January.
 Asked if he supported replacing Mr. Roberts, Mr. Corzine replied, ''I'm not in favor of that.''
 For his part, Mr. Roberts said that he had no concerns about his political future. ''I'm not nervous at all,'' he said. ''I think my good friends here are going to look out for me, and we'll be fine.''
 Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, the state Democratic chairman and a supporter of Mr. Corzine's budget, defended Mr. Roberts's leadership position. 
 ''We have different views here, but that doesn't mean he's a bad speaker,'' said Mr. Cryan. ''He'll be a great speaker for years to come.''
 For their part, Republicans have complained that Mr. Roberts has treated them dismissively since becoming speaker in January. 
 ''I don't think there's any tears being shed for the prospect of Joe Roberts being in trouble in my caucus,'' one Republican legislator said. 
 Tuesday's joint meeting of the Legislature will be the second time in four years that a governor has called a special session to push through a budget.
 But the special session called by Gov. James E. McGreevey in 2003 began two days before the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
 Legislators managed to approve a budget after an around-the-clock negotiating session that lasted until the morning of July 1, and all government operations continued while the two chambers voted.
 Late Monday afternoon, Mr. Roberts said he and other Democratic leaders would spend the evening calling Assembly members to make sure they report in the morning. When asked if he had any plan to talk to the governor again before then, he said, ''I would love to.''

HEADLINE: Disunited States Of America

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
On Independence Day, would we all be happier with even more independence? What if government of the people meant that the Red people in the South and the Blue people in the North had a border between them?
 This question used to be of interest mainly to Southerners mourning their Lost Cause, but nowadays Northerners have their own reason to lament. The South is gaining seats in Congress at their expense, and four of the last five presidents have come from the South.
If the South were a separate country, Northern liberals wouldn't be ranting at George W. Bush and Pat Robertson. They wouldn't be frantically trying to find a candidate who appealed to the Bible Belt and pretended to enjoy Nascar races. They might never hear a Garth Brooks song or have to stop at a Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. 
 Southern conservatives wouldn't have to fight for moral values against godless Yankees. They wouldn't have to watch John Kerry go hunting. Michael Moore would be an obscure foreign filmmaker. Talk-show hosts wouldn't be rallying their audiences against Hillary Clinton because she'd never have been elected to their Senate. Politics in both countries might be less partisan, even civil.
 I realize this prospect sounds farfetched, but it's not crazy to imagine that the South could have become independent. It's a ''counterfactual'' possibility that has been seriously debated by historians. 
 The pessimists include Roger Ransom, who lays out a detailed scenario in his recent book, ''The Confederate States of America.'' Ransom, an economic historian at the University of California at Riverside, imagines the Confederate armies in the West and at Gettysburg making a few different moves that stymie the Union, leaving the war stalemated in 1864.
 As a result, Lincoln loses the election, and his successor signs a peace treaty allowing the South to secede. The Confederacy stretches from Virginia down to Florida and out to the western edge of Arizona (with the international border running along the upper edges of Kentucky, Arkansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico).
 Slavery remains legal, in Ransom's alternate history, but when world demand for cotton declines in the 1870's, slavery becomes a political and economic liability. The Confederate government, struggling to diversify its economy, emancipates the slaves and compensates their owners (who would have been lobbying for such a buyout). 
 On balance, Ransom figures, Southern whites would have fared a little better economically in a separate nation. But blacks would have done much worse, and not only because slavery would have lasted longer. Once freed, they wouldn't have been given equal political or economic rights in the Confederacy, and Northerners might have tried to stop them from immigrating -- maybe with the seal-the-border fervor of today's Minutemen.
 Ransom's pessimism is shared by another historian, John Majewski of the University of California at Santa Barbara. He imagines blacks suffering for decades, first under slavery and then under an apartheid system. He speculates that people in both countries would have ended up poorer, especially in the South, because of trade barriers between the countries and the lack of a single large market.
 But there's also the optimistic scenario of Jeff Hummel, an economic historian at San Jose State University, the author of ''Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men.'' He believes slavery would have collapsed quickly if the South had been allowed to peacefully secede and the North had simply stopped returning runaway slaves.
 Unable to stop slaves from escaping, Hummel argues, the South would have been forced to abandon the system, and freed blacks could ultimately have been better off than they were during the Jim Crow era. 
 Hummel imagines that both the South and the North could have done well economically as independent nations -- Canada, after all, is not exactly a Third World country. In fact, he thinks people in both countries could have been richer and freer because of smaller national governments. For example, their competition for trade with Europe would have prevented them from imposing the high tariffs that the United States maintained in the late 19th century. 
 I side with Hummel's optimism, although it's possible that something could have gone very wrong between the North and the South -- like another war, as Ransom envisions would have occurred in the early 20th century. I don't buy that scenario, but if you do, then the current Red-Blue divide doesn't seem so bad after all.

HEADLINE: Billionaires to the Rescue

BYLINE: By David Nasaw. 
David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City University of New York Graduate Center, is the author of the forthcoming ''Andrew Carnegie.''

 BODY:
WHEN Warren Buffett announced that he was giving away $31 million in stock to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, he was following in the footsteps of the tiny Scots-American steelmaker Andrew Carnegie. 
 Over a century ago, Carnegie announced that he intended to give away his fortune, not a portion of it, or even 85 percent, as Mr. Buffett has pledged, but every penny. On his death in 1919, The New York Times estimated that Carnegie had in his lifetime dispersed more than $370 million to charity (equivalent to tens of billions today).
In his ''Gospel of Wealth'' essays, first published almost 120 years ago, Carnegie assailed those who believed it their right to spend their fortunes on themselves or leave them to their children. He considered it to be an act of almost criminal negligence for men like himself to waste their talents accumulating millions that were not going to be spent for the sake of the larger community. ''The day is not far distant when the man who dies leaving behind him millions of available wealth will pass away 'unwept, unhonored and unsung,' '' he wrote. ''Of such as these the public verdict will then be: 'The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.' '' 
 The question that has been asked often of Carnegie is whether in giving away his money he was attempting to atone for his sins. For Carnegie, the assumption has often been that he was trying to earn redemption for the bloodletting of the early 1890's, when, with the help of Pinkerton agents, he broke strikes, busted unions, decreased wages and increased the workday to 12 hours, seven days a week, in his Pittsburgh-area mills.
 The assumption is off the mark. Carnegie was not acting out of guilt or shame at breaking unions or compelling his employees to work in inhuman conditions. He had, in fact, determined to give away his millions long before the events at Homestead because he never considered the money his to do with as he pleased. 
 In his mind, Carnegie had not earned this fortune as an individual, but held it as a ''trustee'' for the larger community, which was the source of all wealth. ''Wealth is not chiefly the product of the individual,'' he wrote, ''but largely the joint product of the community.'' 
 Without the tremendous growth of the American population and economy in the late 19th century, there would have been no railroads and no need for his iron and steel. Without abundant coal in southwestern Pennsylvania, iron ore in the Mesabi Range of Minnesota and the genius of the men who worked for him, there would have been no millions in his accounts. 
 Carnegie believed he had nothing to atone for. The laws of the marketplace were inexorable and had to be obeyed. Even had it been possible for him to pay higher wages and remain competitive and profitable -- which he insisted it was not -- he would have resisted doing so. 
 ''Trifling sums given to each every week or month -- and the sums would be trifling indeed -- would be frittered away, 9 times out of 10, in things which pertain to the body and not to the spirit; upon richer food and drink, better clothing, more extravagant living,'' he declared. It was far better that he make as great a profit as possible for later redistribution in the manner he thought best. 
 While we can only applaud the decision by Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates to give away so much of their fortunes, their gifts raise questions not unlike those that confronted Andrew Carnegie a century ago. Is society served by permitting so much capital to be accumulated by so few? Should we have to rely on the usually unfulfilled hope that fortunes of this magnitude will be put to a good cause? What becomes of a society that must rely on ''gifts'' from a handful of socially conscious billionaires to save its schools, cure disease and alleviate poverty?

HEADLINE: Contemporary Music's Hope for Vitality Is Writ Small, Not Large

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
Recently I heard pieces by 12 American composers at two events. The American Composers Alliance at the tiny Thalia Theater played music by people hovering around middle age or beyond. The names at the Counter)induction concert at the equally tiny Tenri Cultural Center averaged about 35.
 None of these 12, I think, will ever have festivals devoted to them. Their chances of big commissions by major symphony orchestras or opera houses are equally dim. They have been, or probably will be, recorded, the making of CD's having become such a user-friendly cottage industry. Judging by their program biographies, all seem to have first-rate musical educations and many teaching jobs. 
Posterity does not beckon. There may be no entries in future music encyclopedias. Scholars will not pore over their techniques or the cultural contexts of their lives. Yet these composers are obviously devoted to their work, and to one another's work as well. A lot of them know exactly what they are doing. How high they aspire I don't know. I hope their aspirations are more on the order of personal satisfaction and the collegiality of fellow artists than of fame.
 This may sound like a sad story, but it is not. That these concerts go on -- indeed, thrive -- tells us that music as an art keeps moving through time from generation to generation, from language to language and idea to idea. Such progress is usually unremarked by the serious music lover who looks to a Thomas Ades or the next grand premiere for signs of advances in music. 
 I suggest that it is my 12 men and women who keep music going. Any true lover of baseball will understand. We cherish the skills -- indeed, the art -- of players at the highest level, but we also feel that the essence of the sport is in the sandlot pickup game, or softball in Central Park. The most satisfying afternoons I have ever spent were not in Yankee Stadium but in minor-league parks in cities like Indianapolis or Richmond, Va.
 Music at the highest levels is to be honored and sought after; mediocrity is no prize. But supreme talent can also be a victim of its own success. Size does matter. How many famous pianists have I heard with reputations big enough to command full houses at Carnegie or Avery Fisher Hall who would be so much more effective in spaces seating 500 or fewer? Music is a business, and if you can sell more tickets, you do. The Metropolitan Opera House is bigger than it ought to be because, economically, it has to be.
 Indeed, intimacy is one of the prizes our 12 composers have won, though sometimes, I'm sure, in spite of themselves. Concerts like the recent ones at the Thalia and Tenri are invariably played by young musicians of astonishing skill and evident devotion. No one is in these kinds of events for the money. The waiving of fees is a common practice.
 At Tenri loose chairs are pulled up around players in one corner of an art gallery space. Anyone who remembers the cinematic history of the Thalia will know how small it is. When I first started covering this kind of event, more than 25 years ago, I usually came away with a sense of having heard very talented people who were frustrated, forlorn and isolated. I hope I have learned better. Certainly these composers, musicians and audiences are at a distance from New York Philharmonic subscription concerts or Great Performers at Lincoln Center. But there is a community here, a kind of musical village, that is taking care of itself very nicely.
 There is a quota of aspiring students at these events, a critic or two, a handful of the curious, or just plain admiring concertgoers. But more often than not, the composers and musicians onstage are being received by their colleagues sitting in the audience. A few weeks hence, perhaps in another place, the people onstage will be sitting in the audience, and the people in the audience will be up there playing.
 We are still pretty well hypnotized by the big event, the international reputation and the march toward future greatness. This mentality has also caused us to misuse the word ''provincial,'' which now implies ''limiting'' when it might more constructively mean ''limited.'' Being limited need not mean being less sophisticated, less proficient or less intelligent. Small communities can do music's work at a high level without management or press coverage.
 I don't pretend to understand how the Internet proliferates music as widely as it does. I do know that it is promoting many individual tastes for individual audiences. This makes the prospects for our 12 composers very promising. True greatness will always pursue universality, but it is the very good and the local that keep music's blood circulating.

Record Producer Sentenced (And Pardoned) in Dubai
The American record producer Dallas Austin was sentenced yesterday in Dubai to four years in prison for cocaine possession but almost immediately was said by two of his lawyers to have been pardoned, The Associated Press reported. In sentencing Mr. Austin, 34, who has produced hits for TLC and Boyz II Men, among others, the court also ruled that he be deported after serving his term. Two of his lawyers said shortly afterward that Mr. Austin, above right, had been pardoned by the ruler of Dubai, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. Mr. Austin, who pleaded guilty on Monday, was arrested on May 19 as he arrived at the airport in Dubai to attend a three-day birthday party for the model Naomi Campbell. 


Pinchas Zukerman Extends Contract in Ottawa
Pinchas Zukerman, who touched off a furor by saying he needed a rest and then taking a sudden sabbatical last December from his post as music director of the National Arts Center Orchestra in Ottawa, has extended his contract at least until 2011, the orchestra announced yesterday. Mr. Zukerman, left, who was appointed in 1999, broke his silence about his departure in January, when he referred to ''a few rotten apples'' that ascend to prominence in every orchestra and ''create an atmosphere that has to be eradicated, quite frankly.'' Jayne Watson, the orchestra's director of communications, called the remarks ''intemperate.'' Mr. Zukerman returned a month earlier than planned, to lead the orchestra in concerts in May. Yesterday, the orchestra said the renewal of his contract was approved unanimously by the board, and Mr. Zukerman, in a statement, said, ''Thanks to the dedication of my orchestra colleagues, we have been able to make a difference across Canada by reaching out to new and diverse communities to introduce them to the power and magic of music.''

Chomsky Publisher Charged in Turkey
Fatih Tas, the Turkish publisher of a book by the American intellectual Noam Chomsky, said yesterday that he and two of his colleagues were facing prison sentences as long as six years on charges of ''denigrating national identity'' and ''inciting hatred,'' Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Tas, owner of the Aram Publishing House, said that he and his colleagues Omer Faruk Kurhan and Taylan Tosun had been charged over the book ''Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,'' written by Mr. Chomsky, right, and Edward S. Herman, which argues that corporate and government pressures distort news coverage. Mr. Tas said that Ender Abadoglu, the translator of the book, published in Turkey in March, was also likely to be indicted. Mr. Tas was tried and acquitted in 2002 for publishing ''American Interventionism,'' a collection of essays by Mr. Chomsky that included criticism of the Turkish government's treatment of its Kurdish minority and of American arms sales to Turkey. The European Union has warned Turkey that prosecution of intellectuals and writers is harmful to its bid for membership.

Americans in Paris
A statue of Thomas Jefferson and a portrait of Rosa Parks were unveiled yesterday in Independence Day observances in Paris attended by its mayor, Bertrand Delanoe, and by the mayor of Washington, Anthony Williams, Agence France-Presse reported. The statue of Jefferson, who drafted the Declaration of Independence, represented the United States in France from 1785 to 1789, became the first American secretary of state and served as the third president, is at the approach to a pedestrian bridge across the Seine next to the Musee d'Orsay. The portrait of Mrs. Parks, who died last year and whose defiance of Jim Crow laws helped to touch off the civil rights movement in the United States, was unveiled at a sports center in southern Paris.

B. B. King Bids Farewell at Montreux
The blues guitarist and songwriter B. B. King, 80, ailing and on a final tour of Europe, bade an emotional farewell to fans at a concert that stretched into the early hours yesterday at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, where he has performed for more than 20 years, Reuters reported. At the end of the two-and-a-half-hour concert in the resort town on Lake Geneva, Mr. King, above, who suffers from diabetes, was saluted by performers who joined him onstage. Among those paying tribute were the singers Gladys Knight, Barbara Hendricks, Randy Crawford and Leela James; the jazz guitarists John McLaughlin and Stanley Clarke; the keyboarders Joe Sample and George Duke, and the saxophonist David Sanborn. ''Maybe I should quit every night,'' said Mr. King, a winner of 14 Grammy Awards. Claude Nobs, the founder of the festival, celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, said: ''Nobody wants it to be your last year. B. B., you are an honorary citizen of Montreux; this is your second home.''

Hungary's Envoy Rocks
Andras Simonyi, Hungary's ambassador to the United States, traveled from Washington to Westminster, Md., yesterday to play blues at Common Ground on the Hill, Reuters reported. Attended by more than 300 people, Common Ground is an institute that offers classes in traditional arts and music, from the African roots of the concept ''cool'' to bluegrass banjo. Mr. Simonyi, who said he hoped to play guitar with rockers in the Bush administration, was born in 1952 and credits rock with giving him a vital connection to the outside world during the Communist era in Hungary. ''When I was listening to rock music, I became part of the West,'' he said. ''This was a link to the free world.'' When he came to Washington as ambassador in 2002, he formed a band called Coalition of the Willing, including Jeff Baxter, formerly of Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers; Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr., former assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs; and Alexander Vershbow, United States ambassador to South Korea. Mr. Simonyi said he had spoken to the White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, and spokesman, Tony Snow, both musicians, about a White House concert.

China Bans Korean Film
China has banned South Korea's leading box-office movie because of subtle gay themes, Reuters reported yesterday. An executive with the South Korean entertainment company CJ said from its Beijing office that the film, ''King and the Clown,'' about a tyrannical ruler and his two court jesters, right, was denied distribution permission because of sexually explicit language and China's sensitivity to homosexuality, considered a mental disorder as recently as 2001. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, however, that the company had been authorized to sell the film on DVD. ''King and the Clown,'' which took in about $85 million and sold about 12 million tickets in South Korea, has no sex scenes involving the king and the jesters, but a romance is implied. China's film censorship authority was not available for comment.

Footnote
Free performances of the Friedrich Schiller play ''Mary Stuart'' will be given by New York Classical Theater at 7 tonight and from Friday through Wednesday at Castle Clinton in Battery Park in a presentation of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council in association with the River to River Festival.

HEADLINE: Bach and Ruin: Impressions Of Neighborhoods Gone Bad

BYLINE: By NATHAN LEE

 BODY:
''Urbanscapes'' plants a camera in neighborhoods gone to seed, cultivating a bittersweet portrait of American ruin. The filmmakers, Lorena Luciano and Filippo Piscopo, grew up in Italy, and they regard the dilapidations of their adopted superpower with a touch of the tourist's sentimentalism. Wastes of Chicago, Detroit, the South Bronx and Newark are reflected through measured montage and digital-video impressionism. A cello suite by Bach is as prevalent as the trash. 
 As indicated by the title, this documentary tends toward the general, abstract and vague, though some detail and much charm are achieved by the choice of commentators. The photographer Camilo J. Vergara tracks the metamorphosis of specific city blocks over decades, returning to update his extensive record of demolition, gentrification, neglect or renewal.
General Gordon Baker, a Detroit autoworker, remembers better days. Marion, his wife, who is a social worker, recalls the upheavals of urban renewal, a process known in her circle as ''Negro removal.'' Mel Rosenthal, a native of the South Bronx, returns with memories good (then as now, a vibrant street life) and bad (the ''planned shrinkage'' of the 1970's, whereby municipal services like garbage collection and firefighting were deliberately cut back to encourage the exodus of undesirable populations). 
 Things go bad for a reason, and in the United States they go very bad where poor black people live. ''Urbanscapes'' doesn't neglect the politics of blight, but as with every subject glanced at here -- memory, architecture, city planning, racism -- the emphasis sticks on those poetically entropic facades.

HEADLINE: The Pay Is Awful, but Judging Barbecue Has Its Rewards

BYLINE: By DANA BOWEN and JOSH OZERSKY

DATELINE: Franklin Square, N.Y. 

 BODY:
ON a Saturday morning, 56 people filed into a nondescript office building on Hempstead Turnpike here to learn how to eat barbecue. And how to taste it, smell it, prod it and otherwise determine whether it is worthy of honor -- and cash prizes. 
 As barbecue competitions become more popular around the country, skilled judges are increasingly in demand, especially in the Northeast, which has no great history of the smoking pit. 
The number of contests sanctioned by the Kansas City Barbecue Society, competitive barbecue's most influential governing body, has risen in the past five years, to 220 a year from fewer than 60, said Carolyn Wells, the executive director. So the organization has been training more judges -- 8,000 have been sworn in over the past decade -- but until recently few New Yorkers were among them.
 The students here, mostly local men who spend many weekends little more than an arm's length from their backyard barbecues, had paid $70 each to cover the five-hour class and membership in the Kansas City Barbecue Society. (Members of the society paid only $45, for the class.) After studying the rule book and signing the judges' code of conduct, they would qualify to rate events like the fourth annual Grill Kings competition, with 50 teams, at Belmont Park on July 15 and 16, and the second annual Hudson Valley Ribfest from Aug. 18 to 20 in New Paltz, N.Y.
 As the instructor, Jerry Mullane, outlined the scoring system, students learned that the rules of barbecue are not intuitive, but they are exacting. 
 ''How much sauce can you have?'' Mr. Mullane asked, pointing to the bottom of a plastic-foam box like the ones competitors use to deliver meat to tables of six judges. ''We say a 50-cent piece.'' That is, bigger than a dab, smaller than a puddle.
 Students patiently scribbled notes as Mr. Mullane, a restaurant owner from suburban Philadelphia and a longtime judge, listed acceptable garnishes: parsley and cilantro, yes; red leaf lettuce and crinkly greens, no. 
 Stomachs were growling by lunchtime, when each table was presented with a dozen meat-filled boxes: three variations each on chicken, ribs, pork shoulder and brisket. But hunger did not cloud the students' criticism.
 Debbie Knicos, who runs a cookie business out of her Long Island home and barbecues on a kettle grill she converts to a smoker, raised an eyebrow at a box of haphazardly arranged chicken thighs.
 ''There's no lettuce,'' she whispered, penciling in low marks for appearance, moderate marks for taste and tenderness. 
 ''In places like Kansas City everyone's a judge, and they let people out of work to judge,'' Mr. Mullane told the class. Events in New York, like the Big Apple Barbecue Block Party, where some of the country's top pit masters cook in Madison Square Park, are more about bonhomie than championship titles.
 Still, interest is growing in the Northeast. ''We used to be a clique,'' said Mr. Mullane, who started judging around the country 10 years ago with his wife, Linda, after their son left for college. Now there are new judges at every event, he said.
 Barbecue judges are not paid, but many believe that the smoked meat they consume -- about two pounds at each contest -- is fair compensation. Mr. Mullane, a man whose girth suggests a sincere love of food, revealed tips for getting even more.
 ''If you get there on Friday you're going to have a great time,'' he said, describing the night-before party that unfolds while competitors are cooking. ''The best way to get food is to say, 'Wow, that's a great smoker!' ''
 Many of the students were looking for cooking tips, too. After learning that perfectly cooked brisket should expand and contract and that ribs should not fall from the bone, Walter Ejnes, the president of a medical education company, revised his recipe. ''I overcook my ribs,'' he wrote via e-mail after the event. ''One hour less on the smoker might make them even better.''
 During breaks, the students hobnobbed with the competition barbecuers who prepared the meat for the class: Phil Rizzardi, who competes for Barbecue Brethren, a Long Island team, and Nancee Gell of Norwalk, Conn., whose team, representing Purple Turtle Catering, won top prize at Grillin' on the Bay in Brooklyn in March. It was the first competition in New York City sanctioned by the New England Barbecue Society, which follows Kansas City Barbecue Society rules.
 Mr. Rizzardi said later that he was a little dubious about the class. A grease fire did in the ribs, he said, but that did not keep many students from awarding top marks. No experience beyond the class is required for certification.
 ''It kind of concerns me!'' Mr. Rizzardi said. ''These are our future judges of America.''
 The ribs, overcooked and charred, didn't go unnoticed by a few competitors who were among the student body, hoping to glean what judges are looking for. 
 ''I wanted to see the inside of the game,'' said Lou Elrose, a k a Big Lou, a retired New York City police officer who cooks on the competition circuit with Adam Perry Lang, the chef at Daisy May's BBQ USA in Manhattan. Mr. Lang won the grand championship last year at the Great Pork BarbeQLossal in Des Moines, the first New Yorker to do so. 
 Mr. Lang, like most restaurateurs who moonlight as competitive barbecuers, has taken the judging class. He arrives at competitions early to shop local supermarkets and eat at local barbecue places, in an effort to understand the mind-set of local judges. ''You want to know your audience,'' he said.
 He uses sweeter flavors when competing in Kansas City, more vinegary undertones in the South. And he relies on tips he has picked up on the circuit, like injecting meat with marinade to keep it moist. 
 Judges warn, however, that if dark liquids are injected, they could streak the meat, drawing demerits for appearance. Not Mr. Lang's award-winning pork butt recipe, which has a hint of soy-spiked fruit. But he doesn't inject his meat at his restaurant.
 ''Competition barbecue,'' he said, ''is its own art form."

HEADLINE: In the World of Fine Wine, There'll Always Be a France

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov

 BODY:
PERMIT me to speak briefly in praise of France. 
 Yes, France, the greatest wine producing nation in the world.
Don't look so shocked. I've heard about the Judgment of Paris, the famous blind tasting in which French and American wines went glass-to-glass in 1976, and the French lost. I know all about the greatness of California cabernets and shiraz from Australia, and I understand that the French lag in the clever global marketing of instantly recognizable brands of wine.
 Nonetheless, no country comes close to matching France, either in setting demanding standards for its wine industry or in producing such a variety of consistently excellent wine. Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne and the Rhone go without saying, but those famous regions are simply the most visible. From Jurancon in the southwest to Jura in the east, from Nantes on the Atlantic to Alsace on the German border, France makes wines that are endlessly compelling and should be endlessly inspiring.
 Why is it necessary for me to state what should be obvious? Because a prevailing attitude toward France and its wines, in the New World at least, seems stuck somewhere between pity and glee for an industry supposedly rotting from within. 
 New World producers and journalists like to jeer at the sacred French notion of terroir as a myth constructed to preserve French status in the industry, and they laugh at the rigidity of the French appellation rules, which dictate what French growers can plant, where they can plant it, and how they should tend the vines. The European Union's recent decision to spend millions of dollars in an effort to diminish a European wine glut by digging up vineyards and turning excess wine into ethanol contributed to a confused perception of industry-wide crisis. The perception springs from an oversimplification of the French wine business, and no doubt a bit of wishful thinking.
 The latest chorus of American gloating was heard around the time of the 30th anniversary celebration of the Paris tasting, even as many of these same gloaters were lining up to pay record prices for the heralded 2005 vintage of Bordeaux. When French winemakers were understandably reluctant to participate in yet another re-enactment in May, American wine writers were quick to play the cowardice card. And when the event feebly played out, and the Americans won again, writers exulted.
 ''Sacre bleu! Make that red, white and blue,'' Linda Murphy wrote in The San Francisco Chronicle, which can perhaps be forgiven for boosterish support of an industry in its backyard. In maybe the unkindest blow of all, Hollywood is apparently considering a movie version of the original event, based on the book ''Judgment of Paris: California vs. France and the Historic 1976 Paris Tasting That Revolutionized Wine'' (Scribner, 2005), by George M. Taber. 
 Maybe it's payback for years of supercilious French sneering at the American wine industry. Or maybe Americans just need to lash out to pump themselves up with competitive energy, like football players pounding their lockers in an adrenalin-fueled frenzy. Any way you look at it, American wine partisans have got themselves a punching bag and they call it France.
 Business-oriented types look at the French wine industry as old and tired. Through rigidity, bureaucracy and lack of creativity, they say, once-dominant France clings to old and outdated ways, and can no longer compete with modern wine powers like Australia, the United States, Chile and South Africa.
 Those sympathetic to France heave a sigh, shrug their shoulders and say, What can you do? Meanwhile, some of the harshest critics are among the French themselves, particularly growers and winemakers in less prestigious areas, or entrepreneurs who feel hamstrung by French wine laws.
 Make no mistake. France's troubles, as far as the wine business goes, are many. Consumption at home has dropped precipitously as the culture that once prized the long lunch and the arduous construction of a meal has taken a route toward convenience foods, quickly gobbled. The quest for productivity in a globalized economy, no doubt, has also taken its toll on daytime consumption, while stricter drunken-driving laws have also had an effect. Troubled fortunes in the wine economies of Bordeaux and the Languedoc are well known, if not well understood. And France's share of the wine export market has tumbled as well. 
 What's crucial to understand is that France has two entirely different wine economies, and one should not be confused with the other. The first produces oceans of cheap, occasionally palatable wine, sold for immediate consumption under lowly appellations, like plain Bordeaux or Beaujolais, for example, rather than the more prestigious and more specific St.-Julien or Julienas. This industry is indeed in a deep crisis, with many growers hurting badly. Historically, much of this wine was for domestic consumption, and this segment has taken the biggest hit as the market has shrunk. Producers who would like to sell these wines overseas say they feel hampered because they cannot compete against the cleverly branded bottles of New World producers, who often use winemaking techniques unavailable to French producers. 
 The other industry makes the middle to high-end wines, those sold around the world, consumed in restaurants and reviewed in publications like Wine Spectator. Producers like Sylvain Pitiot, who makes the seductive, voluptuous Clos de Tart, a grand cru Burgundy, are doing exceptionally well, regardless of how many gallons of French wine the European Union wishes to convert to fuel. Like Clos de Tart, much of the high-quality end of the business is prospering. 
 In many ways, the French A.O.C. laws, for appellation d'origine controlee, which protect quality at the top, are simultaneously responsible for the demise of the low end. In other words, the law that insures the meaning of St.-Julien by dictating what the wine is made of and how it is labeled can stifle the producer of ordinary Bordeaux, who might want to legally blend some syrah into the cabernet sauvignon, or call the wine by a cute, memorable brand name -- not Yellow Tail, but maybe Red Head. But while a producer in the Languedoc might wish he could pull out all his grenache and replace it with syrah, a Burgundy producer like Mr. Pitiot would be appalled at the idea of somebody wasting precious pinot noir territory by replacing it with merlot.
 It may be that both ends of the French wine industry can only work at cross purposes, with the Old World tradition of exalting specific place names struggling against the New World merchandising power of the brand name. For France to try to accommodate the low end by compromising the standards that have insured its high-end dominance might in the end be catastrophic for the whole industry. 
 ''Europeans should realize they can't play that New World game,'' said Neal Rosenthal, an American wine importer who is devoted to the concept of terroir. ''They're better off protecting what they have and making sure people better understand the reasons behind it.''
 Not that the standards can't be beneficially modified. In a recent column in Decanter, a British consumer magazine, Michel Bettane, the French wine critic, suggested that St.-Emilion would be a fine place to plant chardonnay, which is currently not permitted under A.O.C. rules. Maybe so. And as in any bureaucracy, a stultifying rigidity often makes rational decision making difficult. But on the whole, the A.O.C. rules do far more to protect greatness than to prevent it.
 While a further decline on the bottom end of the industry will have a tremendous social and human cost in France, it won't undermine the greatness of Frenchwines. It's possible to imagine that France will be joined at the top by countries like Italy and Spain, which produce distinguished, singular wines like Barolo and Rioja, and are working hard to improve the quality in distinctive regions that have long been ignored.
 It's harder to imagine New World countries like the United States and Australia reaching the same pinnacle. Their leading wines, whether made of cabernet, chardonnay, shiraz or pinot noir, will always be measured against the French, and regardless of the blind tasting here or there, few people really take seriously the notion that the New World wines will surpass the French reference points on a large scale. What's more important about New World wines is how they have improved their quality on the low-to-middle ranks, to the point where today it is possible to say that very few bad wines are produced.
 No, France will always set a standard, barring some sort of colossal, self-destructive move, like gutting its appellation rules. Should that happen, Americans and the rest of the world would then have great cause to jeer.

HEADLINE: The Natural Dogs

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
THE star of the wienie roast has fallen on hard times. 
 In a country increasingly enamored of specialty sausages and natural beef, hot dog sales have slumped. But a new dog might save the day, one that is better for the environment and the animals, healthier for the body and, perhaps most important, doesn't taste like some kind of jailhouse punishment lunch.
The politically correct frankfurter.
 In the past four years sales of packaged organic hot dogs have increased sharply. Although organic dogs have been around for at least a decade, the new models on the market taste better, have healthier fat profiles and are made from animals that spend their lives eating nothing but pasture. 
 The key is that the curing code has recently been cracked. Instead of relying on sodium nitrates or the more common sodium nitrites for color, texture and shelf life, hot dog makers have found a magic solution of celery juice, lactic acid and sea salt that rescues the organic dog from its tough brown reputation and rockets it to pink juiciness. It also addresses the concern among some consumers and scientists that nitrites and nitrates might contribute to cancer.
 For parents like Andrea Slonosky, a media librarian at Long Island University in Brooklyn, a better dog is a big relief. She has a toddler who loves them. If it is meaty and cylindrical, he'll eat it.
 She often buys packages with an organic label, however uneasily. After all, they're still hot dogs. ''I really have to try not to think too hard about the fact that organic unthinkable meat scraps are still unthinkable meat scraps,'' Ms. Slonosky said.
 The reasonable reader (and, certainly, the reasonable vegetarian reader) might be wondering why Ms. Slonosky gives her family hot dogs at all. But that reader probably does not have children and has never worried about getting enough protein into their little carb-stuffed bodies. Besides, why try to deny a kid a hot dog?
 Americans eat almost $2 billion worth of hot dogs a year, whether deep-fried Italian style in Jersey, spiked with sport peppers in Chicago or batter-dipped in Texas. Almost 30 million hot dogs will be eaten at the nation's ballparks this year.
 Still, the national appetite for conventional hot dogs is waning. The amount of packaged hot dogs sold has dropped by more than 6 percent over the past four years, to 772.4 million pounds from 825.8 million pounds, according to a new report from ACNielsen, the market research company. (Figures don't include sales at Wal-Mart, which doesn't release such data.)
 Hot dogs labeled organic, although still a tiny slice of the market, have boomed. During the same period, the number of pounds of organic dogs sold has increased 21 percent, to 1.2 million.
 Stephen McDonnell, who founded the natural meat company Applegate Farms in 1987 and remains its chief executive, argues that the hot dog revolution should center on beef from animals that eat only pasture rather than the standard diet of grain. Beef from cattle raised on grass is leaner and has a healthier dose of omega-3 fatty acids, the kind found in fish like salmon and mackerel. As a result, he said, the dogs are healthier.
 After working for a decade on the formula, Mr. McDonnell this month introduced low-priced nitrate-free hot dogs made with grass-fed beef from Uruguay. 
 Sold under the name the Great Organic Hot Dog, they look just like those plump, salty, chemically pink dogs served on buns at sporting events and from street carts. The suggested price is $4.99 a pound; that's a dollar or so more than a pound of Ball Park franks, although on the third of July Great Organics were $5.69 at one Brooklyn supermarket.
 Mr. McDonnell's hot dog even eats like the inexpensive hot dogs that dominate the market, with that slightly rubbery, juicy texture. And that was his secret plan: make the organic grass-fed dog taste just like the mass-market favorite.
 ''If we can introduce a whole new group of people to healthy food through a hot dog, oh my god, the lateral impact is enormous,'' Mr. McDonnell said.
 Although serious hot dog fans prefer the snap of a natural casing, Mr. Applegate's dogs -- like most -- are formed with a cellulose casing, which is removed before packaging. ''We don't do skin at this point because we are after the mainstream shopper,'' he said. ''You can't take America's favorite food and change it to that degree and expect widespread acceptance.''
 Mr. McDonnell is selling a couple of other styles of organic hot dogs that are made from animals raised on grain. The new dogs will be the first completely grass-fed wienies in the country to be sold at mainstream markets like Publix and Safeway. 
 Staff members of the Dining section held a blind taste test of several organic and grass-fed skinless uncured hot dogs aimed at the mass market. The Applegate grass-fed dogs were a close second to Nathan's, a conventional hot dog thrown in as a ringer. 
 The Applegate dog had not quite half the fat of Nathan's, and about 25 percent less sodium.
 We also found that two versions of Organic Valley's organic uncured hot dogs provided a perfect snapshot of the difference the new vegetable juice curing technique can make. The company's original organic dogs, which have been made since the late 1990's, were everything one would fear in an uncured organic dog: without an effective alternative to nitrites, they had a dense, dry texture and an unappealing brown color.
 The new versions, made from Midwestern cattle whose diet was at least 85 percent grass, were springier and juicy. It was night and day.
 Beyond the mass market are the elite athletes of the grass-fed hot dog movement. These are boutique dogs, made in smaller batches with beef from herds raised not far from where the dogs are sold. They have a more distinctive flavor and texture than any mass-market versions we tasted and are showing up in increasing numbers, both at farmers' markets and at new high-end hot dog stands in New York and San Francisco. 
 The emphasis is on local beef, in keeping with the emerging notion that local sustainable food is a better economic and social choice than a mass-marketed product, even one that carries an organic label.
 Among those I've tasted on both coasts, the Dines Farms beef dog is a favorite. Made from animals that graze on Catskill Mountains pasture in Oak Hill, N.Y., the hot dogs have a natural casing that snaps lightly, revealing a fine-textured interior with lots of juice and a pleasant, meaty flavor. 
 They are available in packages at only a handful of Greenmarkets and natural food stores in New York City. And for $2.50 ($3.50 with toppings), you can get one steamed and nestled in a bun from Amy's Bread at Sparky's in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or on Bleecker Street in Manhattan. 
 On the other coast, when the Giants are playing a home game at AT&T Park in San Francisco, Sue Moore and Larry Bain roll out their Let's Be Frank cart and start grilling their version of the new hot dog. It is made with pastured beef from the 80,000-acre Hearst Ranch in San Simeon, Calif., and stuffed into lamb casings. (The franks can be bought online at letsbefrankdogs.com.)
 On a nice day, from their cart at the ballpark and another at Crissy Field, a park near the base of the Golden Gate Bridge, they can sell 400. 
 Let's Be Franks are more russet than pink, and their pleasantly rough texture and extra-juicy bite makes them more robust, more like a sausage than most hot dogs from grass-fed beef.
 Getting the texture of nitrate-free grass-fed beef to mimic a mass-market hot dog is tricky. The nature of the fat in an animal fed on pasture is different from that of one raised on grain. There is less saturated fat, and the animals tend to be leaner, so when the meat is being chopped into hot dog paste, dog makers have to carefully balance temperature, water levels and the pace of emulsification.
 ''To the American palate corn-fed beef fat tastes like butter,'' Mr. McDonnell said. ''You have to deal with the leanness issue and the fat taste issue or most Americans are not going to accept a natural version of a hot dog.''
 Ms. Moore of Let's Be Frank said it took five attempts and six months to find a recipe that both tasted authentic and had a texture that was enough like a hot dog.
 ''We just really wanted to do excellent street food,'' she said. But they also wanted to offer a healthier alternative.
 ''What people can't get their minds around is that hot dogs can be good for them,'' she said. ''So instead of saying that, we say it's an old-fashioned hot dog.''
 Their hot dog is also an inexpensive way to deliver the gospel of locally raised grass-fed beef to the masses. Many hot dog eaters are not going to drop a lot of cash on an aged grass-fed porterhouse, but they might spend $5 to see what the buzz is about.
 Using local grass-fed beef in a hot dog or a hamburger reduces consumption of fuel in transportation and feed production and helps local ranchers stay in business, Ms. Moore said. Let's Be Frank uses grass-fed cuts that restaurateurs and retailers generally don't buy -- the plate, the shoulder clod and the chuck roll. And the company hopes to go national, relying on a network of regional ranchers and processors.
 Grass-fed purists who use local beef raise an eyebrow at Mr. McDonnell for importing his beef all the way from Uruguay. He does so because the meat costs less -- important in moving grass-fed dogs to the masses. Grazing land in the United States is expensive, and the beef business isn't designed for large pasture-feeding operations.
 ''In Uruguay there's just 2,000-acre farm after 2,000-acre farm,'' he said. ''It's open grass. It's in the culture of Uruguay.''
 Besides, he said, beef isn't like fruit or vegetables, which can suffer when transported thousands of miles. 
 And then there are those in the healthy-dog game who think grass fed isn't necessarily better and nitrates aren't necessarily bad for you. Bill Niman, the onetime rancher from Northern California who began the beef and pork company that bears his name, introduced Fearless Franks in 1997. 
 The name played to people afraid of what lands in conventional dogs. It was one of the first in the market that tasted good and was made without hormones or antibiotics. His animals, grown on ranches in the West, start out eating pasture grass and are finished on grain. He maintains that the mix creates the kind of flavor Americans like. 
 Most grass-fed animals eat hay and other feed when the grass isn't growing in winter months, a feeding method that Mr. Niman says is less sustainable and energy-efficient than using a highly caloric grain diet at the end of the animal's life.
 And he offers both a version without sodium nitrate, largely to get on the shelves of Whole Foods, and one that uses the compound as a preservative.
 Hebrew National hasn't failed to notice the consumer appetite for a healthier dog. Its parent, ConAgra Foods, last month began a television campaign focused on the unique aspects of Hebrew National franks. They aren't organic or necessarily nutritionally better than many brands, but they are made in accordance with kosher dietary laws, which means the cuts of meat from the front half of the animal are used and the butchering and processing meet specific religious standards.
 For many parents looking for a healthier way to keep their youngsters in hot dogs, all the action on the hot dog is welcome news.
 Nati Porat, a nursery-school teacher in Park Slope, Brooklyn, has started buying nitrate-free hot dogs designated organic or natural. ''I don't know if I should be trusting them, but I kind of have faith,'' she said. ''I never ate hot dogs before I had kids. I was actually health-conscious.''

It Takes More Than a Hot Fire and a Cold Beer
 HOT DOGS might seem like the easiest thing in the world to prepare. And in many ways they are. Most are already fully cooked and require only heat. But anything worth heating and eating takes a little technique to make it really good. 
 The first thing to consider when cooking a dog is whether it has a casing. Skinless dogs are the most popular. They are too delicate to spend much time on a griddle or a grill, even though some people love nothing more than a hot dog charred by fire or split and fried hard in a pan.
 The best method, advocated by Stephen McDonnell of Applegate Farms and supported by my tests, is to set them in a pot of water and bring the water barely to a simmer. The dogs will be heated through, and the water bath will take away some of the fat but leave the juiciness and plumpness. The same effect can be achieved in a microwave oven in a few minutes, depending on the number of dogs.
 For a frank made with a natural casing, the griddle is best. Some people prefer to start the dogs off in a steamer or simmered in a little water. But I think heating the dogs through in a cast iron pan or on a griddle allows more time for the skin to caramelize and crisp a bit.
 The worst thing is to allow a dog to get so hot so fast that the skin splits. It's a waste of juice and ruins its looks. KIM SEVERSON

HEADLINE: The Internet Knows What You'll Do Next

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A FEW years back, a technology writer named John Battelle began talking about how the Internet had made it possible to predict the future. When people went to the home page of Google or Yahoo and entered a few words into a search engine, what they were really doing, he realized, was announcing their intentions. 
 They typed in ''Alaskan cruise'' because they were thinking about taking one or ''baby names'' because they were planning on needing one. If somebody were to add up all this information, it would produce a pretty good notion of where the world was headed, of what was about to get hot and what was going out of style. 
 Mr. Battelle, a founder of Wired magazine and the Industry Standard, wasn't the first person to figure this out. But he did find a way to describe the digital crystal ball better than anyone else had. He called it ''the database of intentions.''
 The collective history of Web searches, he wrote on his blog in late 2003, was ''a place holder for the intentions of humankind -- a massive database of desires, needs, wants, and likes that can be discovered, subpoenaed, archived, tracked, and exploited to all sorts of ends.''
 ''Such a beast has never before existed in the history of culture, but is almost guaranteed to grow exponentially from this day forward,'' he wrote. It was a nice idea, but for most of us it was just an abstraction. The search companies did offer glimpses into the data with bare-bones (and sanitized) rankings of the most popular search terms, and Yahoo sold more detailed information to advertisers who wanted to do a better job of selling their products online. But there was no way for most people to dig into the data themselves.
 A few weeks ago, Google took a big step toward changing this -- toward making the database of intentions visible to the world -- by creating a product called Google Trends. It allows you to check the relative popularity of any search term, to look at how it has changed over the last couple years and to see the cities where the term is most popular. And it's totally addictive.
 YOU can see, for example, that the volume of Google searches would have done an excellent job predicting this year's ''American Idol,'' with Taylor Hicks (the champion) being searched more often than Katharine McPhee (second place), who in turn was searched more often than Elliot Yamin (third place). Then you can compare Hillary Clinton and Al Gore and discover that she was more popular than he for almost all of the last two years, until he surged past her in April and stayed there. 
 Thanks to Google Trends, the mayor of Elmhurst, Ill., a Chicago suburb, has had to explain why his city devotes more of its Web searches to ''sex'' than any other in the United States (because it doesn't have strip clubs or pornography shops, he gamely told The Chicago Sun-Times). On Mr. Battelle's blog, somebody claiming to own an apparel store posted a message saying that it was stocking less Von Dutch clothing and more Ed Hardy because of recent search trends.(A disclosure: The New York Times Company owns a stake in Mr. Battelle's latest Internet company, Federated Media Publishing.)
 It's the connection to marketing that turns the database of intentions from a curiosity into a real economic phenomenon. For now, Google Trends is still a blunt tool. It shows only graphs, not actual numbers, and its data is always about a month out of date. The company will never fully pull back the curtain, I'm sure, because the data is a valuable competitive tool that helps Google decide which online ads should appear at the top of your computer screen, among other things. .
 But Google does plan to keep adding to Trends, and other companies will probably come up with their own versions as well. Already, more than a million analyses are being done some days on Google Trends, said Marissa Mayer, the vice president for search at Google.
 When these tools get good enough, you can see how the business of marketing may start to change. As soon as a company begins an advertising campaign, it will be able to get feedback from an enormous online focus group and then tweak its message accordingly. 
 I've found Pepsi's recent Super Bowl commercials -- the ones centered around P. Diddy -- to be nearly devoid of wit, but that just shows you how good my marketing instincts are. As it turns out, the only recent times that Pepsi has been a more popular search term in this country than Coke have been right after a Super Bowl. This year's well-reviewed Burger King paean to Busby Berkeley, on the other hand, barely moved the needle inside the database of intentions.
 Hal R. Varian, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who advises Google, predicts that online metrics like this one have put Madison Avenue on the verge of a quantitative revolution, similar to the one Wall Street went through in the 1970's when it began parsing market data much more finely. ''People have hunches, people have prejudices, people have ideas,'' said Mr. Varian, who also writes for this newspaper about once a month. ''Once you have data, you can test them out and make informed decisions going forward.''
 There are certainly limitations to this kind of analysis. It's most telling for products that are bought, or at least researched, online, a category that does not include Coke, Pepsi or Whoppers. And even with clothing or cars, interest doesn't always translate into sales. But there is no such thing as a perfect yardstick in marketing, and the database of intentions clearly offers something new. 
 In the 19th century, a government engineer whose work became the seed of I.B.M. designed a punch-card machine that allowed for a mechanically run Census, which eventually told companies who their customers were. The 20th century brought public opinion polls that showed what those customers were thinking. This century's great technology can give companies, and anyone else, a window into what people are actually doing, in real time or even ahead of time.
 You might find that a little creepy, but I bet that you'll also check it out sometime.

HEADLINE: After 4 Years, Health Group For the Poor Gets Started 

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
More than four years after it was promised, a foundation created by state lawmakers to help New Yorkers get health care is, at last, up and running -- and with much more money at its disposal than expected.
 The Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki created the New York State Health Foundation in early 2002, but the law was challenged in court, freezing the plan for almost four years. By the time the foundation could begin operating, the assets the state had given it had grown from a value estimated at $50 million to more than $250 million.
There are charitable foundations with billions of dollars, but they have much wider missions. The New York Health Foundation has enough grant money to give away to become important within its narrow mandate, limited to health care and to New York. 
 Its board hired James R. Knickman in April as its president and chief executive, giving it a leader with deep experience in health care, the charitable world and New York. The foundation plans to publish its first request for grant proposals this month.
 Yet the group has barely begun to define its identity and purpose. Mr. Knickman has not yet hired a staff, and the request for proposals is expected to be very broadly worded.
 Talk to Mr. Knickman, or to the voting board members appointed by the governor and legislative leaders, and what emerges is less a specific set of ideas than excitement about the range of possibilities. One issue that arises repeatedly is the epidemic of obesity and diabetes.
 ''We are very interested in finding three or four areas, to focus on these and really have an impact,'' Mr. Knickman said.
 The foundation has a broadly worded, three-part mandate from the state: to expand health insurance coverage for people who cannot afford it, improve access to care for people who have trouble finding it, and educate people about health issues and help them address those problems.
 Tackling such enormous problems head-on -- to insure the uninsured, or open new clinics -- could cost billions of dollars, clearly beyond the foundation's capacity. And its leaders say they are not particularly interested in being a ''think tank,'' writing and commissioning papers on various issues; many groups do that already.
 What they talk of instead is supporting small-scale, neighborhood-level efforts by community groups, clinics or schools, finding what works, and trying to show how it can be replicated elsewhere. ''We're thinking in terms of demonstration projects,'' said Deborah Konopko, the foundation chairwoman.
 Mr. Knickman said, ''We want to find innovative people trying innovative things and support them, and maybe join forces with other organizations.''
 He cited some examples to emulate, like the Harlem Children's Zone, a group that works on a range of problems, from asthma to drug abuse, in central Harlem. He also spoke enthusiastically of a project in Upper Manhattan by a national organization, Community Voices, working with neighborhood groups to connect low-income, uninsured people with clinics and doctors.
 ''I'd like to take something like that and do it in 10 communities,'' he said. ''I could see helping community health centers with investment in technology and better management, to make them more efficient.''
 The board members, and others in the health care field, see the hiring of Mr. Knickman as a coup. Most recently, he has been a vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation overseeing health care grants, and chairman of the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Jersey. Earlier, he was a longtime professor of health policy at New York University's graduate school of public service, and he worked for a time on health policy in Mayor Edward I. Koch's administration.
 Despite their enthusiasm, some of the foundation's supporters cannot help but view it wistfully, believing that it should have been wealthier.
 In January 2002, the Legislature and governor passed a law allowing Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield to convert from a nonprofit corporation to a profitmaking one, under a new parent company, WellChoice. As a condition of the deal, the state claimed ownership of some of the newly issued WellChoice stock, as compensation for Empire's decades of being tax-exempt.
 Some states that had allowed such conversions, including California, had used most of the revenue, billions of dollars in some cases, to create foundations promoting health care for the poor.
 But New York lawmakers, over the objections of a few of their colleagues, seized on the conversion as a source of money to pay for a new contract with the powerful hospital workers' union. They set aside just 5 percent of the stock for a foundation.
 No one knew for certain what price WellChoice would fetch on the open market, but at the time the law passed -- in the midst of a recession -- state and company officials estimated the value of all the outstanding stock at $1 billion, and the foundation's portion at $50 million. When the state sold some of the stock nine months later, it found that the market price was about twice that high.
 Consumer advocates who believed that more of the stock should go toward public health challenged the conversion law in court, with a string of lawsuits and appeals that prevented sale of most of the stock for long stretches of time. Paradoxically, those delays turned out very well for the state and the foundation. The economy improved, health insurance industry stocks soared, and WellChoice was taken over by WellPoint, a national insurer, pushing the stock still higher.
 Today, the foundation's assets are worth about $250 million. In all, the windfall to the state has been about $5 billion, much of it still in the form of stock. It is not clear how that money will be spent.

HEADLINE: Banks Sprout Around a Town Green

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN, N.J. 

 BODY:
For a look at just how quickly banks have been adding new branch offices in the last five years, it pays to visit this community's downtown.
 Four of the 10 businesses on North Park Place, which borders a picturesque town green, are banks, and even more banks are to be found on nearby South Street. According to town officials, downtown Morristown now has 17 banks in an area that extends only about a half-mile in each direction from the green. They say that there were fewer than half that number five years ago.
Gary W. Ford, a senior associate in the retail services group at CB Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate company, says banks are also expanding in nondowntown areas of the suburbs, generally without opposition. But, in some communities, there is concern that a proliferation of downtown branches is threatening to drain the vitality of business districts. 
 In Morristown, for instance, local officials are worried that banks have already snapped up much of the area's prime retail space and that because of their shorter business hours, they are also cutting into pedestrian traffic. 
 But an even larger concern is that the banks, because they are often willing to pay significantly higher rents, may be driving away other types of retailers. This is a particular concern here, where the business district spiraled downward during the 1990's and is still trying to regain a healthy mix of retailers. 
 Michael Fabrizio, the executive director of the Morristown Partnership, the local downtown business improvement group, estimated that retail rents in downtown Morristown are now averaging $30 a square foot annually, but that banks are offering landlords $65 to $70 a square foot.
 ''It's not the banks that bother us as much as it is the marketability of our downtown,'' he said. ''What would happen if banks, after creating these artificial markets, were to eventually merge and not need downtown locations as much as they once did?''
 Mr. Fabrizio and Richard Tighe, a local town councilman, are now trying to get Morristown to pass an ordinance that would ban banks from opening new branches in spaces that were previously occupied by other businesses. The ban would apply within the heart of Morristown, in an area around the town green that is about six blocks long and two blocks wide.
 The ban would not affect two new banks that town officials say are already scheduled to open on South Street, as well as the bank that may eventually open in the large redevelopment project that is to be built on the site of the old Epstein's department store, just outside the area where the ban has been proposed. 
 Real estate executives say that similar bans have long been in place in Princeton and more recently in Red Bank, N.J., as well as in Bronxville and the village of Westhampton Beach in New York.
 David M. Feehan, president of the International Downtown Association, says that some of the downtown improvement groups that belong to his Washington-based organization have also been raising concerns about banks lately. ''It's a relatively new issue, but we think that as demand for retail space in downtown areas increases, it will become an increasingly important topic, especially in areas where there is a limited amount of on-street retail space,'' he said. 
 In downtown Morristown, store space is already in short supply; the vacancy rate is now only about 5 percent, Mr. Fabrizio said. That, he said, is significantly less than the 15 percent vacancy rate that the area had in the mid-1990's, when it was struggling in the wake of the closing of a Macy's department store, as well as a moratorium on new development, which lasted from 1984 to 1992, until the town completed a major sewer project. 
 Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Tighe now worry that the area's existing retailers may have a hard time coping over the next two years as the Epstein's site is redeveloped. The construction is expected to cause inconvenience for shoppers of existing stores, and it may discourage other retailers from moving in until they see how the project works out. The development is expected to provide more high-end housing in downtown Morristown -- as well as more than 70,000 square feet of new retail space -- but it will probably not break ground until later this summer.
 ''Retailers here are going to be struggling while Epstein's is torn down and rebuilt,'' Mr. Tighe said. ''Because we want to have an active downtown, we want to do everything we can to help them.'' 
 Chuck Lanyard, a principal and director of brokerage services for the Goldstein Group, which is based in Glen Rock, N.J., emphasizes that ''landlords have the right to pick tenants that give them economical viability and security,'' and that banks also provide an important retail service.
 Ted Zangari, a redevelopment lawyer at the firm of Sills Cummis Epstein & Gross in Newark, said that municipal land use ordinances in New Jersey had historically not allowed restrictions on the types of businesses coming into certain areas. ''This is slippery-slope ordinance-making,'' he said. ''Council members may target banks today, but tomorrow it could be art galleries or bring-your-own-bottle restaurants. Typically, a free-market system will sort out the ancillary and complementary uses that surround a cluster of businesses.''
 In downtown Morristown, meanwhile, banks probably deserve at least some of the credit for the area's revival. The business district still abounds in smaller stores, and local officials would love to see it get more apparel and shoe stores, housewares dealers, and also a bookstore, to replace the Barnes & Noble that left years ago. 
 Lately, however, the area has managed to attract more national retailers, like Starbucks and Godiva, as well as a popular Century 21 department store that opened in 2002 on the site of the old Macy's store. 
 In downtown Red Bank, some local officials would also like to see a broader mix of retailers. Tricia Rumola, the executive director of Red Bank Rivercenter, says the town's 20-block-square business improvement district now has about eight banks, but some have taken the area's choicest retail spots, as well as some of the largest. A Chase bank, for instance, opened last year on Broad Street, on the site of what used to house a roughly 6,000-square-foot Prown's department store. While Prown's is still in business, it has since moved to a smaller spot on Monmouth Street. 
 Ms. Rumola said some banks in downtown Red Bank, like Bank of America, had worked diligently to try to bring more street life to area at night, by sponsoring evening music and dance performances.
 Still, she said ruefully, when pedestrians walk by the new Chase building at night, all they see now is ''this big glowing light.''

HEADLINE: A Roar for the 4th, Echoing Back 6 Decades

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
DAN DAMEO knows exactly when he got the bug.
 He was 8, and his uncle, an Air Force pilot named Mike Yannell, buzzed his house in Millburn, N.J., in a shiny new P-51 Mustang fighter plane. He missed the chimney, took the plane up into a climb and rolled over.
''It tore my heart out,'' he said the other day. ''It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.'' 
 Eventually, Mr. Dameo came full circle -- not just becoming a pilot himself but getting hooked on war birds, the vintage military planes like the one that buzzed his house. Before long he was flying decommissioned models like the P-51's that became a legend in World War II, the P-40 Warhawk, the B-25 Mitchell or the bent-wing Corsair he was flying on Sunday, part of his contribution to keeping the Fourth of July weekend about more than beaches and barbecues.
 Who knows how things manage to ascend or descend on the national search engine? And maybe the fascination with historic warplanes isn't that much of a surprise -- the Greatest Generation's Greatest Airplanes. 
 But for Dan Dameo, for Bob and Chris Baranskas, for Jeff Clyman, Len Boyd and the others who fly out of the American Airpower Museum on Long Island, there's a very simple way to remind us that holidays like the Fourth of July or Memorial Day or Veterans Day are more than days off from work or markings on a calendar.
 They strap on parachutes and climb into old airplanes where the engine roar can blow out your ears and the cockpit shakes and rattles. Then they fly off into the blue in planes that somehow are as nimble and frisky now as they were when they were commissioned more than 60 years ago.
 There are fancier museums than the American Airpower Museum, which is in a crowded hangar at Republic Airport and includes exhibits about wartime history and culture and about functioning vintage planes. But there aren't many museums that pack more of a punch for World War II veterans and for their children and grandchildren who come to gaze in wonder at planes that have become every bit as emblematic as the bomber jackets worn by the men who flew them.
 The government was all but giving away the planes that flew over Germany and Japan once their military life was over. But now some of the planes are going for $1.5 million to $2 million, and there's an entire industry of air shows and memorabilia built in large part around them. 
 Mr. Dameo, director of the museum's flight operations, gives his age as ''69 and holding.'' He is largely retired from a trucking business he owned but still flies corporate jets. He said his favorite of the war birds was whichever one he happened to be flying. But as much as he loves the planes, he's more likely to be moved by how people react to them, the old pilots and crew members who get misty-eyed when allowed to climb into the cockpits, the guy in the wheelchair who just wanted to be wheeled out to touch the plane. Which he did.
 Maybe that's just the American nostalgia machine in action, but you couldn't tell it by the pilots who fly out of here. 
 ''We live in a fast moving, MP3-, iPod-oriented, Internet-driven country where you're only as good as your last moment on an Internet blog,'' said Mr. Clyman, a pilot and the founder and president of the museum, which is nonprofit. ''We try to get away from that and transport people back to an era where things moved more slowly and people were committed to ideals that didn't shift so much with the political winds. The pilots here feel they're not just flying planes; they're doing a service.''
 So the half-dozen or so pilots, two in their 20's, most a good deal older, find the time on holiday weekends to get in the air, pay their noisy tribute to the past, bring the old planes to life and then bring them back down. No one is quite sure how long this will last. The soaring price of fuel, which has doubled in the past two years, makes the dicey economics dicier. It costs a fortune to train new pilots, insurance isn't cheap, and maintaining the planes is an expensive labor of love left to a few men with the dedication of monks. At 69, whether holding or not, Mr. Dameo can do this for only so many more years.
 But then, one part of it does seem eternal. The planes are regularly taken apart: propellers changed, engines rebuilt, every rivet checked and rechecked. We get old, but the planes, with their ferocious roar, their colorful markings like war paint, their odd angles and Marvel Comics names -- Avenger, Albatross, Mustang, Thunderbolt -- seem ageless. As long as there's someone to climb into the cockpit, they seem like they can fly forever.

HEADLINE: An Outcry Rises as Debt Collectors Play Rough

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Karen James contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The rise in American consumer debt has been accompanied by a sharp increase in complaints about aggressive and sometimes unscrupulous tactics by debt collection agencies, a phenomenon that has government regulators increasingly concerned. 
 In April, the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the federal law that governs debt collection practices, reported that it received 66,627 complaints against third-party debt collectors last year -- more than against any other industry, and nearly six times the number in 1999.
The agencies often buy the debt from more established companies for pennies on the dollar and seek to collect even if the debt has been paid or was never valid to begin with. Sometimes, consumers pay up simply because they are worn down by threats from the companies and fear damage to their credit rating. 
 One New York City victim, Judith Guillet, complained and filed a police report in 2003 after receiving a Chase credit card bill for $2,300, including five charges from Amoco gasoline stations in the Bronx. She has never owned a car or had a driver's license. 
 The bank agreed that the charges were not valid, but the debt case hung on because the bank turned it over to a collection agency. Last November, that agency obtained a court order allowing it to freeze Ms. Guillet's bank account even though it could not demonstrate that the debt was valid.
 ''I felt helpless,'' said Ms. Guillet, 57, a nurse who is retired on full disability. ''I couldn't pay my rent, buy food or pay my electricity bills.''
 Officials in New York City, which has some of the most stringent consumer protection laws in the country, said the number of local complaints about debt collectors more than doubled in three years -- to 900 in the 2006 fiscal year, which ended on Friday, from 774 in 2005, 509 in 2004 and 422 in 2003. 
 The city's Department of Consumer Affairs recently subpoenaed records from eight companies with the most complaints and is considering whether to propose tougher regulations. And last month, New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, sued a national debt collection company, accusing it of trying in thousands of cases to collect on debts that could not be verified.
 The Federal Trade Commission enforces the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the 1977 law that prohibits abusive, deceptive and unfair tactics by collection agencies. Last July, the commission won $10.2 million -- its biggest judgment for illegal collection practices -- in a case against National Check Control of Secaucus, N.J. The company, now out of business, overstated the amounts consumers owed and threatened them with arrest and prosecution.
 ''We're very concerned about the increase in complaints about debt collection, and we are stepping up our enforcement against the debt collection industry,'' said Peggy L. Twohig, who directs the F.T.C.'s Division of Financial Practices. 
 In its most recent annual report on the act, the commission identified tactics that have become particularly common: misrepresenting the nature, size and status of a debt; making constant harassing and abusive phone calls at all hours; contacting a debtor's relatives, employers and neighbors; failing to investigate claims by consumers that a debt is paid, expired or fraudulent; and threatening to sue or seek prosecution. (Such threats are illegal unless the collector has both the legal basis and the intent to take such action.)
 In addition to filing complaints with regulators, a growing number of consumers are suing over debt collection abuses, according to the National Association of Consumer Advocates. 
 Stephanie M. Clark, 36, and her husband sued the Triad Financial Corporation of Huntington Beach, Calif., and Verizon Wireless in Federal District Court in Santa Ana, Calif., in August 2004. After they fell behind on their car payments, the suit alleged, Triad hired a collector who threatened them with arrest, posed as a Verizon Wireless employee, changed the password on their cellphone account and obtained their cellphone records. According to the suit, the collector called dozens of the couple's relatives, friends and business associates, posing as a law enforcement officer and telling them that there was an arrest warrant for the Clarks. 
 ''They contacted former and future employers,'' said Ms. Clark, who now lives in Healdsburg, Calif. ''It was very stressful. We felt completely violated. Humiliated.'' In June 2005, before the case was to go to trial, the companies settled with the Clarks for an undisclosed sum. (Both companies said they could not discuss the settlement, which also resolved the original debt, because of a confidentiality agreement.)
 Last July, Leigh A. Feist, 39, of Minneapolis, took out a cash-advance loan of around $570. From September to April, a collection agency, Riscuity, called Ms. Feist constantly on her cellphone and at her job at a health insurer, according to a suit that her lawyer, Peter F. Barry, filed on May 25. The calls were so frequent, Ms. Feist said, that her supervisor examined the record of incoming calls and reprimanded her.
 Edward Chen, president of Riscuity, based in Marietta, Ga., said that he was not aware of the suit but that the company stops calling debtors at work at their request. 
 Regulators and consumer advocates say many creditors prefer to hire collection agencies or sell bundled debts to debt buyers because of the expense of litigation. 
 Robert J. Hobbs, the deputy director of the National Consumer Law Center, an advocacy organization based in Boston, attributed the rise in complaints about abusive collection practices to three broad trends: the rapid growth in the number of collection agencies, the tightening of bankruptcy-protection laws last year and the record level of consumer debt, now totaling $2.2 trillion, complicated by rising interest rates and stagnant personal incomes. Identity theft and Internet fraud are also cited as factors.
 Rozanne M. Andersen, the general counsel at ACA International, which represents 3,600 debt collection agencies, more than half of the estimated 6,000 to 7,000 such companies in the United States, said its members adhere to a rigorous code of ethics. ''To the extent there are abusive practices taking place in the industry, ACA International absolutely denounces those practices that fall outside of the law,'' she said.
 Eric M. Berman, a lawyer in Babylon, N.Y., and an officer of the National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys, whose members represent creditors, said complaints filed with the government were not always legitimate. For example, he said, some debtors complain when debt collectors will not accept partial payments on the same installment terms that the original lender provided, a practice that may be frustrating to the debtor but is legal. 
 ''People need to get much more education about credit accounts and what they're getting into,'' Mr. Berman said. ''In addition, there are a small minority who are scammers -- people who will run up credit with no intent of paying it and then try to negotiate their way out of it.'' 
 While consumer advocates say that abusive collection practices have a disproportionate effect on poor people, the elderly, immigrants and people with limited English, the rise in complaints seems to span the social and economic spectrum. 
 Mary H. Monroe, 71, a retiree in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, received repeated calls last year from Diversified Collection Services, part of the Performant Financial Corporation of Livermore, Calif., insisting that she owed more than $8,000 in tuition and fees at a beauty school that she had never attended.''I thought they had to be kidding,'' she said.
 She said the calls continued, despite her protests that the collectors had the wrong person. ''I finally got a lawyer to write to them, and they haven't bothered me since,'' she said.
 Maria Perrin, a senior vice president at Performant, said the company halts its efforts when it learns of cases of mistaken identity. ''Honestly, we don't want to spend time with the wrong person,'' she said.
 James M. Rhodes, 65, was not as lucky as Ms. Monroe. In November, Mr. Rhodes, a commercial lawyer and arbitrator on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, received the first of three letters from Midland Credit Management, part of the Encore Capital Group of San Diego. The company insisted that he pay $2,800 on a MasterCard he never had.
 Mr. Rhodes repeatedly insisted that the debt was not his, and then wrote to state and city officials. In April, the city's Department of Consumer Affairs got Midland to acknowledge that the debt was erroneous. But that was not the end of it, because in the meantime, in March, Mr. Rhodes heard from a second collection agency, Phillips & Cohen Associates of Westampton, N.J., demanding payment on the same account, this time for $1,900. Mr. Rhodes sent letters of protest and contacted the city again. 
 J. Brandon Black, the chief executive of Encore, said, ''The vast majority of fraud or mistaken-identity complaints and concerns are taken care of at the level of the issuer.'' Matthew A. Saperstein, a vice president at Phillips & Cohen, said it closed the account on May 12 after receiving a letter from Mr. Rhodes.
 Ms. Guillet, the Bronx woman with the gasoline charges, spent two years insisting that her credit card charges were not valid. Finally, lawyers for New Century Financial Services of Cedar Knolls, N.J., which had bought the debt, obtained a judgment in New York City Civil Court that led Emigrant Savings Bank to freeze her account. Ms. Guillet, who has fibromyalgia, a muscle pain and fatigue disorder, lives on $1,324 a month in Social Security Disability Insurance.
 Although companies must serve notice before getting permission to freeze a bank account, such notices are often misdirected or, as in Ms. Guillet's case, ignored by people who are fearful or confused.
 A nonprofit legal clinic, MFY Legal Services, got the account unfrozen in January and, after providing extensive documentation that Ms. Guillet had saved over two years, reached a settlement with New Century, which agreed to stop contacting her and dropped the case. (A company official, Jeff Esposito, said he could not discuss the case.) 
 ''It stressed me out so bad,'' Ms. Guillet said of being pursued for a debt she did not incur. ''I wondered what else might be out there that I don't know about.''

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich. 

 BODY:
WITH conservatives controlling the White House and Congress, one might expect states' rights to be firmly in vogue. But several recent federal actions have seriously weakened the states' efforts to protect health and the environment.
 In March, for example, the House of Representatives passed, and the Senate is considering, the benign-sounding ''National Uniformity for Food Act,'' which would bar states from addressing food-borne hazards, leaving food safety solely to the Food and Drug Administration. Thirty-nine state attorneys general signed a letter opposing the act.
The proposed law would keep California from applying its highly effective Proposition 65 -- a law meant to protect people from carcinogens -- to foods. This year, the state used Proposition 65 to stop Pepsi from selling soda bottles with labels that contain lead. The federal proposal would also keep Michigan and Connecticut from requiring labels for sulfite-containing dried fruit, which can cause serious allergic reactions. 
 This act is no anomaly. A report last month from Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, shows that since 2001 Congress has enacted 27 laws that pre-empt state authority in areas from air pollution to consumer protection. 
 The Bush administration is following Congress's lead -- but in a quieter way that is likely to undermine states even more. Its strategy to block California limits on greenhouse-gas emissions from cars (which 10 other states plan to adopt) is a case in point. Since 1967, California has been allowed to set its own automotive pollution limits, subject to limited review by the Environmental Protection Agency. But this spring, the Department of Transportation stepped in by inserting into its new fuel-economy standards for light trucks a statement that the exclusive federal authority to set fuel-economy standards bars California's emissions limits, because car manufacturers might comply with emission limits by increasing fuel efficiency. The car industry will surely use this to reinforce its position in court that California cannot set greenhouse-gas limits.
 The F.D.A., for its part, is moving to limit states' authority over prescription drug labels. Buried in the preamble to the agency's new labeling standards -- meant to make drug labels easier to read -- is a statement that state agencies and courts cannot require any safety information beyond what the F.D.A. requires. GlaxoSmithKline has already cited the F.D.A. statement in court, arguing that the company is not responsible for failing to disclose that Paxil increases suicide risk.
 The F.D.A. has also moved -- faster than Congress -- to oppose California's food safety efforts. The agency tried to block a lawsuit brought by California's attorney general against tuna manufacturers for failing to place warnings on tuna cans about the dangers of mercury. Because of the risks to fetal development and children, the F.D.A. itself has recommended limits on tuna consumption, but it has stopped short of requiring labels. In the California case, at the tuna companies' request, the agency wrote a letter to the attorney general accusing California of interfering with the F.D.A.'s wish ''to avoid overexposing consumers to warnings'' of tuna's risks. In May, the judge ruled that the state could not require any extra warnings.
 Federal environmental and health rules have historically provided a floor of minimum protection. States, for their part, have led the way on countless matters, from requiring health insurers to cover mammograms to stringently regulating mercury emissions from power plants. 
 So why is the federal government suddenly trying to block state efforts to protect public health -- through bureaucratic actions largely outside the public view? The unfortunate result is that big businesses' revenues are being shielded, while protections for consumers and the environment are being stripped away.

HEADLINE: The State of New Orleans: An Update

Matt Fellowes is a fellow at the Brookings Institution. Bruce Katz is the director of the metropolitan policy program at Brookings. Amy Liu is the deputy director of the program. Nigel Holmes is a graphic designer.

 BODY:
LAST week this newspaper reported that more than $2 billion in reconstruction aid for the victims of Hurricane Katrina had been lost to ''scams, schemes and stupefying bureaucratic bungles.'' Add to this the inexcusable $7 billion allocated for temporary trailers and mobile homes, which cost far more than available rental apartments, and the scale of waste is stunning. 
 Nonetheless, the vast majority of the $107 billion we calculate has been allocated by the federal government has been converted by public officials and private leaders into a substantial amount of progress. In New Orleans, levees have to a large extent been rebuilt and millions of tons of debris have been cleared away. Nearly $6.4 billion in new cash assistance is now headed to Louisiana homeowners; an additional $1.5 billion will go toward replenishing affordable housing stock in the state.
Still, as the chart below indicates, problems in reopening hospitals and schools and in getting city services operating will make it hard for New Orleans to attract new families, particularly the service workers that support the tourism industry. And in some ways those uprooted by the storm are doing worse than those in the city itself: of the 309,000 working-age adults still displaced by the hurricane, nearly 25 percent are unemployed -- a rate more than four times as high as in New Orleans itself. 
 The $20 billion in new spending that President Bush signed off on last month will be the last major investment for some time. We must hope that the federal agencies on the receiving end and their state and local partners find ways to spend it wisely.

HEADLINE: The Search for New Oil Sources Leads to Processed Coal

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: EAST DUBUQUE, Ill. 

 BODY:
The coal in the ground in Illinois alone has more energy than all the oil in Saudi Arabia. The technology to turn that coal into fuel for cars, homes and factories is proven. And at current prices, that process could be at the vanguard of a big, new industry.
 Such promise has attracted entrepreneurs and government officials, including the Secretary of Energy, who want domestic substitutes for foreign oil.
But there is a big catch. Producing fuels from coal generates far more carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming, than producing vehicle fuel from oil or using ordinary natural gas. And the projects now moving forward have no incentive to capture carbon dioxide beyond the limited amount that they can sell for industrial use. 
 Here in East Dubuque, Rentech Inc., a research-and-development company based in Denver, recently bought a plant that has been turning natural gas into fertilizer for forty years. Rentech sees a clear opportunity to do something different because natural gas prices have risen so high. In an important test case for those in the industry, it will take a plunge and revive a technology that exploits America's cheap, abundant coal and converts it to expensive truck fuel. 
 ''Otherwise, I don't see us having a future,'' John H. Diesch, the manager of the plant, said.
 With today's worries about the price and long-term availability of oil, experts like Bill Reinert, national manager for advanced technologies at Toyota, say that turning coal into transportation fuel could offer a bright future. ''It's a huge deal,'' he said. 
 There are drawbacks; the technology requires a large capital investment, and a plant could be rendered useless by a collapse in oil prices. But interest was high even before the rise in oil prices; three years ago, the Energy Department ran a seminar on synthetic hydrocarbon liquids, and scores of researchers and oil company executives showed up. The agency that runs municipal buses in Washington, D.C., and other consumers expressed interest. 
 But the enthusiasm was not enough to overcome the fear of a drop in oil prices. Lately, however, the price of diesel fuel, which determines the value of this coal-based fuel, also called synfuel, has soared, as has the price of natural gas, which made plants like the one at East Dubuque ripe for change. 
 Most of the interest is in making diesel using a technology known as Fischer-Tropsch, for the German chemists who demonstrated it in the 1920's. Daily consumption of diesel and heating oil, which is nearly identical, runs more than $400 million. The gasoline market is more than twice as large, but if companies like Rentech sated the demand for diesel, the process could be adapted to make gasoline. 
 The technology was used during World War II in Germany and then during the 1980's by South Africa when the world shunned the apartheid regime there. Now Rentech is preparing to use an updated version. 
 Sasol, the company that has used the technology for decades in South Africa, is exploring potential uses around the world and is conducting a feasibility study with a Chinese partner of two big coal-to-liquids projects in western China. Last August, Syntroleum, based in Tulsa, agreed with Linc Energy, of Brisbane, Australia, to develop a coal-to-liquids plant in Queensland. 
 Other projects are in various stages of planning in this country, although the one here on the Mississippi River just south of the Wisconsin border has a head start. 
 But people who think this technology will find wide use presume some kind of environmental controls, which the Rentech plant, thus far, does not have. Some environment and energy experts doubt that the method is compatible with a world worried about global warming. 
 Unless the factory captures the carbon dioxide created during the process of turning coal into diesel fuel, the global warming impact of driving a mile would double. 
 ''It's a potential disaster for the environment if we move in the direction of trying to create a big synfuel program based on coal to run our transportation fleet,'' said Daniel A. Lashof, of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''There's a brown path and a green path to replacing oil, and Fischer-Tropsch fuel is definitely on the brown path.'' 
 But the Energy Department sees potential. In March, the Energy Secretary, Samuel K. Bodman, said in a speech that making diesel fuel or jet fuel from coal was ''one of the most exciting areas'' of research and could be crucial to the President's goal of cutting oil imports. He said that loan guarantees enacted in last summer's energy bill might be used for Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuel. 
 In Des Plaines, Ill., near Chicago, a new company called GreatPoint Energy has developed, on a laboratory scale, a vastly improved process for turning coal into natural gas. 
 The promise and the pitfalls are similar for both GreatPoint and Rentech. Measured in the standard energy unit of a million British thermal units, or B.T.U.'s, coal sells for $1 or so, natural gas around $7. Diesel fuel is around $23. As with all energy conversions, turning coal into natural gas or diesel fuel means losing something in translation -- specifically, energy -- but if the price difference is big enough, the energy loss is not something that investors will worry about.
 But it also means carbon emissions, which causes concern to environmentalists. Carbon is released in converting coal into an energy-rich gas made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and then converting the gas into something more useful. Rentech wants to turn it into liquid fuel. GreatPoint wants to rearrange the molecules into natural gas. 
 But coal is cheap and the energy possibilities are endless. For example, at the Rentech plant, a substation on the east side of the plant that currently pulls in electricity will send it out instead. And, uniquely in this country, the plant will take coal and produce diesel fuel, which sells for more than $100 a barrel.
 The cost to convert the coal is $25 a barrel, the company says, a price that oil seems unlikely to fall to in the near future. So Rentech is discussing a second plant in Natchez, Miss., and participating in a third proposed project in Carbon County in Wyoming. 
 The plant here will ''bring back an industry that's shutting down,'' Hunt Ramsbottom, the company chairman, said of the fertilizer business. ''The goal is fuels, but to get the plant up and running, fertilizer is a good backstop.'' 
 And it is all local. The coal will come from southern Illinois, by barge or rail. The diesel can go straight to terminals or truckstops in the area, said Mr. Diesch, the plant manager, and the fertilizer to local farms. An odd advantage is that today, most coal-burning power plants in the area use coal hauled from Wyoming, because its sulfur content is lower; burning high-sulfur coal encourages acid rain. But if the coal is gasified, rather than burned, filtering out the sulfur is relatively easy, and the sulfur changes from a pollutant to a salable product.
 Emissions of traditional pollutants -- that is, the ones the government regulates, and not carbon dioxide -- will be lower with coal than they were with natural gas, he said. Outsiders are interested, but skeptical, because of the carbon problem. ''It might serve our goals in terms of reducing oil dependence,'' said Phil Sharp, a former congressman from Indiana and now head of Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research organization in Washington. But ''they should take into account that we are headed to a carbon-constrained economy.''
 Robert Williams, a senior research scientist at Princeton, said ''it's a step backward'' to operate a plant like Rentech's without capturing the carbon. ''It almost doubles the emission rate,'' he said. 
 Mr. Ramsbottom also sees the carbon dioxide problem. ''The worldwide production of Fischer-Tropsch fuels is going to ramp up dramatically, and carbon sequestration is on everybody's mind,'' he said. But the geology of this part of Illinois is not suitable for sequestering the carbon dioxide from these plants. Building a pipeline would be expensive and difficult to justify while carbon emissions are not taxed, experts say.
 GreatPoint has a different plan: move the plant where it can sell the carbon.
 Andrew Perlman, the company's chief executive, thinks it has value. ''Not only is it capturable, one of biggest advantages of the system is, we can locate our plant near a natural gas pipeline, in places where we can sell that carbon dioxide for a profit, using existing technology,'' he said. Oil producers inject carbon dioxide into old oil fields, to force oil to the surface.
 Backers also hope that methanization, the process GreatPoint uses, will succeed in part because it fits in with existing energy infrastructures, like gas pipelines and coal mines. If it did, it could have a profound impact on the balance of natural gas imports, lessening or eliminating the need for liquefied natural gas ports. Like Fischer-Tropsch diesel, methanization is not a new idea; one plant in North Dakota does it now, using a technology paid for under the Carter-era Synthetic Fuels Corporation. But GreatPoint is going about it in a new way, in which far less energy is lost in the transition. There is a potential to make fuels from gasification better than ordinary fuels. Robert Williams, a senior research scientist at Princeton University, points out that crop wastes and wood chips can also be gasified, producing carbon monoxide and hydrogen. 
 Normally, biomass is thought of as carbon-neutral, because for each plant cut down for gasification, another grows and absorbs carbon from the atmosphere. But if biomass is gasified and the carbon dioxide sequestered by being pumped into the ground in the expectation that it will stay there, then atmospheric carbon actually declines for every gallon produced. 
 From a greenhouse perspective, that is more attractive than what Rentech does now with the carbon dioxide from its plant here. It is sold to soft-drink bottlers. That keeps the gas sequestered until someone burps.

FRANCE CAUTIOUS ON G.M. ALLIANCE France is ''extremely cautious'' about the prospect of General Motors forming an alliance with Renault and Nissan, the French industry minister said yesterday. ''This shouldn't be taken as a done deal; it's an idea,'' Francois Loos, the minister, below, said in an interview with i-Tele television. Mr. Loos was speaking after the boards of Renault and Nissan on Monday authorized Carlos Ghosn, who is chief executive of both carmakers, to begin negotiations with G.M. if its board agrees. The French state holds about 15 percent of Renault. A alliance among Renault, Nissan and G.M. would nevertheless be ''positive'' in principle, Mr. Loos added. (AP) 


G.M.'S SALES IN CHINA SOAR General Motors said yesterday that its sales in China jumped 47 percent over a year earlier in the first six months of this year, helped by stronger-than-expected demand. G.M. and its joint ventures sold 453,832 vehicles in China in the January to June period, compared with 308,722 in the same period of 2005, the company said in a statement. G.M. says it had a 12.5 percent share in the China vehicle market, up from 10.8 percent a year earlier, making it the No. 1 foreign automaker in the country. Last year, it surpassed the longtime leader, Volkswagen of Germany. On Monday, G.M. reported a 26 percent decline in its United States sales for June over the previous year. (AP)

MUSIC AND YAHOO CHINA The world's biggest music companies are preparing a lawsuit against Yahoo China for copyright infringement as part of the industry's efforts to crack down on piracy. ''Yahoo China has been blatantly infringing our members' rights. We have started the process and as far as we're concerned we're on the track to litigation,'' said John Kennedy, chairman and chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a music industry trade group based in London. ''If negotiation can prevent that, so be it.'' Yahoo China officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Yahoo China is a partnership between the Internet giant Yahoo Inc., which owns 40 percent of the business, and Alibaba.com of China. (REUTERS)

EMPLOYEES SUE OVER DATA THEFT Concerns about identity theft prompted a group of nine employees to sue the Union Pacific Corporation, the nation's largest railroad, over the way it uses Social Security numbers to identify employees. The company said in May that a computer with names and Social Security numbers of 30,000 current or retired Union Pacific employees had been stolen from a personnel employee on April 29. The lawsuit was filed Friday in Pottawattamie County, Iowa, by the nine railroad employees on behalf of a class that could include 30,000 members, according to the lawsuit. A Union Pacific spokesman said Monday that company lawyers had not yet seen the lawsuit and had no comment. (AP)

RUSSIA WARNED ON ENERGY The ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned Russia yesterday of the dangers of basing its economy on the energy industry, urging policy makers to avoid ''the pitfalls of hydrocarbon dependence.'' The company said in a report that an influx of foreign currency from the sale of Russian gas and oil could force up the value of the ruble, which could harm other industrial sectors. The report said that receipts from oil and gas provided Russia with about 50 percent of its government revenues, and 65 percent of export earnings. (AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE)

TAXI PROTEST IN ITALY Striking taxi drivers in Rome decided to intensify a major protest that has so far lasted two days and caused disruption at airports, at rail stations and in major cities. Union representatives announced a national strike for July 11 and said they were organizing a march on Rome today for dozens of drivers from all over the country who might continue protesting in the city for two weeks.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Is Looking for More Elbow Room

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
In the midst of its biggest expansion in nearly a decade, the world's largest software company has suddenly found itself with a major setback: not enough room to grow.
 Microsoft -- in the midst of a bitter rivalry with Google and Yahoo -- snapped into action this April, saying the company would spend about $2 billion on new technologies to reinvigorate itself. Then last month, Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, Bill Gates, announced that he would leave his day-to-day role at the company in two years.
Easier said than done, at least when you consider that the company, which houses more than 30,000 people on its sprawling campus in Redmond, Wash., suddenly will have to make room for up to 12,000 new bodies. It will spend $1 billion to expand that campus by more than a third, or 3.1 million square feet, over the next three years. That includes new leases and the purchase and construction of 14 buildings. For a modest-size real estate market like Seattle, those are staggering numbers. 
 ''The Redmond you'll see even in a year will make your eyes pop,'' said Lou Gellos, a Microsoft spokesman. ''It's going to be a very different campus.''
 Microsoft is expanding beyond the boundaries of its current site, adding two buildings in a downtown Redmond shopping mall for a total of three, and consolidating its North American sales headquarters staff in a new skyscraper under construction in nearby Bellevue, Wash. By next summer, Microsoft will take over 15 of the 28 floors, or 320,000 square feet, in the office tower.
 ''They're pretty much leasing up all the vacant office space in Redmond,'' said Rob Odle, director of planning and community development for the city of Redmond.
 Microsoft had planned to add 2.1 million square feet over 15 to 20 years, but overcrowding at its headquarters and a heated battle with Google and Yahoo forced the company to step up the pace. 
 The move comes none too soon. The latest version of the Windows operating system, Vista, has been hit with delays and will not reach store shelves until January. The update of Office business software, which was to be released this year, will not be out until January. Google has started making inroads in office applications, one of Microsoft's core businesses, with its release of spreadsheet and word processing software. Google, the search giant, has also overtaken Microsoft in online searches and accounted for 49 percent of them in May, versus 10.6 percent for Microsoft, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, a New York market research firm. 
 ''They see themselves as somewhat beleaguered, and that's been their pattern since the beginning,'' said Rob Helm, director of research at Directions on Microsoft, a research firm in Kirkland, Wash., that tracks only Microsoft. ''There's always been a bogeyman driving significant parts of their business strategy.''
 Microsoft's increased spending should be a boon for the Seattle area, where unemployment has stubbornly floated from 4 percent to 5 percent for well over a year. The company plans to hire 4,000 to 5,000 new employees this year, more than half of whom will be located in the United States. (Microsoft would not say how many people it expects to hire in Redmond.) For every new technology-related job, nearly four new jobs -- mostly in the service sector -- are created in Washington State, according to the Technology Alliance, a state trade group based in Seattle. 
 ''The real reason you want these jobs is for the multiplier effect,'' said Bill McSherry, director of economic development at the Puget Sound Regional Council in Seattle.
 But some local residents do not applaud Microsoft's expansion. For them, it means increased traffic, higher home prices and crowded parks. Roads are clogged and median housing prices on the Eastside, the area east of Lake Washington where Redmond is located, have soared 17 percent, to $484,500, in May from a year ago. 
 ''There are two times a day when people come and go to Microsoft that traffic is so bad you have to stay home,'' said Jack Bittner, 59, a resident of the Grasslawn neighborhood, which is next to Microsoft. ''It's almost gridlock now.''
 Mr. Bittner and his wife have even considered selling his house, which they bought for $86,000 in 1987, and moving to Bellingham, a city north of Seattle. He expects he could get around $600,000 for his four-bedroom ranch. 
 Transportation has become the largest issue for the growing region. And for its part, Microsoft has vowed to spend $35 million on transportation improvements in Redmond, including an overpass over Route 520 near its campus, sewer upgrades and turn lanes on nearby roads. 
 But even a sizable cash infusion would merely be a temporary solution to a problem that has been steadily worsening for years. The area's roads and bridges, some of which are earthquake hazards, already struggle to handle the company's 30,000 employees. The Route 520 bridge, which crosses Lake Washington and connects Seattle to Redmond, was built in 1963 to handle 15,000 vehicles a day. Now, 115,000 vehicles cross it daily. Increased traffic, windstorms, earthquakes and boating and traffic accidents have further shortened the bridge's life and required extensive repairs. State officials worry a strong windstorm or earthquake could damage the bridge beyond repair.
 ''The economic impacts would be catastrophic,'' said John Milton, SR-520 project director with Washington's state transportation department. ''It's the feeder for two of the major employment centers in the area.''
 Privately, Microsoft officials bristle at the notion that the transportation burden is theirs. But Microsoft's size makes it a convenient target for complaint among Redmond residents. 
 ''Almost immediately after Microsoft began expanding in the late 1990's, the traffic in our neighborhood just went nuts,'' Mr. Bittner said. ''That makes me not too excited about this expansion.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Firm Has Korea Up in Arms

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
South Korean authorities are continuing a high-profile investigation into Lone Star, the Dallas-based private-equity fund, fueling a public backlash against excessive profits made by foreign investment funds. 
 Just eight years ago, Lone Star was hailed as a savior, pouring money into companies crippled by South Korea's financial crisis. Today, it appears to be in danger of being run out of town in a flap that could threaten Seoul's attractiveness to foreign investors.
South Korea is investigating Lone Star for possible wrongdoing involving its takeover of Korea Exchange Bank. Lone Star's plan to sell the bank, earning a windfall profit of $4.4 billion, has provoked a public outcry, along with its attempts to avoid Korean taxes. 
 A separate investigation into allegations of embezzlement and bribery resulted in a raid on Lone Star's Seoul offices and the arrest of three businessmen linked to the fund. 
 Lone Star's troubles sit at the center of a growing uproar over the huge and often tax-free profits earned by foreign hedge funds and other investment funds, which like Lone Star are now cashing out of lucrative investments made here during and after the financial crisis. Most experts, however, describe the outcry as just growing pains of this country's rapid transformation into one of Asia's most open economies. 
 ''Lone Star was a shock to the system,'' said Kim Joon Gi, a professor of law at Yonsei University in Seoul. ''Koreans were suddenly asking: How on earth could they make such a killing, and then not pay taxes? And to make it worse, they're foreigners.''
 Behind the uproar is also a sense among many Koreans that foreign investors were given unfairly generous terms after the 1998 financial crisis. They point in particular to the attempts by Lone Star to shelter its profit, the largest ever on a single deal by a foreign investor, from Korean taxes by using international treaties originally designed to prevent double taxation of companies doing business overseas. 
 [On June 19, government auditors cleared Lone Star of wrongdoing in its 2003 purchase of Korea Exchange Bank, but prosecutors are still investigating, and tax authorities are examining whether they can tax the fund's earnings. And on Friday, a former executive of Korea Exchange Bank received a one-year prison sentence for bribery.]
 While Lone Star has received the most attention, other funds have also come under intense scrutiny.
 In April, prosecutors indicted the local head of the United States private equity firm Warburg Pincus on insider trading charges stemming from the 2003 purchase of LG Card, a credit card company. Newbridge Capital, another American investment fund, was investigated last year by tax authorities after avoiding taxes on its $1.2 billion in profit from the sale of Korea First Bank.
 The American private equity firm Carlyle Group was criticized for not paying taxes on its $740 million profit from the sale of KorAm Bank two years ago. More recently, Carl C. Icahn and another United States investment fund, Steel Partners II, have drawn criticism for trying to take over KT&G, a former state-owned tobacco company.
 Some politicians and newspaper editorials have chimed in, calling these investors ''vulture funds.'' Tax officials have announced a sweeping inspection of 6,100 foreign-invested companies and foreign corporate offices in South Korea. In April, South Korea's president, Roh Moo Hyun, even weighed in, saying that deregulation had exposed the country to foreign takeovers.
 South Korea is not alone in criticizing investment funds, as the United States Congress has also looked into regulating the hedge fund industry. But South Korea's outrage has been severe, partly due to a deep-seated distaste for excessive profits. The size and intensity of the fury has raised alarms among some overseas investors that a broader nationalist backlash could threaten one of Asia's most dynamic success stories, and the government's proclaimed dream of turning Seoul into a regional financial hub similar to Hong Kong.
 A few analysts have also expressed concern that the flap could even escalate into a political dispute between Seoul and Washington, just as they have begun negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement. 
 Lone Star's founder and managing partner, John Grayken, summed up the bitterness of some investors in a press conference last month in New York -- a rare airing of grievances by one of the normally secretive investment funds.
 ''The hostile antiforeign investor climate has created great uncertainty for us as investors in Korea,'' Mr. Grayken told reporters. ''It is difficult to manage Lone Star's other investments and determine our future investment policy there.'' 
 But most economists, investors and government officials say South Korea is far from closing the doors to its vibrant economy, the world's 10th-largest according to the International Monetary Fund.
 These experts say that the shock therapy of throwing open the nation's long-protected economy after the banking and currency crisis of eight years ago has made South Korea a popular destination for direct foreign investment. Last year, it lured $9.6 billion, according to the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. That's 1.2 percent of South Korea's $800 billion gross domestic product, about 60 percent more on a percentage basis than the United States received from abroad in 2004, the most recent year for which data are available.
 ''South Korea is still steaming toward globalization,'' said Moon Hwy Chang, a professor of international business at Seoul National University. ''There's been an overreaction to Lone Star, but most Koreans also know we need trade and investment.''
 Mr. Moon and other experts and officials also point out that about half of that investment comes from industrial companies like General Electric, Motorola and General Motors, which have not been caught up in the current furor. In fact, G.M., which bought the ailing automaker Daewoo Motor four years ago, has even won the grudging respect of labor unions by hiring back 1,600 workers laid off before the takeover.
 Rather, these experts say, the investment funds are running into troubles that are at least partly of their own making. Lone Star says it does not owe Korean taxes because Korea Exchange Bank was purchased by the fund's subsidiary in Belgium, a country with which South Korea has a treaty that alleviates its tax burden to Seoul. Lone Star said it would pay taxes on the sale in Belgium, where the rates are lower than those in South Korea. Carlyle did something similar with its sale of KorAm Bank, using a subsidiary in Malaysia, another treaty country.
 While legal, such maneuverings have left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Koreans, who see the funds as taking advantage of their country while it was down, and now trying to escape with the loot. ''Lone Star Wants to Eat and Run,'' said a headline in January in The Seoul Shinmun, a major daily. Spurred by public indignation, Korean lawmakers passed a bill last month limiting use of tax treaties.
 But the real danger, say some economists, is that public resentment could trigger a broader backlash that could sour interest among foreign investors. While this remains unlikely, they say there are widespread misgivings with the rapid pace of South Korea's opening to the world after the 1998 crisis.
 ''Korea is in a delicate period, a transition period to becoming more global,'' said Mr. Moon of Seoul National University. ''Those opposed to globalization are seizing upon the mistakes of Lone Star and other funds to say slow down.''
 The Korean government has found itself caught in the middle, reassuring overseas investors while also trying to appease domestic anger. But they insist that the country remains open to investment.
 ''Korea's policy of attracting foreign capital is unchanged,'' the commerce minister, Chung Sye Kyun, said in an interview. ''I will personally lead the charge to protect any businesses, foreign or domestic, from unfair or discriminatory actions.''
 For their part, investment funds say they are entitled to the large windfalls because they took such huge risks, buying bankrupt and ailing companies at a time when no one else had the money or the appetite to invest. But in an apparent recognition that it may have gone too far, Lone Star said in April that it would donate $104 million to Korean charities, and keep $763 million in a bank account in South Korea to cover any taxes that it might owe. Mr. Grayken said the fund's current investments in South Korea totaled $5 billion.
 Many foreign business leaders in South Korea say the public attention is natural given the problems at Lone Star. And they say the recent uproar over foreign investment is just a hiccup for a country learning to adjust to the rapid opening of its economy since 1998.
 ''The U.S. went through the same thing in the 1980's with Japan, and more recently with Dubai ports,'' said Tami Overby, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, a lobby group for United States businesses. ''Korea has taken a huge bite and is still trying to digest it.''

HEADLINE: With Jobs to Do, Louisiana Parish Turns to Inmates

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. 

 BODY:
At barbecues, ballgames and funerals, cotton gins, service stations, the First Baptist Church, the pepper-sauce factory and the local private school -- the men in orange are everywhere. 
 Many people here in East Carroll Parish, as Louisiana counties are known, say they could not get by without their inmates, who make up more than 10 percent of its population and most of its labor force. They are dirt-cheap, sometimes free, always compliant, ever-ready and disposable.
You just call up the sheriff, and presto, inmates are headed your way. ''They bring me warm bodies, 10 warm bodies in the morning,'' said Grady Brown, owner of the Panola Pepper Corporation. ''They do anything you ask them to do.'' 
 It is an ideal arrangement, many in this farming parish say. 
 ''You call them up, they drop them off, and they pick them up in the afternoon,'' said Paul Chapple, owner of a service station. 
 National prison experts say that only Louisiana allows citizens to use inmate labor on such a widespread scale, under the supervision of local sheriffs. The state has the nation's highest incarceration rate, and East Carroll Parish, a forlorn jurisdiction of 8,700 people along the Mississippi River in the remote northeastern corner of Louisiana, has one of the highest rates in the state.
 As a result, it is here that the nation's culture of incarceration achieves a kind of ultimate synthesis with the local economy. The prison system converts a substantial segment of the population into a commodity that is in desperately short supply -- cheap labor -- and local-jail inmates are integrated into every aspect of economic and social life. 
 The practice is both an odd vestige of the abusive convict-lease system that began in the South around Reconstruction, and an outgrowth of Louisiana's penchant for stuffing state inmates into parish jails -- far more than in any other state. Nowhere else would sheriffs have so many inmates readily at hand, creating a potent political tool come election time, and one that keeps them popular in between. 
 Sometimes the men get paid -- minimum wage, for instance, working for Mr. Brown. But by the time the sheriff takes his cut, which includes board, travel expenses and clothes, they wind up with considerably less than half of that, inmates say. 
 The rules are loose and give the sheriffs broad discretion. State law dictates only which inmates may go out into the world (mostly those nearing the end of their sentences) and how much the authorities get to keep of an inmate's wages, rather than the type of work he can perform. There is little in the state rules to limit the potential for a sheriff to use his inmate flock to curry favor or to reap personal benefit.
 ''If you talk to people around here, it is jokingly referred to as rent-a-convict,'' said Michael Brewer, a lawyer and former public defender in Alexandria, in central Louisiana. ''There's something offensive about that. It's almost like a form of slavery.''
 That is not a view often expressed in East Carroll Parish. 
 ''I've been at cocktail parties where people laugh about it,'' said Jacques Roy, another Alexandria lawyer. ''People in Alexandria clamor for it. It's cheaper. I've always envisioned it as a who-you-know kind of thing.''
 The prisoners are not compelled to work, but several interviewed here said they welcomed the chance to get out of the crowded jail, at least during the day. Still, Mr. Brewer said, ''if one of them were to refuse, you can imagine the repercussions.'' 
 Nearly half of Louisiana's prisoners are housed in small parish jails, a policy that saves the state from building new prisons and is lucrative for sheriffs, handsomely compensated for the privilege. 
 ''They're making a ton of money,'' said Burk Foster, former criminal-justice professor at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette and author of the recent textbook ''Corrections.'' The sheriffs are paid $22.39 per prisoner per day for accommodating their charges in facilities of often rudimentary construction.
 The accommodations here appear to be made of no more than corrugated metal. ''Hey man, we're sleeping on the floor,'' an inmate called out from behind the fence at the parish jail last week, before a visitor was shooed away by an angry guard.
 Exactly how much the sheriffs pocket, however, is unclear. 
 ''Sheriffs deliberately obscure from the public how much money they're making,'' said Mr. Foster, a leading expert on Louisiana prisons.
 A spokeswoman for the state corrections department said she could not respond to the idea that sheriffs profited from housing state inmates. 
 The sheriff here, Mark Shumate, did not reply to phone calls and messages, but one of his investigators, Brandon Wiltcher, had an explanation for the popularity and pervasiveness of inmate labor here.
 ''It's just such a shortage of people who will work, or that can work,'' Mr. Wiltcher said. 
 This parish, the poorest in Louisiana, lost 20 percent of its free population from 1980 to 2000. The inmate population, however, grew.
 Mr. Shumate is a very big man in these precincts of lush green corn, cotton and soybean fields that stretch into a horizon shimmering in the heat. Residents say his inmates cook hamburgers for community get-togethers; they are in the concession stand at children's baseball games; they dig graves, mow roadsides and roof churches. 
 ''They are a constant fixture and presence, at each of these community events,'' said Danny Terral, who works in his family's farm-supply business. ''I daresay I haven't been at a community event where it's not been, those orange shirts.''
 They build dugouts and tend the athletic fields -- free -- at Briarfield Academy, a private school here. ''They did an excellent job,'' said the school's principal, Morris Richardson, adding, ''We try to provide their lunch for them.'' 
 Mr. Wiltcher, of the sheriff's office, said there was nothing wrong with helping out the private school without charge. 
 ''It's not only used at this private school, it's used parishwide,'' he said of inmate labor. ''Since it's used for everyone who needs it, I don't see where there would be a problem with it.''
 The churches, too, are grateful beneficiaries. ''They sent me prisoners for a month'' for menial chores at the First Baptist Church, said Reynold Minsky, also chairman of the local levee board. ''All completely free,'' Mr. Minsky added. ''It's a real good deal. Everybody is tickled.''
 Many here view the inmates essentially as commodities, who can be returned behind bars after the agricultural season is over, and the need for labor is reduced.
 ''Good thing about it, wintertime, you can lock them up -- put them in cold storage,'' said Billy Travis, a farmer and police juror, as county commissioners here are known. ''I call it deep freeze.'' 
 Right on the main road into town, at the base of the levee, up from the Economy Inn and the Scott Tractor Company, the quasi-employment agency behind concertina wire is neither out of sight nor out of mind. At midday, passing motorists can spot its residents, out for a brief exercise spell. ''They got D.O.C. mixed in with parish prisoners,'' another inmate complained, referring to the State Department of Corrections inmates who mingle freely with those who have committed lesser local crimes.
 At Lake Providence Country Club one afternoon last week, during a Rotary Club meeting, the talk was of organizing a midsummer fish fry. ''I imagine the sheriff can do that,'' one man called out. ''I hear the sheriff does a really good job,'' another said. 
 Outside the worn little town, a succession of empty storefronts and others headed that way, inmates can be spotted clearing up the remains of a ruined church off a hot country road, while a deputy lounges in the shade; picking up trash; and clearing undergrowth from roadsides with heavy equipment. 
 Up the road, toward the Arkansas line, a half-dozen or so are at work in the stifling production-line room of the small pepper-sauce plant, sweating alongside the free laborers. Another is fixing up a house next door that Mr. Brown bought to rent out. 
 The factory owner sings his praises, calling him reliable, trustworthy, honest. The inmate, Roy Hebert -- he says he is in for forgery -- beams. ''Mr. Brown, he takes care of me,'' Mr. Hebert said.

HEADLINE: 6 MISSILES FIRED BY NORTH KOREA; TESTS PROTESTED

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI and DAVID E. SANGER; Norimitsu Onishi reported from Tokyo for this article, and David E. Sanger from Vermont. Reporting was contributed by Warren Hoge from the United Nations, and by David S. Cloud, Helene Cooper and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington.

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, July 5 

 BODY:
North Korea test-fired at least six missiles over the Sea of Japan on Wednesday morning, including an intercontinental missile that apparently failed or was aborted 42 seconds after it was launched, White House and Pentagon officials said.
 The small barrage of launchings, which took place over more than four hours, came in defiance of warnings from President Bush and the governments of Japan, South Korea and China. Of the launchings, which the United States and Japan condemned, intelligence officials focused most of their attention on the intercontinental missile, called the Taepodong 2, which American spy satellites have been watching on a remote launching pad for more than a month.
It is designed to be capable of reaching Alaska, and perhaps the West Coast of the United States, but American officials who tracked its launching said it fell into the Sea of Japan before its first stage burned out.
 ''The Taepodong obviously was a failure -- that tells you something about capabilities,'' Stephen Hadley, President Bush's national security adviser, told reporters in a phone call on Tuesday evening in Washington. But other officials warned that even a failed launching was of some use to the North Koreans, because it will help them diagnose what went wrong with the liquid-fueled rocket. 
 In a statement issued late Tuesday night, the White House said the United States ''remains committed to a peaceful diplomatic solution'' and sought implementation of a joint statement on denuclearization issued after a meeting with North Korea in September. But it said ''the North Korean regime's actions and unwillingness to return to the talks appears to indicate that the North has not yet made the strategic decision to give up their nuclear programs.''
 ''Accordingly, we will continue to take all necessary measures to protect ourselves and our allies,'' the White House said, offering no details.
 The missiles have been the source of considerable diplomatic tension in recent weeks, because of North Korea's declarations that it already possesses nuclear weapons. American intelligence agencies have told President Bush they believe the North has produced enough fuel for six or more weapons, but it is unclear whether they have actually used it to make nuclear devices. 
 However, the country is not believed to have developed a warhead small enough to fit atop one of its missiles, and it has never conducted a nuclear test, to the knowledge of American officials. 
 The other missiles that the North fired appeared to be a mix of short-range Scud-C missiles and intermediate-range Rodong missiles, of the kind that the North has sold to Iran, Pakistan and other nations. Those missiles also landed in the Sea of Japan.
 None of the launchings were announced in advance. But the first came just minutes after the space shuttle Discovery lifted off in Florida -- an event the North Koreans could monitor on television. Administration officials said they could only speculate as to whether the missile launching had been timed to coincide with the shuttle launching, or with Independence Day, but outside analysts had little doubt.
 ''It's very in your face to do it on the Fourth of July,'' said Ashton B. Carter, a Harvard professor who, with former defense secretary William J. Perry, had urged the Bush administration to destroy the Taepodong missile on the launching pad, advice the administration rejected. 
 ''Hooray if it failed,'' Mr. Carter said. 
 While the test itself was a sign of North Korea's defiance of the United States, for the administration, the outcome was as favorable as officials could have hoped for: the North's capacity was called into question, and the North's enigmatic leader, Kim Jong Il, has now put himself at odds with the two countries that have provided him aid, China and South Korea. ''Our hope is that the Chinese are going to be furious,'' said one senior American official, who declined to be identified. 
 Another official noted that only days ago, the Chinese indicated that they were trying to put together an ''informal'' meeting of the long-dormant six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program. 
 The North has boycotted the talks since September, citing American efforts to close down the banks it uses overseas.
 But North Korea had apparently not responded to the Chinese invitation, and American officials said last week that the Chinese would not have made that gesture if they believed that they were about to be embarrassed by the country that they once considered a close ally.
 The launching also makes it difficult for the South Koreans to continue their policy of providing aid and investment to the North, a program that has caused deep rifts with Washington. Administration officials said that Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the main negotiator with North Korea, would leave for Asia on Wednesday, and that they expected him to use the launchings to try to bring South Korea and China into the fold on imposing some kind of sanctions.
 At the same time, the launching is likely to strengthen the hand of hard-liners in the Bush administration who have long argued that the six-party talks were bound to fail. They now have what one American diplomat called ''a clear runway'' to press for a gradually escalating series of sanctions, which some officials clearly hope will bring down Mr. Kim's government. 
 But it is far from clear that China -- which provides the North with its oil and much of its food -- would go along with any move for sanctions. 
 The firing ended weeks of speculation about the intentions of Pyongyang, which had rolled out the Taepodong 2, its new long-range missile, in full view of American spy satellites, and came despite severe warnings from the United States and countries in this region that a test would entail further isolation and sanctions. The first missile was fired around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, according to the Japanese government. 
 American officials said they believe the Taepodong 2 was the third missile fired, with the U.S. Northern Command saying that it was launched at 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
 American and Japanese officials immediately condemned the launchings. But American officials had never considered it a serious threat to the United States, especially because there was no evidence the missile was equipped with a warhead. Mr. Bush's spokesman, Tony Snow, only went so far as to call the launching ''provocative behavior.''
 The Japanese government said it would take ''severe actions'' against the North, possibly including economic sanctions. Those could include shutting down the ferry service to North Korea and attempting to stem the flow of the transfer of cash to the North from Koreans in Japan, though officials acknowledge that would be difficult. 
 At the United Nations, John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador, was ''urgently consulting'' with other members of the Security Council to try to schedule a meeting of the panel, according to his spokesman, Richard A. Grenell. Later in the evening, it was announced that the Council would meet to take up the matter at 10 a.m. Wednesday at the request of Japan. Mr. Hadley acknowledged that ''what we really don't have a fix on is, you know, what's the intention of all this, what is the purpose of all this? '' He noted it was a violation of North Korea's previous pledges to hold to a moratorium on missile tests. 
 It was also unclear why North Korea fired short- and mid-range missiles, which it has tested successfully in the past and of which it is said to own several hundred.
 ''One theory is that they knew that there was a probability that things with the Taepodong 2 wouldn't work, so it was good to fire off a few missiles that would actually work,'' said a senior Bush administration official, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak about this issue.
 In 1998, the last time the North tested a missile outside its territory, Pyongyang fired the Taepodong 1, which flew over Japan before falling into the sea. That test set off a negative reaction in the region, especially in Japan, which responded by strengthening its military and its alliance with the United States.
 Wednesday's tests are likely to increase calls inside Japan to strengthen its missile defense efforts with the United States, and could increase support for hawkish candidates in the race to succeed Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who is scheduled to retire in September.
 Shinzo Abe, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, who is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Koizumi and who has gained popularity in recent years by being tough on North Korea and China, said the tests were ''a serious problem from the standpoint of our national security, peace and stability of the international community and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.''
 The tests are sure to anger China -- which expended considerable diplomatic prestige in pressing the North not to go ahead with the launching and to rejoin the six-nation talks -- and raise doubts anew about the real extent of Beijing's influence on Pyongyang. The Chinese foreign ministry said it had no comment to make yet on the launching.
 In South Korea, whose government publicly urged the North not to test-fire but privately played down the risk, opponents of the government's engagement policy toward the North might gain support in presidential elections next year.
 Intelligence from American satellite photographs indicated in mid-June that the North was proceeding with the test-firing of the Taepodong 2 at a launching pad on North Korea's remote east coast. Satellite photographs showed that the North Koreans had taken steps to put fuel into the missile, but the missile sat there until Wednesday morning, leading to speculation that the North was simply staging the event in order to gain attention from the United States.
 American officials had suggested that they might use the missile defense shield to shoot down the Taepodong 2 in midair. Bad weather in this region was said to have delayed the launching, because poor visibility would prevent the North from tracking its missile.
 But the North contradicted expert opinion by launching its long-range missile in predawn darkness today.

HEADLINE: Enron's Founder Oversaw Company's Rise and Collapse

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
Enron Corp. founder Kenneth Lay, who was convicted of helping perpetuate one of the most sprawling business frauds in U.S. history, has died. He was 64.
 Nicknamed "Kenny Boy" by President Bush, Lay led Enron's meteoric rise from a staid natural gas pipeline company formed by a 1985 merger to an energy and trading conglomerate that reached No. 7 on the Fortune 500 in 2000 and claimed $101 billion in annual revenues. 
He was convicted May 25 along with former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling of defrauding investors and employees by repeatedly lying about Enron's financial strength in the months before the company plummeted into bankruptcy protection in December 2001. Lay was also convicted in a separate non-jury trial of bank fraud and making false statements to banks, charges related to his personal finances. He was scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 11.
 Lay had built Enron into a high-profile, widely admired company, the seventh-largest publicly traded in the country. But Enron collapsed after it was revealed the company's finances were based on a web of fraudulent partnerships and schemes, not the profits that it reported to investors and the public.
 When Lay and Skilling went on trial in U.S. District Court Jan. 30, it had been expected that Lay, who enjoyed great popularity throughout Houston as chairman of the energy company, might be able to charm the jury. But during his testimony, Lay ended up coming across as irritable and combative.
 He also sounded arrogant, defending his extravagant lifestyle, including a $200,000 yacht for wife Linda's birthday party, despite $100 million in personal debt and saying "it was difficult to turn off that lifestyle like a spigot."
 Both he and Skilling maintained that there had been no wrongdoing at Enron, and that the company had been brought down by negative publicity that undermined investors' confidence.
 His defense didn't help his case with jurors.
 "I wanted very badly to believe what they were saying," juror Wendy Vaughan said after the verdicts were announced. "There were places in the testimony I felt their character was questionable."
 Lay was born in Tyrone, Mo. and spent his childhood helping his family make ends meet. His father ran a general store and sold stoves until he became a minister. Lay delivered newspapers and mowed lawns to pitch in. He attended the University of Missouri, found his calling in economics, and went to work at Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) predecessor Humble Oil & Refining upon graduation.
 He joined the Navy, served his time at the Pentagon, and then served as undersecretary for the Department of the Interior before he returned to business. He became an executive at Florida Gas, then Transco Energy in Houston, and later became CEO of Houston Natural Gas. In 1985, HNG merged with InterNorth in Omaha, Neb. to form Enron, and Lay became chairman and CEO of the combined company the next year.

Breach of Faith
Hurricane Katrina and the Near Death of a Great American City
By Jed Horne
412 pages. Random House. $25.95.
 There are two Hurricane Katrina deluges to reckon with: the one that hit the city and the one now hitting bookstores. The latter storm surge has barely begun.
''The Great Deluge'' by Douglas Brinkley was written at record speed, yet is thus far the most evocative, soul-shaking account of the calamity. Ivor van Heerden, the prophetic deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center, has analyzed the event's scientific and forensic aspects in ''The Storm'' (written with Mike Bryan). CNN and Time are among the news organizations that have commemorated their coverage in book form. 
 Now The Times-Picayune, the New Orleans newspaper, joins the fray. ''Path of Destruction'' is a coming book by two members of its Pulitzer Prize-winning news team, John McQuaid and Mark Schleifstein, with an emphasis on history, climatology and politics. But Jed Horne, a Times-Picayune metropolitan editor, is after the big picture. His ''Breach of Faith'' is an amalgam of the feature stories, news analysis, forensic evidence and backroom power plays engineered by New Orleans's most influential citizens and the hellish ordeals suffered by its least. 
 The model for a book of this scope remains J. Anthony Lukas's ''Common Ground,'' the amazingly multifaceted, gripping and comprehensive account of Boston's racial tensions as seen through the eyes of three very different families. Mr. Horne's book is modeled along similar lines. But while Mr. Horne touches all the necessary bases, his book is thorough without managing to become more than the sum of its miscellaneous parts.
 What happened to the hometown advantage? Many Hurricane Katrina authors are New Orleans residents, but The Times-Picayune had a special edge. Its coverage of the disaster was so strong that it became the primary news source for other publications. Its feat in continuing to function despite overwhelming obstacles was part of the event's high drama. 
 If ever an author were entitled to insert himself into a news story, Mr. Horne is: he and his newspaper had what Random House calls ''a front-row seat'' for the storm's unfolding horrors. Yet ''Breach of Faith'' is a measured, impersonal, often dispassionate account of news that has since become all too familiar.
 A Hurricane Katrina book is sure to do certain things. It will cite John M. Barry's 1998 ''Rising Tide,'' about the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, as a model for studying a natural disaster and its wider racial, economic and political ramifications. It will incorporate ghastly, graphic examples of extraordinary suffering. 
 It will refer to the snake-filled muck that swamped the city as ''gumbo.'' It will find controversy in the behavior of New Orleans's mayor, C. Ray Nagin. And it will agree that Michael D. Brown, the director of FEMA at the time the hurricane hit, did do a heck of a job, though that depends on what the meaning of ''heck'' is.
 ''Breach of Faith'' delivers all of the above. And it incorporates a great many first-person stories, selected with a Noah's Ark approach to diversity as a way of creating a mosaic. Mr. Horne did not conduct all of these interviews himself, and perhaps that's why so many of them lack immediacy. 
 It's indicative of this book's tone that he identifies one assistant as ''the redoubtable Hamilton Simons-Jones, scion of fine journalistic stock and a man acutely sensitive to the ethical issues journalists confront in dealing with the impoverished and disempowered.'' He also describes one photographer's choice between whether to take action or take pictures as ''vexing.''
 The book is structured so that certain individuals are visited time and again, creating different narrative threads about aspects of Hurricane Katrina's impact. For such tactics to work, the people cited must become very recognizable to the reader. But Mr. Horne lets most of them remain only moderately familiar. 
 And although the book's separate chapters would seem to be about specific parts of the overall story, their organization is not so succinct. He is apt to mention one aspect of the crisis and then move on to another in ways that meander rather than logically progress.
 Time sequences are problematic, since Mr. Horne does not attempt the Herculean job of telling this story chronologically. His separation of different narrative threads can be dizzying, since the book may move from post-storm chaos to anticipation of the imminent hurricane. 
 ''Breach of Faith'' works best when its chronology and focus are unmistakable. In detailing the structure of levees and the difficulty of making them sturdy (''Sinking a sheet pile into peat was like trying to make a fork stand up in salad,'' he writes), Mr. Horne successfully concentrates the reader's attention and his own.
 ''Breach of Faith'' deals with the aftermath of the storm better than it does with the immediate experience of it. Mr. Horne is patient and diffuse enough to fare well with some of the knottier issues raised by the disaster. Questions about insurance practices, possibilities for rebuilding, levee board consolidation and the Army Corps of Engineers' defensiveness about its work practices are dutifully addressed. 
 Mr. Horne also takes issue with Mr. Brinkley's harsh assessment of Mayor Nagin and with the perception of Gov. Kathleen B. Blanco as ineffectual. ''There had always been something deceptive about Blanco,'' he writes, ''a surprise in the discovery, which might take awhile, that she carried a sharp political knife in the folds of her grandmotherly togs.''
 But in the end Mr. Horne cannot come up with much of an ending. ''Only this much seemed certain,'' he writes. ''The seeds of whatever future lay ahead had been sown.'' There's no arguing with that. There's not much reason to pay attention to it either.

FORMER ENRON CHIEF DIES -- Kenneth L. Lay, who as founder of the Enron Corporation rose to peaks of influence in business and politics, only to fall into disgrace amid scandal, died in Aspen, Colo., while awaiting a judge's sentencing this fall that could have sent him to prison for decades. He was 64. [Pages A1 and C7.] 


LEGAL IMPACT -- Kenneth L. Lay's death effectively voids the guilty verdict against him, temporarily thwarting the federal government's efforts to seize his remaining real estate and financial assets, legal experts say. [C1.]

OIL SURGES AFTER MISSILE TESTS -- Oil prices closed at a record high in New York as political tensions over the missile tests by North Korea shook equity and commodities markets around the world. In an already rattled oil market, North Korea's test of at least seven missiles, including one with long-range capability, gave traders another reason to push prices past $75 a barrel. [C1.]

WHEN LARGE IS SMALL -- The Small Business Administration and other federal agencies are mandated by law to provide at least 23 percent of federal contracts to small businesses. But for years, government studies show, large corporations like GTSI, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman have been counted as small businesses. And despite some efforts by the federal government to correct the mistakes, problems persist. [C1.]

NEW JERSEY SHUTDOWN -- As New Jersey's budget impasse deepened and the shutdown of state government services continued, Atlantic City's 12 casinos were forced to close for the first time in the 28 years that gambling has been legal there. [A1.]

CONCERT PROMOTERS MAKE DEAL -- Live Nation Inc., the largest concert promoter in the United States, said that it had reached a deal to buy the No. 2 promoter, HOB Entertainment, the operator of the House of Blues clubs, for $350 million, in a further concentration of the live-music business. [C3.]

GAS RIGHTS FOR GAZPROM -- Russia's Parliament passed a law that grants exclusive rights for exporting natural gas to Gazprom, the state-owned energy operator that is already the world's largest gas company. To take effect, the law must be signed by President Vladimir V. Putin, who has not commented on the legislation. [C4.]

IMMIGRATION HEARINGS -- Lawmakers from the Senate and the House, at odds over immigration reform, held rival hearings on opposite coasts, competing for public support for their differing proposals and moving no closer to compromise. [A12.]

WIRELESS INTERNET VENTURE -- Intel Capital and Motorola Ventures, the venture investment groups for the two chip makers, announced that together they would invest $900 million in Clearwire, a wireless Internet service provider, in hopes of speeding development of a global high-speed wireless network. [C7.]

ATARI'S WAITING GAME -- When executives involved with Test Drive Unlimited, the ambitious online racing simulation due from Atari later this summer, start talking about the game, they trumpet its long, difficult and expensive production process, which began in 2003 and has cost of $15 million and $25 million. [E1.]

FORCE BEHIND GATES FOUNDATION -- Melinda Gates, of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is far more than a name on the door. Although her husband, as the founder of Microsoft, is better known, she has played an instrumental role in the foundation's evolution from a modest-sized organization less than a decade ago into the world's largest foundation, with ambitious goals to reform education in America and eradicate the world's killer diseases. [A12.]

END OF A COMPANY TOWN -- The Pacific Lumber Company has owned the entirety of Scotia, Calif., all 500 acres of it, for 140 years. But soon the company will sell almost all of its residential holdings to the employees who rent them, effectively putting an end to one of the last company towns in the United States. [A1.]

CHAPPELLE'S LOST EPISODES -- Having been unable to persuade the comedian Dave Chappelle to return to his hit series, Comedy Central has pieced together sketches he did before his abrupt departure in May 2005 and named them ''Chappelle's Show: The Lost Episodes.'' [E1.]

NEW FINANCIAL GUIDELINES -- A global group known as the Equator Principles Financial Institutions is expanding its guidelines for ensuring that the large projects they finance do not have a harmful impact on the environment or local population. [C11.]

HEADLINE: Oil Up and Stocks Fall on Missile Worries 

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
Oil prices closed at a record high yesterday in New York as political tensions over the missile tests by North Korea shook equity and commodities markets around the world.
 In an already rattled oil market, North Korea's test of at least seven missiles, including one with long-range ability, gave traders another reason to push prices past $75 a barrel. After hitting $75.40 a barrel in intraday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price settled at $75.19, a jump of 1.7 percent, or $1.26 from Friday.
''It's more of the same,'' said Ric Navy, vice president of the BNP Paribas bank. ''Regardless of the fundamentals being adequate, the psychology of the market is telling you otherwise. There's a lot of nervousness.'' 
 That was enough to batter Japanese stocks again this morning, after falling 0.7 percent yesterday. The benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.5 percent to 15,284.78 at the end of morning trading. South Korea's Kospi stock index was also down. 
 Anxiety over North Korea spread to Wall Street where stocks weakened. In a further sign of concern of political instability, investors turned to safe alternatives, and the price of gold and silver shot up. 
 Reports about the missile tests came as investors also weighed a jobs report from Automatic Data Processing showing that nonfarm employment surged by 368,000 jobs in June.
 Analysts said the new employment numbers, which came in at more than double what economists expected, were a sign the economy was still growing at a strong pace. Investors remained concerned that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again in August.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.28 points yesterday, or 0.72 percent, to 1,270.91. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 76.20 points, or 0.68 percent, to 11,151.82, , and the Nasdaq composite index lost 37.09 points, or 1.69 percent, to 2,153.34.
 Markets in Asia and Europe closed modestly lower while the dollar gained against many foreign currencies. The main South Korean index declined less than 0.5 percent. In Europe, stock indexes in Britain, France and Germany all dropped at least 1 percent.
 Investors bid the Japanese yen, the South Korean won and the Taiwan dollar down against the euro and the American dollar. Gold rose nearly $14 an ounce, reaching $629.70. The price of silver jumped 4.5 percent, to close at $11.415 an ounce. 
 Concerns that Japan would postpone a long-awaited increase in short-term interest rates because of the diplomatic tensions with North Korea helped drive those moves, analysts said. The missile crisis could undermine regional growth rates if investors shift large amounts of capital to safe-haven investments like gold and if consumers decide to put off big purchases, the analysts said.
 Noting that the missile firings were timed to coincide with Independence Day in America, Masuhisa Kobayashi, chief strategist in the Tokyo office of Barclays, said, ''The United States government is clearly being provoked, and all eyes are now on its response.''
 Many Asian markets started the trading day off sharply lower, but rebounded as the day wore on and investors appeared to conclude that a military confrontation was not imminent. For example, the South Korean benchmark index, known as the Kospi, was off by as much as 2.1 percent in early trading, but retraced more than three-quarters of the loss before the close. 
 While most of the missiles appeared to fall harmlessly into the sea, the test launching of so many at once was widely seen as an act of defiance by the isolated Communist government, especially after repeated public warnings from the United States, Japan, China and other nations not to go through with a test.
 Japan immediately responded by announcing fresh economic sanctions against Pyongyang, including the turning back of a North Korean ferry as it tried to enter a Japanese port. The United Nations Security Council met in an emergency session to consider a resolution threatening sanctions. Despite support from the United States, Japan and Britain, China and Russia resisted the measure. 
 Economic sanctions would probably have little direct effect on regional trade and investment because North Korea's economy is already tiny and impoverished, with very limited economic contacts with the outside world. Economists estimate the country's gross domestic product at just $40 billion.
 The larger danger for now would seem to be any chilling of investor and consumer sentiment, analysts said. The timing is unfortunate for Japan, whose $4.6 trillion economy is finally showing signs of returning to normal after a decade-long funk. 
 A series of reports of strong economic statistics have many people believing that the Bank of Japan will raise its short-term interest rates to 0.25 percent from effectively zero, perhaps as soon as next week. But an extended crisis over the missile tests may lead it to delay action, analysts warned. 
 In the Treasury markets, bonds dropped again yesterday. The price of the 10-year note fell 18/32, to 998/32. The yield edged up to 5.22 percent, from 5.15 percent on Monday. 
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

PERSON: Kenneth Lee Lay 

HEADLINE: Kenneth L. Lay, 64, Enron Founder and Symbol of Corporate Excess

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Kenneth L. Lay, the son of a Baptist preacher in rural Missouri who rose to the pinnacle of corporate America as head of Enron before becoming a symbol of corporate excess, died yesterday in Aspen, Colo. He was 64.
 The cause of death was coronary artery disease, a forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy, Dr. Rob Kurtzman, told reporters yesterday in Grand Junction, Colo.
Mr. Lay's sudden death -- family and friends say he did not have a history of heart disease -- came six weeks after he was convicted of 10 charges of conspiracy, fraud and lying to banks and almost four months before he was to be sentenced for those crimes. He faced years in prison.
 As the chief executive of Houston Natural Gas in the 1985, Mr. Lay helped engineer the company's merger with InterNorth of Omaha; the combined company would be named the Enron Corporation a year later. Enron went on to become the nation's seventh-largest company, pioneering and dominating the trading of natural gas and electricity. But in December 2001, the company collapsed amid accounting scandals. 
 Kenneth Lee Lay was born in April 15, 1942, in Tyrone, Mo., the second of three children of Omer and Ruth Lay. His family moved frequently during his childhood as his father, a lay preacher, tried to establish himself in various trades and business ventures. When Mr. Lay was 6, the family's fledging chicken business was wiped out when a large shipment of birds was killed in a truck accident.
 He learned the value of money early, supplementing the family's meager income by delivering newspapers, cutting grass and baling hay. 
 Those childhood lessons would be reinforced when he studied economics under the tutelage of Pinkney Walker, an economics professor at the University of Missouri who became his mentor. 
 In the late 1960's, Mr. Lay landed his first real job, with the Houston-based Humble Oil and Refining, later part of Exxon. As one executive responsible for setting up Humble Oil's corporate development department, Mr. Lay received what seemed a princely salary of $13,000 a year. It was around this time that he married his college girlfriend, Judith Ayers. They had two children.
 While working at Humble, Mr. Lay began to pursue a doctorate in night school at the University of Houston. Then, with the draft board back in Missouri eager to get hold of him, Mr. Lay applied to the Navy's officer candidate school in Rhode Island and was accepted, heading out in January 1968. That led to his first experience in Washington; after officers' school, he was assigned to the Pentagon as an economist. 
 When his time in the military was up, Mr. Lay was preparing to return to the corporate world when he heard from Mr. Walker, who had been named by President Richard M. Nixon to the Federal Power Commission. Mr. Walker persuaded his star student to join him as his technical assistant. 
 After Washington, Mr. Lay did return to the business world, leaving for a job at the Florida Gas Corporation. His next big break came in 1981, when he moved to Houston, a city that would remain his home for decades to come. There, he joined a larger pipeline company, Transco, as president and chief operating officer. 
 The 1980's was a decade of crucial developments in Mr. Lay's life. It was then that he would marry his second wife, create Enron and forge ties to political leaders.
 In 1981, as his first marriage was failing, he followed a former boss to Transco, a pipeline company in Houston. He later married Linda Phillips Herrold, who had once been his secretary at Florida Gas.
 When Mr. Lay was at Transco, many of the pipeline industry's financial contracts at the time were built on a faith that oil prices would continue rising; the arrangements required the companies to buy a set percentage of a gas well's production, at preset, ever-increasing rates. 
 But when oil prices fell in the early 80's, the cost of gas dropped, too, leaving the pipeline companies on the hook for buying fuel at excessive prices. The problem hit Transco hard. So Mr. Lay corralled a group of Transco analysts, and urged them to play around with a new idea: setting up a spot market for gas, which would allow producers to sell the gas directly to customers -- taking the pipeline operators and distributors out of the middle.
 The idea was a rollicking success and alleviated Transco's financial bind. Mr. Lay emerged as something of a legend in the industry, a man who had transformed near certain disaster into a new business. Plenty of other companies sat up and took notice. 
 By May 1984, Mr. Lay was approached by a smaller rival, Houston Natural Gas, or H.N.G., about taking over the company as chairman and chief executive. He took the job, assuming the helm of a major corporation for the first time at the age of 42. 
 In less than a year, H.N.G. was on the path to becoming Enron. Internorth, an Omaha energy company, was fighting off a corporate takeover and, as a defensive maneuver, approached Mr. Lay about merging the two companies. Mr. Lay was intrigued, and on May 2, 1985, the merger of the two companies was announced. The merged company became loaded down with high-interest debt, used to finance the deal. 
 By 1986, after some internal struggles, Mr. Lay was fully in charge of the company, which by then had been rechristened Enron. 
 At Enron, Mr. Lay recruited Jeffrey K. Skilling, a McKinsey & Company consultant, in 1988 and the two began moving it away from its staid pipeline business and pushed it deeper into trading, first in natural gas and later in electricity.
 As he moved up the ranks of Houston's business elite, Mr. Lay also made connections in the city's deep political pool. He would establish a close relationship with Vice President George H. W. Bush, making large campaign contributions and heading critical committees. He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush's 1992 re-election committee and the chairman of the Republican National Convention held in Houston that year.
 His relationship with the Bush family was solidified in July 1990, when Mr. Lay helped to orchestrate the World Economic Summit in Houston at the request of the first President Bush. What had seemed to be an organizational mess before Mr. Lay stepped in proved to be an international showcase. 
 Mr. Lay continued his close contact with Washington -- remaining close friends with Mr. Bush, later golfing with President Bill Clinton, and eventually establishing a close relationship with George W. Bush, while he was the governor of Texas.
 When the younger Mr. Bush set off on his quest to win the 2000 presidential election, Mr. Lay served as a major player, playing host at big fund-raisers and contributing plenty of his own money to the effort. After Mr. Bush won the election, Mr. Lay was considered for the job of Treasury secretary, but was passed over. 
 Still, there was no disguising his close relationship to the Bush family; at the inauguration, the first President Bush and his wife flew to Washington with Mr. Lay on an Enron corporate plane. Mr. Lay's survivors, all of Houston, include his wife, Linda; a son, Mark; a daughter, Elizabeth Vittor; and three stepchildren, Robyn Lay, Beau Herrold and David Herrold.
 People who found themselves on the other side of Mr. Lay's goals and ambitions found him determined, strong-willed and effective. Curtis L. Hebert Jr., the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, frequently disagreed with Mr. Lay on how much and how quickly the nation should deregulate electricity markets.
 Neither convincedthe other, but Mr. Lay did not have to. His Republican colleagues frequently outvoted Mr. Hebert.
 ''Ken Lay was a charming fellow and always presented himself as such, even though we didn't agree,'' Mr. Hebert said. ''I think that was part of his success.''
 It was, perhaps, also part of his eventual failure.
 Bill Burton, a Texas lawyer who had known Mr. Lay for more than 10 years, compared Mr. Lay to Icarus, the figure in Greek mythology who was given wings made of feather and wax but fell into the sea when he flew too close to the sun.
 ''The Enron and Ken Lay stories are best told in an English literature class, or a classics class,'' Mr. Burton told an interviewer in 2002, ''where you are trying to explain what hubris is all about.''

HEADLINE: The Bulb Hunter

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
A few weeks ago Chris Wiesinger traveled to the most forlorn area of Lufkin, Tex., an old railroad town not too far from the border of Louisiana, and from the window of his Ford F-150 pickup almost immediately noticed a Zephyranthes grandiflora. At 25, he is rarely prone to effusion, but the sight of the flower caused him to smile in such a way that his whole face rippled, like a pool of water into which a pebble has been thrown. 
 The plant, more typically known as a rain lily, was blooming on a vacant lot surrounded by four bungalows, all of them boarded up. ''There's nothing else here,'' Mr. Wiesinger said as he walked toward the flowers. ''It never gets touched or cared for, and just look at it. Well, my goodness.''
Mr. Wiesinger makes a living finding pretty things in ravaged places. In 2004 he started the Southern Bulb Company with the aim of reintroducing flowers long out of vogue, committing himself exclusively to those that have ably asserted themselves against the particular cruelties of exceedingly hot weather for decades, even centuries. 
 While the pursuit of heirloom botanicals may have an air of elitism about it, Mr. Wiesinger goes after what one might think of as the Barbara Stanwycks of floriculture: resilient flowers without patrician connotation that thrive in areas largely lost to the economic revival of the New South. His is the world of old cotton towns, condemned properties, abandoned buildings and houses where torn sofas crest on bowed porch fronts. ''Most of the time you're not finding this stuff in the fancy neighborhoods around Dallas,'' he said, ''but in places where people couldn't afford to plant new things.''
 Drawing on a business plan he devised three years ago as a senior in Texas A&M's horticulture program, he collects the bulbs and propagates them on his small farm in Mineola, about two hours east of Dallas. Afterward, he distributes them to nurseries and over the Internet through his Web site, southernbulbs.com.
 His passion for reprising old varietals, some from Texas, some from the Southeast, has gained him considerable attention, earning him a spot on House & Garden's list of most important American tastemakers in April and turning him into a sought-after speaker on the garden club circuit.
 In many ways Mr. Wiesinger represents plant hunting's latest iteration. From the Victorian era through much of the 20th century, plant hunting was an adventurer's diversion, taking its practitioners to the mountains of the Congo or Peru to return home to the United States or Western Europe with the most exotic species. 
 Mr. Wiesinger is part of a more recent movement focused on retrieving plants domestically. Beyond that, though, he is breeding bulbs at a time when virtually all the people doing the breeding are still Dutch, explained Tom Christopher, a gardening writer and contributing editor for House & Garden. ''Chris is moving something that's been the preserve of a handful of collectors to common gardeners,'' he said. 
 A bulb bred in the Netherlands, or a plant imported from the Himalayas, will not necessarily thrive in a warm climate. ''We are conditioned to think of hardiness in terms of what can withstand cold weather,'' Mr. Christopher said, ''and not in terms of what will survive extreme heat and humidity.'' 
 Mr. Wiesinger's innovation is the specificity of his interest in supplying a gardening market whose needs have largely been ignored. The proliferation of nurseries with nationally distributed catalogs and retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's has contributed to a homogenized gardening culture that takes insufficient account of regional differences, said Jason Powell, an owner of Petals From the Past, a nursery in Jemison, Ala. ''Gradually,'' Mr. Powell said, ''we've seen fewer hardy, unusual flowering plants, fewer plants that are tried and true and tough.'' 
 The advantage of heirlooms generally is not merely that they speak to a cultural interest in nostalgia but that they tend to prosper efficiently, requiring less water, spraying and vigilance. ''These kinds of plants are like comfort food,'' explained Felder Rushing, a horticulturist in Jackson, Miss. ''They can be taken care of almost instinctually.''
 After spotting the rain lily in Lufkin, Mr. Wiesinger made his way to the nearest house with signs of human activity, knocked on the door and was greeted by a middle-age woman who told him the property belonged to a neighbor's brother. Mr. Wiesinger explained that he collected plants and sought to reach the owner for permission to dig up a bulb or two. The woman assured him that no one would mind, shared her own tale of misfortune -- her home was about to be condemned if she didn't make various improvements -- and finally asked if he might like to borrow a shovel.
 Mr. Wiesinger's endeavor relies on the notion that strangers will bestow him a great deal of generosity. When searching for bulbs he follows a strict protocol, which is to say that he never merely takes what he sees but almost always gets what he wants. If he spots a Mrs. James Hendry crinum, or a hoop petticoat daffodil outside an abandoned house somewhere in, say, Alabama, he calls the local tax office to get the name of the owner, contacts the person and explains his purpose. 
 In many cases the owner is far off, paying taxes on an old family home. ''It's just amazing how nice people are,'' Mr. Wiesinger said. He managed to track down the owner of one beat-up house, calling him in Victoria, in South Texas. ''I asked him if I could have a few bulbs and he said, 'Take all of them, and you can have the house too, if you want that.' ''
 In certain instances he feels obliged to pay for his inventory. A few months ago he pulled several thousand daffodil bulbs from the front yard of a mobile home in Wells, Tex., and paid $100 to the family living there. ''I try to always give something back,'' Mr. Wiesinger said. ''If it isn't money, then I'll plant something new in the place where I took something, or with gardeners I'll offer to barter something they might not have.'' Rarely is he ever asked for anything in return.
 Cemeteries play a big role in the life of some plant hunters. Over 25 years ago a group called the Rose Rustlers, also based in Texas, began taking cuttings from them in an effort to locate and resurrect various varieties of antique roses. Mr. Wiesinger often uses the plant life near gravestones as an indicator of what he can hope to find elsewhere in the area, but his own ethical code prohibits him from removing samples of plants or uprooting them. 
 ''Graveyard etiquette is a strange thing,'' he said. ''Some people will say: 'There are great flowers there! Dig them up!' But I don't know, I just can't help feeling that it is wrong.''
 An outdoorsman given to oxford-cloth shirts, Mr. Wiesinger possesses a demure geniality. If people seem eager to give him things, it is largely because he seems so nervous about asking. He spends most of his days traveling, passing much of his time in extended conversation with the people on whose front steps he happens to land. 
 After visiting Lufkin Mr. Wiesinger made a stop in nearby Alto to inquire about a hardy amaryllis. The woman in possession of it, Darline Lindsey, began to talk about her injured shoulder, a shower she was in the midst of installing, one of her relatives in Pennsylvania, a daughter who was or was not going to move to the area. 
 In Nacogdoches an hour or so later, a doctor he had met while lecturing, who had promised him some crinums, talked about his medical career in San Francisco, his affinity for the opera, his wife and the brain tumor she had suffered.
 ''That is a lot of what I do,'' Mr. Wiesinger said, back in the pickup. ''I listen. I listen to the stories about the bathroom renovation. Often people will be fixing lunch, and they'll ask me to stay, so I stay for lunch. Grandmothers want to fix me up with their granddaughters. I get that sometimes -- they'll say: 'Do you have a wife? I have this lovely granddaughter.' And I say, 'Thank you ma'am, now I need to be on my way.' 
 ''I dated someone for three months once but with me always on the road Well, anyways.''
 His own story, as he is well aware, has helped contribute significantly to his renown. Mr. Wiesinger runs the Southern Bulb Company out of a trailer with the help of three friends: Brad Gaultney and Ben Arcuni, both of whom were in the corps of cadets at Texas A&M with him, and Amanda George, a former White House intern for Laura Bush. The three men live together in a rented 250-square-foot cabin, near the farm he owns in Mineola, sleeping on mattresses on the floor. This summer a fourth roommate, Grant Cox, an intern at Southern Bulb, moved in. 
 Ms. George, a native of Mineola who said her great-great-grandfather was shot by Geronimo, lives down the road with her mother and is teaching herself Arabic. Every night the group convenes for dinner in the cabin, often eating the bass they catch in the lake out back. Because they live in a dry county and know no other single people their own age, they read Patrick O'Brian novels before bed and go to sleep early.
 The son of an oil-industry executive, Mr. Wiesinger grew up in Houston and California, where he attended Bakersfield Christian High School and played football. One day in his junior year, someone dropped off a few boxes of bare-root roses as a donation to the school. Mr. Wiesinger planted them and so began his interest in gardening. ''Anyone sent to detention had to come out and help me weed,'' he said.
 The Southern Bulb Company has yet to make a profit, and Mr. Wiesinger cannot afford to pay his friends much, he said. All in the group eagerly work six days a week, managing the farm, growing the bulbs, fulfilling orders and occasionally joining him in exploratory expeditions. Ms. George and Mr. Cox travel to fairs on weekends to promote the product. 
 If the focus seems unusually intense, it is because their interest in gardening is motivated less by aesthetic predilection than it is by philosophical belief. Mr. Wiesinger and his friends are all observant Christians who see gardening as a lesson in the politics of personal responsibility and the value of rewards deferred.
 ''You can't take a day off from life, and plants teach you that,'' Mr. Wiesinger said. ''There's always responsibility, with everything, always. A lot of people my age don't understand that, or they don't understand that a lack of their own responsibility will hurt someone.'' 
 Mr. Gaultney left a well-paying job at General Electric in Dallas to work for the Southern Bulb Company because cubicle life left him feeling empty, he said. After her White House internship was completed Ms. George, who has been paying off a credit card bill for her $1,900-a-month apartment in Washington, returned to Mineola to seek a job with health insurance. Southern Bulb offered it.
 ''The fact that Chris was so passionate and my age was very appealing,'' Ms. George said. ''But he also understood all the things I hold dear. We're all so conditioned to expecting things right when we want them, and gardening is a very different approach to life.''
 On his way to a friend's wedding in Austin one day, Mr. Wiesinger talked about some of his grander ambitions. The poverty he encounters in his work stirs his philanthropic impulses. He dreams of making enough money to buy old houses, create new gardens and reinvigorate depressed communities. 
 ''Ross Perot is from East Texas,'' he remarked. ''Ross Perot and Southern Bulbs team up to restore East Texas. Wouldn't that be cool?''

DATELINE: Tucson 

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, a group of researchers at the University of Michigan conducted a survey of hospitals and found that 4 out of 10 had fast food restaurants on their premises. Today, I'm afraid, that number can only have gone up -- judging by how often I and my colleagues cringe at the sight of new burger and pizza places in medical centers. 
 With the obesity epidemic in America getting more attention every day, nutrition experts tell us we exercise too little, eat too much and eat too much of the wrong kinds of food. What are the wrong kinds of food? We are constantly told to cut back on fat and sugar, but to my mind the greater problem is the processed food that, over the past 50 years, has increasingly displaced whole, natural food in the American diet. The proliferation of fast food is a glaring example of that change.
Modern food technology has transformed slow-digesting grains into snack foods made of pulverized, refined starches that, once eaten, quickly raise blood sugar, promoting insulin resistance and weight gain in genetically susceptible individuals -- most of us, unfortunately. We have invented high-fructose corn syrup, a cheap sweetener that is ubiquitous in soft drinks and most of the sweetened products in supermarkets and convenience stores. And we have processed oil-rich seeds into chemically altered fats that can promote inflammation, heart disease and cancer.
 All three of these products abound in fast food, one of America's worst contributions to world culture and cuisine. As the movie ''Super Size Me'' pointed out, the increasing availability and popularity of fast food is a major cause of obesity and declining health. How remarkable, then, that our hospitals would house fast food restaurants. Hospital administrators apparently like them as a source of revenue and a draw for employees, visitors and even patients. A year and a half ago, when the head of the Cleveland Clinic bravely tried to get rid of the McDonald's at that hospital, staff members and visitors made it clear they liked having the franchise close by. (McDonald's pointed to the 10 years left on its lease and refused to budge.)
 Expelling fast food from hospitals is an obvious step to better health, but suggest it and you run into the same tangle of inertia and apathy that has kept hospitals from serving patients appetizing and wholesome food -- and has instead allowed large food service corporations to put profit ahead of quality. I hold my profession responsible for much of the apathy. Nutrition is slighted in medical education. It is considered a ''soft'' subject akin to home economics, not worthy of the time and attention commanded by important fields like biochemistry and pharmacology.
 We must have nutritionally literate doctors, but getting fast food out of hospitals will also require the kind of grassroots activism that has removed sugary sodas and candy from vending machines in many schools. Doctors should model healthy lifestyles for their patients, and hospitals should be places of inspiration and education as well as centers for the treatment of disease. Fast food has no place in them.

HEADLINE: Company Town, Losing a Landlord, Seeks a Mate

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SCOTIA, Calif. 

 BODY:
There are three flags that fly over Main Street in this quainter-than-quaint town on the banks of the Eel River.
 The first two are easy: the flags of the United States and California. But the third is probably unknown to anyone without a working knowledge of the lumber industry, the spotted owl or the old logging camps of the Pacific Northwest.
It is the flag of the Pacific Lumber Company, which, as it happens, has owned the entirety of Scotia, all 500 acres of it, for 140 years: its homes, its streets, its shops and even its two churches. 
 Until now, that is. Late last year, bowing to economic realities and requests from employees, Pacific Lumber announced that it would sell almost all of its residential holdings in Scotia -- 275 houses -- to the employees who rent them, effectively putting an end to one of the last company towns in America. 
 The deal, of course, comes with a catch.
 While this lovely little town has one of everything -- a single supermarket, a single restaurant, and a single doctor -- what is more notable is what it lacks. There is no city council, no mayor, no governing structure whatsoever. As the only landlord in town, Pacific Lumber provides the town's security, sewage treatment, water, power, maintenance, and, in the winter, free firewood. 
 All of that will end, however, when Pacific Lumber sells, which could begin as soon as next year. And that is where the town across the river comes in. 
 One of the leading plans being debated is for the city of Rio Dell (pop. 3,174), to annex Scotia, a plan backed by Pacific Lumber. 
 It is easy to see the appeal for Rio Dell, which sits across a small green bridge from Scotia. Nestled into a wooded hillside off Highway 101, about 250 miles north of San Francisco, Scotia is both immaculate and surreal, equal parts Mayberry and Twin Peaks. Rows of perfect little houses sit on perfect little lawns, almost identical right down to the paint, which is limited, by a company rule, to pale greens, yellows, browns and blues. (The company president's wife picked out the colors.) Ducks and geese sleep in front yards, and children play safely in the sleepy streets. 
 The town also has assets, most of which may also be sold by Pacific Lumber. The main street has a movie theater, a museum and the Scotia Inn, a 1920's hotel that houses the town's only restaurant and bar. (It is currently closed for renovations.) Scotia has a new shopping center, a school for kindergarten through eighth grade, a community recreation center and a baseball diamond, all within walking distance of the giant lumber mill and power plant that hulk and hum next to the river. 
 And as all residents of Scotia, population 800, must be employees of or consultants for the company or work in the town's businesses, the populace has another enviable attribute: almost everyone, except retirees, has a job.
 ''I live exactly 47 paces from the firehouse,'' said John Broadstock, the volunteer fire chief for Scotia and the chief of plant security for Pacific Lumber. ''Or 22 when the alarm goes off.''
 Still, while the annexation plan is backed by most residents of the two towns, there is also anxiety, as with any arranged marriage. 
 For the townspeople of Scotia -- which, on its surface, has more in common with the 19th century than the 21st -- there is the worry that some of the modern problems of Rio Dell might migrate to their town. Rio Dell, which was hit hard by a recent slump in the lumber industry, ranks well below national averages in household income, property value and educational level. The unemployment rate for Humboldt County, the tree-rich region where Scotia and Rio Dell sit, is above California state averages. 
 ''This area has always been somewhat dependent on the lumber industry,'' said Graham Hill, who is both the acting city manager and the police chief for Rio Dell. ''And when they downsized, that really had an economic effect on this area.'' 
 Indeed, while downtown Scotia looks like something out of ''Brigadoon,'' Rio Dell's main drag is a little more rough around the edges, with gas stations and inexpensive restaurants and even a homeless person or two. And while Scotia has almost no serious crime, Rio Dell keeps its police officers -- all six of them -- busy with about 3,200 calls a year, Mr. Hill said. 
 Dan Dill, a Scotia resident and fifth-generation Pacific Lumber employee, said he was aware of the problems across the Eel River, but thought the deal was still a good idea. ''I'm not too worried,'' said Mr. Dill, 35. ''They've definitely had some rocky times, but I think they're really improving now.'' 
 For their part, some residents of Rio Dell also have questions about taking on new responsibilities. ''Everyone that I've ever heard anything from seems to have a positive attitude about it, with the caveat that 'You're looking into this, right?' '' Mr. Hill said. ''Because we're dealing with a big company with a lot of resources.''
 As that suggests, Pacific Lumber would like Rio Dell to take on Scotia, which costs the company more than $1 million a year to maintain. The company is footing the bill for two studies looking at the infrastructure of the town and the economic impact of the proposed annexation. 
 Kirk Gothier, a planning director who sits on the county commission, which is in charge of approving the deal, said the studies were necessary ''to assure Rio Dell they are not inheriting a can of worms'' in annexing Scotia. 
 ''While the town looks nice, the infrastructure is not as nice,'' Mr. Gothier said. ''It's tough to keep up the streets with lumber trucks running around.''
 Scotia is also old. The founders of Pacific Lumber bought the property the town sits on in 1863 and built the first bunkhouse two decades later. Originally called Forestville, the town was renamed Scotia in 1888, by which time it had a post office, a church and its own school district. 
 At the time, it was just one of hundreds of company-owned settlements nationwide, said Linda Carlson, author of ''Company Towns of the Pacific Northwest,'' who said the Western towns were driven by logging and mining and largely killed off by the Great Depression and commuting. During the Depression, most operations closed for at least a few years, Ms. Carlson said, adding, ''and by the time they came back, the people were gone.'' 
 But Scotia survived the Depression, as well as periodic fires, floods and environmental battles, which put new pressures on loggers to protect the natural habitats of endangered animals like the spotted owl and the coho salmon. After years of protests, in 1999, Pacific Lumber signed a landmark habitat conservation deal, the Headwaters agreement, which protected thousands of acres of ancient redwoods and squeezed the extent of logging operations.
 Pacific Lumber has also in recent years closed two local mills -- in Fortuna and Carlotta, Calif. -- as well as one mill in Scotia. Like the town of Scotia, the Fortuna and Carlotta mills are being considered for sale and development, while a brewery is considering moving into the shuttered Scotia mill. 
 The lumber company is owned by Maxxam, a Houston corporation, which posted a net loss of $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2006. Nonetheless, Robert E. Manne, the president of Pacific Lumber, said his main motivation in selling the town was keeping employees happy by making them homeowners, though he admitted that ''obviously, when we exit this and sell the homes, we get the money.'' 
 Mr. Manne said the company was doing everything it could to protect the town's special character. 
 ''But when it comes down to the nostalgia, in the mind of the employee, and the choice between history and them being able to have an affordable house and being able to meet the American dream?'' Mr. Manne said. ''The American dream wins.''
 Still, some town residents said they would miss knowing all their neighbors, not to mention the free firewood. ''Sure, everybody holds a little bit of that,'' said Mr. Broadstock, the fire chief. ''But we're in totally different times now. Things have got to change to survive.''

HEADLINE: Slow-Pitch Baseball as Hernandez Quells the Pirates Softly

BYLINE: By BEN SHPIGEL

 BODY:
Orlando Hernandez threw his first six pitches out of the strike zone last night. For a finesse pitcher like Hernandez, Jose Valentin did not consider that a good omen.
 ''It was kind of scary,'' Valentin said.
''But he knows what he's doing out there,'' he added. 
 Valentin's concerns did not last long. On a night when his teammates did not muster a hit after the first inning, Hernandez preserved their five-run outburst by baffling the Pittsburgh Pirates over seven shutout innings in the Mets' 5-0 victory at Shea Stadium.
 Jose Reyes's leadoff triple rattled the Pirates' starter, Kip Wells, and the Mets received big hits from Valentin (two-run double), Paul Lo Duca and Endy Chavez (each with run-scoring singles).
 ''I don't mean to be a killjoy, but I don't like to sit there in situations like that waiting for heartbreak,'' Mets Manager Willie Randolph said, lamenting the Mets' offensive falloff after the first inning.
 But if Randolph, as he has insisted over the last week, is viewing these games through the prism of the ''big picture,'' then the Mets' later offensive woes should not concern him.
 Their offense is still frighteningly potent, and they were missing David Wright, who received the day off. He should instead magnify the images of Hernandez mowing down an aggressive Pirates team and a gratefully inactive bullpen. 
 Since Hernandez threw seven innings last Friday against the Yankees, three of the Mets' past four starters had not lasted longer than five innings. The bullpen was in need of a rest. Hernandez gave them one, needing only Chad Bradford and Duaner Sanchez to throw an inning each in closing out the victory.
 ''It's good for tonight and good for the bullpen,'' Hernandez said. ''Everybody is happy.''
 Hernandez has allowed two runs in his last 14 innings, and after a sloppy beginning to his Mets career, is proving an adept No. 4 starter. He threw his curveball for strikes early in the count and set up his sneaky high-80's fastball with changeups slower than New York's interstate highway speed limit.
 The Pirates swung early, swung often and rarely made good contact. Their only four hits were singles, and not hard-hit ones at that.
 After his shaky first two hitters, Hernandez proceeded to throw first-pitch strikes to 17 of his next 25 batters. He allowed two walks and struck out seven in throwing a relatively economical 107 pitches (68 for strikes). 
 Wells matched him, and the Mets would have been in serious trouble had they not struck early.
 Wells, who missed two and a half months while recovering from surgery to repair a blocked artery in his right arm, allowed only three walks over his next five innings and struck out three. 
 This is still sort of a spring training phase for him, and he could be an intriguing option for pitching-starved teams if he continues regaining his stamina. He has great stuff, Lo Duca said, but crumbles when he puts a few runners on base. 
 Valentin echoed that thought, recalling their White Sox days. ''I played behind him for three years in Chicago, and he gets pretty nervous and shaky when he's in trouble,'' he said. 
 Reyes initiated the trouble when he tripled over the head of center fielder Jose Bautista, who was playing inexplicably shallow. He scored on Lo Duca's single, and Carlos Beltran followed with a walk. After Carlos Delgado struck out, Wells drilled Cliff Floyd in the right knee, loading the bases. 
 Floyd was already nursing an injury from Tuesday, when he collided with Reyes as they pursued a pop-up. Floyd had left with a mild concussion, but he said he felt well enough to play last night. ''Maybe it'll keep my head from moving so much when I swing,'' Floyd said. ''You know, take a positive from a negative.''
 With the bases loaded, Valentin cracked Wells's first pitch down the first-base line. First baseman Sean Casey was playing far from the bag and lunged, but never had a chance. The double scored Lo Duca and Beltran. Floyd scored on a wild pitch, and Valentin scored on Chavez's bloop single to center. 
 Wright received the day off yesterday because he will not be getting much time to rest during the All-Star Game break. He will be in Pittsburgh, participating in his first All-Star Game, and he said that he did not mind receiving a break. Randolph said he would probably offer days off to the other All-Star position players, Beltran, Lo Duca and Reyes, but added that they did not have to accept. 
 ''I've been scuffling a little bit recently,'' said Wright, whose last day off was May 26. ''This was something for us to step back and decide that it would be beneficial for me and the team.''

INSIDE PITCH
 Pedro MartInez was scheduled to throw practice pitches yesterday but chose not to, reducing the already minimal chance that he will pitch before the All-Star Game break. The Mets will decide Martinez's status after he throws in the bullpen today, and they will almost certainly place him on the disabled list to clear space for Mike Pelfrey to make his major league debut this weekend against the Florida Marlins.
 General Manager Omar Minaya and Willie Randolph continued to say that Pelfrey was ''in the mix'' with Jose Lima and Darren Oliver for starts tomorrow and one game of Saturday's doubleheader. John Maine will start the other game. ''If he's ready to come up, bring him in,'' Randolph said of Pelfrey. ''I love young talent.''
 Assuming the Mets choose between Oliver and Lima for the remaining start, it makes more sense to start Lima, a right-hander, because of the Marlins' mostly right-handed-hitting lineup.

HEADLINE: Intrepid Will Cross River for Refitting, Then Return to a Rebuilt Pier

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The aircraft carrier Intrepid, the military museum that has been docked on the Hudson River for 24 years, is scheduled to close on Oct. 1 and will be moved soon afterward to New Jersey for repairs and Staten Island for renovation.
 The final details are still subject to the nautical and political tides, but Bill White, the president of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, said yesterday that about a month after the museum closed, the carrier would be towed away from its mooring at Pier 86, West 46th Street and 12th Avenue, and is not expected to return for 18 months. 
 The museum's directors approved the general plan last week after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council agreed to provide a total of $17 million over the next two years for the overhaul of the carrier and the pier, Mr. White said. Gov. George E. Pataki pledged an additional $5 million in state economic development funds. In addition, $35.5 million in federal funds would raise the public financing for the project to $57.5 million, which should cover all the costs, he said.
 Governor Pataki and Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn are scheduled to hold a news conference about the overhaul plan aboard the carrier today.
 Arnold Fisher, a developer whose family has run the Intrepid Foundation for more than 20 years, said that without the money from the city and state, the Intrepid's future as a military museum was uncertain. 
 ''The ship goes back to the Navy if this didn't all come together,'' said Mr. Fisher, chairman of the private, nonprofit foundation. 
 Ms. Quinn said, ''My sense is that if the city hadn't stepped forward, that the Intrepid's days may very well have been numbered.'' She added, ''To have lost the Intrepid now would have sent a terrible message to the men and women who are fighting overseas.''
 Mr. Fisher said he would push hard for the pier to be rebuilt quickly so that the Intrepid can return for Fleet Week, the Navy's annual celebration here, in May 2008.
 While it is gone, New York City will be missing one of its more popular tourist attractions, the focal point for military celebrations and an emergency location for federal agencies in the event of a terrorist attack or natural disaster.
 Within hours of the Sept. 11 attacks, the F.B.I. asked for space on the carrier to house hundreds of its agents displaced from their offices downtown, Mr. White said. The museum remained closed for five weeks while the agents were there, he said.
 After Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast last summer, the Federal Emergency Management Agency asked to use the Intrepid in the event New York is hit by a hurricane or other disaster, Mr. White said. He said the Intrepid's executives have agreed to honor any such requests.
 ''We're an auxiliary to them,'' Mr. White said. ''We might not be the first place they go, but they know they can go here if necessary.''
 Last fall, when the Intrepid's officials were planning a new design for Pier 86, they considered a plan with two levels, the lower one being available for law enforcement agencies in an emergency, Mr. White said. That plan was scrapped in favor of a plan for a single-deck pier with red and blue stripes on its top. A Concorde supersonic transport jet, which now sits on a barge on the opposite side of the pier from the Intrepid, will be placed on the end of the rebuilt pier, he said.
 Intrepid officials considered trying to repair the pier without moving the carrier, but they decided that doing that could take five years and cost $100 million, Mr. White said. In the current plan, the work on the pier is expected to cost $35 million, most of which would come from $31 million that was appropriated by Congress in late 2004 for the Hudson River Park Trust, a city-state authority that controls the pier. Another Congressional appropriation of $4.5 million to the museum is pending, he said.
 The 900-foot-long carrier, which has not moved since it arrived in 1982, will go first to a dry dock in Bayonne, N.J., for up to 60 days of patching, scraping and repainting of the hull, Mr. White said. From there, it will be towed to a pier on Staten Island, where, at the invitation of the mayor, it will stay rent-free until Pier 86 has been rebuilt, he said.
 The carrier will not be open to the public while it is away. Instead, the foundation will use the time to make some improvements, including installing a mezzanine in the main exhibit hall and creating space for the public to get to the anchor chain, whose links weigh 270 pounds each. 
 Moving the 40,000-ton Intrepid will require six to eight tugboats with at least 5,000 horsepower each, Mr. White said. Getting the carrier out into the river will take about six hours and moving it gently to Bayonne four more, he said. 
 Before it can be moved, the silt that has piled up around the hull on the river bottom must be dredged. Mr. White said he hoped to receive approval for the dredging from the Army Corps of Engineers within two weeks. Harbor officials also have to approve moving the carrier. 
 The foundation's directors have their sights set on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, as the day to send the carrier down the river with fanfare, but the tides may not cooperate. Tide tables show that the river may be at its highest on the evening of Nov. 4, Mr. White said, making that the best time to try to dislodge the Intrepid. 
 ''If we can move it on another day, we're pretty confident we can make it the 11th,'' Mr. White said.

PERSON: Theodore Levitt

HEADLINE: Theodore Levitt, 81; Coined the Term 'Globalization' 

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Theodore Levitt, a former professor at the Harvard Business School credited with coining the term ''globalization'' and with championing the undervalued role of marketing in defining what businesses should make and sell, died June 28 at his home in Belmont, Mass. He was 81.
 The cause was prostate cancer, according to his son, Peter. 
 Mr. Levitt, known as Ted, gained widespread attention for his marketing insights in 1960, the year after he joined the Harvard faculty. He published an article called ''Marketing Myopia'' in The Harvard Business Review that criticized business executives for too narrowly defining what their companies did. He argued, for instance, that the railroad industry had lost customers to the airlines, trucking and auto industries in part because its top executives thought they were in the business of running trains instead of providing transportation.
 More than 1,000 companies ordered 35,000 reprints in the weeks after publication, a total that has since risen to 850,000 reprints, according to The Harvard Business Review. 
 His concept that business was becoming globalized, which Mr. Levitt defined as the changes in technology and social behaviors that allow multinational companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald's to sell the same products worldwide, first appeared in a 1983 Harvard Business Review article ''The Globalization of Markets.'' In his sweeping style, he said, ''Gone are accustomed differences in national or regional preferences.''
 Although unapologetic about exaggerating, Mr. Levitt would readily concede that companies actually had to balance persistent national cultural patterns with the general trend toward the embrace of global brands. Thus, he approved tactics like McDonald's supplementing its standard menus with local fare like vegan meals in India. 
 Mr. Levitt's zest for intellectual combat reflected his view of writing as an extension of his Harvard classroom, which he prowled as he lectured, occasionally tossing chalk for emphasis. ''His technique in class was to be provocative to get you to think,'' said Michael Berolzheimer, a former student, who credited a strategy session with Mr. Levitt as the roots of his company's successful marketing of DuraFlame fireplace logs. 
 In addition to writing eight marketing books and frequently consulting, Mr. Levitt was also editor of The Harvard Business Review from 1985 to 1990. Under his direction, the review began running shorter articles and cartoons in addition to its longer analytical articles and ''how to'' reviews of management practices. 
 Theodore Levitt was born March 1, 1925, in Vollmerz, Germany. His father, Boris, a cobbler, and his wife, Rachel, moved the family to Dayton, Ohio, a decade later. Mr. Levitt and Erma Fiste, who became the syndicated humor columnist Erma Bombeck, founded a newspaper together as fifth graders. Mr. Levitt was drafted into the Army before graduating and served in Europe during World War II.
 After the war, he worked as a sports writer for The Dayton Journal Herald, completed high school through a correspondence course, then enrolled at Antioch College, graduating in 1949. He earned his Ph.D. in economics from Ohio State University in 1951. He taught at the University of North Dakota and worked as an oil industry consultant in Chicago before moving to Harvard in 1959.
 Mr. Levitt is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Joan Levy; two sons, Peter, of Boston, and John, of Sarasota, Fla.; two daughters, Kathryn Wells, of Lexington, Mass., and Laura Levitt Beaudry, of Belmont, Mass.; six grandchildren; and two sisters, Ann Brenner, of Winston-Salem, N.C., and Dorothy Engelhardt, of Dayton, Ohio. A daughter, Frances Levitt Byington, and a brother, Albert, died before him. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 11, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An obituary and headline on Friday about Theodore Levitt, a marketing scholar at the Harvard Business School, referred incorrectly to the origin of the word globalization. While Mr. Levitt's work was closely associated with the idea of globalization in economics, and while he published a respected paper in 1983 popularizing the term, he did not coin the word. (It was in use at least as early as 1944 in other senses and was used by others in discussing economics at least as early as 1981.)

HEADLINE: Little Shift in Prices of Manhattan Apartments 

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Despite some signs of a weakening market, Manhattan's lofty real estate prices were little changed during the last quarter, according to a series of market reports released yesterday. 
 The reports showed that the number of apartments on the market rose and the number of sales fell during the second quarter of the year, a shift that suggests an increase in bargaining power for buyers rather than sellers.
But with the economy strong and apartments in demand, buyers so far have not been able to translate that market power into lower prices over all. According to one report, released by Prudential Douglas Elliman, average sales prices of Manhattan apartments were up to $1.39 million, an increase of 6.6 percent over the prices in the first quarter of this year and 5.2 percent above those in the same period a year ago. 
 ''People out there wondering whether it is the right time to buy should make a decision based on their lifestyle, not by trying to sharpshoot the market,'' said Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group. ''When sellers lose their patience they will allow the prices to go down. Right now there is a lot of demand to support prices.''
 She said that sales activity picked up toward the end of the quarter, in deals that had not closed and were not counted in the second-quarter statistics. 
 Each of the reports, using different methodologies, came up with different figures but similar explanations. While the Elliman report showed overall prices up modestly, a report by the Corcoran Group and another by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead showed a similar decline, by less than 5 percent. 
 In each case, prices of cooperative apartments, which are usually located in older apartment buildings with stricter rules, showed more strength than newer condominiums. Douglas Elliman reported that average sales prices of co-ops rose by 18 percent over the prior quarter, while Brown Harris Stevens showed a 7 percent increase, and Corcoran showed a 1 percent decline. Prices on two-bedroom co-ops rose sharply in several of the reports. 
 Condominium prices were weaker, but the declines were attributed to scores of sales in new condominiums with smaller, less expensive apartments. Last year, when average apartment prices set records, there were many multimillion-dollar sales in other new condominiums, like the Time Warner Center in Columbus Circle.
 Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Terra Holdings, which owns Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, noted, for example, that while condo prices over all fell by 15 percent from the previous quarter, prices for one- and two-bedroom condos rose somewhat.
 ''With the economy this strong, we are not going to see a huge swaying of the market, one way or the other,'' he said, but rather ''a gradual change in different segments of the market based on supply and demand.''
 Douglas Elliman reported that the average condo sales price fell by 1.9 percent to $1.45 million. It put the median price of a Manhattan condo at $990,000 and a co-op at $722,000. 
 Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Inc., the appraisal firm that prepared the Elliman report, said the inventory of 7,640 condos listed in the second quarter was up 10 percent over the previous quarter and 53 percent over a year ago. He found the number of sales was down 3.5 percent from the last quarter, often the slowest of the year, and 15 percent from a year ago.
 And despite the decline in condominium prices, he said that for the second month ever, condo sales made up more than half of all sales, even through there are far more co-ops in Manhattan. He attributed that to the intensive marketing campaigns for new condominiums.

HEADLINE: Mixed Response in Russia to North Korean Missile Launch

BYLINE: COMPILED by MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.

Today's Top Stories
The major newspapers focused extensively on the fallout from North Korea's early Wednesday missile launch. From Tuesday night through Wednesday morning North Korea test fired seven medium- to long- range missiles, including the Taepodong-2 long-range ballistic missile with a range of 6,000 kilometers. According to Japanese military authorities, Kommersant said, each of the rockets fired landed within Russian waters close to the cities of Nakhodka and Vladivostok. Nezavisimaya Gazeta said only two fell near Russian territory.
According to Rossiiskaya Gazeta, North Korea planned the test launching to have maximum resonance with the United States. The first missile took off shortly after the launch of the space shuttle Discovery. The fact that the event took place during United States' Independence Day celebrations was also significant, the newspaper said. Vremya Novostei added that President Bush was preparing to celebrate the occasion of his 60th birthday at the time. 
 The United States responded swiftly and directly, trying to forge international support for measures that would persuade North Korea to give up its weapons program. But the Russian response, despite the fact that the missiles fell within that country's territory, was confused and inconsistent. Several Russian papers claimed that for Moscow the launch was completely unexpected. Despite the relatively friendly relationship Moscow enjoys with Pyongyang, North Korean officials, Izvestia said, did not inform Russia of its intention to launch the rockets, their proposed trajectory, or their intended targets. Kommersant noted that Russia has no geosynchronous satellites capable of detecting a weapons launch at all times. Military officials first learned of the launch from the internet, Kommersant said. 
 Sergei Lysevski, a commandant in the Irkutsk garrison, told Kommersant that "I don't know where or what fell there, if it was successful or not, but our military forces are the best in the world." An unnamed person from the office of Astro-warfare, however, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that they were aware of the preliminary trajectory of the rockets. 
 Statements from Russian government officials were muted. Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said that "these launches did not do any damage to Russian security," Izvestia reported. Vremya Novostei quoted a Ministry of Foreign Affairs representative as saying that "the acts threaten free international shipping in the regions and were a violation of standard norms of missile testing." Another foreign affairs official, Mikhail Kamyanin, called the act a provocation and said that the launch "lessens the confidence level in the area," Rossiiskaya Gazeta reports. Nezavisimaya Gazeta points out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is handling the issue, while the defense ministry has been largely silent. 
 With the launch, Rossiiskaya Gazeta reported, North Korea has broken its 1999 agreement to place a moratorium on missile development and testing. In an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, the United States, Japan, Great Britain, and France called for sanctions against North Korea. Russia, despite, as Kommersant noted, nearly being hit by North Korean missiles, opposed such measures, as did China

IN OTHER NEWS

KOMMERSANT
EXPANDING WARTIME POWERS: In its third and final reading, the State Duma passed several amendments to federal laws aimed at broadening the legal basis for the war on terrorism. Among the more notable changes was an amendment giving the president the authority to make decisions on the use of special forces against terrorists operating in Russia. Another amendment would give the president control over the use of armed forces abroad without having to consult with the Federation Council as in the past. Norms governing press activities during antiterrorist operations were not substantially altered. Also unchanged by this round of hearings was an earlier amendment to the Codex on Criminal Procedure, allowing Russia to hold secret trials for severe crimes in the absence of the accused if he is present somewhere in the Russian Federation.

GAZETA
HIGH U.S. INTEREST RATES A CONCERN: The head of the Federal Service for Financial Markets, Oleg Vyugin, says that a United States interest rate of 10 percent would render the Russian financial market uncompetitive. Currently the American interest rate is hovering at 5.25 percent, but it has not always been that low. In the 1970's, rates frequently rose above 10 percent and even reached 19 percent in 1981. Russian market experts, however, see no major risk ahead. "Interest rates are not always a main factor in determining the level of investment," says Aleksei Trifonov, head of the analytical office of the Forex Club. "Often economic dynamics and political stability are most important." Ultimately, the newspaper said, Russia has no regime dedicated to financial politics and will remain at the mercy of the United States federal reserve.

VEDEMOSTI
NO PROGRESS ON RESOURCE LAW: Debate over the law "On Resources" has stalled. The law, which has been under discussion for over two years, will not come into effect for at least another year. At issue are norms governing the use of mines as well as those regulating government interference in competition for resources by specific companies. According to Torgul Bagirov, President of the Moscow International Oil Club, the latest edition of the law is beneficial to Gazprom and Rosneft. Currently, the law gives the government power to single handedly dissolve agreements with resource developers if they fail to meet a number of requirements. In addition, foreign investors involved in the development of "strategic" mines must hand over their control to Russian companies for compensation in cash or forge alliances with Russian companies, so that 50 percent of the company shares are in Russian hands.

VREMYA NOVOSTEI
 CHAIKA, PUTIN PRESS EUROPEANS OVER EXTRADITION: At the seventh European Conference of Procurator Generals held in Moscow Wednesday, Russia's new Procurator General, Yuri Chaika, proposed developing a mechanism to solve conflicts over extradition of accused criminals. In the last several years, European countries, especially Britain, have regularly ignored Russian demands for extradition of individuals, most notably the media magnate Boris Berezovskii; Akhmad Zakaev, emissary from the Chechen Republic; and top Yukos executives. Mr. Chaika promised that if unsuccessful, he would submit his proposal to the European Union. President Vladimir V. Putin also pressed this issue: "It is difficult for us to explain the refusal on the part of certain countries to extradite witnesses with involvement in terrorism," the president said.

HEADLINE: A Verdict Interrupted

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Alexei Barrionuevo contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 5 

 BODY:
In yet another bizarre twist to the Enron saga, the sudden death of Kenneth L. Lay on Wednesday may have spared his survivors financial ruin. Mr. Lay's death effectively voids the guilty verdict against him, temporarily thwarting the federal government's efforts to seize his remaining real estate and financial assets, legal experts say.
 ''The death of Mr. Lay in all likelihood will render the government's hard-fought victory null,'' said Christopher Bebel, a former federal prosecutor based here who specializes in securities fraud. 
But while the death of Mr. Lay may have limited government efforts in his criminal case, he remains the subject of civil lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission and former investors and Enron employees. Those lawsuits could still proceed, with the aim of taking control of some of Mr. Lay's remaining assets. 
 Mr. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the two chief executives who guided Enron through its rise and fall, were found guilty in May of fraud and conspiracy, and were free on bail pending their sentencing. 
 Just last Friday, the Justice Department had moved to seize a total of $183 million in assets belonging to the two men. 
 The bulk of those assets belong to Mr. Skilling. Five years ago, Mr. Lay's personal fortune was valued as high as $400 million. But a large part of that was tied to the value of Enron's stock, which is now virtually worthless.
 Mr. Lay testified at his trial that his net worth had declined to liabilities of $250,000, hampered by mounting legal bills and poor-performing investments. But his finances were apparently not so dire. According to legal documents filed at the federal courthouse here Friday, Mr. Lay had holdings in an investment account at Goldman Sachs valued at $6.3 million. 
 In addition, prosecutors said that Mr. Lay's full-floor luxury apartment in this city's River Oaks district had at least $1.5 million in value that could be forfeited to the United States. 
 The government's forfeiture effort ahead of the planned sentencing of Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling this fall, however, has been thrown into doubt, at least in relation to Mr. Lay's assets since the death of a criminal defendant before his sentencing and the appeal process may void the criminal case against him.
 ''Technically, he was found guilty, but that's extinguished as of today,'' said Joel M. Androphy, a prominent defense lawyer in Houston.
 A person involved in the government's action against Mr. Lay, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, said that Mr. Lay's death did not necessarily rule out proceeding with forfeiture actions, explaining, ''The family at the end of the day cannot sit on the fruits of the fraud.'' But, this person said: ''Even if the verdict is nullified, he paid for his actions with his life. That is more tragic.'' 
 The civil lawsuits against Mr. Lay may continue with efforts to seize his remaining assets, but even those moves may be complicated by his death since technically there was no conviction of Mr. Lay in the criminal case to rely upon as proof.
 Still, lawyers in the civil lawsuits may proceed against Mr. Lay's remaining assets through motions inspired by admiralty law. Under that law, the government or a private party can take action against property (or the ship) without going after the owner (the captain), legal experts said.
 Lawyers involved in the civil lawsuits, however, have already signaled that they were more interested in seeking compensation from institutions with deeper pockets that may have profited from improper dealings with Enron, like Wall Street investment banks, rather than focusing on Mr. Lay. Shortly after Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2001, Mr. Lay still had extensive real estate holdings, including three beachfront homes in Galveston, Tex., and two luxury homes in Aspen, Colo., one with five bedrooms and the other with four bedrooms. All those properties have been sold.
 Any life insurance policies bought by Mr. Lay may also be shielded from federal seizure efforts since state laws normally cover such payments. Any efforts to go after life insurance proceeds will be complicated, even if it can be argued that the original policies were acquired with ill-gotten gains.
 Attention now shifts to Mr. Skilling, Mr. Lay's protege. The sentencing of Mr. Skilling is now set for October instead of September at the request of his Los Angeles-based lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, who had a previously scheduled trial involving the rock band The Eagles.
 Mr. Skilling has more assets open to federal seizure than Mr. Lay had, including more than $50 million in cash and securities in a Charles Schwab account, $4.6 million in value at his 9,000-square-foot home in Houston and a condominium worth nearly $580,000 in Dallas, according to the government's forfeiture documents.
 Mr. Petrocelli said the government's efforts to go after the assets of his client and those of Mr. Lay illustrated an overreaching of federal authority. ''The issue is the recklessness and overzealousness with which the government has pursued the Enron case right from the inception,'' Mr. Petrocelli said.
 At issue, too, are Mr. Skilling's obligations to his lawyers. Mr. Petrocelli's law firm, O'Melveny & Myers, is awaiting more than $20 million of payments from its client for work carried out since last September. ''Jeff wants to pay his lawyers, to whom he owes tens of millions of dollars,'' Mr. Petrocelli said, ''and would like to satisfy family obligations including child support.''
 Lawyers for Mr. Lay may also be left with unpaid invoices. Michael Ramsey, a lawyer for Mr. Lay who experienced his own heart problems during the trial, declined to comment on Wednesday, saying simply, ''I am not well.''
 For Mr. Skilling, an even more pressing concern may be his sentencing before Judge Simeon T. Lake III, with sentencing experts saying Mr. Skilling could get more than 20 years of jail time in a medium- or maximum-security prison, in line with federal sentencing guidelines. If anything, Mr. Lay's death may warrant even harsher scrutiny of Mr. Skilling's crimes by Judge Lake.
 ''Jeff Skilling is quite literally the last man standing in the Enron scandal,'' said Robert A. Mintz, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: ENRON FOUNDER, AWAITING PRISON, DIES IN COLORADO

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Kenneth L. Lay, who as founder of the Enron Corporation rose to peaks of influence in business and politics, only to fall into disgrace amid scandal, died early yesterday morning in Aspen, Colo., while awaiting a judge's sentencing this fall that could have sent him to prison for decades. 
 Mr. Lay, who was 64 years old, died of coronary artery disease, according to Scott Thompson, the chief deputy coroner for Pitkin County, Colo. The finding was based on an autopsy completed late yesterday.
The death of Mr. Lay was a final, unexpected chapter in a complex personal and corporate drama that played out in public view in the years since Enron's collapse into bankruptcy in late 2001. It came at a time of enormous stress for Mr. Lay, who was awaiting sentencing after his conviction on May 25 on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy stemming from his actions in the weeks before Enron's demise. 
 As recently as Friday, federal prosecutors filed a motion in federal court in Houston seeking forfeiture of Mr. Lay's remaining assets, including his home in Houston, though his death means that the government may not be able to proceed with that motion. [Page C1.]
 While sorrowful and disbelieving about his conviction, according to people who have been in contact with him in recent days, Mr. Lay had been speaking of his probable prison sentence in almost a resigned manner. 
 ''He seemed healthy, peaceful, with a good and positive perspective on his life and his future,'' Dr. Stephen P. Wende, Mr. Lay's pastor at the First United Methodist Church in Houston, said of a meeting he had with the former Enron chairman on Thursday. ''He certainly didn't want to go to prison, but if that is where he went, he felt God could use him there.''
 Mr. Lay had been in Old Snowmass, Colo., staying with friends at the Pabst Ranch for the week with his wife, Linda. A call for emergency assistance came from the home at 1:41 a.m. yesterday, according to a statement from Joe DiSalvo, the director of investigations for the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Lay was taken to the Aspen Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:11 a.m. 
 With Mr. Lay's death, his successor at Enron, Jeffrey K. Skilling -- the man widely viewed as the brains behind Enron's rise, and who was convicted alongside Mr. Lay of fraud in their joint trial -- will stand alone before the court to be sentenced for his role in what has proved to be the greatest corporate scandal in American history.
 Before the scandal, Mr. Lay was a rags-to-riches story, a onetime Missouri farm boy ensconced among the elite of American business. He walked among presidents and political heavyweights, who turned to him for advice and campaign cash. He was a regular visitor to the White House under President Bush, who famously bestowed upon Mr. Lay the endearing nickname ''Kenny Boy.'' 
 But it all came unstuck as Enron spiraled toward bankruptcy, setting off a scandal that shook its hometown, Houston, and transformed the once-revered Mr. Lay into a reviled figure nationwide. 
 A corporation that had been thought to represent the best of business was revealed instead to be the worst, infused with both criminality and incompetence. What had seemed to be unstoppable financial power was exposed as the product of accounting manipulations and deceit. And Mr. Lay himself was transformed from a man worth hundreds of millions of dollars to someone near financial ruin.
 While his criminal acts did not occur until the final months before Enron's downfall, Mr. Lay became the symbol of the scandal, condemned as a liar and a cheat. Through it all, and to his dying day, Mr. Lay maintained his innocence, portraying himself as an honest, hard-working man who had been railroaded by prosecutors and deceived by a dishonest chief financial officer at Enron, Andrew S. Fastow, whom he blamed for the company's demise. 
 The country house where local residents said Mr. Lay was staying is about 15 miles and a universe away from the glitz of Aspen. Dominated by a horse pasture and a corral in front, the relatively modest wooden house, on a rural winding road, had rusting farm implements in the pasture and faded gray outbuildings off the gravel driveway.
 A county sheriff's deputy barred visitors from entering the yard. But a woman who said her name was I. V. Pabst came out to speak with a reporter, and to praise Mr. Lay. ''Ken Lay was a wonderful, kind-hearted generous man,'' she said. ''We are all suffering from a broken heart.'' She declined to say more. Ms. Pabst owns the Pabst Ranch and is the great-granddaughter of the founder of the Pabst Brewing Company.
 Ms. Kimberly, the family spokeswoman, confirmed in a statement that Mr. Lay had died. ''The Lays have a very large family with whom they need to communicate, and out of respect for the family we will release further details at a later time,'' Ms. Kimberly said in the statement.
 There had been no known warnings of heart problems, Ms. Kimberly said, and Mr. Lay had continued exercising every day, a habit he developed years ago. While Mr. Lay showed signs of physical and emotional exhaustion during the trial in the spring, in recent weeks, friends said, he was looking healthier than they had seen him in years. 
 It is not unprecedented, however, for the stress of trial to contribute to the death of white-collar defendants. In 1988, for example, David W. C. Clark, a New York lawyer convicted in an insider trading case, died from chronic alcoholism just days before he was scheduled to be sentenced. 
 Mr. Lay was a short, soft-spoken man with courtly manners who could also show flashes of anger and impatience -- a combative side that emerged while he testified in his own defense, damaging his case. He said he planned to appeal his conviction. He was awaiting his sentencing for 10 felonies, including six charges relating directly to his work at Enron and four counts of bank fraud involving his personal finances. Now, his case has instead come to an unexpected end that has left some of his former colleagues stunned. 
 ''I think it's tragic,'' said Mark Palmer, Enron's former spokesman, who said he had not spoken to Mr. Lay since 2002. ''But Ken was a spiritual guy and he believed the Lord has a plan for him. If this is it, I hope he's at peace.'' 
 Mr. Lay was born in 1942, the middle child of a deeply religious but struggling Missouri family. The first turning point in Mr. Lay's life came in his sophomore year at the University of Missouri, when he signed up for a course in introductory economics. He was fascinated by theories of free markets, and abandoned his plans to attend law school in favor of pursuing a career in business. 
 In the late 1960's, he began a career in the energy business that was interrupted by a stint in the Navy and one at the Federal Power Commission, a federal agency in Washington. 
 In the 1980's, while back in the energy business, Mr. Lay established a reputation as an intellectual dynamo in an industry not known for its cutting-edge thinking, which led to a job at age 42 running a company that would become Enron when Mr. Lay helped engineer the merger of two pipeline companies, Houston Natural Gas and Internorth, an Omaha energy company. 
 Under Mr. Lay's direction, Enron embarked on an ambitious expansion that secured him a place at the front table among America's top businessmen. 
 But, it would later become obvious, Enron's finances were not anywhere as strong as the company's reported financials made them appear. 
 Throughout the 1990's, Enron slowly became addicted to accounting machinations allowed under a technique known as structuredfinance. This legitimate mechanism is used by most large companies to help diversify risk, bringing in outside investors and shifting assets and debt to off-books entities.
 By 1998, Enron had voluminous off-books partnerships set up by Mr. Fastow, its chief financial officer. But Mr. Fastow had begun using the vehicles years before to direct corporate cash to himself and a few trusted allies -- without the knowledge of Mr. Lay, according to Mr. Fastow's testimony. 
 Mr. Lay was aware of many of the off-books entities, if not their full purpose. And in 1999, he along with the Enron board approved of the creation of a special fund called LJM, which was headed by Mr. Fastow and was expected to be used for structured finance deals. 
 Instead, LJM and its successor, LJM2, became vehicles of crime, used to disguise the financial rot underpinning Enron's veneer of success. 
 In early 2001, Mr. Lay turned the chief executive reins of the company over to Mr. Skilling, although he retained the title of chairman. But in August of that year, Mr. Skilling resigned unexpectedly from the company and Mr. Lay returned to his old job. 
 The resignation of Mr. Skilling set off suspicions that something was deeply wrong within Enron, but Mr. Lay set himself up in his long-familiar role of corporate cheerleader, assuring employees and investors that everything was fine. In making those statements, the jury found at his criminal trial, Mr. Lay lied to the public, not revealing internal concerns he was hearing about the company's shaky financial condition and questionable accounting. 
 In his statements to investors, Mr. Lay assured employees that he was purchasing Enron stock -- a claim that was true only in the most limited sense. While he had purchased some shares in the open market, for months Mr. Lay had been selling far more stock back to the company and using most of the proceeds to pay down bank loans. The complex transactions resulted in about $100 million being transferred from Enron to Mr. Lay, and ultimately to his lenders. 
 The questions about Enron's financial underpinnings left the company reeling, and the company filed for bankruptcy in December 2001. In addition to Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling, 22 others have either pleaded guilty or been convicted of charges related to the company's failure.
 The collapse, which cost investors billions and thousands of employees their jobs and retirements, devastated Mr. Lay, according to people who knew him. ''He felt very keenly the pain of those who had lost livelihoods, life savings and lifelong jobs at Enron,'' said Dr. Wende, Mr. Lay's pastor. ''The man I saw carried that with him at a deep emotional level.''

HEADLINE: Few Good Choices in North Korean Standoff

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
The Bush administration has tried to ignore North Korea, then, reluctantly, to engage it, and then to squeeze its bankers in a manner intended to make the country's leader, Kim Jong Il, personally feel the pinch. 
 Yet none of these steps in the past six years has worked. So now, after a barrage of missile launchings by North Korea, President Bush and his national security advisers found themselves on Wednesday facing what one close aide described as an array of ''familiar bad choices.''
The choices have less to do with North Korea's newest missile -- which, as Mr. Bush pointed out on Wednesday, ''didn't stay up very long and tumbled into the sea'' -- than with the bigger question of whether the president is prepared to leave office in 2009 without constraining an unpredictable dictator who boasts about having a nuclear arsenal. 
 ''We're at the moment when the president has to decide whether he wants an unconstrained, nuclear North Korea to be part of his legacy,'' said Jonathan D. Pollack, a professor of Asian and Pacific studies at the United States Naval War College who has spent much of his career studying North Korea and its improbable strategies for survival. 
 ''Until now, the attitude has been, 'If the North Koreans want to stew in their own juices, let them,' '' Mr. Pollack said. ''But it's becoming clear that Mr. Bush may leave office with the North Korean problem much worse.'' 
 Dealing with North Korea has frustrated every president since Truman. But it has proved particularly vexing for Mr. Bush because his administration has engaged in a six-year internal argument about whether to negotiate with the country or try to plot its collapse -- it has sought to do both, simultaneously -- and because America's partners in dealing with North Korea each have differing interests in North Korea's future. 
 On Wednesday, rejecting pressure from the Bush administration, China and Russia said they would not get behind an American drive to bring sanctions against North Korea, saying they favored less punitive actions. [Page A10.]
 It was the latest disappointment in a string of attempts to enlist China to help moderate the North. Still, answering questions on Wednesday, Mr. Bush expressed no interest in dropping his objections to one-on-one talks with the North, a government he once said he ''detests.''
 Another alternative for Mr. Bush would be take a hard line that might risk an escalation of the half-century-old confrontation between the United States and North Korea. But such a tack is now complicated by the widespread assumption that even if the North does not have the ability to launch a nuclear weapon, it now probably possesses enough extra nuclear fuel that it may be tempted to sell some to a terrorist group or another state. 
 That is Mr. Bush's biggest concern, and late last year the National Security Council ordered a study of the likelihood that Mr. Kim, in his effort to seek attention or gain negotiating leverage, would threaten to do it. The results, according to a senior administration official who would not speak for attribution about intelligence matters, were inconclusive. 
 But so far the North has only dared to offer reminders, like the test firings while Americans were celebrating the Fourth of July, that it possesses weapons that could destroy Seoul or threaten Japan, including American forces based there. The launchings were only the second time that North Korea had tested an intercontinental-range missile that, depending on whose numbers one believes, could eventually hit the United States. (The last such test launching was in 1998, and as Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies put it Wednesday, ''both failed dismally.'')
 To many experts, the missile tests fit into a pattern: whenever Mr. Kim has concluded that he was not getting attention to his demands, he has staged a crisis. His father, Kim Il Sung, did so in 1994, and won an agreement from the Clinton administration that later fell apart. Kim Jong Il did so in 2003, as American troops were flowing toward Iraq, when North Korea threw out international inspectors and reprocessed the 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods into what the Central Intelligence Agency says is enough bomb-grade material for six or more weapons. 
 At that time, top Pentagon officials briefed Mr. Bush on his military options, including bombing the North's nuclear facilities. ''It didn't take very long,'' one official deeply involved in that briefing said, ''because it was pretty clear there wasn't an acceptable military option -- or at least, a risk anyone was willing to take.''
 But Mr. Bush came to office appearing to have already determined that he would not negotiate, either. He often said that he distrusted North Korea's government and detested how Mr. Kim treated the North Korea people. In the first months of his presidency, he refused to endorse South Korea's ''sunshine policy'' of luring North Korea out of its shell with economic incentives. Yet the isolation strategy ultimately failed: North Korea kept producing plutonium.
 Mr. Bush then reversed course, reluctantly agreeing to engage with the North Koreans at a distance, through six-nation talks convened by China and joined by Japan, South Korea and Russia. An agreement in principle was reached in September, calling for disarmament for security guarantees and eventual aid, but with no timetable. Even before the ink was dry, the North Koreans were interpreting it differently than the other signatories were.
 Mr. Bush has most recently bet that China would eventually tire of the North Korean antics and enforce some discipline. Mr. Bush repeated that he and Jiang Zemin, China's former leader, had agreed that a nuclear North Korea was ''unacceptable.'' But the reality, administration officials acknowledge, is that China fears a collapsed and chaotic North Korea more than it fears a nuclear-armed North Korea. 
 That could change now. The Chinese warned the North Koreans not to fire the missiles; the fact that Mr. Kim dismissed that warning is bound to anger China's leaders.
 But so far, Mr. Bush has not been able to harness his partners into coordinated pressure on the North. If that changes soon, at the United Nations Security Council and around the world, it could be that the president will finally have a way forward.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Neighbors Condemn Missile Tests, but Differ on What to Do

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI and JOSEPH KAHN; Norimitsu Onishi reported from Tokyo for this article, and Joseph Kahn from Beijing. Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 5 

 BODY:
Japan, South Korea and China on Wednesday all condemned North Korea's missile tests, but regional analysts doubt the launchings will bridge big gaps between the regional powers on how to handle North Korea.
 The military exercise strained relations between North Korea and all its neighbors. Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, scoffed at stern warnings from Washington and Tokyo, which have favored a tougher line, and embarrassed Seoul and Beijing, which have used economic and diplomatic incentives to lure the North out of isolation.
But when Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the lead negotiator with North Korea, returns to the region this week, he will find that many of the same rifts that existed before continue to complicate the task of forming a united front. He will also find a region that remains in the throes of disputes that pit Japan against China and South Korea, and that are unrelated to North Korea. 
 Japan took the hardest line on Wednesday, saying it is considering imposing economic sanctions, possibly cutting off a significant source of cash for North Korea by cracking down on money transfers from Japan. It also banned the North Korean Mangyongbong-92 ferry -- the only regular link between Japan and North Korea and a conduit for transferring cash and supplies to the North -- from entering its ports for six months.
 ''We will consider every type of sanctions possible,'' said Shinzo Abe, Japan's chief cabinet secretary and a leading candidate to succeed Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. 
 South Korean officials indicated that they would withhold 500,000 tons of rice and 100,000 tons of fertilizer the North had sought in aid this year. South Korea has already delivered 350,000 tons of fertilizer this year.
 But South Korean officials made it clear they would maintain their basic efforts to engage North Korea through economic cooperation, a policy exemplified by a joint industrial complex in Kaesong, North Korea.
 China, North Korea's most significant ally, took the softest line of the three major regional powers, calling for calm from all sides.
 ''We are seriously concerned about the events that have occurred,'' Liu Jianchao, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a statement.
 Japan toughened its foreign policy after North Korea launched a midrange missile, the Taepodong 1, over its territory in 1998. Japanese analysts said the launchings early Wednesday, and North Korea's growing defiance in the face of international condemnation, would further harden Japan's position.
 ''This time, it's more serious than in 1998,'' said Yasunori Sone, a professor of politics at Keio University. ''North Korea is challenging everybody this time, even China and South Korea. I think the consequences in Japan will be even greater.''
 The rising threat from North Korea, Japanese analysts said, is likely to help Japan's political leadership persuade the Japanese public of the need to strengthen military ties with the United States, transform Japan's Self-Defense Forces into a full-fledged military and eventually revise Japan's pacifist Constitution.
 These changes could further strain Japan's relations with South Korea and China, which suffered under Japanese militarism and remain sensitive to any signs of its revival. Disputes with China and South Korea over territory and Mr. Koizumi's annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, where Japanese war criminals are enshrined, have already undermined Japanese influence in the region, said Kiichi Fujiwara, a professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo.
 ''Our relations with South Korea and China are at their worst, and without their support we can't do anything against North Korea,'' Mr. Fujiwara said. ''If we want to be tough against North Korea with economic sanctions, we need the support of China and South Korea.''
 It is unlikely, regional analysts said, that China and South Korea, the North's two biggest trading partners, would agree to sanctions. Both countries have increased their economic activities with the North in recent years, partly to prevent it from collapsing and destabilizing the region, and partly to encourage the North to adopt economic reforms.
 Yoon Duk Min, a regional security specialist at the government-affiliated Institute for Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, said South Korea, which has been accused of being soft on the North, would adopt a relatively tough stance toward the North in the short term.
 ''There will be increasing doubts about the government's policy of engagement -- criticism that we have been betrayed by North Korea by these launchings,'' Mr. Yoon said.
 But Mr. Yoon and other experts said South Korea was likely to resume its engagement policy after some period despite pressure from the United States and Japan to join them in an economic squeezing of the North. A consensus has taken root in South Korea that a conflict with the North should be avoided at all costs, and that improving relations remains the only feasible option even if that causes difficulties in the South's alliance with the United States.
 ''Whatever happens, the current government, or whatever government that follows it, will find it very difficult to discard the engagement policy,'' said Hamm Taik Young, a political scientist at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. ''The cold war is over. We can't live on by branding North Korea as the enemy. North Korea is there. We have to deal with it.''
 Political analysts said the tests were a slap in the face for Beijing, though many expect it to still seek middle ground between North Korea and the United States and Japan.
 ''This is a very frustrating development for our leaders, but the basic strategy will probably stay in place,'' said Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at People's University in Beijing. ''They will not abandon their patient approach in seeking a long-term, peaceful solution.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Strong Measures To Warn the North Koreans

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and WARREN HOGE; William J. Broad contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5 

 BODY:
The Bush administration tried Wednesday to build international support for stronger measures, including sanctions, to persuade North Korea to abandon its weapons program after it fired a seventh missile into the Sea of Japan. But China and Russia resisted, saying they favored less punitive actions. 
 ''I strongly believe that it is much more effective to have more than one nation dealing with North Korea,'' President Bush said a few hours after the North followed its six-missile barrage of the previous day with a seventh missile launching. 
''I view this as an opportunity to remind the international community that we must work together to convince the North Korean leader that he must give up his weapons program,'' Mr. Bush added.
 The unsuccessful launching of a new missile called the Taepodong 2 on Wednesday in the face of repeated international warnings effectively scrapped a moratorium that North Korea had observed since 1998. A successful test of the long-range missile would have represented a significant expansion of North Korea's ability to make advanced weapons.
 Bush administration officials suggested that more tests might be on the way: Stephen J. Hadley, the president's national security adviser, said that the North had initially rolled around 10 missiles up to the launchpads, meaning that maybe three or four more could be ready soon, though it was unclear what types they might be. And officials turned their attention to persuading China, and to a lesser extent Russia, to put pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
 At the United Nations, Japan circulated a proposal for a Security Council resolution condemning the missile tests, urging North Korea to return immediately to talks on its nuclear program and threatening sanctions if it did not move to irreversibly dismantle the nuclear program. 
 China and Russia indicated that they would prefer a blander, nonbinding ''presidential statement'' from the Council, with no threat of punishment against the already isolated North Korean government. 
 Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, counseled against ''whipping up emotions too much,'' and Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, noted that the Council had issued a presidential statement rather than a resolution in 1998, when the North last tested a missile outside its own territory. 
 But American officials, from Mr. Bush on down, lobbied the Chinese publicly and privately to come down hard against the North Koreans. In an unusually public challenge to Beijing, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, Washington's main negotiator with North Korea -- which calls itself the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- presented the missile launchings as an act of defiance. 
 ''China said, 'Don't do it, and the D.P.R.K. went ahead and did it,' '' Mr. Hill said. ''Now we need for China to be very firm about what's acceptable behavior and what's not acceptable behavior.''
 Administration officials would like China to at least back a Security Council resolution condemning the firing of the missiles, a symbolic step that could set up punitive sanctions if North Korea then followed up with more missile tests. 
 Beyond that, Washington may also try to persuade China to cut off oil shipments to the North for a few days, something Beijing has done in the past when it was annoyed with the North.
 Mr. Hill spoke before leaving for Beijing, where he is to meet with his counterparts in the dormant six-party talks on the North Korean nuclear program. The North has boycotted the talks since last September, when the United States cracked down on banks and North Korean companies suspected of counterfeiting dollars and laundering money. 
 About a month ago, a day after the United States offered to hold direct talks with Iran over its own nuclear program, North Korea invited Mr. Hill for direct talks in Pyongyang, the capital. That offer was immediately rebuffed by the White House, which insisted that the North instead return to the deadlocked talks, at which China, South Korea, Japan and Russia are the other participants.
 On Wednesday, administration officials were still insisting that the only forum for a discussion with North Korea was the six-party talks. ''This is now not a matter of the United States and North Korea,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said. ''It is really a matter of the region saying to North Korea that is has to change its behavior.''
 Of the seven missiles fired, United States intelligence officials have focused most of their attention on the single long-range missile, the Taepodong 2, which American spy satellites had been watching on its launching pad for more than a month. 
 It is designed to be able to reach Alaska, and perhaps more distant locations on the West Coast of the United States, but American officials who tracked its launching said it had fallen into the Sea of Japan before its first stage burned out.
 The other missiles fired appeared to be a mix of short-range Scud-C missiles and medium-range Rodong missiles of the kind based on old Soviet designs that North Korea has sold to Iran, Pakistan and other countries.
 ''If one missile is going to get your attention, then seven will really get your attention,'' said Robert Einhorn, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation under President Bill Clinton. ''It's kind of an 'in-your-face, America, we're really going to break this moratorium in a big way.' ''
 Administration officials cautioned against drawing much cheer from the Taepodong 2's failure, suggesting that North Korean scientists might have been able to glean knowledge from the launching for future use.
 Rocket experts also attached little significance to the trouble that the missile had, saying that in general, new models often blow up in flight tests before engineers can find and fix all the problems. 
 ''It's a trial and error process,'' said Charles P. Vick, an expert on the North Korean rocket program at GlobalSecurity.org, a research group based in Alexandria, Va. ''They're trying to build and test to wring out the problems. It's the process any nation has to go through.''

HEADLINE: The Myth of the New India

BYLINE: By Pankaj Mishra. 
Pankaj Mishra is the author of ''Temptations of the West: How to Be Modern in India, Pakistan, Tibet and Beyond.''

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
''INDIA is a roaring capitalist success story.'' So says the latest issue of Foreign Affairs; and last week many leading business executives and politicians in India celebrated as Lakshmi Mittal, the fifth richest man in the world, finally succeeded in his hostile takeover of the Luxembourgian steel company Arcelor. India's leading business newspaper, The Economic Times, summed up the general euphoria over the event in its regular feature, ''The Global Indian Takeover'': ''For India, it is a harbinger of things to come -- economic superstardom.''
 This sounds persuasive as long as you don't know that Mr. Mittal, who lives in Britain, announced his first investment in India only last year. He is as much an Indian success story as Sergey Brin, the Russian-born co-founder of Google, is proof of Russia's imminent economic superstardom. 
In recent weeks, India seemed an unlikely capitalist success story as communist parties decisively won elections to state legislatures, and the stock market, which had enjoyed record growth in the last two years, fell nearly 20 percent in two weeks, wiping out some $2.4 billion in investor wealth in just four days. This week India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, made it clear that only a small minority of Indians will enjoy ''Western standards of living and high consumption.''
 There is, however, no denying many Indians their conviction that the 21st century will be the Indian Century just as the 20th was American. The exuberant self-confidence of a tiny Indian elite now increasingly infects the news media and foreign policy establishment in the United States. 
 Encouraged by a powerful lobby of rich Indian-Americans who seek to expand their political influence within both their home and adopted countries, President Bush recently agreed to assist India's nuclear program, even at the risk of undermining his efforts to check the nuclear ambitions of Iran. As if on cue, special reports and covers hailing the rise of India in Time, Foreign Affairs and The Economist have appeared in the last month. 
 It was not so long ago that India appeared in the American press as a poor, backward and often violent nation, saddled with an inefficient bureaucracy and, though officially nonaligned, friendly to the Soviet Union. Suddenly the country seems to be not only a ''roaring capitalist success story'' but also, according to Foreign Affairs, an ''emerging strategic partner of the United States.'' To what extent is this wishful thinking rather than an accurate estimate of India's strengths? 
 Looking for new friends and partners in a rapidly changing world, the Bush administration clearly hopes that India, a fellow democracy, will be a reliable counterweight against China as well as Iran. But trade and cooperation between India and China is growing; and, though grateful for American generosity on the nuclear issue, India is too dependent on Iran for oil (it is also exploring developing a gas pipeline to Iran) to wholeheartedly support the United States in its efforts to prevent the Islamic Republic from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The world, more interdependent now than during the cold war, may no longer be divided up into strategic blocs and alliances.
 Nevertheless, there are much better reasons to expect that India will in fact vindicate the twin American ideals of free markets and democracy that neither Latin America nor post-communist countries -- nor, indeed, Iraq -- have fulfilled.
 Since the early 1990's, when the Indian economy was liberalized, India has emerged as the world leader in information technology and business outsourcing, with an average growth of about 6 percent a year. Growing foreign investment and easy credit have fueled a consumer revolution in urban areas. With their Starbucks-style coffee bars, Blackberry-wielding young professionals, and shopping malls selling luxury brand names, large parts of Indian cities strive to resemble Manhattan. 
 Indian business tycoons are increasingly trying to control marquee names like Taittinger Champagne and the Carlyle Hotel in New York. ''India Everywhere'' was the slogan of the Indian business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year.
 But the increasingly common, business-centric view of India suppresses more facts than it reveals. Recent accounts of the alleged rise of India barely mention the fact that the country's $728 per capita gross domestic product is just slightly higher than that of sub-Saharan Africa and that, as the 2005 United Nations Human Development Report puts it, even if it sustains its current high growth rates, India will not catch up with high-income countries until 2106.
 Nor is India rising very fast on the report's Human Development index, where it ranks 127, just two rungs above Myanmar and more than 70 below Cuba and Mexico. Despite a recent reduction in poverty levels, nearly 380 million Indians still live on less than a dollar a day.
 Malnutrition affects half of all children in India, and there is little sign that they are being helped by the country's market reforms, which have focused on creating private wealth rather than expanding access to health care and education. Despite the country's growing economy, 2.5 million Indian children die annually, accounting for one out of every five child deaths worldwide; and facilities for primary education have collapsed in large parts of the country (the official literacy rate of 61 percent includes many who can barely write their names). In the countryside, where 70 percent of India's population lives, the government has reported that about 100,000 farmers committed suicide between 1993 and 2003. 
 Feeding on the resentment of those left behind by the urban-oriented economic growth, communist insurgencies (unrelated to India's parliamentary communist parties) have erupted in some of the most populous and poorest parts of north and central India. The Indian government no longer effectively controls many of the districts where communists battle landlords and police, imposing a harsh form of justice on a largely hapless rural population. 
 The potential for conflict -- among castes as well as classes -- also grows in urban areas, where India's cruel social and economic disparities are as evident as its new prosperity. The main reason for this is that India's economic growth has been largely jobless. Only 1.3 million out of a working population of 400 million are employed in the information technology and business processing industries that make up the so-called new economy. 
 No labor-intensive manufacturing boom of the kind that powered the economic growth of almost every developed and developing country in the world has yet occurred in India. Unlike China, India still imports more than it exports. This means that as 70 million more people enter the work force in the next five years, most of them without the skills required for the new economy, unemployment and inequality could provoke even more social instability than they have already.
 For decades now, India's underprivileged have used elections to register their protests against joblessness, inequality and corruption. In the 2004 general elections, they voted out a central government that claimed that India was ''shining,'' bewildering not only most foreign journalists but also those in India who had predicted an easy victory for the ruling coalition. 
 Among the politicians whom voters rejected was Chandrababu Naidu, the technocratic chief minister of one of India's poorest states, whose forward-sounding policies, like providing Internet access to villages, prompted Time magazine to declare him ''South Asian of The Year'' and a ''beacon of hope.'' 
 But the anti-India insurgency in Kashmir, which has claimed some 80,000 lives in the last decade and a half, and the strength of violent communist militants across India, hint that regular elections may not be enough to contain the frustration and rage of millions of have-nots, or to shield them from the temptations of religious and ideological extremism. 
 Many serious problems confront India. They are unlikely to be solved as long as the wealthy, both inside and outside the country, choose to believe their own complacent myths.

PERSON: Pierre A. Rinfret

HEADLINE: Pierre A. Rinfret, 82, Dies; Lost to Cuomo in '90 Race

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Pierre A. Rinfret, an economist and adviser to several presidents who in 1990 recorded the worst showing by a Republican candidate for governor in New York's history, losing resoundingly to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, died on June 29 on Nantucket, in Massachusetts. He was 82 and had made his home in Nantucket in recent years.
 Mr. Rinfret's family confirmed the death, saying only that it followed a brief illness. The Associated Press reported that Mr. Rinfret died of heart-related problems. 
A Manhattan millionaire who had been an informal adviser on economic matters to Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, Mr. Rinfret (pronounced RIN-fray) had neither sought nor held public office. But in May 1990, just eight days before the Republican State Convention, he was mentioned as a possible candidate to unseat Governor Cuomo, the two-term Democratic incumbent.
 Nineteen Republicans had already declined their party's nomination when State Senator Roy M. Goodman, the Manhattan Republican leader, pulled Mr. Rinfret's name from the address book of a mutual friend. On May 30, 1990, Mr. Rinfret, at the time a registered Independent, became the Republican nominee.
 After a campaign that was characterized by debt, defection, frequent public combustion and the candidate's protracted absence from the state, Mr. Rinfret was roundly defeated at the polls, earning just 21 percent of the vote. He only narrowly beat the Conservative Party candidate, Herbert London, who won 20 percent; Mr. Cuomo was re-elected with 53 percent. Politically, Mr. Rinfret defied category. As an economist, he was described as a moderate conservative. But he broke with President Richard M. Nixon in 1969 over the administration's economic policies, which Mr. Rinfret publicly denounced.
 On the campaign trail, Mr. Rinfret supported abortion rights and favored the death penalty for drug kingpins. He once proposed that the New York Police Department arm and train 100,000 volunteer vigilantes to help fight crime in the city.
 Mr. Rinfret could be lavish with criticism, and seldom spared his own party. He was ''not particularly proud to be a Republican,'' he declared a month before the election; he also called the major Republicans in the state ''gutless wonders'' for refusing to run against Mr. Cuomo.
 Democrats fared no better. Mr. Rinfret called Mr. Cuomo ''chicken'' for not having served in the military during the Korean War; he once referred to Carol Bellamy, a former president of the New York City Council, as ''that idiot woman.''
 Describing himself, Mr. Rinfret liked to say, ''What you see is what you get.''
 Pierre Andre Rinfret was born on Feb. 1, 1924, in Montreal, and moved with his family to New York five years later. His father was a struggling salesman, and by the younger Mr. Rinfret's later account, the family was very poor, once moving 13 times in a single year because there was no money for rent.
 During World War II, Mr. Rinfret served with the Army in France and Germany. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. While in the Army, he earned a certificate in electrical engineering from the University of Maine.
 After the war, Mr. Rinfret earned a bachelor's degree in business from New York University in 1948 and an M.B.A. there the next year. On a Fulbright Fellowship, he studied political economics at the University of Dijon, earning a Diplome d'Etudes Superieures, considered the equivalent of an American master's degree, in 1951.
 That year, Mr. Rinfret joined Lionel D. Edie & Company, an investment counseling and economic consulting concern based in New York. Mr. Rinfret later became a vice president there and in 1964 was named the company's chairman. He left Lionel D. Edie in late 1966 to form his own consultancy, Rinfret-Boston Associates, with offices in New York and Switzerland.
 Mr. Rinfret first came to wide public notice in 1964, after President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had just signed a tax-cut bill, approvingly quoted ''a leading industrial economist'' -- Mr. Rinfret -- who had recently described the nation's economy as robust. For the next several years, Mr. Rinfret was often sought by the news media as an authority on economic affairs.
 The economics of Mr. Rinfret's campaign for governor seemed less secure than he might have wished. In a financial report from mid-July 1990, Mr. Rinfret reported having raised just $869,632. Of this, $540,000 was his own money.
 In September 1990, Mr. Rinfret's campaign manager, Assemblyman John J. Faso -- the Republican candidate for governor this year -- left the campaign, as did his finance chairman, former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon. For his part, Mr. Rinfret spent most of the summer leading up to the election on his yacht in Europe, The New York Times reported.
 Although during the campaign Mr. Rinfret promised that he would be ''moving the devil out of New York State'' if he lost, he initially reversed himself and elected to stay in his home on the Upper East Side, declaring, ''I love New York too much.'' He later reversed the reversal, retiring to Nantucket in 1991.
 Mr. Rinfret is survived by his wife, the former Ida Ceci, whom he married in 1948; a daughter, Suzanne Rinfret Moore, of Montreal; a son, Peter, of Greenwich, Conn.; and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: What to Do About North Korea?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''North Korea's Folly'' (editorial, July 5):
 It is universally recognized that the threat of an action is usually more effective at achieving results than carrying out that action. 
 Most nations are more subtle in their foreign affairs than the Bush administration has been, where bluster and machismo have been the trademark. 
 As we should have done with Saddam Hussein, we should quietly inform Kim Jong Il in no uncertain terms that if he were to attack with a ''weapon of mass destruction,'' his regime, and probably his life, would be promptly terminated. 
 We know it's a game he understands, because he is now playing at it himself, in his own delusional way.

Robert D. Chagnon
Martinsburg, W.Va., July 5, 2006

To the Editor:
 When George W. Bush made an example of Iraq, establishing our intent to engage in pre-emptive strikes for any perceived threat, did he think that the world would cower instead of seeking to protect themselves? 
 President Bush might have prepared us for difficulties with North Korea and Iran by protecting our ports and borders, strengthening our military and brokering a world consensus against torture, terrorism and nuclear proliferation.
 Instead, he has been profligate with our resources, failed to protect the homeland, diminished our military and moral authority, and bullied North Korea and Iran into being more desperate than ever to gain a seat at the nuclear table. 
 Rather than ''North Korea's folly,'' it would be more aptly termed ''Bush's folly.''

Georgianne Arnold
Rochester, July 5, 2006

To the Editor:
 If I were a small country with a longstanding contentious relationship with the United States, as North Korea has, I'd take a lesson from Iraq and arm my country to defend itself against a capricious invasion to effect ''regime change.'' 
 I suspect that all small countries like North Korea never want to be caught without a strong defense against such an invasion.
 The trend toward nuclear weapons for smaller and larger countries is inevitable. We'd better develop a smart strategy for dealing with this and other problems. 
 The solution is not unilateral use of force. I hope that we are seeing the last of such unenlightened approaches in Iraq.

Ronald Williams
Charlotte, N.C., July 5, 2006

To the Editor:
 It has become increasingly clear that even as the Bush administration has been dithering in Iraq, a real threat to our security has been permitted to evolve in North Korea. 
 The belligerence, deceit and paranoia of Kim Jong Il's regime -- not to mention its indifference to the suffering of its own people -- can no longer be addressed through ''diplomacy'' or by the kind of economic sanctions that would only serve to make life even more unbearable for the millions who must already contend with severe privations and systematic mind control. 
 We need to extricate ourselves from our Middle East fiasco, convince the Russians and especially the Chinese that their own security can be enhanced only by a joint military effort against this outlaw regime and proceed to engage a real enemy with real weapons of mass destruction before their missiles do have sufficient range to deliver nuclear payloads to American soil.

Stuart Freeman
Brooklyn, July 5, 2006

To the Editor:
 Stephen Hadley, President Bush's national security adviser, lightly dismisses North Korea's failed attempt to launch its intercontinental missile, the Taepodong 2, remarking that it ''tells you something about capabilities'' (front page, July 5).
 Like the proverbial dog that was able to walk on its hind legs -- but badly -- for a country as poor as North Korea to be so dedicated to developing a long-range missile system should alarm the world.

HEADLINE: House and Senate Hold Immigration Hearings 

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON; Cindy Chang contributed reporting from San Diego for this article.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 5 

 BODY:
At odds over immigration, lawmakers from the Senate and the House held rival hearings on Wednesday on opposite coasts, competing for public support for their sharply differing proposals and moving no closer to compromise. 
 Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, sponsors of a bipartisan bill passed by the Senate in May, chose the day after the Fourth of July to hold a hearing wrapped in patriotic themes at the National Constitution Center here.
Most of the speakers embraced the Senate's approach, which calls for a path to citizenship for most illegal immigrants and a guest worker program, as well as enhanced border security and punishment for employers who hire illegal workers. 
 In San Diego, Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California and chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Non-Proliferation, was chosen to lead a meeting in a Border Patrol station that featured agents and local sheriffs. 
 Mr. Royce framed the hearing with a warning that the United States was ''losing ground'' on securing the borders against terrorists. One of the main speakers, Darryl Griffen, the San Diego Border Patrol chief, said his agents continued to be swamped by illegal immigrants.
 Democrats at the hearing accused Republicans of fanning sentiment against immigrants while delaying action on reform. ''The leadership wants us to start here with hearings that are really a dog and pony show,'' said Representative Brad Sherman of California. 
 A Republican bill adopted by the House in December focuses on border security and makes it a crime to be in the United States illegally. House Republicans have rejected Senate proposals for a route to citizenship for a majority of illegal immigrants, calling it amnesty. 
 Mr. Specter, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, led the hearing here, shaping the session to feature employers and politicians who spoke of critical labor shortages in local businesses and an urgent need for immigrant labor. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York said his city's economy would be ''a shell of itself'' without the city's immigrants, 40 percent of the population, and would ''collapse'' if illegal immigrants were deported en masse. Mr. Bloomberg called for a national fraud-proof employee identification card that would allow employers to determine easily the legal status of immigrants. 
 Carol Green Rossi, representing the Pennsylvania Tourism and Lodging Association, said hotels in her state were ''constantly in the recruitment mode'' for immigrant labor but faced troubling and costly problems with inefficient guest worker programs and systems to verify immigration status.
 Mayor Louis Barletta of Hazelton, Pa., which has adopted strict measures to punish employers who hire illegal immigrants and landlords who rent to them. said a recent wave of killings by illegal immigrants had ''terrorized'' the city. In addition, Mayor Barletta said, municipal services are ''buckling under the strain'' of illegal immigration.
 In San Diego, a group of immigrants' rights activists held a vigil while more than 100 protesters who want to reduce illegal immigration packed the hearing room and an area outside.
 ''We want our borders secure,'' said Don Schenck, 69, a retired postal worker from Corona, Calif., who was one of the protesters. ''We want no amnesty for people who broke our laws.''
 In Alexandria, Va., President Bush paid a surprise morning visit to a Dunkin' Donuts owned by two Iranian-American brothers to emphasize his support for comprehensive immigration reform, a catchword for the Senate approach. Mr. Bush said he opposed amnesty and wanted not only enhanced border enforcement but also a ''rational plan'' that would not lead to mass deportations. 
 ''I'm also realistic to tell you that we're not going to be able to deport people who have been here, working hard and raising their families,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 White House officials said Mr. Bush was not stepping back from a compromise he has floated in recent days, in which border security measures would be put in place as much as two years before guest worker and immigrant legalization programs. But the president restated that he did not want the security measures in a separate bill, as House Republicans insist. 
 ''What this White House has been clear about is you don't do borders only,'' said Tony Snow, the White House spokesman.
 Senators said Mr. Bush was moving toward their position, but House Republicans said he was moving toward theirs. ''I think things have moved remarkably in the direction of border security in the past few weeks,'' Mr. Royce said.
 Mr. Specter acknowledged the political duel with the House.
 ''We don't have to match them, we have to exceed them,'' he said of his House counterparts, adding that the Senate could not sit by ''like a potted plant'' while the House held hearings across the country. 
 The Senate announced Wednesday that Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, would hold a hearing in Miami on Monday. The topic is ''Contributions of Immigrants to the U. S. Armed Forces.''

Warhol's Chairman Will Go to Auction
 In 1971 Andy Warhol is said to have made the deadpan observation that ''since fashion is art now, and Chinese is in fashion, I could make a lot of money.'' A year later he produced a series of 10 large hand-painted and silk-screened canvases of Mao with such bright brushstrokes that the Chinese leader looked as if he were wearing lipstick and eye shadow. 
 Too bad Chairman Mao isn't around to see how, 30 years after his death in 1976, those Warhol paintings remain a symbolic shorthand for consumerist culture. 
Rather than Warhol, however, who died in 1987, it is the Daros Collection, an enterprise and art space in Zurich, that now hopes to benefit from his genius. On Nov. 15 it is to auction what many experts consider perhaps the most important of the Warhol Maos at Christie's in New York. The auction house estimates that the painting, measuring 82 by 61 inches, will fetch around $12 million. 
 Just as Warhol's timing was savvy -- the portrait was painted in 1972, the year President Richard M. Nixon traveled to China in a historic overture that would lead to full diplomatic relations -- Daros's decision to sell its Mao now seems clever. Bidders are likely to include not just the wealthy American hedge fund managers who have been spending huge sums of money on ''wall power,'' but also China's new rich, who have also begun snapping up contemporary art. For those Chinese bidders, a historic portrait of Mao would be considered the linchpin of any collection. 
 Brett Gorvy, co-head of Christie's postwar and contemporary art department, said the image was ''probably the most important Warhol to come on the market since the ''Orange Marilyn,'' a 1964 painting that sold for $17.3 million at Sotheby's in 1998. ''It's also something no one would have thought would ever be for sale.''
 First formed in the mid-1980's by Alexander Schmidheiny, the son of a prominent Swiss industrialist, in collaboration with the art dealer Thomas Ammann, the Daros Collection has generally sought to collect a few artists in depth. So far it has world-class holdings of works by Cy Twombly, Brice Marden, Agnes Martin, Robert Ryman, Sigmar Polke, Louise Bourgeois and Warhol.
 After Mr. Ammann and Mr. Schmidheiny died (in 1993 and 1994) the collection was inherited by Alexander Schmidheiny's family and has been overseen by his brother, Stephan. In 2001 Stephan Schmidheiny opened a space in Zurich that not only showcases the collection but also holds exhibitions. Since then its holdings have significantly expanded. 
 Walter Soppelsa, director of the collection, said its decision to sell the Mao was purely a curatorial one. ''We want to focus on the 60's,'' he said in a telephone interview. Although he said he had a wish list of works that the Daros would like to buy with the proceeds from the Mao sale, he did not elaborate. ''Now, when the right piece shows up, we're ready,'' he said.
 It isn't the first time the collection has sold work at auction to refocus its holdings. Two years ago it sold ''Jim Beam J. B. Turner Train'' (1986), by Jeff Koons, a cast stainless-steel train measuring nine and a half feet and filled with bourbon, for $5.4 million. 
 The Daros Collection owns many Warhols from the 1960's, including ''210 Coke Bottles,'' from 1962, ''Blue Liz as Cleopatra,'' from 1963, and ''Atomic Board,'' from 1964. 

Museums Work Together
 For years now museums have joined forces to purchase expensive works of art and organize major exhibitions. In the process, relationships between some institutions become formalized. This week the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London announced that they had reached a five-year agreement to mount exhibitions together, exchange staff for temporary periods and loan each other works from their collections. 
 ''This expands the breadth of our museums' reach,'' said John E. Buchanan Jr., director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. ''Before this our collections, exhibitions, concepts and philosophy were limited to the West Coast.''
 The two museums have worked together before on projects like ''A Grand Design: The Art of the Victoria and Albert Museum'' in 1999 and ''International Arts and Crafts: William Morris to Frank Lloyd Wright,'' which closed at the de Young, part of the Fine Arts Museums, last month. 
 While the institutions say the arrangement is based ''not on a financial agreement but on shared interests,'' sharing the expenses makes organizing such large, splashy shows more economical. 
 ''We have very complementary collections,'' said Mark Jones, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. ''Relationships like this have become increasingly more necessary.'' He added that the relationship with San Francisco is not an exclusive one: the V & A has similar ties with the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Mumbai and is developing a relationship with the Shanghai Museum in China.
 For now, however, it is focusing on its collaboration with the de Young. Already on the boards is ''Victorian Avant-Garde: Whistler, Godwin and the Aesthetic Movement,'' which will open in San Francisco in 2008 and travel to London in either 2010 or 2011. 

British Show Canceled
 In April the British Antique Dealers Association announced that it was planning a show next January on the third floor of Sotheby's York Avenue headquarters to coincide with the Winter Antiques Show. Skeptics wondered just how many dealers would take part, given that they generally view the auction houses as competition. Last month the association said it had not attracted enough dealers and put off the show; no new date was set.
 Sotheby's declined to say what the association had agreed to pay for the space, but an executive involved in the show and familiar with the negotiations said the auction house was charging $350,000. 

A New Role at Whitney
 Just as the Whitney Museum of American Art opened ''Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collections at 75,'' it promoted Donna De Salvo, an organizer of the show, from curator of its permanent collection and associate director for programs to chief curator. In her new role she will not only plan exhibitions but also lead the institution's curators in shaping the Whitney's overall programming vision.

Previews and Openings

LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL Starts Wednesday. Through July 30. This always buzzed-about summer showcase includes ''DruidSynge,'' the complete works of John Millington Synge, and ''Grendel,'' an opera directed by Julie Taymor. Sites in and around Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500.

'NO CHILD' Previews start tomorrow. Opens July 16. The chameleonic Nilaja Sun returns with her acclaimed solo show about the New York public school system (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village; (212) 239-6200.

Broadway

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of cliches set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

*'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)

* 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with elan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231.(George Hunka)

'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)

'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)

Long-Running Shows

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'THE BUSY WORLD IS HUSHED' With the Episcopal church in a tizzy about homosexuality and that intriguing new gospel of Judas the subject of much speculation, Keith Bunin's play about conflicts of family and of faith arrives at a propitious moment. Jill Clayburgh stars as an Episcopal minister with a troublesome son and what may be an undiscovered Gospel. Engaging, if a little too tidy (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'GODOT HAS LEFT THE BUILDING' John Griffin's homage to Samuel Beckett's classic play nails the master's comedy but falls short of his lyricism, though it features fine performances from Scott David Nogi and Edward Griffin (2:00). 45 Below Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Hunka)

'MACBETH' As Mr. and Mrs. MacB, Liev Schreiber and Jennifer Ehle inscribe thoughtful studies in the excesses of ambition and the ultimately annihilating prickings of conscience. But in Moises Kaufman's elegantly wrought production set in the tumultuous 1930's, the Macbeths' murderous rampage unfolds at an oddly stately pace. Blood flows regularly, but as if it's being dispensed from silver taps. Despite the intelligence and craft of their performances, neither Mr. Schreiber nor Ms. Ehle seems to inhabit fully the darkness of their characters. (2:25). Delacorte Theater, Central Park West and 81st Street, (212) 539-8750; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will & Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)

'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)

* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)

'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee)

'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)

'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)

'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)

* 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)

'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)

'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)

* 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)

'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)

'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)

'THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL' (R, 88 minutes) The post-9/11 self-absorption of a handful of New Yorkers. Occasionally well observed, but mostly irritating and contrived. (Scott)

'THE GREAT YOKAI WAR' (No rating, 124 minutes, in Japanese) From the prolific Japanese cult director Takashi Miike comes this extravagantly imagined fable about a boy who joins a band of cute magical creatures locked in an apocalyptic struggle against some who are much less cute. (Scott)

'THE HIDDEN BLADE' (R, 132 minutes, in Japanese) Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, ''The Hidden Blade'' focuses on a gentle samurai balancing his love for a low-caste servant girl and his mission to kill a traitorous friend. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, the director, Yoji Yamada, is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)

'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)

'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden)

'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)

* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carriere's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)

* 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)

'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)

'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiance home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern)

'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)

* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)

'THE ROAD TO GUANTANAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantanomo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)

* 'ROOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) Engulfed by nightmares, blackouts and the anxieties of the age, a Texas woman flees homeland insecurity for a New York vision quest in this acute, resourceful and bracingly ambitious debut film. (Lee)

'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)

'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)

'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)

* 'TWO DRIFTERS' (No rating, 98 minutes, in Portuguese) From the dexterous mind of Joao Pedro Rodrigues comes a bizarre love triangle like no other. Two gay boys (one of whom is dead) are reunited with the help of an enigmatic girl on roller skates in a metaphysical melodrama about grief, love, hysterical pregnancy and the transmigration of souls. (Lee)

'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)

'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott)

'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)

* 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)

'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)

AMADOU AND MARIAM (Thursday) Known throughout West Africa as the Blind Couple From Mali, Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have reached American listeners with a smooth eclecticism that on their album ''Dimanche a Bamako,'' last year, folded in reggae and some loose-limbed rock.

* CAMERA OBSCURA (Tonight) Like their fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, led by the lovably plain-voiced Tracyanne Campbell, is in love with wistful 1960's folk-pop and plays a country-leaning variation on it with taste and finesse.

* ELVIS COSTELLO AND ALLEN TOUSSAINT (Monday and Tuesday) After Hurricane Katrina, Elvis Costello made a fruitful reconnection with Allen Toussaint, the veteran New Orleans songwriter and pianist with whom Mr. Costello had worked in the 1980's. They recorded ''The River in Reverse'' (Verve Forecast), an album of bittersweet parables about loss and perseverance, and are now touring together, with a 10-piece band that seamlessly commingles Mr. Costello's Imposters and Mr. Toussaint's Crescent City Horns. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $53.50 to $95. (Sisario)

FRUIT BATS (Thursday) The Fruit Bats, from Chicago, play weightless little nuggets of psych-folk that are deceptively wistful. Behind their apparent melancholy is a playful wit and a modest awe: ''It takes leviathans down in the abyss,'' sings Eric Johnson, the band's leader. ''The hidden messages of the things that you missed.'' With Higgins. At 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sisario)

HAKIM (Tomorrow) Hakim is a superstar in his native Egypt, singing a high-energy dance update of shaabi, an irreverent and streetwise pop style. (Its name means ''of the people.'') He borrows Western beats, and some big Western voices too -- the stars with whom he has sung include James Brown and Olga Tanon. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Sisario)

COLIN HAY (Thursday) Not all former pop stars age as gracefully as Mr. Hay, who in the 1980's was the voice and face of the Australian new-wave oddballs Men at Work.

With Bigger Thomas. At 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)

JOLIE HOLLAND (Tuesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming and deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), is a wry, greet-the-morning scene that finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. At 8 p.m., Canal Room. (See above.) $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)

* LES SAVY FAV, BEANS, DRAGONS OF ZYNTH (Sunday) The most exciting news about the summer concert season is the unexpected arrival of the McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The first concert features the arch postpunk band Les Savy Fav, the alternative rapper Beans and Dragons of Zynth, a talked-about new band whose sound is called ''Afrotek.''

At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, thepoolparties.com; free. (Sisario)

LIFETIME, THE BRONX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Lifetime was a standard-issue hardcore punk band from New Jersey in the mid-1990's -- lots of slashing, melodic guitars and accusatory lyrics -- that has been enjoying a small renaissance since reuniting recently, after almost a decade. The Bronx -- which hails from Los Angeles, not New York -- plays a violently propulsive and proudly obnoxious kind of strut-punk that comes down from Black Flag and the MC5. With the Loved Ones. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)

MAIN SQUEEZE ACCORDION FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) The lineup of this all-day squeezebox affair gives an indication of the surprising diversity of accordion music and its players.

MOUTHUS, COUGHS (Tonight) An evening of grungy, discordant and exhilarating noise-rock. Mouthus, a fearsomely unpredictable duo from Brooklyn, delves into guttural depths of guitar and vocals, and Coughs, a six-piece band from Chicago, offers tortured singing above a malevolent rumble of percussion. Also on the bill are members of the clamorous Sightings and the gloomy but strangely not very noisy Bret Gand Is Dead. At 8, Goodbye Blue Monday, 1087 Broadway, at DeKalb Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn, (718) 453-6343; $8. (Sisario)

* ONEIDA (Thursday) Things are best in Oneida songs when the various patterns of drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones that seem to summon some primordial rock energy.

With Dirty Faces, Company and Knyfe Hytes. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)

At 7 and 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $30. (Sisario)

DAVID LEE ROTH (Thursday) The latest project by the former lead singer of Van Halen, ''Strummin' With the Devil'' (CMH), is an album of bluegrass versions of the band's songs, on which Mr. Roth sings a few.

SOILENT GREEN (Sunday) Soilent Green, from Louisiana, seems hell-bent on reinventing Southern rock in its own gloomy image.

ANGIE STONE (Tonight) This neo-soul singer performs her tales of tough-minded affection with gutsy directness, not bothering with distracting vocal gymnastics. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)

UNCLE MONK (Monday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this new acoustic duo, singing tautly written songs -- much like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. At 9 p.m., Parkside Lounge, 317 East Houston Street, between Clinton and Attorney Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 673-6270; $5. (Sisario)

YO LA TENGO (Thursday) This enduring indie-rock band, with its lean guitar riffs and feedback excursions, takes a detour into soundtrack territory. It accompanies the silent films of Jean Painleve, one of the first to take cameras underwater, who became a favorite of the Surrealists with his scientific documentaries about seahorses, starfish and a solar eclipse. At 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)

YURA YURA TEIKOKU (Tomorrow and Sunday) Long a major player in Japan's garage-punk-revival scene -- which is bigger, and better, than you might think -- this three-piece band made a splash at its first New York concerts last year, and returns for two more. With dry, bluesy guitars and strutting rhythms, it has perfected a stylish synthesis of the sounds of ''Beggars Banquet''-era Rolling Stones and scraggy 1960's psychedelic groups like the 13th Floor Elevators. Tomorrow night at 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. Sunday night at 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sisario)

Cabaret

BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs.

 Opera

GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Monday) This company's productions almost invariably end up at New York City Opera, and lots of people drive to Cooperstown to get an early glimpse of what's on the way. But Glimmerglass, with its intimate, comfortable and up-to-date house, is a vastly better place to see and hear these productions than City Opera's cavernous New York State Theater. The company opens its season with a light work, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag. Alternating with ''Pirates,'' through Monday, is Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' in a production by Leon Major. ''Pirates'': tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 1:30; ''Barbiere'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Monday at 1:30 p.m., Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255; $64 to $112 tonight, tomorrow and Sunday; sold out on Monday. (Allan Kozinn)

'GRENDEL' (Tuesday and Thursday) The soap opera -- delayed opening, restaging problems -- attached to the Los Angeles production of Elliot Goldenthal's new opera ''Grendel'' has evidently been resolved, and Julie Taymor's elaborate staging arrives at the New York State Theater as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $40 to $200. (Bernard Holland)

NEW JERSEY OPERA THEATER (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Founded in 2002, the New Jersey Opera Theater is striving to become the state's pre-eminent opera company.

Tomorrow night, Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore'' takes the stage in a production directed by David Grabarkewitz and conducted by Brent McMunn. From all reports the casts are young, eager and gifted. Both Mozart's and Donizetti's stories of confused young lovers can gain extra poignancy when performed by emerging artists. ''Cosi Fan Tutte'': tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; ''L'Elisir d'Amore'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 to $49.

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Thursday) There are few cozier places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall (a former coffee barge) on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Tonight Alexander Fiterstein, a highly regarded clarinetist, and Steven Beck, a fine pianist, play a freewheeling program that ranges from Weber's Grand Duo Concertante and Lutoslawski's ''Dance Preludes'' to Schumann's ''Fantasiestucke'' and Giampieri's ''Carnival of Venice'' Variations. Tomorrow and Sunday Dvorak's exquisite and rarely heard Terzetto figures into a program that also includes string quartets by Haydn and Beethoven, and Gyorgy Ligeti's Sonata for Solo Cello, to be played by Nicholas Canellakis. And on Thursday Mr. Beck returns on his own, to play Stravinsky, Brahms, Haydn and Schubert. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083; $35 tonight and Thursday, $40 tomorrow and Sunday. (Kozinn)

NAUMBURG ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) George Garrett Keast leads this summertime orchestra in the second of its four free concerts this summer. The program includes Stravinsky's delightful ''Pulcinella'' Suite, Beethoven's Eighth Symphony and, with Andrew Armstrong as the soloist, Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24. At 7:30 p.m., Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, (718) 340-3018. (Kozinn)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Philharmonic's Summertime Classics series -- conceived as a way for the orchestra to get its money's worth from the players during the off weeks of late June -- is back. The idea is to present programs of mostly lighter and familiar fare at reduced ticket prices. Still, last summer Bramwell Tovey proved not only a lively conductor but also an avuncular host whose comments to the audience were witty and informative. The series ends this weekend with Mr. Tovey conducting Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' Overture, Saint-Saens's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espagnol'' and Ravel's ''Bolero.'' Are there four more familiar and popular pieces in the repertory? At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $19 to $49. (Tommasini)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC'S CONCERTS IN THE PARKS (Tuesday through Thursday) After the Philharmonic's Summertime Classics series ends tomorrow, the orchestra leaves the air-conditioned confines of Avery Fisher Hall for its annual series of free concerts in the parks. The Philharmonic's dynamic associate conductor, Xian Zhang, offers two Tchaikovsky works, the ''Festival Coronation March'' and the Violin Concerto (with the charismatic violinist Jennifer Koh as soloist), and Dvorak's exuberant Symphony No. 8. Expect these concerts to draw tens of thousands of people for picnics in the parks and music under (if nature cooperates) the stars. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Prospect Park ball fields, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Great Lawn, Central Park; Thursday at 8 p.m., Cunningham Park, Francis Lewis Boulevard and Union Turnpike, Fresh Meadows, Queens; (212) 875-5709. (Tommasini)

SUMMERGARDEN (Sunday) The Museum of Modern Art begins its annual summer series of free concerts in the Sculpture Garden with music from Sweden, Bolivia, France and the United States. Current and recent students at the Juilliard School will play, directed by Joel Sachs. First come first served. Enter through the garden gate on 54th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. The music will move inside in case of rain. At 8 p.m., (212) 708-9491. (Holland)

* TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) When James Levine injured his shoulder early this year, forcing him to cancel his conducting commitments for the rest of the season, his doctors said he would most likely be ready to conduct when Tanglewood opened. Some doubt remained until recent weeks, but Mr. Levine said he would be up for the opening program, tonight, in which he is to lead the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. His soloists are Sondra Radvanovsky, Wendy White, Clifton Forbis and John Relyea. Bernard Haitink then takes over the rest of the weekend, for programs of Ravel, Mozart, Debussy and Roussel tomorrow evening, and Sibelius and Mahler on Sunday afternoon. His soloists are the pianist Emanuel Ax tomorrow and the violinist Joshua Bell on Sunday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Lenox, Mass., (888) 266-1200; $17 to $98. (Kozinn)

WASHINGTON SQUARE MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tuesday) The music is by or about Mozart. The performers are Eriko Sato and the festival's chamber orchestra. The concert is free. At 8 p.m., Washington Square Park South, Greenwich Village, (212) 252-3621. (Holland)

Chunky Move (Tuesday through Thursday) Apparently, Australian men have dancing difficulties too. Perhaps not these particular men, though; employing video montages and interviews, the members of the physical Australian troupe Chunky Move channel their inner wallflowers in ''I Want to Dance Better at Parties.'' Through July 15. At 8 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $36. (Claudia La Rocco)

Monday through Thursday at 5 and 7:30 p.m., Chashama, 112 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 391-8151 or www.chashama.org. (Dunning)

* JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) The Suzanne Farrell Ballet from Washington will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater through the weekend in an all-Balanchine program, followed there on Wednesday and Thursday (and next weekend) by Tania Perez-Salas's company from Mexico. In the smaller Doris Duke Studio Theater, Emanuel Gat Dance from Israel plays through this weekend, with Robert Moses' Kin from San Francisco moving in on Thursday through next weekend. Suzanne Farrell tonight and tomorrow at 8 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; $50. Perez-Salas Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8, Shawn Theater; $45.

* LA MAMA MOVES! (Tonight through Sunday) Six choreographers from around the world, including Bill Irwin, will perform in ''Border Jumping'' in the closing weekend of this festival, whose curators were Nicky Paraiso and Mia Yoo. Tonight through Sunday night at 7:30. ''Mavericks in Motion,'' featuring nine choreographers who include Justin Montalvo, Christopher Morgan and Kate Weare, will also be performed. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2:30 and 8 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; $10 (Dunning)

* NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tomorrow) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 until the end of the month, although this week there will be only two performances. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell)

PAUFVE DANCE (Tonight through Sunday night) From San Francisco, Randee Paufve and her dancers, who range in age from 22 to 72, will present ''The Big Squeeze,'' a program of dances about love, home, space and place. At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-7479 or www.paufvedance.org; $15; $13 for students and 65+. (Dunning)

* ROXANE BUTTERFLY (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Djellaba Groove'' ain't your grandmother's tap. This performer mixes in flamenco, multilingual spoken word and North African rhythms to give this New World art form some Old World flair. And it gets better: her show is paired with the terrific Noche Flamenca at the SummerStage performance. Tonight, 8 to 10:30, summerstage.org Free. Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200 or telecharge.com; $15 (La Rocco)

* TAP CITY (Sunday through July 22) Six years ago the irrepressible Tony Waag, fed up with the lack of performing opportunities for tap dancers in New York, started this festival. Who says you can't please all of the people all of the time? From rarely seen films to master classes with and performances by today's brightest American and international hoofers, Mr. Waag's boisterous creation promises something for everyone. From 8 to 11 p.m., the festival opens with a free tap jam at Pier 63 Maritime, West 23rd Street at the Hudson River, Chelsea. For a complete festival schedule, visit atdf.org. (La Rocco)

DUSAN TYNEK DANCE THEATER (Thursday) Dusan Tynek, from Czechoslovakia, trained with Aileen Passloff at Bard College. He will present two premieres, one inspired by sinister 19th-century Czech ballads and set to string music by classical and contemporary composers, and the other set to music by Michael Galasso. Through July 16. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+. (Dunning)

VON USSAR DANCEWORKS (Thursday) Astrid von Ussar, a Slovenian modern-dance choreographer now based in New York City, will present four new and recent pieces, including her new ''23 hours,'' set to music by Graeme Ravell. The program features a dance by Mojca Ussar, her sister. Through July 16. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $25 for opening night performance and reception. (Dunning)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)

Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Egypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith)

* Frick Collection : 'Jean-Etienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

* International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)

* Metropolitan museum of art: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)

* Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)

* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)

Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)

* MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)

* New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)

NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)

* The Whitney Museum of American Art : 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)

Galleries: Uptown

* WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)

* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

* HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.' This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith)

* Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naive immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

'Air' This appealing, understated show organized by the painter Amy Sillman includes Benjamin Butler's lush, Mondrian-style painting of trees; Pat Palermo's semi-abstract drawings of wrecked cars and other curious subjects; John White Cerasulo's watercolor of a bare-chested wilderness giant; Pamela Wilson-Ryckman's flickering picture of a scattering crowd of people; and abstractions in various styles by Robert Bordo, Jenny Monick, Howard Smith, Laura Newman and Patricia Treib. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 234-8645, through July 28. (Johnson)

'Everywhichway' This lively show of artists working inventively between abstraction and representation includes Katherine Bradford's whimsical images of ships and the sea; Chris Martin's updated Tantric art; Sigrid Sandstrom's Arctic icescapes; suave, retro-Modernist pattern paintings by Jennifer Riley and Colin Thomson; Harvey Tulcensky's finely textured ballpoint-pen fields; and compact, sensuous ceramic slabs by Joyce Robins. Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565, through July 28. (Johnson)

'The Sanctuary and the Scrum' A diverting, pluralistic show inaugurates a new Northwest Chelsea exhibition space. It includes good abstract and semi-abstract paintings by Jessica Dickinson and Andrew Guenther; a stuffed swan shorn of its feathers from the head down by Jane Benson; a gleaming crutch covered by tiny mirror facets by Kristian Kozul; and a funny photo-conceptual project about grocery store shopping carts by Julian Montague. Black & White, 636 West 28th Street, (212) 244-3007, through July 29. (Johnson)

Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson)

* Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the famed modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter)

Other Galleries

Christine Osinski: 'Notes From West Brighton' Ms. Osinski took the visually and sociologically gripping photographs in this exhibition on Staten Island, where she lives, in the early 1980's and the early 90's. These exceptionally lucid black-and-white pictures of nondescript neighborhoods, grocery store customers, small-town parades, self-consciously posing teenagers and abandoned wrecked cars were made with an affectionately cool, clear eye for the beauty and weirdness of ordinary people and places. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, East Village, (212) 505-9156, through July 30. (Johnson)

Last Chance

Eva Lundsager: 'Wherever' Improvising with infectiously playful freedom on medium-large canvases, Ms. Lundsager creates hedonistic and trippy abstract landscapes composed of dots, squiggles, woozy stripes, smudgy areas, luminous open spaces, and colors ranging from neon bright to muddy brown. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, closing today. (Johnson)

MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' . Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Met, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of its department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710, closing Sunday. (Glueck)

'Nightmares of Summer' This entertaining selection of dark, weird and nasty visions includes Marilyn Minter's big photograph of dirty feet with toenails painted fashionably green; Barnaby Furnas's explosive, cartoonish painting of a woman at the beach spilling blood-red wine; an otherworldly coppery seascape by Stuart Elster; photographs by Anders Petersen, Hans Bellmer and Diane Arbus; drawings by Carroll Dunham and Steve DiBenedetto; and more. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-3363, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

HALSEY RODMAN: 'THE NAVIGATOR'S QUARTERS MUST NOT BE DISTURBED' A solo debut introduces a multi-talented sculptor who lets his work bog down in an obscure narrative, but still cuts loose with a sufficiently engaging array of techniques, materials and colors. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, closing tomorrow. (Smith)

'Scarecrow' The work in this show is supposed to be menacing and abrasive, but it is mostly interesting and amusing.

HEADLINE: Freeing the Line

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:

Marian Goodman Gallery
24 West 57th Street, Manhattan
Through Aug. 26
 Catherine de Zegher, former director of the Drawing Center, continues the fine work she did there with this light-as-air, largely sculptural group show. As ever, her mix of artists holds surprises, and her goal is clear: to redefine materially what drawing is. 
 Actually, the earliest piece, Richard Tuttle's ''Untitled,'' from 1972, once helped to redefine what art itself is. It is made of 12 small nails hammered into a gallery wall and connected by lengths of wire. That's it. At first you see nothing; then, there it is. Move a few feet away, and it's gone. Call it a sculpture, a drawing, a perceptual intervention; in a world cluttered with unavoidable things, it is a bracing act of material and spiritual economy. 
 In fact, the whole first half of this show is almost extravagantly understated. The Belgian artist Joelle Tuerlinckx balances slender, paint-flecked sticks and scraps of ribbon on see-through bases. Karel Malich's suspended wire mobiles from the 1970's swoop and twist like transparent clouds. The openwork weavings in cable and steel by the marvelous Venezuelan artist Gego (1912-1994) work their magic both in midair and on the wall. 
 Gego is high on my list of important historical figures overdue for a New York survey. Her art finds an ideal complement here in work by the young Indian artist Ranjani Shettar. Ms. Shettar has just one piece here, but, deservedly, it is given a room of its own. A long, weblike curtain made from threads and pellets of colored wax, it gradually spirals inward, its color changing from dark green to light green to yellow. Titled ''Vasanta (Spring/Transition),'' it couldn't be lovelier. (Ms. Shettar also has a solo show at Talwar Gallery.)
 The second part of the show, in the south gallery, is darker and denser. If Mr. Tuttle set the tone in the first half, Eva Hesse sets it here, with a 1966 black wall sculpture that seems to extrude a long section of black rubber hosing that descends to the floor. Monika Grzymala, a young artist based in Germany, picks up on this abject linearity and turns it into an environment made entirely of black tape. 
 Covering two walls and wrapping around a pillar, the results suggest a walk-in explosion. And the same effect is distilled in Julie Mehretu's painting ''Covenant,'' with its Leonardo-like firestorm filling cosmic space. Done in black ink and acrylic, Ms. Mehretu's piece really is close to being a drawing in the conventional sense, though in the context Ms. de Zegher has created, it is also one more example of how varied, malleable and radical a thing convention can be.

HEADLINE: Services Index Shows Growth Slowed in June 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The United States service sector grew more slowly than expected in June, but the labor market showed strength as jobless claims dipped unexpectedly last week, according to data released yesterday. 
 The Institute for Supply Management said that its nonmanufacturing business activity index fell to 57.0 in June, the lowest level since January. The June reading was below May's 60.1 and less than the median forecast of 59.0 among economists polled by Reuters.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the United States service sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of overall economic activity.
 ''The economy is growing strongly but it has lost momentum since the beginning of the year,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com in West Chester, Pa. 
 Earlier yesterday, the government reported that new claims for United States unemployment benefits unexpectedly slipped by 2,000 last week. The jobless claims reinforced the view of strong private-sector job growth signaled by data in the ADP National Employment Report released Wednesday.
 ''It's the sign of a robust labor market in terms of layoffs,'' said Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. ''Companies are reluctant to lay off workers in the current climate.'' 
 Economists and the Federal Reserve will get a more complete picture of the job market today when the Labor Department releases its employment report for June.
 Also yesterday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said that its mortgage application index rose 5.9 percent last week as interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell for first time in four weeks to 6.80 percent.

HEADLINE: A Border Dispute That Focuses on Water, Not Immigration

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: CALEXICO, Calif. 

 BODY:
For more than 100 years, as their names imply, Calexico and its much larger sister city, Mexicali, south of the border, have embraced each other with a bonhomie born of mutual need and satisfaction in the infernal desert.
 The pedestrian gate into Mexico clangs ceaselessly as Mexicans lug back bulging bags from Wal-Mart and 99 Cent Stores in Calexico. The line into the United States slogs along, steady but slower, through an air-conditioned foyer as men and women trudge off to work and, during the school year, children wear the universal face that greets the coming day.
Now, the ties that bind Calexico and Mexicali are being tested as a 20-year dispute over the rights to water leaking into Mexico from a canal on the American side is reaching a peak. Though the raging debate over illegal immigration in the United States has not upset border relations here, some say the fight over water could affect the number of Mexicans who try to cross here illegally.
 To slake the ever-growing thirst of San Diego, 100 miles to the west, the United States has a plan to replace a 23-mile segment of the earthen All-American Canal, which the federal government owns and the Colorado River feeds, with a concrete-lined parallel trough. 
 The $225 million project would send more water to San Diego, by cutting off billions of leaked gallons -- enough for 112,000 households a year -- that have helped irrigate Mexican farms since the 1940's. 
 But Mexican farmers and their advocates say the lined canal would effectively turn off the spigot for 25,000 people, including 400 farmers whose wells rely on the seepage that has helped turn the powdery fields east of Mexicali, an industrial city, into one of the biggest Mexican producers of onions, alfalfa, asparagus, squash and other crops. 
 The farmers and their families ask what will they do if they cannot till the fields and answer that they will cross the border, illegally if they have to, in droves. 
 ''They can't build a fence high enough to stop us,'' said Geronimo Hernandez, a Mexicali farmer whose family has worked the fields for generations.
 Juan Ignacio Guajardo, a lawyer in Mexicali who is helping a civic group there and two environmental groups in Southern California fight the canal, said, ''You can't have it both ways,'' adding, ''You can't take our water away and then say, 'We don't want immigration, either.' '' 
 The dispute over the project was among the topics President Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico discussed in an April meeting in Mexico.
 [A federal judge ruled against environmental groups in the United States and a Mexicali civic association in a lawsuit against the project, dismissing some claims on June 26 on technicalities and deciding on July 3 that many of the predicted effects on Mexico were ''highly speculative'' and that the federal environmental law at issue did not apply beyond the border. The groups said they were preparing an appeal. In addition, a separate lawsuit is pending in state court.]
 On the American side, managers of the Imperial Irrigation District, which controls the canal and a vast water system that has turned swaths of the California desert in the Imperial and Coachella Valleys into some of the most fertile farmland anywhere, defend the plan.
 They say the 1944 international treaty on the distribution of water from the Colorado River, which feeds the canal, does not prohibit the concrete lining. New agreements among the states and water utilities along the Colorado have imposed limits on how much water can be tapped from the river, making every drop count that much more.
 ''There is more need than water available,'' said the general manager of the irrigation district, Charles Hosken. ''When you find a point to access water, I think it is our duty to go after it.''
 Mr. Hosken acknowledged that the project, which has been mired in legal challenges and planning since the 1980's, ''will have impact'' on Mexico, but said, ''The fact is, the water belongs to the United States, and we have never been compensated for it.''
 He said he was particularly angry at opponents of the project who invoke the immigration debate, which while discussed here, has not set off the fiery passions found elsewhere.
 The notion that cutting off the leakage would drive up illegal immigration, he said, was ''quite a stretch'' and a ''scare tactic'' intended to take advantage of the charged atmosphere surrounding the debate.
 But opponents said the project was moving forward without enough consideration of its potential effects.
 The federal lawsuit contended that a study in 1994 of the project's environmental consequences was outdated and should be revised to take into account changes of the last 12 years.
 The groups argued in the suit that the original study did not fully take into account a projected increase in air pollution if the fields were returned to dust or the deterioration of Mexican wetlands if the leaking water were to dry up and remove the habitat of endangered birds and lizards. 
 In the state lawsuit, filed in April, another environmental group contends that the concrete lining and the shape of the new canal would produce swifter currents that would endanger people and animals. That group says it plans to seek a temporary restraining order against the project.
 California has agreed to pay for 60 percent of the project, with the San Diego County Water Authority financing the rest. Malissa Hathaway McKeith, president of Citizens United for Resources and the Environment, a group in the federal lawsuit, said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger could halt the project by withholding the state money until the environmental effects were studied more closely.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzenegger, Margita Thompson, said such a move was far from likely because the governor thought that the water recovered from the lining would lessen the need to tap the Colorado.
 ''This will help provide long-term stability in water management,'' Ms. Thompson said.
 The dispute has touched a nerve in Calexico, which, with a population of 33,000, mostly Spanish speakers of Mexican descent, functions as a virtual suburb of Mexicali, which has nearly one million residents.
 The mayor and Council of Calexico have sided with the Mexicali farmers, taking pains to make clear that Mexicans are welcome here in part because they fear that economic distress in the region could damage their economy, which is buoyed by Mexican wallets.
 ''If we didn't have Mexico,'' said Mayor Alex Perrone, who like many other city residents was born in Mexicali and reared in Calexico, ''we could not survive.''
 So intertwined are the towns that Calexico fire trucks race across the border for emergencies. Mexicali children fill private schools in Calexico. Special border-crossing cards known as laser visas make it easy for many Mexicans to go back and forth, though some sneak in, too, hiding in cars or scaling the steel-plate fence.
 Ire against the new canal has grown in Mexicali, where bumper stickers opposing it are turning up. 
 ''How can they take away the farmers' water after all these years?'' asked Juan Rodolfo Rodriguez, a Mexicali shopkeeper who was buying a caffe latte at the Starbucks shop here. ''Americans always want more, but we are used to this.''
 Farmers like the Hernandez family fear they would not have the resources to find alternate water sources, like digging deeper wells to tap an underground aquifer.
 ''It would be costly to maintain,'' said Luis Hernandez, Geronimo Hernandez's brother. ''And who knows if it would give us the same amount of water?''

The debate over replacing a part of the All-American Canal with a concrete-lined trough has strained the longstanding ties between Mexicali and Calexico, Calif. Calexico functions almost like a Mexicali suburb.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Bright View of Muslim Integration

BYLINE: By DAVID RAMPE

DATELINE: PARIS, July 6 

 BODY:
One year after bombings by Islamic militants in London set off intensive soul-searching across Europe about Muslim integration, a new survey has turned up surprisingly positive attitudes, both among European Muslims toward Europe and among society in general toward Muslims. 
 The poll, carried out by the Pew Global Attitudes Project this spring in 13 countries, with additional samples of Muslims living in Britain, Germany, France and Spain, indicated that ''Muslims are generally positive about conditions'' in their countries of residence. 
 ''In fact,'' Pew said, ''they are more positive than the general publics in all four European countries about the way things are going in their countries.'' 
 Among non-Muslim Europeans, overall attitudes toward Muslims did not worsen and in fact in some ways improved, despite the events of the past year: the July 7 attack in London, which killed 52 people; rioting across France in the autumn by youths, many of Muslim origin; and the rage ignited by Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. 
 The survey also found that European Muslims polled largely welcomed the entry of women into modern roles, favored a moderate version of Islam and did not see many or most Europeans as hostile toward Muslims. More French non-Muslims than those polled in a similar survey a year ago said immigration from the Middle East and North Africa was a good thing.
 The survey, released Thursday, indicated that European Muslims polled shared with other Europeans a concern about unemployment. 
 Pew surveyed 14,030 people from March 31 to May 14 in Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Spain, Turkey and the United States. The margin of sampling error for the national populations was plus or minus two to six points.
 Among Muslims in Europe who see a struggle within Islam between moderates and militants, most support the moderates. But allegiance to militant Islamic political movements is not insignificant; in Britain, 15 percent of the Muslims polled sided with the militants. 
 The majority populations often worry that a growing Islamic identity could lead to violence. But many also worry that it could keep Muslims from adopting the national customs and way of life. In Germany, Britain and Spain, big majorities saw immigrants as wanting to remain distinct, as did a small majority in France.
 The survey found no perceptible rise in animosity toward Muslim immigration in Spain, France, or Germany. But in Germany, with its large Turkish population, immigration from the Middle East and North Africa was seen as ''a good thing'' by only 34 percent of the general public, with the majority -- 59 percent -- describing it as a bad thing. Even among the Muslims living in Germany, most did not favor immigration from these areas.
 In Britain, 57 percent said such immigration was a good thing, in line with previous surveys in May of last year and in 2002. In France, 58 percent saw it as a good thing, up from 53 percent last year.
 Where European Muslims differed most sharply from general populations was on foreign affairs, Pew found.
 While general publics in the four countries surveyed did not give the United States high ratings -- Britons were most favorable, at 56 percent -- Muslim views were far less favorable, toward both the country and Americans. The American ''war on terror'' is also extremely unpopular among Muslim populations, with 83 percent opposed in Spain, 78 percent in France, 77 percent in Britain and 62 percent in Germany.
 By contrast, Iran -- which has upset the West with its nuclear program -- has the support of many Muslims, especially in Britain and Spain.

HEADLINE: North Korea Flatly Rejects Protests on Missile Firings

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI; David S. Cloud contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 6 

 BODY:
North Korea declared Thursday that it would continue to test-fire missiles and vowed to use force if other nations tried to stop it, even as it acknowledged for the first time that it had launched seven missiles the day before.
 Responding to international condemnation with characteristic defiance and vagueness, North Korea said the launchings of the seven missiles, including one long-range Taepodong 2, had been ''routine military exercises'' intended to raise the nation's ''capacity for self-defense.''
In a statement attributed to its Foreign Ministry and released by its official press agency, the North stated that it would continue with its missile launchings and that it ''will have no option but to take stronger physical actions of other forms, should any other country dare take issue with the exercises and put pressure upon it.''
 The warning was issued as the United States and countries in this region remained divided over a Japanese-backed proposal for a United Nations Security Council resolution threatening sanctions if the North did not dismantle its nuclear program. 
 President Bush called the leaders of China and Russia on Thursday seeking a unified response against the test firings. But the two countries, both permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, said they opposed punitive sanctions.
 ''We think the Security Council should make a necessary response, but the response should be helpful to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and should help diplomatic efforts,'' Jiang Yu, the spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing. 
 When asked whether China, North Korea's biggest trading partner and aid donor, was considering cutting aid as a result of the tests, Ms. Jiang said, ''At present we are not taking this aspect into consideration.''
 In Moscow, President Vladimir V. Putin said he was disappointed by the test firings but added that the North Koreans were right in their assertion that they had the legal right to perform such tests.
 North Korea said that the launchings were the country's ''exercise of its legitimate right as a sovereign state'' and that it was no longer bound by past moratoriums on missile tests because the United States and Japan had broken previous agreements.
 In its statement, the North described Wednesday's missile launchings as successful, an assertion disputed by experts who tracked the Taepodong 2. 
 North Korea's continued defiance appeared to be intended to press the United States into direct talks, analysts and politicians said. For months it has been demanding that the United States lift a crackdown on North Korean businesses and banks that do business with the country.
 It has also pushed for bilateral talks, twice inviting Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and the main American negotiator with North Korea, to Pyongyang, its capital.
 Washington has refused, saying only that it will participate in the now stalled six-nation talks over the nuclear program. The six nations are the United States, North Korea, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia.
 ''These actions by North Korea are an act of defiance meant to remind the U.S. that to ignore it comes at a price,'' said Peter Beck, the Northeast Asia project director at the International Crisis Group in Seoul.
 ''The tests may also have been intended to rally the North Korean people, to justify the hardships that they are undergoing,'' Mr. Beck said, adding that one of the biggest anti-American rallies in years was held in Pyongyang last week.
 At a parliamentary hearing here, South Korea's defense minister, Yoon Kwang Ung, predicted that North Korea might fire additional missiles. He said he was basing his assessment on ''the traffic of equipment and personnel in and out of launch sites.'' Military talks between the Koreas are scheduled for later this month.
 South Korean news organizations reported Wednesday that North Korea had three or four more mediumrange missiles sitting on launching pads. North Korea is believed to have about 200 medium-range and 600 short-range missiles.
 The missile launchings have drawn contrasting responses from South Korea and Japan, America's two allies in the region.
 Caught between its alliance with the United States and its policy of engaging the North, South Korea condemned the tests but is unlikely to impose more than a few limited penalties, experts here said.
 In the long term, few expect South Korea, which is the North's second-largest trading partner and aid donor, after China, to significantly alter its policy of engagement. What China and South Korea fear almost as much as military confrontation, experts say, is the sudden collapse of the North Korean government and a subsequent flood of millions of refugees. 
 At a parliamentary hearing, Lee Jong Seok, the South's minister of unification, said that cabinet-level meetings between the North and South would go ahead as scheduled next week and that Seoul would proceed with economic joint ventures with North Korea. 
 By contrast, Japan has taken its toughest stance yet against North Korea. Fukushiro Nukaga, the head of Japan's Defense Agency, told a parliamentary committee in Tokyo on Thursday that Japan would step up efforts to establish a missile defense shield with the United States. 
 ''We would like to cooperate with the United States and put our joint missile interception into shape as quickly as possible,'' he said.
 In Washington on Thursday, American military officials disclosed more details about the flight of the Taepodong 2, saying it was longer than the 42 seconds initially reported.
 Counting the rocket's boost phase and a period during which the missile was tumbling out of control into the Sea of Japan, the missile was in the air for closer to two minutes, they said. The period during which the missile was stable as it flew was 42 seconds, the officials said.
 All of the military officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information.
 ''If the missile had kept going, it would have had to go over Japan,'' said one military official, who said he had seen projections of the trajectory that showed it headed over central or northern Japan.
 ''The missile was headed east,'' the other official said, adding that tracking the missile's possible trajectory was especially difficult in this case because the flight was relatively short.
 The officials said they did not know whether the North had planned for the missile, which is believed to have a range of 3,500 miles or more, to fly into Japanese airspace. It may not have been loaded with enough fuel to go that far, or North Korea may have intended to abort the flight, but the missile fell into the sea before its first stage burned out.
 The officials said it did not appear that the missile was being launched into space, which would have taken it on a more vertical trajectory.
 One official confirmed that the missile had been tracked by Aegis sensors on Navy ships patrolling the Sea of Japan, the first time that a foreign ballistic missile had been tracked by the sensors. 
 Within seconds of the detection of the launching, as well as those of the shorter-range rockets, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and other senior officials were informed, using a special communication procedure called a missile alert conference, another senior Pentagon official said.

PERSON: Rosie Perez

HEADLINE: 'Do the Right Thing' Is More Than Her Movie Debut 

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
COACHED toward the curb by her own impromptu valet parking attendant -- in his actual job the well-mannered executive director of Working Playground, an arts-education nonprofit group that serves New York City schoolchildren -- the actress Rosie Perez halts her sporty black Volvo station wagon and hands him the keys. Girl's got clout. 
 Not that she flaunts it. Not when the role she is playing is that of civic-minded activist with not one cause, but two. 
 She is ready to rhapsodize about Working Playground, whose creatively inclined but economically deprived student clientele conjures up memories of growing up the hard way in Williamsburg and Bushwick. 
 And, as a member, with Oscar figures like Heath Ledger, of the celebrity-enhanced board of Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, she is more than willing to vent about the multibillion-dollar Atlantic Yards project that is, she frets, threatening to change her eclectic home borough into, horrors, ''a mini-Manhattan.'' Just call her Citizen Rosie. And just don't ask her age. 
 ''That question is so rude,'' she snaps. Reflexively. ''I'm an artist, not a criminal.'' But she was a college student in Los Angeles when she made her film debut in Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing'' in 1989, which puts her somewhere north of 35 and south of, oh, never mind. ''I know it's your job to ask,'' she explains, escalating her distinctive diction to jackhammer level. ''You're in a rude business.'' Occasionally. 
 Ms. Perez, whose figure is hourglass curvaceous but taut, as befitting an Emmy-nominated choreographer and Oscar-nominated actress, is dressed-to-blend with the Lower Broadway crowd in a pink T-shirt, snug brown jeans, and platform sandals. The outfit does not scream diva, though her megawatt grin when she notices herself being noticed certainly does. She has dimples. Ageless.
 She adjusts her Kate Spade shades and zips into the building where Working Playground, on whose artistic board she sits, has a one-room office. No signs of administrative bloat around here. Even the air-conditioner is turned off. A photograph on the wall catches her eye: there she is, smile in full deployment, surrounded by female students she instructed in a master dance class a few years back. Ms. Perez, who is childless, seems to lose herself in the picture. ''Seeing those kids again gives me goose bumps,'' she says.
 WHEN she snaps out of her reverie, she is ready to chatter. Preferably about Working Playground's mission since 1991: enriching students' educational experience by immersing them in the in-depth study of art forms ranging from film and theater to animated video production. The organization reaches 35 public schools and helped establish New Design High School, on Grand Street. 
 This month, Sharif James, a New Design student who participated in a film class taught by Ms. Perez, is attending an architecture program at Cornell University. Working Playground provided a $4,000 scholarship to send him there.
 ''My mantra for Working Playground is, what separates an underprivileged kid from a privileged kid is opportunity,'' she says. ''These kids completely remind me of myself. You can be intelligent and be poverty-stricken, but to be treated as a charity case by the welfare system is insulting: I remember being insulted by it as a kid. I've seen too many walking geniuses grow up to fail, to not rise to the occasion. Working Playground is unique because the kids are committed to the programs. It brings me to tears.''
 Ms. Perez's ideas were solicited six years ago by Amy Rosenfeld Poux, the founding partner of Working Playground. It was a family obligation of sorts: at the time, Ms. Perez was married to Ms. Poux's brother. The marriage didn't last, but the affiliation did. ''The novelty of my celebrity has worn off, trust me,'' she says, twirling a corkscrew curl -- she has a head full -- around an index finger. Ms. Perez is not a sit-still type: she prowls the office, serves herself from the water cooler, and scrolls through the student artworks. 
 She never had much of an arts education, nor a traditional upbringing. Aside from a sad stint in an upstate group home run by nuns, she was raised by a maternal aunt. ''My aunt got custody and it changed my life; she showed me love.'' 
 She went to college for marine biology, but Spike Lee intervened: ''I told him I didn't know anything about acting and he said, 'You're an actress, trust me.' '' She dropped out of college. She made her Broadway debut in ''Frankie & Johnny in the Clair de Lune,'' opposite Joe Pantoliano, and also co-starred opposite Mary Louise Parker in ''Reckless'' in 2004. 
 Her directorial debut, ''Yo Soy Boricua,'' a documentary, was featured at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival. ''Dented Cans,'' her first screenplay, will receive a reading at the Public Theater later this summer.
 She owns a house in Los Angeles, but she's never there: she prefers Brooklyn, where she lives in a Victorian, circa 1864, with two rescued dogs, one of them the nemesis of every rat in Fort Greene Park. A public service dog, as it were.
 She is gearing up for a rally on July 16 against the Atlantic Yards project, which she describes as ''awfully ugly and so out of character for Brooklyn. I'm all for progress and I'm all for development, but I'm not for the betterment of the filthy rich. If that eyesore comes to Brooklyn with the Nets, it's over, it's done. But why give in and let Bruce Ratner take over? My nabe was like my private Mayberry.''

HEADLINE: Court Ruling Favorable to Tobacco Pushes Dow Higher 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as the Altria Group's shares led a rally in tobacco stocks after the Florida Supreme Court threw out a $145 billion punitive damage verdict against tobacco companies.
 But lingering caution before today's employment report for June limited gains in the broader market, while a sell-off in shares of eBay and Apple Computer weighed on the Nasdaq.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73.48 points, or 0.66 percent, to finish at 11,225.30. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.17 points, or 0.25 percent, to end at 1,274.08. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to close at 2,155.09. 
 During yesterday's session, Altria's shares jumped 6 percent, or $4.43, to end at $77.76 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, the stock hit a record high at $79.10. 
 An index of tobacco stocks rose 1.8 percent. Reynolds American shares rose 4 percent, or $4.59, to close at $118.95. Carolina Group, the tracking stock for the Lorillard Tobacco unit of Loews, closed at $53.99, up 5.5 percent, or $2.81.
 On the Nasdaq, eBay shares sank to $26.82, their lowest level in more than two years, after the company said the head of its PayPal payments unit would leave in a shake-up that reassigned executives at four divisions. The stock fell 5.3 percent, or $1.51, to close at $26.85; eBay was the heaviest weight on both the Nasdaq and the S.& P. 500.
 Shares of Apple dropped 2.2 percent, or $1.23, to $55.77, a day after it said it had been sued over its awarding of stock option grants and after news that Microsoft was developing a competitor to Apple's iPod music player.
 Shares of companies whose fortunes are closely tied to economic cycles rebounded from the previous session's heavy losses, led by 3M, whose stock rose 1 percent, or 84 cents, to $81.39.
 But shares of Wal-Mart Stores, the world's biggest retailer and a Dow component, slipped 0.6 percent, or 30 cents, to $46.72 as a broad swath of major retailers posted mixed June sales. Wal-Mart sales hit the low end of its forecast. Shares of Target, a Wal-Mart rival, rose 1.9 percent, or 90 cents, to $49.17 after its sales came near the high end of its forecast.
 Volume was light, with only 1.41 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On Nasdaq, about 1.64 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 1.80 billion.
 ''Altria is single-handedly the reason for the Dow and the S.&P. to be up today, clearly outperforming the Nasdaq,'' said Michael James, senior trader at the Wedbush Morgan regional investment bank in Los Angeles.
 Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 8 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, while on the Nasdaq, about eight stocks rose for every seven that fell.
 Treasury security prices rose yesterday, extending gains, after an unexpectedly weak report on the United States service sector hinted that today's employment report for June might prove softer than forecasts.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32, to 9918/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.18 percent, from 5.22 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Oil Giant Is Drilling Far From Home Waters 

BYLINE: By PAULO PRADA

DATELINE: MACAE, Brazil 

 BODY:
When Petroleo Brasileiro, Brazil's state-controlled energy company, said it would not spend another cent investing in Bolivia after the nationalization of the energy sector there, it was no idle threat. 
 Petrobras, a company that once bartered chickens for imported oil, used to focus solely on guaranteeing the supply of fuel for Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, with 180 million people.
But innovative offshore drilling techniques and an aggressive plan to diversify have enabled the company to shift its focus from production at home toward becoming a player on the global energy market and a major foreign investor. 
 Once largely unknown outside South America, Petrobras over the last decade expanded abroad swiftly, investing in 18 countries on three continents. 
 At a time when many oil companies are holding steady on new production and stockpiling the windfalls of record-high prices, Petrobras is investing aggressively in new sources and using its deepwater drilling expertise to start producing in once-remote offshore beds as far afield as Angola, Tanzania, Turkey and India. 
 Closer to home, it has been raising its profile in the United States, where it recently bought a refinery. And going against the trend, it is stepping up its investments in the Gulf of Mexico, where new drilling operations are being increasingly being sited farther from shore. Petrobras plans to invest $2 billion there by 2010, one of the few companies preparing to go beyond the shallow waters that historically produced gulf oil.
 With its expansion abroad, Petrobras stands out among rival state-run giants that have traditionally dominated the Latin American energy sector. ''In today's market, a company like Petrobras is an exception,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the PIRA Energy Group, a consulting firm in New York. ''They are going outside their borders, exploring new opportunities and diversifying, unlike most other state companies.'' 
 When most people think of Latin American oil, their thoughts turn to Venezuela and Mexico.
 But production by Petroleos de Venezuela, or PdVSA, and Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, remains largely domestic and their output stagnant or falling. Brazil cannot compete with Venezuela or Mexico in terms of reserves, but Petrobras may soon surpass PdVSA to become the second-largest company behind Pemex in production. 
 Petrobras, which remains 55.7 percent state-owned, is investing its rush of profits to bolster output to 2.5 million barrels of oil a day by 2010, up from an average of 1.9 million this year. Its production last year led to net sales of $45.22 billion and a net profit of $10.02 billion, a 50 percent increase from net profit of $6.69 billion in 2004. That puts it on a much stronger financial footing than both PdVSA and Pemex, which lost money last year. 
 The rapid production gains reflect Petrobras's success in developing new deep-sea drilling techniques, enabling it to pump farther from shore than other producers and increase its output more quickly than any other company in Latin America. The techniques, similar to those later developed by giants like Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron, enabled Petrobras in recent years to pump oil from depths once thought inaccessible and helped Brazil to attain long-sought self-sufficiency in oil production early this year.
 In the 1980's, foreign activities by Petrobras were once aimed at negotiating imports, as the company traded machinery and agricultural products for oil from the Middle East. But now, the company is focused on developing deepwater fields abroad.
 ''The priority is no longer ensuring Brazil imports enough oil,'' said Nestor Cervero, director of international operations for Petrobras, in an interview at his office overlooking the bay and surrounding hillsides of central Rio de Janeiro. ''Our international strategy is now about new markets and expanding the business and brand.''
 For all its agility, Petrobras was blindsided in May when Evo Morales, president of Bolivia, nationalized the country's energy sector. Petrobras, the largest foreign investor in Bolivia, was widely criticized for not foreseeing the move and now must renegotiate contracts that supply Brazil with half its natural gas. 
 The setback, though, allowed Petrobras to brandish its growing heft as a foreign investor. Having already spent $50 billion in Bolivia, Petrobras scrapped plans to invest another $2 billion. Instead, it plans to invest in other sources, including imports of liquefied natural gas from Africa. 
 Late in June, Petrobras said it would ramp up overall investments by more than 66 percent over the next four years, investing at least $87.1 billion, mostly on exploration and production, from 2007 to 2011. Of that, $12.1 billion will be invested abroad, especially new offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and new fields off the coast of Nigeria and Angola.
 Petrobras is also beginning to buy foreign refineries to process its growing global output and eventually plans to sell fuel in gas stations in the United States, Europe, and Asia, in addition to its retail sales in South America. In February, Petrobras paid $370 million for a 50 percent stake in a refinery in Pasadena, Tex.
 The growing investments are a sharp contrast to the course being followed by many state-run companies.
 Despite Venezuela's huge reserves, PdVSA produces less today than it did five years ago. Company officials say PdVSA produces about three million barrels a day, all domestically. Yet more than a third of that output, independent analysts say, is produced by foreign companies, who this year by law surrendered a controlling stake in their operations to the domestic giant.
 What is more, PdVSA is investing little in new capacity. Much of today's revenue goes to finance President Hugo Chavez's heavy social spending at home and elsewhere in Latin America. Many analysts say, then, that Petrobras is overtaking PdVSA as the largest producer in South America.
 ''One company is investing in its future and the other in the petroleum diplomacy of their president,'' said Roger Tissot, Latin America director at PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington.
 But the Petrobras strategy has risks. 
 Many of its new investments -- in Nigeria and the Persian Gulf, for instance -- are in politically unstable regions. And the company's management, critics say, remains influenced by Brazil's center-left government, which has been soft on neighboring countries, like Bolivia, whose policies harm the company's interests.
 Executives deny suggestions that Petrobras operates any way other than as a private enterprise. By casting the net far and wide, they say, Petrobras is minimizing exposure to any one country.
 Its investments in the Gulf of Mexico are an example. 
 As with Africa's oil-rich Atlantic coast, where geological similarities to Brazil's shore attracted Petrobras engineers, drilling in the gulf is in increasingly deep waters. The company over the last decade has won leases for 276 sites throughout the gulf, according to the United States Minerals Management Service, which regulates oil exploration.
 But most of those sites remain untapped. 
 That is because Petrobras hopes to introduce platforms that until recently were not authorized in the gulf: floating production, storage and offloading platforms. Increasingly used by Petrobras at home, the floating units are large ships that, like traditional platforms, can be connected by hoses to pumping points on the seabed. 
 But because the floating platforms can navigate -- many are converted oil tankers -- they are more agile in distant waters and can better weather high waves and winds. If regulators approve a Petrobras petition to introduce its first floating production, storage and offloading platform, the vessel would increase the company's production in the region from the current 8,000 barrels a day, to more than 100,000, according to company estimates.
 In Brazil, the P-43 floating platform is moored a 106-mile helicopter ride over the Atlantic from the little airport in Macae, the logistical base for a cluster of 38 platforms northeast of Rio de Janeiro, where Petrobras gets 90 percent of its oil. The $260 million vessel, launched in 2004, is emblematic of the company's innovative reach into deeper waters. 
 In the 1970's, Petrobras built a handful of tiny derricks in the shoals near Macae, where the government hoped a few small oil beds would help reduce Brazil's dependence on foreign sources. Geological tests in later decades, however, indicated large deposits much farther out -- more than 100 miles into the Atlantic and more than a mile underwater. 
 The problem was that no company had ever drilled that deep. 
 So, Petrobras engineers worked with manufacturers to develop pressure-resistant instruments and progressively moved seaward, breaking global depth records along the way.
 ''Petrobras became the leader in deepwater drilling,'' said Tom Marsh, publisher at ODS-Petrodata, a researcher based in Houston that tracks data on offshore energy projects. ''Their oil was offshore and that made the Brazilian coast one big, giant research and development project.'' 
 Amid a circular pod of 20 computers that make up the P-43's control room, teams of analysts one recent afternoon tracked production and naval systems. From there, Rivadavia Freitas, the platform manager, walked to the vessel's stern, where a giant hose awaited the arrival of another ship to offload crude. 
 ''From the platform it goes to refineries on shore or in other countries,'' Mr. Freitas said. ''We export directly from here.''

HEADLINE: A Class-Action Shuffle

BYLINE: By ELLEN ROSEN

 BODY:
For class-action securities-law firms, opportunity is in the air. 
 There is a growing scandal involving the backdating of stock options by dozens of companies, and already lawsuits are mounting.
At the same time, the firm that has been the powerhouse in securities class actions for decades -- Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman -- has troubles of its own, possibly giving its rivals a chance to win clients. 
 After the firm and two name partners were indicted in May on charges that they made more than $11 million in secret payments to three individuals who served as plaintiffs in more than 150 lawsuits -- charges that the firm and the partners have denied -- some large institutional investor clients like the state pension funds of New York and Ohio dropped the firm. 
 While competitors say they are not looking to pick off either clients or lawyers, a number of firms are poised to assume Milberg's mantle.
 Among the most prominent is Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann of New York. The law firm topped the rankings of plaintiffs' law firms for securities class-action settlements last year because of its representation of WorldCom investors, along with a Philadelphia law firm, Barrack, Rodos & Bacine. The settlements with the banks that helped sell WorldCom bonds totaled more than $6 billion. Bernstein Litowitz also reached a $3.2 billion settlement with Cendant in 2000.
 Those settlements are among the three largest after the Enron settlements, which to date have totaled more than $7 billion, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, which tracks securities class actions. (Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins, the law firm started by William S. Lerach after his 2004 split from Milberg Weiss, was lead counsel in the Enron litigation. The total amount from that scandal may grow. The firm, even without Enron, had the largest number of settlements last year, according to the I.S.S. rankings; it also represents the institutional investors who were not part of the Time Warner settlement, Patrick Coughlin, a partner, said.) 
 One Bernstein Litowitz partner, Max W. Berger, attributed his firm's success to the careful vetting of cases. He expects ''some spillover'' from Milberg's troubles, but said that his firm had not ''seen an influx of business just yet.''
 ''Quite frankly it's not something that we're focused on, because we handle our cases and operated well on our own,'' he said.
 Grant & Eisenhofer, based in Wilmington, Del., ranked sixth on the I.S.S. list for last year. The name partners, Jay W. Eisenhofer and Stuart M. Grant, began their careers in the Wilmington office of the giant Wall Street law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom but wanted to be plaintiffs' lawyers. And, like Bernstein Litowitz, the firm is selective, Mr. Eisenhofer says. 
 ''We don't have a single case where we are not lead counsel,'' he said. ''We'd rather take on the extra cost of taking the case and being responsible than having someone else be responsible.'' 
 Both Bernstein Litowitz and Grant & Eisenhofer are among those filing suits against the companies that have disclosed problems with the awarding of stock options. And while a recent study by NERA Economic Consulting found that the overall number of securities lawsuits has dropped, Mr. Berger is sanguine about the business.
 ''There's no shortage of fraud, and no shortage of people who want to capitalize on making money wrongfully,'' he said. 
 Other firms have made a name in securities litigation as well. Heins Mills & Olson, a Minneapolis firm, counts among its clients the Minnesota State Board of Investments, which governs the state's pension funds. Its representation of the state in a lawsuit against Time Warner over overstatements of revenue by its AOL subsidiary resulted in a $2.65 billion settlement, the fourth largest to date according to I.S.S. 
 ''We have practiced nationally for some time, but the order of magnitude of the settlement has attracted clients from around the country who were unaware of us before,'' said Samuel D. Heins, a partner. 
 Entwistle & Cappucci, based in New York, has likewise gained attention for its work in the litigation over accounting irregularities filed against Royal Ahold, the Dutch parent of supermarkets chains like Stop & Shop and Giant. That case resulted in a settlement of $1.1 billion, which to date is the fifth largest. 
 Despite the inroads that some firms are making in the area, Marina Ein, a spokeswoman for Milberg Weiss, said that ''business is good,'' adding that the firm expects to stay active in the options lawsuits that have been filed. Milberg says it has suffered relatively little attrition of lawyers since the indictment. The health care practice group has departed, and the head of the office in Boca Raton, Fla., Maya Saxena, left to open her own firm, although she is currently subletting space from her former employer. 
 Going solo is not for the faint of heart, but Ms. Saxena, six months pregnant with her first child, says she knows the obstacles, especially because plaintiffs' firms typically work on contingency fees, and can wait months or even years until the first settlements.
 Mr. Berger says that ''in a midlevel case, you may have out-of-pocket expenses well in excess of $1 million.'' 
 And while the clients are typically now big institutional investors rather than individual shareholders, the law firms, rather than the institutions, absorb the upfront costs because, as Mr. Heins put it, ''the huge multibillion-dollar funds are fiduciaries and are reluctant to put out the money for litigation.'' 
 In legal circles, meanwhile, speculation that Milberg may seek to merge with another law firm appears to be just talk for now. 
 Stephen D. Susman, a partner at Susman Godfrey in Houston, said that there was ''no truth to the rumors'' that his firm would unite with Milberg. 
 ''We have talked to Milberg about working on some of the cases they're involved in,'' he said, ''but we haven't taken on a single case.'' 
 And while the world of plaintiffs' lawyers is often a sharp-elbowed fray, there is little delight among competitors over Milberg's predicament. 
 ''It's awful on a lot of levels,'' said Mr. Berger of Bernstein Litowitz. 
 Roger W. Kirby, a partner at Kirby, Squire & McInerney in New York, one of the law firms used by the New York state pension fund, says he finds no pleasure in the indictment. 
 ''I'm not enjoying schadenfreude, which I thought I would,'' he said. ''I feel bad for the principals there.''

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Gives Signals of August Rate Rise 

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 6 

 BODY:
Worried about inflation amid strong economic growth, the European Central Bank signaled Thursday that it would raise interest rates in early August, stepping up its pace of tightening credit. 
 Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the bank, vowed that the bank would exercise ''strong vigilance'' in preserving stable prices, a code it uses to hint at a rate increase the following month.
The early August meeting of the governing council, the committee that sets interest rates for the 12 nations using the euro, is typically held by teleconference, in keeping with the European summer holidays, and major decisions are usually deferred until later in the year. But Mr. Trichet, as if to drive home his message, announced that the council would gather in Frankfurt for the Aug. 3 meeting. 
 He also said that he would hold a news conference afterward to explain the bank's decision. The bank generally skips the news conference, since little happens.
 Mr. Trichet's comments were enough to persuade investors that the bank would abandon its quarterly pace of rate increases and tighten again on Aug. 3, two monthly meetings after June's move. Previous rate increases have come at three-month intervals, in December -- when the bank ended a phase of low borrowing costs -- March and June.
 An increase in rates in August would be the fourth in nine months, and would probably bring the bank's benchmark rate to 3 percent. 
 The decision reflects the bankers' strengthening conviction, analyst said, that the economic upswing in the euro countries has continued to gather momentum and that it was threatening to stoke inflation that had been pushed up by oil prices.
 Most of the world's major central banks are pursuing policies similar to the European bank's after a period of relatively cheap money, although they are at different stages of raising rates. The Federal Reserve Board in Washington raised its main rate last week for the 17th consecutive time, to 5.25 percent, while the Bank of Japan appears likely to start tightening rates next week after five years of keeping them near zero.
 Most economists had been betting that the European bank would wait to raise rates until its meeting on Aug. 31.
 Although some economists have speculated that the European bank might opt to raise rates by a half percentage point, Mr. Trichet said there was ''no sentiment'' for moving that quickly, virtually ensuring that it would raise its pivotal rate, currently 2.75 percent, by a quarter percentage point to 3 percent.
 ''It couldn't be much clearer if they stood out in the street and shouted out their plans with a megaphone,'' said Rob Carnell, an economist at ING Baring in London. ''It was extremely blunt.''
 The bank's message Thursday led many economists, including those at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, to project that the central bank would raise rates two more times this year, pushing the benchmark rate to 3.5 percent.
 Hitting that level would put the bank in the position to cut rates if other developments weaken growth, economists said.
 ''Given the uncertainties that hang over next year, it is sensible for the E.C.B. to get rates there by the end of the year,'' said Ken Wattret, an economist with BNP Paribas in London. ''It gives them options next year.''
 That said, Mr. Trichet made it clear that the European bank was intent on preserving its flexibility to act when it saw fit, and not according to any predetermined schedule.

HEADLINE: 2 American Officials Apologize for Crime

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Reporting for this article was contributed by Mona Mahmoud in Baghdad, Iraqi employees of The New York Times in Najaf and Kirkuk, and David S. Cloud and Eric Schmitt from Washington.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 6 

 BODY:
The United States ambassador and the top American military commander here together issued an unusual apology on Thursday for the rape and murder of a young Iraqi woman and the killing of her family, saying that the crime, in which at least four soldiers are suspects, had injured the ''Iraqi people as a whole.''
 The statement came just hours after Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said at a news conference that he might ask the American military to scrap a rule granting foreign soldiers here immunity from Iraqi prosecution. Such a move would be a direct rebuke to the Bush administration, which has fought tenaciously to ensure that American soldiers are exempt from local or international laws when serving on foreign soil.
''I'm about to talk to the multinational forces to reach solutions that will put an end to such practices,'' Mr. Maliki said of criminal behavior by soldiers. One possible course of action, he said, would be to ''revise the issue of immunity.'' 
 ''Our people cannot tolerate that every day there is an ugly crime such as that in Mahmudiya,'' he added, referring to the market town near which the four Iraqis, including a young girl, were killed on March 12.
 Mr. Maliki's assertion, which followed similar remarks he made in Kuwait on Wednesday, signaled the growing furor within the Iraqi government over the latest crime. The incident first became public last week, when the Fourth Infantry Division announced that it was investigating the involvement of American soldiers in the rape and slayings. 
 The rise in political tensions came as sectarian violence continued in Iraq. A suicide car bomber rammed his sedan into a Shiite shrine in the holy town of Kufa, killing at least 12 people, including five Iranians, and injuring dozens, Iraqi officials said. Iraqi and American forces have generally maintained tight security around the southern holy sites of Najaf and Kufa, to which Shiite pilgrims, including many Iranians, flock by the thousands.
 The strongly worded apology issued Thursday night by the top American commander in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., and Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad revealed the deep concern among American officials over the criminal episode's potential to damage the entire American project in Iraq. 
 ''We understand this is painful, confusing and disturbing, not only to the family who lost a loved one, but to the Iraqi people as a whole,'' the two senior officials said in a written statement. ''The loss of a family member can never be undone. The alleged events of that day are absolutely inexcusable and unacceptable behavior.'' 
 The statement is all the more unusual because no soldiers have been convicted yet or even formally charged. On Monday, a recently discharged Army private, Steven D. Green, 21, was arrested in North Carolina on suspicion of rape and murder. Three soldiers, some of whom are reported to have admitted their roles in the crime to investigators, are confined to base in Mahmudiya, 20 miles south of Baghdad, and their weapons have been confiscated.
 Mr. Green was moved Thursday to Louisville, Ky., where, in a half-hour hearing in which he pleaded not guilty, a federal judge ordered continued detention for him. Prosecutors said that Mr. Green, who was discharged from the Army in May before his suspected role in the case was discovered, is scheduled to be arraigned on Aug. 8 in Paducah, Ky. 
 The mayor of Mahmudiya, Mouayid Fadhil, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that American military investigators wanted to dig up the victims' bodies. But Iraq's Justice Ministry must first determine whether exhumation is allowed under Koranic law, he said. The victims' relatives are also reluctant to divulge the burial site out of shame over the fact that one of the dead, a girl as young as 15, was reported to have been raped by at least two American soldiers, the mayor said. 
 Sexual assault is considered one of the most heinous and shameful crimes in Muslim society; even mentioning the subject is often considered taboo. ''We don't want to talk about this,'' Mr. Fadhil said. ''She was raped.''
 The debate over exhuming the bodies could complicate the military investigation. American military officials declined on Thursday to talk about specifics of the investigation, but prosecutors undoubtedly want detailed forensic evidence to build as strong a case as possible against the suspects. The victims were examined by doctors at the local hospital months ago before being buried, Mr. Fadhil said, but the Americans want to check the corpses for themselves.
 The victim in the suspected rape was Abeer Qassim Hamzeh. The others killed were her younger sister, father and mother, Mr. Fadhil said. 
 The case is one of at least five in which the military is investigating or prosecuting soldiers in the killings of unarmed Iraqi civilians. Four were announced in June alone. The Mahmudiya case is the only one that involves the rape of an Iraqi, making it especially incendiary. 
 In another case, in which marines are suspected of killing 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha last November, the second-ranking American officer in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, has completed his review of an inquiry into whether Marine officers tried to cover up the shootings and is expected to announce his findings and recommendations in the next few days, said two military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the findings have not been made public.
 Mr. Maliki said at the news conference on Thursday that the Iraqi government would conduct its own inquiry into the Mahmudiya crime. 
 But Iraqi courts have no power to prosecute the soldiers. An order issued under the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority, which ruled Iraq after the American invasion until June 2004, said that foreign troops, missions and their consultants here are immune from Iraqi law. Orders issued by an occupational authority usually expire when the authority leaves, but the Iraqi Constitution has extended the decrees.
 Mr. Fadhil said that a committee of local officials was prepared to carry out its own criminal investigation but was awaiting orders from the national government. ''Now, the subject has many dimensions,'' he said. ''It's become an international affair.''
 Complicating matters, ''the family doesn't want to say where the bodies are,'' he added. ''The family didn't involve the police when the crime took place. We found out about it only when the Americans revealed it.''
 The American military began its investigation after a soldier described the crime in a counseling session in late June and said he had been involved. American soldiers were notified by Iraqis of the crime on March 12, the day it took place, military officials said. But the Iraqis who had stumbled on the bodies had speculated that other Iraqis had done the killing, since the area is a caldron of sectarian violence. So the Americans did not think of investigating then, officials said.
 A senior American commander in Mahmudiya visited Mr. Fadhil and other local officials on Thursday and ''expressed sorrow for the killing of the family and the behavior of the soldiers,'' Mr. Fadhil said.
 He added that the local investigative committee intended to examine the victims' home. The American soldiers are accused of trying to cover up the crime by burning both the body of Ms. Hamzeh and the house. But the body was sufficiently intact for local doctors to find multiple bullet wounds, Mr. Fadhil said.
 The violence in Iraq on Thursday threatened to ignite further sectarian bloodletting. The suicide car bomb in Kufa had been following two buses carrying Iranian pilgrims and was detonated when the pilgrims disembarked, said Capt. Salem Ghanem, the assistant director of tourist security in Najaf, which adjoins Kufa. Iraqi vendors who had gathered around the pilgrims were among the victims.
 The explosion ripped into the two buses and left behind pools of blood, shredded shoes and bags with food that the pilgrims had been carrying.
 Officials in the Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Kufa are hoping that religious tourism will help strengthen the local economy.
 In Baghdad, two car bombs exploded near a high school, killing at least three people and injuring six. Gunmen in the town of Musayyib shot up a minivan, killing two girls who were just 4 and 6 years-old. Police found two bodies in the insurgent stronghold of Hawija; both the victims had been handcuffed and tortured. 
 In his afternoon news conference, Mr. Maliki said that the government has decided to ban all political activity on university campuses because of rampant violence.
 He also said that a police force with thousands of members assigned to protect government buildings and other installations was filled with criminals and murderers. The declaration was an unusually blunt acknowledgment of the corruption that has plagued the Iraqi security forces. ''It didn't really protect the ministries,'' he said of the force, called the Facilities Protection Service. ''On the contrary, it turned into a partner in the killing.''


CORRECTION-DATE: July 8, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the case of a former American soldier accused of involvement in the rape and killing of an Iraqi woman, and in the killing of members of her family, misstated the date of the arrest. The suspect, Steven D. Green, was arrested on June 30; Monday was the day that prosecutors announced the arrest. (The error was repeated yesterday in an article about the case.)

HEADLINE: Bush Heads to Chicago to Spotlight Good Economic News

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6 

 BODY:
Presidents have for decades bemoaned the Washington press corps. President Bush has discovered an escape valve: with his poll numbers down and the midterm elections around the corner, he is taking his show on the road, holding a full-scale formal news conference Friday in Chicago.
 The unusual event, which will feature local reporters' asking questions of the president alongside the national correspondents who typically travel with him, is part of a new push by the White House to get Mr. Bush more exposure out in the country at a time when many Americans are unhappy with his handling of the economy and the war in Iraq. 
''It's always important to change the playbook a little bit,'' said Dan Bartlett, a senior communications adviser to Mr. Bush, ''and that's what this is intended to do.''
 The changes go beyond the news conference. Mr. Bush usually dips in and out of American cities in an hour or two, but his Chicago itinerary included an overnight stay, a dinner on Thursday night with local opinion leaders and Mayor Richard M. Daley, a breakfast on Friday with business leaders and an afternoon tour of a microelectronics plant in Aurora, in the home district of Representative J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House.
 The trip coincides with the release of the unemployment report for June, which is expected to show fairly strong job creation. Administration officials are using the visit to spotlight the economy. Though it is performing relatively well by most standards, Mr. Bush has not reaped the customary political benefits, and the White House is trying to turn that around. 
 Mr. Bartlett called the visit ''an extended stay,'' and both he and the White House press secretary, Tony Snow, said Mr. Bush would be making more domestic trips.
 ''We can pop in and out of a media market in a nanosecond, give a speech and go,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''This gives an opportunity to really sink your teeth into a city or a region.''
 It also gives Mr. Bush an opportunity to do what he does best: act like a candidate, though one who is not running for anything.
 ''Having an unprecedented press conference out in a region like the Midwest guarantees you huge market penetration, allows local reporters to interchange with the president in a way they have never done and will allow him to come across as a more genuine human being,'' said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist. 
 The president and Laura Bush also appeared on Thursday night on ''Larry King Live,'' in a rare joint television interview timed to coincide with Mr. Bush's 60th birthday on Thursday. 
 Mr. Bush, with his wife by his side in the Blue Room of the White House, spoke on a variety of topics, including North Korea, his drop in popularity and the death of Kenneth L. Lay, the convicted former energy executive, whom the president called ''a good guy.''
 Mr. Bush shrugged off the polls and his declining approval rating, saying, ''I've been popular before as president'' and adding, ''Sometimes things go up and down.''
 Mr. Bush seemed almost cozy with the Washington press corps at Thursday morning's news conference with Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada.
 When a Canadian reporter wished him a happy birthday, Mr. Bush grumbled, ''It's amazing; the first birthday greeting I got from the press came from the Canadian press.'' 
 Then, after discovering that two regular White House correspondents were also having birthdays, Mr. Bush summoned them up to the podium for an impromptu, slightly awkward photo session, which ended with the reporters and photographers singing ''Happy Birthday to You'' to the president.
 ''He asked if anyone had a birthday; I raised my hand,'' said one of the two, Richard Benedetto of USA Today. ''The next thing I knew I was standing there, asking myself, 'What am I doing here?' ''

HEADLINE: Deal on Sales Tax Ends Shutdown in New Jersey

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES; David W. Chen and Laura Mansnerus contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 6 

 BODY:
Gov. Jon S. Corzine and the New Jersey Legislature agreed on a new budget on Thursday that would end a six-day government shutdown that idled nearly 100,000 workers and cost the state millions of dollars.
 Despite the end of the bitter impasse -- which centered on Mr. Corzine's insistence on a sales tax increase -- the governor said that the shutdown would probably not end until late Friday at the earliest, when his $31 billion budget is expected to be approved by the full Assembly and Senate.
Gambling industry officials said that Atlantic City's 12 casinos, which were closed Wednesday morning, could reopen within hours of the budget signing, returning about 50,000 people to work. But more than 45,000 furloughed employees with the Division of Motor Vehicles and other state agencies will probably not return to work until Monday morning, and the timing for the resumption of lottery ticket sales was unclear on Thursday. 
 Beyond the immediate consequences of the shutdown -- from the closing of the casinos and state offices to the halt in automobile inspections and lottery ticket sales -- the weeklong ordeal took a fiscal toll on the state. The casinos estimated that they would lose more than $16 million in revenue a day, of which the state's share is about $1.3 million. And the state lottery delivers more than $2 million a day to the state.
 Mindful of the statewide disruption and civic embarrassment caused by the shutdown, a subdued Mr. Corzine apologized to New Jersey residents on Thursday afternoon for the disruption of government services but said that it was necessary to put the state on a solid fiscal footing.
 While the agreement was widely viewed here as a political victory for Mr. Corzine over the Assembly speaker, Joseph J. Roberts Jr., who had steadfastly opposed the sales tax increase, it came at a cost. In the end, he had to agree that half of the $1.1 billion in annual revenue expected from the tax increase could end up going toward easing the state's nagging property-tax burden.
 The agreement reached between Mr. Corzine and Mr. Roberts after almost a week of difficult negotiations calls for raising the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent. 
 The governor had sought the sales tax increase as part of his budget to help close a $4.5 billion budget gap, and he did not waver from that proposal.
 A person or family spending $400 a week on taxable goods and services would pay about $200 more a year in sales tax under the increase.
 ''While we are understandably encouraged by this agreement, this is not a time for celebration or elation,'' Mr. Corzine said at a news conference in his office. ''Far too many people's lives have been disrupted economically, emotionally. Workers' wages have been lost, business revenues diminished and basic public services interrupted. This absolutely must not happen again.''
 In a significant concession to a bloc of Assembly Democrats led by Mr. Roberts, he agreed to address the property tax issue.
 Plans for how the property tax relief would be granted were being completed Thursday night. One plan would allow voters to decide in a referendum in November whether to dedicate half of the $1.1 billion in new sales tax revenue to easing the state's property taxes -- which are among the highest in the nation.
 If voters approve at that referendum, the State Constitution will be amended to dedicate the money to aid cities and towns for the next decade. That provision, which was developed in the 24 hours leading up to the agreement, was the turning point in the talks, Mr. Roberts said. 
 The agreement might require another referendum next year in which voters will decide whether to dedicate the entire 1 percent increase to help ease property taxes. . Some critics of the agreement questioned whether the plan would provide the kind of sustainable long-term solution for the state's budget woes that Mr. Corzine envisioned.
 ''There will be a structural deficit next year, as well,'' said State Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon County who leads the minority. ''Government has been shut down to raise taxes and, regarding the increase in the sales tax, we are robbing Peter to pay Paul.''
 After years of borrowing and using other one-year fixes to close deficits, New Jersey was in a dire fiscal situation when Mr. Corzine was elected last fall. As part of his campaign platform, Mr. Corzine said that the state must establish new ways to generate revenue year after year, although he promised to increase property tax rebates. His eventual solution was a rise in the sales tax. 
 That increase had been the flash point of Mr. Corzine's $31 billion budget proposal. The governor argued that the $1.1 billion that he expected to raise through the tax was the most effective way to help balance the budget.
 The increase was part of a package of about $2 billion in increases or expansions of taxes. The governor had also proposed about $2.5 billion in spending cuts.
 But Democrats in the Assembly argued that any tax increase should be used to increase municipal aid to offset property tax rates. Mr. Corzine said that the use of a portion of the sales tax increase on municipal aid would not prevent the state from exploring other ways to lower property taxes, including holding a legislative session this summer on subjects like streamlining the state's 566 municipalities.
 ''We have a series of reviews going on that will bring fundamental property tax reform,'' Mr. Corzine said.
 Assembly lawmakers, who face re-election next year, were also concerned about the potential political consequences of the tax increase. During the budget debate, several Democrats recalled the legislative elections of 1991 when -- in the first election after Gov. Jim Florio enacted tax increases -- the party lost 21 of the 43 seats that it had held in the Assembly.
 Ultimately, however, Mr. Roberts apparently gambled that fixing property taxes -- which he has repeatedly said was his top priority as speaker -- trumped the potential pain of enacting a new sales tax.
 ''Property taxes are strangling New Jerseyans each and every day,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''The Assembly's belief was that the sales tax increase should be used for property tax relief, to tackle that problem. This compromise that we have before us achieves that end.''
 The agreement was reached about six hours after the governor addressed a joint session of the Legislature for the third successive day.
 In a rare display of emotion, Mr. Corzine urged all side to engage in ''a serious dialogue about compromise.''
 ''Let us resolve to pass a budget that can be agreed upon and signed today -- we can do this today,'' he said, to applause from the 76 lawmakers in the chamber.
 Then, as Mr. Corzine repeated the word ''today'' three more times and pounded the lectern, virtually the entire chamber rose for a sustained ovation.
 Roughly three hours later, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Roberts were huddled together in meetings with the state treasurer, Bradley I. Abelow, and the Senate president, Richard J. Codey -- who originally put forth the compromise that became the agreement.
 A hint that a deal was imminent might have been Mr. Corzine's decision to hold the talks in Mr. Roberts's office, a sign of deference to the speaker. It was there, one State House official said, that the framework for the deal was reached. 
 Despite the breakthrough, Mr. Corzine himself realized that it might only have been the beginning of a long process. ''We have much more to do in the coming months and years to fix our state's public finances,'' he said.

HEADLINE: New York Plans to Examine Creating a Broadband Net 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Even as a contractor moves ahead with plans to install wireless networks in 10 parks, New York City intends to study whether to establish a citywide broadband network similar to those planned by cities like Philadelphia and San Francisco.
 The study, commissioned by the city's Economic Development Corporation, will examine ''whether there is a need for a citywide broadband network as a municipal initiative'' and what legal, technical, logistical and economic challenges such a project would involve, according to a request for proposals that the city released on June 14.
The request for proposals was mentioned in a brief item in Crain's New York Business on June 26, but has otherwise attracted little attention until yesterday when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg mentioned it. 
 The mayor was addressing a project by the Department of Parks and Recreation to bring wireless Internet access to 18 locations in 10 major city parks, including Central and Riverside Parks in Manhattan, Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt Parks in the Bronx.
 Asked why no Staten Island parks were included, Mr. Bloomberg said: ''The parks on Staten Island tend to be very small, and that's much harder to provide Wi-Fi to. So the first thing we're going to do is do the big parks, and then we'll take a look at the others. And we have actually started to do a study as to what it would take to do long, thin parks or very small parks, finding an economic way to do that.''
 Consultants' proposals for conducting the broadband feasibility study are due on July 21. The first goal would be to assess ''the existing state of broadband services'' and decide whether a citywide network -- or a more limited network -- is needed. If the answer is yes, the Economic Development Corporation could have the consultant stay on to develop an economic and technological approach for the project. 
 The request for proposals noted that ''broadband availability is already high'' in many neighborhoods, but also asked whether wireless access could be made widely available ''at competitive prices'' and whether a network could strengthen the local economy.
 In August 2004, a plan announced by Mayor John F. Street of Philadelphia to blanket the city's 135 square miles with broadband signals attracted national attention. A nonprofit organization created to oversee the project, Wireless Philadelphia, signed a contract in March with EarthLink, an Internet service provider based in Atlanta, to install transmittal devices on about 4,000 streetlights and create 22 free ''hot spots'' around the city. 
 Other cities have followed suit. In April 2005, the city of Tempe, Ariz., hired the MobilePro Corporation of Bethesda, Md., to build a wireless network covering the city's 40 square miles. Last April, San Francisco selected EarthLink and Google to provide free or low-cost wireless Internet access across the city's 47 square miles. Last week, EarthLink opened a Wi-Fi network covering the central area of Anaheim, Calif. All of the city's 50 square miles are to be covered by the end of the year. 
 Dana Spiegel, executive director of NYC Wireless, a local nonprofit group that has been hired by several business improvement districts and companies to set up wireless networks in public spaces, cautioned that the other cities might not be the right model for New York City to follow. ''We're a much bigger city and have a much more complicated set of connectivity problems,'' he said. ''It's unclear that municipal broadband at a citywide level is the solution for New York City.''

HEADLINE: Trenton Chalks Up End of Budget Stalemate to a Poker-Faced Corzine

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 6 

 BODY:
An outsider, they called him when he was elected governor last year. A wealthy dilettante who was supposed to be aloof, even arrogant. A political novice who would never survive the merciless and mysterious trenches of Trenton.
 But when Gov. Jon S. Corzine announced on Thursday that New Jersey had finally resolved its budget crisis, many people in and out of Trenton used another word to describe him: underestimated.
For weeks, Assembly Democrats had warned that Mr. Corzine's proposal to raise the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent would never pass their chamber. As recently as Tuesday, in fact, Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. declared that the proposal was ''dead.'' But Mr. Corzine never wavered from his demand that the tax had to be increased to resolve the state's perennial budget shortfalls. In the end, he showed Trenton the kind of poker face and resourcefulness that propelled him to the top of Wall Street. 
 He did not get it done by bullying people into submission, or doing the kind of political horse-trading that is normal in Trenton, according to legislators and aides. Instead, he calmly kept repeating his message to anyone who would listen, displaying rock-solid confidence that the numbers in his budget would win people over.
 Indeed, it was no accident that he demanded that the Legislature meet on three consecutive mornings to hear what was essentially the same message, an hour that would be considered late for bankers but early for politicians. And he was prepared, aides say, to do what would have been the political equivalent of the movie ''Groundhog Day'': asking them to meet every day, until he had gotten his way.
 ''I think a lot of people underestimated his resolve, and his determination to do the right thing, to do things in a very different way than they had been before,'' said State Senator Barbara Buono, a Democrat from Middlesex County. ''The way budget negotiations were conducted represented a quantum leap in the way things were done before, so you had to expect opposition.''
 Still, the agreement was not a complete victory for Mr. Corzine, who had to yield on something dear to Mr. Roberts, and at a princely sum: At least $550 million of the sales tax revenue will go toward property tax relief next year and possibly in the years beyond that. 
 With New Jersey facing a deficit of at least $2 billion next year -- and even larger ones in future years because of rising pension and debt service costs -- the compromise could hobble Mr. Corzine's ability to fix the state's perpetually troubled finances. Still, the agreement was widely viewed in Trenton as a political triumph for Mr. Corzine. Those who knew Mr. Corzine from his days as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs say that they were not surprised by his actions.
 Whenever there was a major deal or crisis at the firm, Mr. Corzine, a trader by training, was known to stake out a position, based largely on the data he had received, and stick to it. So when he decided to push the Goldman Sachs partners to take the company public in the late 1990's, he was ''indefatigable'' in trying to win skeptics over, according to ''Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success,'' written by Lisa J. Endlich and published in 1999.
 ''He would go out on a limb, prodding, persuading, using his enormous stores of charisma and loyalty to bring the partnership to the action,'' Ms. Endlich wrote.
 This time, he engendered opposition from the Legislature, including from many Democrats who saw his budget plan as a replay of the sales tax increase that Gov. Jim Florio pushed through in Trenton in 1990 -- to disastrous electoral consequences. Then Mr. Corzine rankled legislators by not doing enough to woo them after delivering his budget.
 He acknowledged in a recent radio interview that he should have done more, saying he made a ''rookie'' mistake. 
 Yet through it all, he did not waver from his position, displaying a demeanor that Republicans and Democrats have said remained calm and confident throughout the battle.
 What may have caught some legislators and lobbyists off guard was his refusal to engage in Trenton-style politics.
 ''He was dealing with a bunch of people in the Legislature who didn't know him on Wall Street, and he came into office as an extremely rich guy who bought himself a seat in the U.S. Senate, and they said, 'Here's a guy we can deal with,' '' said Carl Golden, who was a spokesman for two Republican governors, Thomas H. Kean and Christie Whitman. 
 ''A lot of those people in the Legislature are accustomed to the ways things are done: 'For the next judicial appointment in Middlesex County, how about considering my family attorney?' '' Mr. Golden said. ''But he made it very clear to everybody up front that he wasn't going to play that way. And then the bucket of cold reality hit them.''
 Mr. Corzine plodded ahead in a manner reminiscent of a friend of his, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in New York City -- though a 1 percent increase in the sales tax was not nearly as hard to achieve, perhaps, as Mr. Bloomberg's successful push to raise property taxes by 18 percent in his first year.
 ''Bloomberg always said, 'Do the right thing, don't worry about polls,' and I'm sure Jon is the same way,'' said Andrew M. Alper, who worked with both men, first as a partner at Goldman Sachs, then as president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. 
 Mr. Alper added about Mr. Corzine: ''He identified a problem in New Jersey's budget. He saw a way to fix it. He clearly had the patience and the fortitude to stick to that position. And it took a lot of courage.''


CORRECTION-DATE: July 8, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the persistence of Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, a trait that legislators and aides say led to his success in resolving the state's budget stalemate, misstated the percentage by which the state sales tax will increase when it is raised to 7 percent from 6. It is 16.7 percent, not 1 percent.

SECTION: Section B; Column 2; Metropolitan Desk; THE GAY MARRIAGE RULING: ALBANY; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1098 words

HEADLINE: Spitzer Says He Would Do What Pataki and Courts Have Not

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Karen James and Jennifer Medina contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 6 

 BODY:
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said on Thursday that he would draft and propose legislation to legalize gay marriage in New York State if elected governor in November. His comments came after the State Court of Appeals deferred to the Legislature on the issue, leaving the fate of gay marriage in New York to elected officials. 
 Although the right of gay couples to marry has widespread support among Democrats, it has little chance in the Republican-led Senate, with the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, reiterating his opposition on Thursday. 
Any possibility of changing the law in New York State could hinge on the ability of Democrats to overturn the 35-27 Republican majority in the Senate, a development that many in politics do not see as likely in November. Mr. Bruno, however, has been known to change his mind, and gay-rights advocates and lawmakers said his views on civil rights for gay people had shifted markedly during the nearly dozen years he has been majority leader.
 Supporters of gay marriage rights in New York have often pinned their hopes on the courts to legalize such unions, perhaps mindful of the opposition of Gov. George E. Pataki. Now that the courts have rebuffed them, the effort to change the law through legislative means may gain new steam, particularly with Mr. Pataki leaving office.
 Mr. Spitzer, who holds a commanding lead in opinion polls in the race for governor, restated his support even though his office had argued against gay marriage in its official capacity representing the executive branch. 
 ''I believe same-sex marriage should be constitutional, should be legal, should be authorized statutorily,'' he said on Thursday. ''I think in New York there is recognition that this is the right thing to do from a civil rights perspective, and whether that will be sufficient in both the Assembly and the Senate, we'll have to wait and see, but it is something I will draft and propose.''
 Mr. Spitzer's signal that he will actively back the legislation could help its prospects among Albany lawmakers, although many Republicans remain committed to defeating such legislation. 
 The Republican candidate for governor, John Faso, praised the court's ruling and said, ''If elected governor, I will work to ensure that marriage remains a relationship between a man and a woman.''
 The Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, Mr. Spitzer's Democratic challenger, said he did not support gay marriage, but hoped ''we can come together to find other ways to provide gay and lesbians in long-term committed relationships the same economic rights and legal protections.''
 The measure is not even a foregone conclusion in the overwhelmingly Democratic Assembly, where gay marriage bills have stalled for several years, though approval there is far more likely than in the Senate. 
 ''The Court of Appeals decision is going to put this issue on the front burner for the Legislature, so while there has not been a focused effort to move the bill out of committee in the past, that changed this morning,'' said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan, the sponsor of a gay marriage bill.
 ''I would suspect there would be a strong majority for the bill on the floor of the Assembly, but I don't know if anyone has done a head count,'' he added.
 Advocates have been frustrated that the Assembly has not already passed legislation. ''Their excuse has been they've been waiting on the courts,'' said Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the former executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, the main lobbying group for gay rights in the state. 
 ''The reality is there has been no leadership on this issue, or very little,'' he said.
 Bryan Franke, a spokesman for Speaker Sheldon Silver of the Assembly, said: ''The speaker plans to take up the issue of gay marriage with his conference. He thinks it's premature to talk about the matter without first discussing it with the members of the Assembly.''
 But the main battleground would certainly be in the Senate, which has emerged as the unpredictable force in Albany as its Republican leadership courts more moderate voters in the efforts to remain in power.
 ''I am opposed to gay marriage because I believe in the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman,'' Mr. Bruno said on Thursday.
 But he has softened his stance considerably over the years. When he became majority leader in 1994, Mr. Bruno rescinded domestic partner benefits for Senate staff members and also repeatedly blocked hate crimes legislation from coming to a floor vote. But he later reinstated domestic partner benefits and supported hate crime legislation.
 In 2002, he spoke out in favor of the long-stalled Sexual Orientation Nondiscrimination Act, known as Sonda, saying, ''Maybe I have become more enlightened.'' 
 ''I am going to vote for this legislation to express tolerance, antidiscrimination, and just to recognize that people have the right to live their lives as they see fit,'' he added at the time. 
 Senator Thomas K. Duane, a Manhattan Democrat who is gay, said of Mr. Bruno, ''He has absolutely evolved in his thinking, and without his support, hate crimes, Sonda, would not have come to the floor.''
 ''On the issue of marriage, he never made a commitment to me, but he never closed off a discussion, and he never tried to dissuade me,'' he added. 
 Mr. Foreman said Mr. Bruno had moved ''180 degrees on his empathy for gay people, but he will not move before the Assembly does.''
 Political pressure, and money, should not be discounted. 
 While the Conservative Party has opposed gay marriage, gay donors have been flexing their financial muscle. Alan Van Capelle, the executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, said his group's political contributions grew from $40,000 two years ago to an expected $300,000 this year, including contributions to candidates and spending on voter outreach. Recipients have included Senator Michael A. L. Balboni, a Nassau County Republican, who has sponsored legislation supported by the gay-rights groups. The group has also been courting and receiving support from major union leaders. 
 ''Undoubtedly, this is going to be a major debate that we are going to have to take up in the next session,'' said Senator Nicholas A. Spano of Yonkers, another Republican who has sponsored legislation supported by the gay rights groups in the past. 
 ''There's no doubt this will be a difficult debate,'' said Mr. Spano, who said he supports domestic partnerships but has ''not taken a position on gay marriage.''


GRAPHIC: Photos: JUDGE ROBERT S. SMITH -- THE MAJORITY: ''We do not predict what people will think generations from now, but we believe the present generation should have a chance to decide the issue through its elected representatives. We therefore express our hope that the participants in the controversy over same-sex marriage will address their arguments to the Legislature, that the Legislature will listen and decide as wisely as it can, and that those unhappy with the result -- as many undoubtedly will be -- will respect it as people in a democratic state should respect choices democratically made.''
 CHIEF JUDGE JUDITH S. KAYE -- THE DISSENT: ''For most of us, leading a full life includes establishing a family. Indeed, most New Yorkers can look back on, or forward to, their wedding as among the most significant events of their lives. They, like plaintiffs, grew up hoping to find that one person with whom they would share their future, eager to express their mutual lifetime pledge through civil marriage. Solely because of their sexual orientation, however -- that is, because of who they love -- plaintiffs are denied the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage. This state has a proud tradition of affording equal rights to all New Yorkers. Sadly, the court today retreats from that proud tradition.''

HEADLINE: Can a Failure Become A Savior?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
GENERAL MOTORS is in trouble for a lot of reasons, but a major one is the difficulty it has had in competing in the American market with automakers from Germany, Japan and South Korea. So does it really make sense for it to be rescued by Renault, a French company that has failed repeatedly in its efforts to sell cars to Americans?
 Here in Paris, there is some doubt whether Carlos Ghosn, who runs both Renault and Nissan of Japan, could really handle another job, as Kirk Kerkorian, G.M.'s largest shareholder, seems to want. ''The United States is different,'' said one French executive, speaking privately. ''When would he sleep?'' 
Even the French government, which is deeply suspicious of globalization except when a French company emerges triumphant, had trouble deciding whether to be happy. The day after one government minister warned that ''this has to be approached with caution,'' another said the government supported the idea.
 It is no surprise that the French government would have an opinion, or two, about any deal involving a major French company, but that is starting to irritate some of those who are supposedly helped by the government that invented the phrase ''economic patriotism.''
 Some comments this week brought back memories of President Jacques Chirac's observation that Eastern European leaders who differed with him had ''missed a good opportunity to shut up.'' 
 Henri de Castries, the chief executive of AXA, the insurance company, said, ''We should not underestimate the damage caused to the image of France by the use of certain words.'' He told a conference sponsored by Paris Europlace that he was offended when patriotism was used ''as a cover for protectionism.''
 Gerard Mestrallet, the chairman of Suez, a large engineering and energy company that is trying to merge with the state-controlled Gaz de France, wishes people thought the merger was his idea rather than the government's, even if it was announced by the prime minister. ''There is a gap between the impression and the reality,'' he said. 
 It may be that some French executives care more about the impression anyway. ''It is not necessary to hold press conferences,'' said Rene Carron, the chairman of Credit Agricole, a large French bank. ''When it comes to economic patriotism, it should be done, but it should not be spoken about at great length.''
 The other big business story in France is the mess at Airbus's parent company, where a French boss who got his job because of President Chirac's support was forced out, but little else was changed. Europe has trouble deciding whether Airbus is supposed to act like a corporation or an employment project.
 Still, the chance that Renault will get the opportunity to fix an icon of American business provides an opportunity for France to prove that it can compete in a world where profits count more than patriotism or protectionism.
 It may not be easy for a company from a country where the government pays health care expenses of retirees. G.M. could solve a large part of its problems if it could get the American government to pay those bills, but that is not likely.
 Renault will continue to be remembered by some Americans, including me, for its failures. My first car was a used 1958 Renault Dauphine, which broke down so often that the Automobile Club of Southern California threatened to expel my father if we did not get rid of the car.
 If Renault decides to do this as part of a new effort to get into the American market, G.M. may not have reason to celebrate. More competition is not what it needs most.

HEADLINE: Putin Goes Online for Chat, and Russians Want to Know

 BODY:
A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.

TODAY'S TOP STORIES
 President Vladimir V. Putin went digital on Thursday, participating in an online question-answer session with Russian and foreign internet users. The forum, which was organized by the popular Russian web-browser Yandex.ru and the BBC, lasted 2 hours 10 minutes, Gazeta reported, during which time the president answered about 40 questions. The president promised to answer more of the 162,000 questions he received at another time, Gazeta said.
According to Vremya Novostei, the most popular questions submitted by participants related to Mr. Putin's personal life. One user asked when the president lost his virginity. Another frequently asked question was whether Russia would legalize marijuana, Izvestia reported. Mr. Putin responded saying that "Russia is an adherent to an international agreement which considers marijuana among those drugs that are officially forbidden." Other popular topics, said Vremya Novostei, were the military, xenophobia, housing and rights in Russia.
 Mr. Putin began by discussing Tuesday's missile test by North Korea. He clarified, according to Kommersant, that rockets did not fall within Russian waters, but in the Russian economic zone. He played down the incident, said Kommersant, explaining that North Korea did not yet have the technology capable of targeting Russia with its missiles. 
 Participants also submitted questions about Mr. Putin's personal relationship with President George Bush. "I think George Bush is a respectable man and a good partner," Mr. Putin said. "If we agree on some mode of conduct, then he later tries to follow it," Kommersant reported the president as saying. 
 Komsomolskaya Pravda related a testy exchange between Mr. Putin and the BBC moderator Bridget Kendall, in a discussion of hikes in Russian gas prices. After Ms. Kendall submitted the question, the president proceeded to press the moderator on the price of the necklace she was wearing, which she admitted was a few hundred pounds. "You wouldn't want to sell it for five kopeks," Mr. Putin responded, trying to make his point. He went on: "Hysteria in the press [over increases in Russian gas prices for Ukraine] was really an attempt at applying political pressure.... Someone wants to force us to sell gas for throw-away prices. This has stopped."
 Mr. Putin was supportive of democracy and its further development in Russia, Komsomolskaya Pravda reports. "Surely without development of democracy, without free press, Russia won't have a future," the president said. He also urged his audience, said Kommersant, not to think about whether democracy in Russia exists or not, but rather about what is needed to have more of it. 
 Very few participants submitted questions on important social issues, like low wages, poor pensions and children's benefits, Izvestia noted. The newspaper suggested that perhaps this was yet another sign of social and political apathy. Evgeny Rubtov of ROMIR Monitoring, suggested, however, that "internet users are the more successful, able and active part of the Russian population," and thus are not as concerned with material issues, Izvestia reports. 
 According to Gazeta, the idea of the forum came from the Putin administration. The newspaper interviewed Aleksei Makarkin of the Center for Political Technology who said that he believed the event to be political stunt. Andrei Ryabov, who also spoke to Gazeta, added that the event was proposed with the upcoming G8 Summit in mind. The internet conference was a way to showcase Russia's openness amid criticism by western governments of Putin's dismantling of free press and "roll back of democracy," the newspaper reports.

FOREIGN MINSTER URGES DIPLOMACY WITH NORTH KOREA: In an exclusive interview, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, said that while Russia's relationship with North Korea was undermined by Tuesday's missile test, Russia would not press for sanctions. In order to regulate the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, he said, six way negotiations must continue referring to dormant talks involving Russia, the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China and Japan. Sanctions, Mr. Lavrov said, would enable North Korea to continue missile testing without being answerable to anyone. Mr. Lavrov also discussed the upcoming G8 Summit. He noted that no decisions regarding the on-going problems in Iraq and Israel would be made. Rather, delegates will focus on issues of energy security, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. Remarking on criticism of Russia's position vis-a-vis the G8, Lavrov said that "on a serious political level none of our partners doubts or has doubted our membership in the G8 or the competency of our presidency."

VREMYA NOVOSTEI

CLEANING UP FOR THE G8: The militia is purging the streets in St. Petersburg and the neighboring village of Strelna of illegal immigrants, homeless people, and even dogs and cats in anticipation of the G8 Summit. So far 25 illegal immigrants have been arrested and deported. People attempting to enter the cities will only be permitted with a special pass disseminated by authorities on Thursday. Some residents of Strelna are concerned about whether a long standing gypsy camp will be destroyed as well. The militia is promising complete protection for the residents of Strelna, who are worried that their city will become a meeting place of antiglobalists arriving in the area from around the world.

NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA

TOILETS FOR ANTIGLOBALISTS, OR PETERSBURG CREATIVITY?: Nezavisimaya Gazeta muses on methods by which St. Petersburg city officials plan to deal with antiglobalist protestors during the Group of Eight Summit. Officials did not need much time to think of a way to deal with the protestors who caused considerable damage and ruckus during previous summits. The decision was made to "send the antiglobalists off to the Kirov Stadium and provide them with porta-pottis." In such a way the problem can be dealt with "in a smart and effective manner." First of all, Russian portable toilets are "cramped and not very comfortable." It is not, needless to say, conducive to hooliganism. Secondly, while in other countries the toilet is meant for "sending away natural necessities," in Russia, a public toilet is meant for "beating someone up." Therefore setting the antiglobalists up with portable toilets is, well, "not very pleasant." Nezavisimaya Gazeta, therefore, congratulates the St. Petersburg governor on her great idea for taking care of those who would create trouble during the summit.

NOVIE IZVESTIA

THE SIEGE OF ST. PETERSBURG: Preparations ahead of the Group of Eight Summit are quickly turning into a nightmare for local residents. Authorities are telling residents to sit quietly at home while all air, water, and rail transportation around the city will be cut off for the duration of the event. Road construction and building remodeling along the main streets have made sections of the city, such as Moskovsky Prospect, unreachable. In addition to the construction, residents are subject to safety inspections. One Petersburg resident, Dmitry Vasilev, whose windows look out onto one of the main streets, Kamenoostrovski Prospect, came home to find a federal agent waiting for him. "I walked up to my apartment and I met a colonel from the FSB," he said, referring to the security service. "He explained that because my windows look out on a federal highway, I must be checked for political and terrorist-related reliability," Mr. Vasilev said. The police are likewise checking up on political activist groups like the National Bolshevik Party. One member told reporters that the police have "long talks" with him and his fellow National Bolsheviks after they are held for questioning after protests. The only positive side of the summit for many seems to be the long-awaited repairs being conducted on some buildings that "have not been touched for 50 years."

KOMMERSANT
 The St. Petersburg Deputy Prosecutor said Thursday that members of the extremist group, Sour, falsely confessed to a series of prominent crimes, including the murder of a Tajik girl, to further their nationalist agenda. While the group is guilty of a number of crimes, including the murder of a Senegalese student, it had no connection with the Tajik girl's murder or with the murder of a Vietnamese student or a five year old Roma girl, he said. He confirmed that the militia was justified in shooting Dmitry Borovikov, also a member of the group, when the suspect attempted to resist arrest.

HEADLINE: Tail Is Wagging the Internet Dog

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL. 
E-mail: whatsonline@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE media columnist Jack Shafer was confused, and maybe a little jealous. He wondered last week why a two-year-old article by Paul Boutin, his fellow Slate writer, was suddenly drawing huge traffic numbers. Mr. Boutin's article was a light, news-free feature about a Web site (tired.com) that asks users if they are tired, and if they are, to explain why. Mr. Shafer, meanwhile, was pounding away on columns about the hottest media topics -- and drawing considerably less traffic.
 ''Not to take anything away from Boutin,'' Mr. Shafer wrote, ''but the piece isn't anywhere near his best'' (slate.com). 
Mr. Shafer found a reason for the sudden surge of traffic: somebody had come across the old article and posted it to Digg.com, where registered users vote on which articles are the most (or the least) interesting or worthwhile. 
 Chris Anderson, editor of Wired magazine, would no doubt see this as a perfect example of ''the long tail'' in full wag. The lengthening of the long tail means that old or minimally popular stuff -- like an old Slate article or a new album by an obscure Bolivian folk musician -- is becoming more valuable thanks to the falling costs of production, storage and distribution. Or as Mr. Anderson puts it on his blog, markets are ''increasingly shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of 'hits' at the head of the demand curve and toward a huge number of niches in the tail'' (longtail.com).
 He first wrote about this phenomenon in Wired two years ago, igniting a lively online conversation that continues. His book on the subject ''The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More'' will hit shelves on Tuesday.
 Thanks to technologies like the Internet, ''there is now less need to lump products and consumers into one-size-fits-all containers,'' he writes. So, for example, most record stores don't stock Frank Zappa's 1968 album ''Cruising With Ruben and the Jets.'' Ten years ago, it would have been difficult to find. Now, it can be bought with the click of a mouse, or instantly downloaded from an online music service.
 This might all seem obvious, but Mr. Anderson argues that the implications are vast, complex and not understood nearly well enough.
 Moving the economy, and the culture, ''from mass markets to million of niches,'' he writes, amounts to nothing less than a reordering of society, affecting everything from world markets to your plans for this weekend.

FISHING FOR INFORMATION -- The Monterey Bay Aquarium offers Seafood Watch, an online database that helps consumers choose their fish based on health and environmental factors. For instance, enter ''salmon'' into the search form and you learn that the coho, sockeye and king varieties are rated ''best'' and that you should ''avoid'' farmed chinook and Atlantic salmon because fish farmers often use pesticides and antibiotics (mbayaq.org).
 Swordfish populations are rebounding, but imported swordfish remains a problem partly because fishermen often ''accidentally catch threatened or endangered sea turtles, sharks and sea birds in large numbers.'' The site offers alternatives and provides links to scientific reports. 

INTERNET IN-BOX -- The Internet is ''not a big truck,'' Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, informed his Senate colleagues on June 28. ''It is a series of tubes.''
 Mr. Stevens was assailing a proposed amendment to a bill in the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee; he is the committee chairman. The amendment, which failed in a tie vote, would have barred Internet service providers from charging fees to give some companies speedier access to the Internet. (The audio of Mr. Stevens's comments is at publicknowledge.org.) 
 The Net is neutral, with all content providers having the same level of service, in terms of speed. Mr. Stevens says this is a problem.
 ''Just the other day,'' he said, ''an Internet was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning on Friday and I got it yesterday. Why? Because it got tangled up with all these things going on the Internet commercially.'' DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: Latino Funds Help Family Businesses With Posterity in Mind 

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif. 

 BODY:
When Daniel D. Villanueva, a former place kicker for the Los Angeles Rams and the Dallas Cowboys, hung up his football cleats for a career in broadcasting in 1968, he tapped into something big. The fledgling Los Angeles television station he joined helped form the Spanish International Network, which ultimately grew into Univision Communications.
 Univision has just agreed to sell itself to a group of private investors for $12.3 billion. The proceeds of an earlier sale of the company -- to Hallmark in 1989 -- expanded Mr. Villanueva's fortune, recently estimated at $179 million, and that allowed him to start an investment fund for Latino entrepreneurs.
 Now what intrigues Mr. Villanueva, 67, most is nurturing small companies and inspiring entrepreneurs to become the backbone of the next generation of Latino businesses. ''The new generation is university- trained as opposed to the founder-builders who were not trained,'' Mr. Villanueva said. 
 He and his son Daniel L. Villanueva, 47, as well as Gabrielle Greene, a longtime investor in media, have formed a new investment fund of almost $100 million. 
 Their company, Fontis Partners, has joined with Rustic Canyon Partners, a fund that invests for the prominent Chandler family of Los Angeles, to form RC Fontis Partners. The word ''fontis'' come from fuentes, or fountain, in Spanish. The fund is so named, the younger Mr. Villanueva said during a recent interview at the RC Fontis Partners offices here, ''because we think of it as a wellspring of capital and inspiration for entrepreneurs and family businesspeople.''
 Indeed, the new venture aims to funnel investments to family companies, many of them in need of capital to expand or to make the transition from family to professional management.
 Such ethnic generational investment is a growing field, now attracting about $2 billion from pension funds and institutions eager to tap into the growth of the 2.7 million companies owned by Latino American families. To be sure, the still-small size of most Latino family companies limits the amount of investment they can absorb. RC Fontis Partners sets a limit of $5 million to $10 million in any single company. 
 ''Purchasing power in the Latino community nationwide has accelerated in the last 10 years,'' the younger Mr. Villanueva said. ''What used to be the corner shop is growing into major companies.''
 Juan Solana, chief economist for Hispanic Business magazine, estimates that the aggregate purchasing power of the Hispanic population of the United States is $768 billion a year and that by 2010 it will be $1 trillion. Indeed, in the last few years, major global financiers, including Goldman Sachs and the former Treasury secretary Nicholas F. Brady, have joined groups backing Latino family companies. 
 Hispania Capital Partners of Chicago aims its investments at firms serving the Latino market, said Victor Maruri, a co-founder of the fund that has raised $125 million from pension funds and banks in three years. In 2004, for example, Hispania took a 40 percent interest in Samy Holding, a maker of hair care products popular in Latino communities.
 At that time, Samy's chief executive, Luis Delgado, was selling through neighborhood hair salons and the Home Shopping Network. ''He had $2 million in retail sales and $8 million through HSN,'' Mr. Maruri recalled. ''So we helped him get retail distribution. And today he has $40 million in retail sales through Target, Wal-Mart, Walgreens and Costco. The major chains are desperate for products that appeal to the Hispanic market.''
 Less than a year old, RC Fontis Partners so far has made a single investment: just under $5 million in a San Antonio company that publishes Rumbo, a Spanish-language newspaper. But it is considering investments in two food companies, a specialty manufacturer of construction tools and two financial service firms. It plans to do two to three investments a year, and ultimately, to have 10 to 12 investments. 
 The pace of RC Fontis investments is about right, said James Montgomery, head of the investment banking firm Montgomery & Company, based in Santa Monica, Calif. ''The lead time for investments can be 12 to 18 months,'' Mr. Montgomery said. ''It takes a while to get into a market and sort through what is interesting. Their pace of investment is not too slow; they probably have a five-year window to put out the money.''
 Recalling an earlier occasion when he co-founded Bastion Capital in 1992, perhaps the first Latino-led investment fund, Mr. Villanueva said, ''My instincts told me that the smaller-level, $5 million to $15 million investments were the place where we could do the most good.'' 
 One entrepreneur whom Mr. Villanueva backed was Thomas Castro, whose El Dorado Communications acquired three radio stations in Texas in 1993, and sold them in 2003, for $140 million. Mr. Castro went on to found Border Media Partners and to acquire six radio stations with the help of an $18 million investment from the Villanuevas and other Latino investors, including the Tony Sanchez family of Laredo, Tex.
 ''It's a time of change for family businesses,'' Mr. Castro said. ''I acquire radio stations from family owners who served a different time and market and change them to Spanish format and music for today's market.''
 Border Media now owns 35 radio stations and recently received $75 million in investment for expansion from Vestar Capital, a private equity fund with $14 billion in assets. 
 Good returns on investment are an obvious reason for big-money enthusiasm. ''We aim for returns of 20 percent to 30 percent a year over five-year terms,'' the younger Mr. Villanueva said. ''We are patient capital; we don't get interest payments or dividends. We invest on the basis that the business will succeed and provide a return to our investors.'' 
 Many public pension funds, including the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which invests in RC Fontis, seek a ''double bottom line'': a benefit to businesses in minority communities as well as a good financial return on investment.
 There is a social aspect in the need for capital among Latino family businesses. Frequently the question is one of generational transitions, the time when families decide whether to take outsiders into the business. ''The truth is that outside professional managers bring discipline and make it a better company,'' Mr. Villanueva Jr. said. ''But at first it's uncomfortable because you have to rationalize why you're doing it.''
 The senior Mr. Villanueva cites as an example a company he has not invested in but which he now leads as chairman of the board. Juanita's Foods is a small company in Wilmington, near Los Angeles harbor, that makes and distributes canned menudo (a soup that contains tripe) and other Mexican specialties in supermarket chains.
 The owner, George de la Torre Jr., had modernized his father's fish-processing business by obtaining licenses to can and distribute the Mexican delicacies. But in recent years the time came for decisions about passing on management to two sons and a daughter or bringing in outside management -- and ownership. The solution, Mr. Villanueva said, lay in a middle course.
 The family has set up an independent board and hired a professional manager to run and expand the business, Mr. Villanueva said. ''The family are still the sole shareholders and they give us parameters.''
 But the company is run by a new chief executive, Rick Alvarez, a marketing expert, and an independent board of three directors, including Mr. Villanueva. ''Rick is going to expand the business with new products and we are hiring other professional staff,'' Mr. Villaneuva said.
 The ambitions of the Villanuevas and other Latino entrepreneurs these days go beyond strictly financial returns. Mr. Villanueva Sr.; Mr. Castro of Border Media; and Henry G. Cisneros, the former secretary of housing and urban development, are among many other Latino business executives backing the New America Alliance, an organization that first met five years ago in Santa Fe. 
 ''We wanted to do something to promote opportunities for Latino American young people but we didn't want to interfere with other organizations or take government money,'' Mr. Villanueva recalled. ''So we went around the room and raised $1 million in 15 minutes for the New America Alliance, which has two purposes: education and philanthropy.''
 The alliance holds annual conventions on Wall Street to promote jobs for young Latinos in the financial industry.
 ''We want to encourage the development of our human capital,'' he said. ''We are encouraging our young people to go to business school and to pursue careers in financial services.''

HEADLINE: Jobs Data Indicates Economy Is Slowing

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Employers added only 121,000 jobs in June, the government reported yesterday, indicating that the economy was slowing under the combined weight of high energy prices and rising interest rates. 
 But the government also reported that hourly wages rose at their fastest pace in five years, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.6 percent. This suggests that the labor market remains tight and may yet spur higher inflation.
The disparate data underscored the uncertain economic situation facing the Federal Reserve as it ponders whether to continue raising interest rates over the summer to cool the economy further or whether it is time to pause. Over the last two years, the Fed has steadily increased the benchmark federal funds rate from 1 percent to 5.25 percent.
 ''Today's numbers only tighten the vise the Fed finds itself in,'' said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist of LaSalle Bank in Chicago. ''The challenge is not to be overly restrictive as growth slows and still attentive to inflation risk.'' 
 Financial markets' reaction to the news was mixed, underscoring the difficulty in parsing an uncertain situation that seems poised between a cooling and an overheating economy. 
 Stocks slid, weighed down by concerns about the implications for inflation of the rising wages recorded in the employment report as well as an earnings warning from 3M and lower-than-forecast sales from Advanced Micro Devices. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index were down more than 1 percent. [Page C6.]
 Most Wall Street economists had been expecting considerably higher payroll growth. So, the price of Treasury bonds rose and the dollar fell against major currencies as the weaker job growth supported the view held by some investors that a slowing economy would allow the Fed to pause in its monetary tightening.
 Noting that the data suggested both that demand would slow and that the forces pushing inflation could intensify, Mr. Tannenbaum said, ''There's a fine line between stagflation and a soft landing.'' 
 With consumer prices rising at an uncomfortable rate of around 4 percent, the Fed and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have been expecting the economy to slow from the torrid pace of 5.6 percent growth recorded in the first quarter. A slowdown would help damp the inflationary pressures that have been strengthened by rising energy prices.
 The weak payroll growth recorded in June by employers surveyed by the Labor Department appears consistent with this view, pointing to a cooling economy, weighed down by a slower housing market and moderating consumer borrowing and spending. 
 Added to lackluster job growth in April and May, the weak hiring pattern in June brought the pace of job creation to about 108,000 a month in the second quarter, down from 176,000 in the first three months of the year. 
 Employment in the construction sector remained essentially flat -- declining by 7,000 jobs as a contraction in residential building was offset by growth in construction of factories and other nonresidential structures. Employment fell at temporary-help agencies while the retail sector shed jobs for the third consecutive month. 
 ''We have had three months of very modest employment growth, which is consistent with an economy that has changed its underlying path,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now chief forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers. ''The economy has slowed consistently, and momentum doesn't look like it is building.''
 This would suggest, some economists argued, that the Fed's string of 17 interest rate increases since 2004 is starting to do its job. The Fed could thus leave interest rates at 5.25 percent at its next meeting in August, rather than raise them by another quarter of a percentage point. ''I think the Fed's going to pause,'' said Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. 
 Still, some economists noted that other indicators pointed to tightness in the labor market. In particular, hourly wages grew by 3.9 percent compared with June 2005, the fastest pace in five years. Moreover, the index of weekly hours worked, the broadest measure of labor use in the economy, increased by 0.4 percent in June.
 ''For me, it is not clear-cut that the labor market has downshifted,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at Bear Stearns. ''Rather than there is lack of demand from employers, it may be that low unemployment has left fewer people to hire, so instead employers are paying their existing workers more and are working their work force for longer hours.''
 To be sure, since the economy emerged from recession in 2001, wages have been merely trying to catch up with inflation, not spurring it. Consumer prices rose by 4.1 percent in the 12 months to May -- dwarfing wage gains. Though the inflation figure for June is not yet known, it could well overshadow the 3.9 percent annual gain in hourly wages last month. 
 Moreover, labor productivity has been growing rapidly, keeping a lid on the rise in employers' spending on labor.
 ''I've been surprised that wages have not already accelerated more than they already have in light of the strong economy and the low unemployment rate and the way headline inflation has constrained real wages,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Banc of America Securities.
 Still, several analysts observed that the overall employment data does not support an optimistic view of inflation prospects, and do not let the Fed off the hook. With unemployment at its lowest since July 2001, wage pressures could build up more. 
 ''I expect the Fed will continue to go,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research. ''The only part that supports a pause by the Fed is the headline payroll number. But on balance, the strength is still seen in the numbers.''
 Other indicators also suggest that the labor market remains tighter than the payroll numbers might suggest. Some 387,000 jobs were created in June, according to the survey of households, released by the Labor Department in tandem with the employer survey used to calculate payroll growth.
 While the employer survey is considered a more reliable indicator of the strength of the labor market, the household survey is thought by some economists to better capture jobs created by small and newly formed companies. 
 And other unofficial indicators pointed to relatively strong hiring. This week, the payroll company Automatic Data Processing said that its payroll data suggested that employment increased by 368,000 in June. 
 The index of the online job search firm Monster.com -- a leading indicator of job growth, based on help-wanted postings -- recorded a solid increase in June, driven by demand for white-collar workers. Some skilled occupations, like accounting, auditing, information technology, health care and transportation, appeared to be facing worker shortages.
 ''Our employer customers continue to report concerns over turnover, particularly in occupations with acute skill shortages,'' said Steve Pogorzelski, president of Monster Worldwide. He added that the index showed growth in 18 of the 23 occupational categories used by the government and declined in only 2: personal care and services, and farming forestry and fishing.

HEADLINE: An Optimistic Japan Appears Set to Resume Charging Interest 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
CENTRAL banks have been raising interest rates in every major industrial country, except one. Next week, however, it is widely expected that Japan will join the club, raising its main rate from the level of zero percent that it has maintained for years in an effort to get the slumbering economy growing again. 
 The last time the Bank of Japan tried to rise above zero, in 2000, the economy promptly went into another recession, and the rate was cut back to zero the next year. Now more than a few politicians are calling on the bank to hold off, but it is widely expected that it will act on Friday. This week's quarterly Tankan report seemed to assure action. That survey, of thousands of Japanese businesses, showed a better business climate than at any time since 1991, when it was just starting to become clear that the Japanese bubble had burst.
The survey is customarily shown as a diffusion index, in which the number of companies saying business conditions are unfavorable is subtracted from the number saying they are favorable. As can be seen from the chart, each quarter this year has given a reading of 20 among large companies, reflecting in the second quarter a total of 27 percent that thought conditions were favorable and 7 percent that saw them as unfavorable. Most viewed them as neutral.
 Another part of the survey showed that companies were increasing their capital spending plans, planning to raise spending by 11.6 percent this year. That was well above expectations.
 The current level of optimism is a long way from the ebullience that characterized Japan in the 1980's, when it seemed to go from economic success to economic success and the United States fretted over its trade deficit with Japan in much the same way it now focuses on China. At the height of optimism in 1989, the index was at 53.
 But during the 10 years from 1993 through 2002, there were just six quarters when more big companies thought business conditions were favorable than unfavorable. At the bottom, during the Asian financial crisis of 1998, the figure was minus 47.
 One reason for the optimism is that Japan's troubled banking system appears to be regaining its health after a prolonged period of dealing with bad loans left over from the bubble years, when capital was cheap and readily available, and many dubious investments were made. 
 For the last six quarters, the difference between the percentage of large companies saying banks are accommodative and those saying lending conditions are severe has been above 20, a level last seen in 1997.
 Optimism is not as great among smaller companies, which are less likely to benefit from strong export markets. Indeed, among very small companies, there are still more companies saying conditions are unfavorable than favorable. But that has been true every quarter since 1992, and there is less pessimism this year than at any time since 1991.
 Can business optimism survive positive interest rates? It appears that the Bank of Japan is again ready to take the chance.

HEADLINE: Sanctions Lifted, Libya Withholds Final Lockerbie Payment

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7 

 BODY:
Libya is holding off on making hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to the families of Americans killed in the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The payment appears to have fallen victim, at least for now, to a Libyan desire for a prominent public acknowledgment of its rehabilitation, according to people expert in the dispute.
 The payments were to have been made when the United States removed Libya from the list of states that sponsor terrorism, which Washington did on June 30. 
In August 2003, Libya promised payments of $10 million for each American on the Lockerbie plane, which carried 259 people, mostly Americans, to be paid in installments, and put $2.7 billion in escrow in a Swiss bank. It released $4 million for each victim in September 2003, as agreed, when the United Nations ended its sanctions, and $4 million in 2004, when the United States lifted some economic sanctions. The last $2 million was supposed to be paid when the United States took Libya off the list of nations supporting terrorism.
 But the settlement negotiated between Libya and lawyers representing the victims expired in July 2004. The American lawyers arranged a series of extensions, the last of which expired in February, according to lawyers for the American victims.
 On May 15, the State Department gave a 45-day notice required by law that it intended to normalize relations with Libya. Near the end of the 45 days, on June 25, a Libyan lawyer representing his government said in a press release that ''the settlement agreement expired, and the Escrow Account agreement also came to an end.''
 ''Consequently,'' his statement continued, ''the remaining amount for which the corresponding condition had not been fulfilled was returned to its source.''
 The State Department lifted the sanctions five days later, without announcement, though the Libyans were seeking a public embrace. 
 According to a government official involved in foreign policy, who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the topic, Libya was seeking an invitation to the White House for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, or at least a visit to Tripoli by an important American official.
 State Department officials have said that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been discussing making such a visit, but that she had decided not to do so, yet.
 Pan Am 103 was a Boeing 747 en route to New York from London. It exploded over the Scottish village of Lockerbie. All those aboard were killed, as were 11 people on the ground. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence agent, was sentenced by a Scottish court in 2001 for 270 murders; he must serve at least 27 years before he is eligible for parole, the court ruled.
 The Libyan press release, which said Libya was no longer obligated to make any payments, was attributed to Judge Azzam Eddeeb of the ''Libyan Legal Team.'' It did not rule out eventual payment, saying ''we shall deal with these cases most transparently and in complete good faith.''
 The statement dealt with three Libyan attacks: the Lockerbie plane, the bombing of La Belle discotheque in what was then West Berlin in 1986, and the bombing of a French airliner in 1989. The disco was frequented by American servicemen and the bomb killed three Americans and seriously wounded about 90, according to the American lawyers. The bombing of a jet belonging to U.T.A., a French airline, over Niger , killed all 171 people aboard. 
 But Stuart H. Newberger, who represents seven American victims in that crash and the owner of the plane itself, a DC-10, said there had been no recent negotiations, and a court judgment against Libya was approaching. A lawyer for the disco victims, Steven Perles, said there had been no settlement. 
 James P. Kreindler, a lawyer who specializes in aviation disasters, said that only the Lockerbie escrow agreement had lapsed, not the underlying compensation agreement. And action by the United States government was delayed, he said, because the Libyans had plotted in 2004 to kill Abdullah, then the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. 
 ''Libya can't get a windfall for that,'' he said, contending that the Libyans would benefit from their plot against the Saudi prince if that kept them on the terrorism list long enough to save them from making the last payment to the Lockerbie victims.
 He added: ''They are looking for a lot of public recognition for their new role in the world. I'm sure our settlement is a piece of that puzzle.''
 In a briefing on May 15, Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said the settlement was between the government of Libya and the American plaintiffs. ''We weren't party to that agreement,'' he said.
 State Department officials acknowledge, however, that compensation by Libya to the American victims of its terrorism was a prerequisite to the normalization of relations that is now under way, 
 The House of Representatives, at the urging of the American families, passed a bill before the July 4 recess that included a provision preventing the opening of an American embassy in Libya or a Libyan embassy here until the payment is made. The provision was introduced by John E. Sweeney, a Republican from upstate New York, who cited a couple in his district whose daughter, son-in-law and two granddaughters died on the plane, among others.
 The Senate has not acted on the legislation. 
 The Libyan mission to the United Nations did not respond to a telephone message seeking comment.

HEADLINE: China Fights Sanctions To Punish North Korea

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE and NORIMITSU ONISHI; Warren Hoge reported from the United Nations for this article and Norimitsu Onishi from Seoul, South Korea.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 7 

 BODY:
Japan introduced a Security Council resolution on Friday calling for sanctions against North Korea for its missile test-firings, but China opposed the move, saying such action could disrupt diplomatic efforts under way in the region.
 As the diplomacy unfolded, Christopher R. Hill, the top American negotiator with North Korea, was in Seoul, South Korea, trying to rally support in that region for a tough, unified response to the North's testing of seven missiles on Wednesday.
Mr. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, met with Chinese officials, including Li Zhaoxing, the foreign minister, in Beijing before arriving in Seoul on Friday evening. 
 China agreed that resuming the six-nation talks over North Korea's nuclear program was a priority, Mr. Hill said. But it did not appear that he had made progress in persuading the Chinese to endorse sanctions. 
 At the United Nations, Kenzo Oshima, the Japanese ambassador, said he hoped for a vote as early as Saturday, but Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, the ambassador of France, which is president of the Council, said that a date would be announced Monday.
 Britain, France and the United States are sponsors of the measure.
 The decision to put the resolution to a vote followed meetings Thursday and Friday involving Japan and the five permanent members of the Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- that failed to establish common ground. China and Russia said they preferred the less forceful measure of a presidential statement, which is nonbinding and does not threaten punishment.
 Entering the American mission for the gathering Friday morning, Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, said, ''A resolution might have negative reactions in the region.'' He added, ''The Security Council's message should be responsible, taking into account the possible consequences.''
 Diplomats said Mr. Wang made the point forcefully in the closed consultations, and he told reporters afterward, ''If this resolution is put to vote, there will be no unity in the Security Council.''
 Asked whether he might exercise China's veto, he said, ''All possibilities are open.''
 The resolution condemns the missile firings, orders Pyongyang to cease missile development and recommit to a moratorium on launchings and urges member states to prevent missiles and missile-related items from reaching North Korea. It also calls on countries to keep the North from selling or transferring any such materiel. 
 Drawn up under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the resolution ''strongly urges'' North Korea to rejoin the six-party talks on its nuclear program.
 Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, which also favors a presidential statement instead of a resolution, remained silent during the consultations, according to diplomats. Emerging from the Council chamber, he brushed aside reporters' requests for comment.
 John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador, signaled a willingness to continue negotiating the text of the resolution. ''We're certainly prepared for further conversations as other diplomatic efforts in the region continue,'' he said.
 But he added: ''We want a resolution. It should be Chapter VII, and I think that's clear. The level of provocation engaged in by these North Korean missile launches warrants that, and we're going to proceed.''
 Mr. Hill is expected to meet South Korean officials over the weekend before flying to Tokyo and Moscow, but he gave an indication on Friday of the message he is expected to convey. ''We shouldn't have business as usual with a country that's been firing off missiles like this in this rather reckless way,'' he said.
 South Korea said Friday that it would go ahead with four-day, high-level ministerial talks with North Korea next week in Pusan, South Korea. But South Korea said that it would delay shipments of food and fertilizer to the North and that it had turned down an offer, made by North Korea several days before the launchings, to hold military talks. 
 North Korea fired the missiles, including the new long-range Taepodong 2, despite warnings not to by its friends in China and South Korea.

HEADLINE: The Environmental Procrastination Agency

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Now that the Supreme Court has gotten itself into the global warming debate, the justices face a choice: Should they rule in favor of environmental groups, or in favor of the environment?
 The court agreed last week to hear a case brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups seeking to empower the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide from cars. To David Schoenbrod, the case sounds unfortunately familiar.
In 1972, as a lawyer for the council, he started the litigation that forced the E.P.A. to take lead out of gasoline. Technically, it was a victory for environmentalists, but it took so long that Schoenbrod decided his comrades in the movement had made a big mistake -- the same mistake they're now making with carbon dioxide. They keep expecting the E.P.A. do an impossible job. 
 They still believe in the Spaceship Earth management style, as Schoenbrod describes it in his book, ''Saving Our Environment from Washington.'' They still imagine the planet as a ship that must be guided by a wise captain, aloof from politicians and voters, who issues orders from the bridge with the help of his trusty crew of technocrats and lawyers. 
 ''The idea in creating the E.P.A. was that only an expert agency insulated from politics can protect the public and the environment,'' says Schoenbrod, now a professor at New York Law School. ''But what it really does is insulate Congress from responsibility for making tough choices. The legislators can take credit for passing laws protecting the environment, and the agency takes the blame for the inevitable delays and compromises and costs.''
 When the E.P.A. was created in 1970, Schoenbrod naively expected it to quickly deal with the known dangers of lead in gasoline. But the agency stalled through both Republican and Democratic administrations because neither party wanted to be blamed for hurting oil refiners or raising gasoline prices. The E.P.A. didn't get the job done until 1985, when it was politically expedient because the economics had changed and oil refiners favored getting rid of leaded gasoline. 
 The E.P.A. would have a far tougher time regulating carbon dioxide because the issue is so much more complicated than lead pollution. There isn't an obvious technical fix for bureaucrats to mandate. The potential sacrifices are enormous and would inspire at least a decade of wrangling and litigation. Any serious solution requires international cooperation. The only way to come up with a workable plan is for politicians to debate and negotiate.
 Schoenbrod's modest proposal for saving the environment is to strip the E.P.A. of its rule-making powers and convert it into an advisory and enforcement agency. It would do technical studies and make recommendations, leaving the lawmaking up to legislators -- usually legislators outside Washington. Except for some large-scale problems, like acid rain or global warming, Schoenbrod thinks that most environmental questions should be settled at the state and local level. 
 His ideas, of course, are not popular in Washington. Corporate lobbyists find it easier to work behind the scenes at the E.P.A. than to conduct public fights on Capitol Hill or in state capitals. Environmental groups also prefer federalizing issues, partly because they've got centralized operations themselves, and partly because they espouse the ''race to the bottom'' theory: if Washington were to delegate power, the states would be so desperate to protect jobs and attract industry that they'd compete to have the weakest environmental rules. 
 But in practice, as Schoenbrod demonstrates, Washington stops local officials from racing to the top. After the dangers of lead were recognized in the 1960's, New York City began taking steps to encourage unleaded fuel, but it and other localities were pre-empted from passing stricter rules once that became the job of the E.P.A. 
 While Congress and the E.P.A. have been dithering about global warming, California is requiring carmakers to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide. New Hampshire has ordered power plants to restrict carbon dioxide and other pollutants. More than a dozen states, including Texas, require utilities to use renewable sources of energy.
 While the Kyoto accord is dead in Washington, a coalition of Northeastern states is setting its own Kyoto-style limits on greenhouse emissions and establishing a market for trading carbon-dioxide credits. 
 If the states keep setting examples, Congress may finally feel enough pressure to do something itself on global warming. But if the Supreme Court decides to entrust that job to the E.P.A., don't expect any commands from the Spaceship's bridge any time soon.

HEADLINE: The Credit Game Is Getting a Second Scorekeeper 

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN.

 BODY:
Few things in life are as important as understanding your credit score, the number that lenders use to determine the interest rate you pay.
 To many consumers it has always been mysterious, and it's about to become even more so.
That is because the credit reporting agencies -- Experian, TransUnion and Equifax -- have come up with their own version of a credit score, called Vantage-Score. They are not doing this because they want to help consumers or expand the sale of their $6 credit score reports. 
 They are doing it because they want lenders to start using their scoring system. That is where the real money is; the Fair Isaac Corporation, which reported $798.7 million in revenue last year, dominates the market with its classic FICO credit score.
 The computer programs of Fair Isaac analyze the data on a credit report and predict whether a borrower would make a late payment of 90 days or more. It associated those odds to a score of 300 for deadbeats and 850 for sterling borrowers. Half of America's consumers are above 720 and half are below it. 
 If a borrower was rated at 720, a lender knew the odds of that borrower's being a credit risk were the same no matter what credit bureau the data came from. The FICO score broadened the availability of credit to more consumers, and -- there is a dark side to everything -- enabled the marketing of those preapproved credit card offerings that fill mailboxes. 
 A few years ago, when Congress began making noises about regulating scoring, Fair Isaac started to educate consumers about their scores. Its www.myfico.com Web site is one of the best sources for information about your credit score and how to improve it. It is also where you can go to buy a credit score report.
 If you want a credit report, you are entitled to a free one from each agency each year. Go to www.annualcreditreport.com to get those. Don't go anywhere else.
 The credit agencies have tried to grab Fair Isaac's business before with their own proprietary credit scores. The products were not widely adopted by lenders because each agency used a different scoring system with different scoring ranges, which made it difficult for lenders to manage risk. It left consumers confused because each agency gave out a different number. It was not unusual to see variance of a hundred points or more, a frightening prospect because a hundred points can mean the difference between an 8.13 percent mortgage and a 6.76 percent one. 
 The agencies banded together in March 2005 and buried their rivalries long enough to come up with VantageScore. They said the new system improves risk prediction by weighing more factors. They also said it more accurately measured consumers with ''thin files,'' their term for someone with a short credit history. 
 The VantageScore also takes into consideration the changing styles of borrowing, as in, for instance, the way Americans use their home as a bank by taking out home equity loans. ''It reflects more current behavior,'' said Stan Oliai, vice president for consulting and decision analytics at Experian.
 VantageScore has some virtues for consumers. The consortium assigns a letter grade to groups of scores, making it easier to understand. If you have A credit, you know you are at the top of the class. If you receive a C, you know, because you have undoubtedly heard it from teachers, that you have room for improvement. 
 Like Fair Isaac, the credit agencies also assign a three-digit number score. Their scores are from 501 to 990. 
 They knew it would be confusing, but they said they had to use three digits because if lenders are going to adopt their system, the lenders would want to keep the same software that has three spaces for a credit score. Fair Isaac had cleverly staked out the dead center with its range.
 The credit agencies created Vantage-Score to lure lenders; what consumers think is secondary. ''I wouldn't say consumers don't matter,'' Mr. Oliai said, ''but getting lender adoption is the sharp end of the spear.''
 When you need to borrow money to buy a car or a house, a lender may explain that you had a credit score of 750. Good? If the lender is using FICO, you'll get the best interest rate. If the lender is using VantageScore, however, you are considered strictly average.
 For the consumer, you have gone from having a bit more clarity about why lenders are quoting a particular interest rate to murkiness. Tom Quinn, vice president for scoring for Fair Isaac, has a vested interest in protecting the FICO score from competition, but he does have a point: ''If I want to be empowered, I want to know the tool that the lender is using.''
 The solution is to ask every lender what system it is using. Most lenders will not be using VantageScore for at least six months, probably as long as 18 months. Each lender needs to test the scoring system to see how effective it is at measuring credit risk and how it compares with a next-generation FICO score that Fair Isaac has developed to compete against it. 
 Until VantageScore catches on -- and it might not -- there is no need to buy a VantageScore report. (Experian is the first to offer the reports at www.vantagescore.experian.com.) There is no reason to buy any credit score unless you are unsure of how good your credit is and you will be borrowing in the next six months to a year. It will take at least that long to improve the score.
 Fair Isaac points out another potential problem. The two systems assign different weights to various factors of consumer credit use to come up with a score. It is possible, but a consumer will never know for sure, that some behavior might improve one score, but hurt another. 
 Mr. Quinn of Fair Isaac bought his VantageScore to compare it. His company placed him in the 76th percentile of creditworthy Americans, meaning that 24 percent of Americans have better credit. His VantageScore made him look better. It said he was in the 89th percentile. He does not know why. 
 The report that came with his competitor's score also said that he would have done even better if he had more available credit. That advice befuddled Mr. Quinn because opening another credit card account or raising his credit limit on existing cards could boomerang and make his FICO score worse. 
 The discrepancies are unlikely to happen often because Fair Isaac and the credit agencies agree on the main things that make a good borrower. They consider paying your bills on time as next to godliness. They all say that the longer your credit history, the better your credit. Get credit, but don't use that much of it.
 Are the two scoring systems equivalent? Who knows? Fair Isaac says it does not know. The same is true of Experian. ''Like everything in the credit industry, it is still a big black box,'' said Matt Fellowes, a senior research associate at the Brookings Institution who has studied credit scoring. 
 Consumers will never know because they will not have access to the algorithms and the estimated 200 million credit files. No one will know until lenders crunch the data.
 There is nothing that anyone can do about it. No one likes monopolies; competition is praised because it offers choice and usually lowers prices. That's what will happen for the real consumers of credit scoring -- the lenders.
 For the rest of us, it is going to be confusing.

INSURER DISCUSSES BID FOR AMERUS -- Aviva, the largest insurance company in Britain, said it was in talks to buy the AmerUs Group, an insurance company based in Iowa, in a deal that would increase its presence in the American market.
 AmerUs, of Des Moines, confirmed the talks but said there was no assurance a transaction would result. The company provides life insurance and annuity products and has a market capitalization of $2.4 billion.
 AmerUs Group's major operating subsidiaries include the AmerUs Life Insurance Company, the American Investors Life Insurance Company, the Indianapolis Life Insurance Company and the Bankers Life Insurance Company of New York.
 Analysts say a successful bid would have to be at a premium. Stock in Amerus rose $4.39, to $66.90 a share yesterday. If a deal is reached, Aviva said it expected to pay for it with combination of Aviva's internal resources, external debt and a sale of Aviva shares. (AP)

LABRANCHE SHARES FALL 24% -- Stock in LaBranche & Company, the New York Stock Exchange market maker, fell 24 percent after the company forecast an unexpected second-quarter loss. Stock in LaBranche fell $3.02, to $9.42 a share. 
 LaBranche said it expected to report a second-quarter net loss of about $23 million, in contrast to a profit of $8.7 million a year earlier. Revenue for stock trades using LaBranche's own capital fell to $20 million in the second quarter from $47 million a year earlier.
 The chief executive, Michael LaBranche, left, said the slide in global equity markets during May undermined trading opportunities in stocks, options and exchange traded funds. The New York Stock Exchange composite index, which tracks all the companies listed on the Big Board, had its biggest monthly decline in May since 2002. The second-quarter results included a $17 million loss because of a decline in the value of shares LaBranche owns in the NYSE Group. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

BID FOR FALCONBRIDGE EXTENDED -- Xstrata extended its hostile takeover bid of 16.1 billion Canadian dollars ($14.5 billion) for the Canadian nickel miner Falconbridge by two weeks, to July 21. The previous deadline for the offer, 52.50 Canadian dollars a share, was yesterday.
 Xstrata pushed back the bid deadline after the Canadian government extended its review of the deal. 
 ''I wouldn't be wholly surprised if they increased their offer at a later date,'' said Greg Smith, a London-based analyst at the investment adviser Fat Prophets. Xstrata is battling a rival offer for Falconbridge from the Phelps Dodge Corporation, which said on June 26 that it had agreed to acquire Falconbridge and Inco of Canada for about $35.4 billion.

MERGER IN DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING -- Primedex Health Systems will buy a rival, Radiologix, for $82.5 million in cash and stock to become the largest operator of diagnostic imaging centers in the United States.
 Investors in Radiologix will receive $3.59 a share in cash and Primedex stock, 60 percent more than the closing price on Thursday, Primedex said. The combined company, to be called Radnet, will operate 132 centers and generate more than $400 million in annual revenue.
 Primedex, which is based in Los Angeles, valued the transaction at $208 million, including debt to be acquired. Radiologix has $45 million of cash and $170 million in debt, said Miles Highsmith, an analyst at Wachovia Securities. Shareholders of Radiologix, based in Dallas, will own 33 percent of Radnet, Primedex said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

HORIZON HEALTH CUTS FORECAST -- The Horizon Health Corporation sharply cut its fiscal 2006 earnings view for the second time and lowered its 2007 outlook, setting off a 32 percent decline in its share price. Horizon, citing a decline in its contract management business, lowered its outlook after the close of market trading Thursday. Stock in the company, which is based in Lewisville, Tex., fell $6.46 yesterday, to $13.83 .
 Horizon also posted lackluster results for its fiscal third quarter, which missed Wall Street's expectations by 6 cents a share. The company said it expected fiscal 2006 earnings a share to be 78 cents to 80 cents. Horizon had previously projected 2006 earnings of 92 cents to 97 cents, which was cut from a February forecast of $1.08 to $1.12. (DOW JONES/AP)

JOB DECLINE IN CANADA -- Canada's economy unexpectedly lost jobs in June, the first decline this year, led by builders, retailers and wholesalers. Employers shed 4,600 workers last month, while a drop in the labor force kept the unemployment rate at 6.1 percent, the lowest since 1974, Statistics Canada said.
 The report suggests the Bank of Canada's seven rate increases since September are slowing an economy the bank says is at full capacity, and may allow policy makers to pause at their meeting on July 11. 
 Builders laid off 19,200 workers in June, while wholesalers and retailers laid off 16,700 employees. Factory employment, which has tumbled 8.5 percent since the end of 2002, fell by another 4,100 workers in June. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

AWARD WIDENED IN CABLE CASE -- The DirecTV Group, the biggest satellite television company in the United States, may owe at least $37 million more in damages and interest to the Finisar Corporation in a patent case.
 Finisar is owed $25 million in additional damages for DirecTV's infringement of a data-transmission patent, plus at least $12 million in interest, Finisar said. Finisar won the case after a nine-day trial last month. At issue in the case, which was filed in April 2005, was a patent for transmitting and broadcasting digital information to a wide base of recipients, Finisar said June 26.
 DirecTV was ordered to pay Finisar, a maker of optical-networking systems, $78.9 million on June 23 after losing the case in Beaumont, Tex. Finisar, citing a ruling in Beaumont, said the added payments were awarded because of the willful nature of the infringement. DirecTV said it would challenge the decision. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

PROFIT INCREASES FOR GAZPROM -- Gazprom, the Russian natural-gas producer, said that profit rose 49 percent last year, less than expected, as costs ballooned by almost a third after. Net income rose to 315.9 billion rubles ($11.8 billion), from 211.7 billion rubles a year earlier, the company said. Gazprom said expenses rose 30 percent whjle revenue rose 43 percent to 1.4 trillion rubles. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

HOME DEPOT'S MARKETING CHIEF LEAVING -- Home Depot said its marketing and merchandising chief, Tom Taylor, is stepping down after 11 months in the job. Mr. Taylor, 40, is leaving the company at year-end and will help find his successor, Home Depot said. He will become a consultant to the company and said he planned to spend time with his family.

HEADLINE: Fighting Diseases With Checkbooks 

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
When Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of the Oracle Corporation, pulled back recently from a plan to donate $115 million to Harvard, Richard L. Sprott was reminded again of the tenuous nature of his livelihood. 
 Mr. Sprott is the executive director of the Ellison Medical Foundation, a philanthropy that has received $175 million from Mr. Ellison mostly to aid research on the science of aging. Although the Harvard situation was unrelated to the foundation -- Mr. Ellison reportedly changed his mind about donating after the resignation in February of Lawrence H. Summers, the president of Harvard, amid a storm of controversy -- the events reinforced for Mr. Sprott his awareness that his organization also depended on a single billionaire.
''We exist only so long as Larry's happy,'' he said. 
 Wealthy individuals, through their philanthropies and the causes they support, like Michael R. Milken for prostate cancer and Michael J. Fox for Parkinson's disease, are a growing force behind medical research these days. 
 And with the largess comes concern about a potential overreliance on the generosity of the wealthy. 
 ''To rely on a few philanthropic organizations, however rich and well intentioned they are, does present significant risks,'' said Nicolas de Torrente, executive director in the United States for Doctors Without Borders, which provides health care in developing countries.
 The spotlight on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which experts say is already setting much of the world's agenda when it comes to fighting diseases in developing nations, has brought such concerns to light. The foundation was helped greatly last week when Warren E. Buffett said that he was giving the foundation $31 billion, most of his fortune. The gift will double the foundation's assets. 
 The world is fortunate that Mr. and Mrs. Gates are focused on health problems of the developing world, Mr. de Torrente said. But, he added, ''What happens if they change their mind or de-emphasize something?''
 He said there needed to be an institutionalized multinational system to assure such research takes place. The World Health Organization, at its meeting in May, took some initial steps to start planning such an effort.
 Another concern is that governments will cut spending if they believe that philanthropies are taking care of a problem. A study done last year by the London School of Economics and the Wellcome Trust said that so-called public-private partnerships -- a recent phenomenon governments, charities and companies uniting to develop drugs for neglected diseases -- were being financed mainly by philanthropies. 
 ''We are in a current climate where the government is saying 'Let philanthropy do it,' '' said Sara Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center, a research organization. 
 Others say that wealthy philanthropists can spend their money on their own pet causes, either to support their business or their ideological interests. 
 An example is the Dr. Robert C. Atkins Foundation, which was started by the late creator of the Atkins Diet to prove the benefits of eating low-carbohydrate foods. After he died in 2003, his wife, Veronica Atkins, who also said she wanted to vindicate her husband's reputation, became chairwoman. When Mrs. Atkins dies, the foundation's assets will grow to more than $500 million from about $40 million now, making it even more of a force in nutrition studies. 
 But the foundation, which has endowed chairs at several medical schools, says it is now supporting general research in diabetes and obesity. It has no relationship to Atkins Nutritionals, a company started by Dr. Atkins to sell low-carb foods and other products. 
 Abby Bloch, executive director for programs and research at the foundation, said it believed in the benefits of the Atkins diet, ''but we don't insist the investigators whom we support or sponsor believe this or prove this.''
 Of course, while reliance on philanthropy has some risks, so does reliance on governments and private companies. Drug companies generally direct research toward diseases of the wealthy countries. Governments can change course, as when administrations change, and programs can be tangled in politics or subject to corporate influence. 
 Philanthropies can try approaches that governments might not want to take or can help the development of drugs that pharmaceutical companies might not develop on their own. 
 Wealthy donors, for example, are now supporting much of the research on human embryonic stem cells in the United States because the Bush administration opposes the part of that work that results in the destruction of human embryos. 
 In California, foundations started by some of the state's wealthiest business executives are providing $14 million to the state's stem cell research program, while $3 billion in state funding is tied up in litigation.
 Charities can also move faster in some cases. The World Health Organization ''doesn't have the power to get massive amounts of things happening quickly,'' said Barry R. Bloom, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, who has long been involved in W.H.O. activities.
 Mr. Bloom, who is working under a grant from the Gates Foundation to develop new vaccine technologies, said that organization can fashion more effective programs. 
 Philanthropy, to be sure, has long played a vital role in medicine, as it has in education, culture and other areas. In the early part of the 20th century, the Rockefeller Foundation essentially eradicated hookworm in the United States and developed a vaccine for yellow fever. 
 The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, founded in 1953, now supports about 300 university scientists. In Britain, the Wellcome Trust, founded in 1936, has long been a major backer of medical research and in recent years helped pay for the Human Genome Project. 
 One question is whether wealthy individuals should set up their own philanthropies or give money to existing organizations with experience. Mr. Buffett was praised last week by some experts for not creating a monument to himself. 
 But some philanthropists say they want to actively manage how their money is spent or do something not done by others. James and Virginia Stowers have put much of their fortune from starting American Century Investments, the mutual fund company, into creating the Stowers Institute for Medical Research, which opened in 2000 in Kansas City, Mo. 
 David Welte, an adviser to Mr. and Mrs. Stowers, said others had recommended that the couple -- both of them cancer survivors -- give their money to an existing institution because leading scientists might not want to move to Kansas City. But the couple were loyal to their city and also wanted to create a new type of research institute, more collegial and free of some of the bureaucratic tangles in universities, he said. 
 It is too early to judge the scientific track record of the institute, which does research on genes and cells. It has about 350 employees and an endowment of about $2 billion.
 Some experts say that the Gates Foundation is singularly influential, in part because of its vast resources and also because it deals with development of drugs for malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases that do not attract much attention from drug companies and other charities.
 ''You'd look 100 years previously to find someone as influential,'' said Eugene R. Tempel, executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, alluding to the early days of the Rockefeller Foundation. 
 In the United States, philanthropies generally provide less money toward a particular area of research than the government's National Institutes of Health, which has a budget of more than $28 billion a year. Drug and biotechnology companies spend tens of billions of dollars a year on research and development. 
 So philanthropies often try to achieve an effect by galvanizing more government spending and putting money into things the government or companies are not doing. 
 The Prostate Cancer Foundation, started by Mr. Milken, who had that disease, spends about $20 million a year on research on the disease compared with more than $500 million by the government and $1 billion by industry, said Leslie Michelson, its chief executive. 
 But the foundation and Mr. Milken's advocacy are generally credited with helping sharply increase government and academic activity in the field. And the foundation's annual conference has become a leading opportunity for scientists to share ideas and data. 
 Executives at foundations said they saw a growing role for themselves. The National Institutes of Health budget has been stagnant in the last few years and it is becoming harder for scientists to obtain government grants. Government grants, they say, also rarely go to scientists with radical ideas with a small chance of success. 
 Philanthropies are also becoming more directly involved in developing drugs, not just sponsoring academic research. Investors have become more cautious about backing early-stage biotechnology companies, preferring instead companies that already have drugs well into clinical trials. That has left a funding gap between academic research and later-stage drug development. 
 ''Our strategy is to be in that sweet spot,'' said Deborah Brooks, president of the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. The charity hopes to spend $25 million this year on research.
 Indeed, it seems business and philanthropy are converging into what is sometimes called venture philanthropy. The Epilepsy Therapy Development Project, a charity that has raised about $5 million, has invested in companies developing drugs for that disease, both to help the companies along and to reap a profit to spend on more research if a company becomes successful.
 One of the most active in drug development is the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. It has spent more than $100 million in the last few years screening chemicals to see if they would make drugs, helping to run some clinical trials and giving grants to biotechnology companies.
 ''We believe we have to reduce the risk of companies to come into the field of cystic fibrosis,'' which is a rare disease, said Robert J. Beall, chief executive of the foundation. The foundation has played some role in virtually all of the nearly 30 drugs in development for the disease. 
 Some philanthropists play very active roles. Hans-Werner Hector, a co-founder of the German software giant SAP, read a newspaper article in 2001 about the struggles of Therion Biologics, a Cambridge, Mass., company trying to raise money for development of a so-called cancer vaccine. He put in more than $100 million, or 90 percent, of the company's financing, and became its major shareholder, said Mark W. Leuchtenberger, chief executive. 
 Mr. Hector could have also profited from its success. But last week, Therion announced that its pancreatic cancer treatment failed to prolong lives. It is likely his money will, in effect, be a charitable gift after all.

HEADLINE: Drastic Action, Modest Result In New Jersey

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 7 

 BODY:
By shutting down the New Jersey government for nearly a week, Gov. Jon S. Corzine has shown his political rivals that he has the resolve to win a costly showdown with a Legislature grown accustomed to financing its spiraling spending by borrowing with abandon.
 But behind his stylistic victory over Democratic legislators, the budget plan Mr. Corzine forced through a battle-weary Legislature will probably have only a modest effect on the factors that have made New Jersey, one of the nation's richest states, one of the most fiscally troubled ones as well.
By increasing the state sales tax to 7 cents on the dollar from 6 cents, Mr. Corzine has tapped into a new stream of revenue that will raise about $1.1 billion a year and close this year's $4 billion budget shortfall. But at least half of that money will go toward property tax relief next year and possibly more in the years beyond that. And the sales tax increase will leave state leaders less flexibility to cope with next year's budget, when increases in retirees' health care costs, pension obligations and school financing are expected to present New Jersey with a gap of at least $2 billion. 
 So although some of Mr. Corzine's aides were crowing that the show of political resolve had marked his emergence as a first-rate arm-twister, the governor himself termed the agreement ''a halting first step.''
 As sleep-deprived legislators went through the process of drafting the budget agreement into law on Friday, Republicans here -- who as the minority party were essentially locked out of the debate -- were still startled at just how much trouble the Democrats went through.
 The impasse idled more than 100,000 workers and cost the state more than $3 million a day in lost revenue from closed casinos and halted lottery sales. It was believed to be the first time that a state government controlled by one-party rule had been shut down by such a struggle.
 And for all of the talk of Mr. Corzine's victory over his fellow Democratic lawmakers in the Assembly, Republicans were quick to point out that his prize was a political land mine -- a tax increase.
 ''They shut down the government in order to raise taxes,'' said State Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon County who has earned a reputation for fiscal prudence by criticizing borrowing by both parties. ''There's still going to be a structural deficit. It's hardly a good day for the citizens of New Jersey.''
 As much as some Republicans have clearly enjoyed the spectacle of Democrats battling with one another, the budget problems that greeted Mr. Corzine when he took office in January were a bipartisan creation. Over the past 10 years, governors and legislative leaders from both parties have relied on a variety of borrowing schemes to avoid tax increases while spending more and more.
 While other states used the low interest rates of the past several years to free up money by refinancing debt, New Jersey has gone on the equivalent of a borrowing spree. 
 For instance, the state borrowed against its proceeds from the tobacco settlement, and against future toll collections on the public highways. Now, with other states now reaping the benefits of their frugality and an improved economy, New Jersey finds itself saddled with costly interest payments and few attractive borrowing gimmicks left. Indeed, a study in the spring by the National Conference of State Legislatures found that 42 states were expecting a surplus.
 ''In 11 states, the state government cannot take on general obligation debt and in other places, culturally, it's unacceptable to borrow, so if they want to build a road or a new school they pay up front, in cash,'' said Arturo Perez, a budget specialist for the conference. ''But New Jersey isn't one of those places, and over the past few years, the way that power to borrow has been used has led them to where they are today.''
 For all the anger that some New Jerseyeans have expressed this week about silent slot machines and padlocked state parks, many of the most shortsighted fiscal decisions over the past decade were devised, in part, to avoid rekindling the fury some residents unleashed in 1990, when Gov. Jim Florio called for sweeping increases in the sales and income taxes. Outraged demonstrators converged on the State House and emblazoned Mr. Florio's likeness on rolls of bathroom tissue to protest the proposed levy on paper products.
 Mr. Florio dropped the paper tax, but won a Pyrrhic victory by forcing a $2.8 billion increase through the Legislature. In the years to come, antitax groups harnessed that anger and ousted Democrats from power in both the Assembly and the State Senate. 
 Then, in the 1993 campaign for governor, Christie Whitman, a Republican, swept Mr. Florio out of office with a pledge to slash the state's income tax.
 Mrs. Whitman made good on that promise, but rather than pay for those tax reductions solely with spending cuts, her administration found creative ways to borrow. The most notable was her plan to issue $2.8 billion in bonds in 1997 to keep the pension system afloat. In the short term, the move allowed the state to plug a $590 million budget hole and reap benefits from the surging equities market. 
 But the drop in the market after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, took the luster off the deal, and the bonds have cost far more in interest payments than they have earned.
 When Mrs. Whitman left for a cabinet position in Washington in 2001, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco served out the remainder of her term as an acting governor and, in a gesture that won favor of the state workers' unions in a legislative election year, granted a 9 percent increase in pension benefits.
 When the next campaign for governor came along, James E. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate, seized on public unease with the Republicans' fiscal management and promised to end the ''runaway spending and reckless borrowing.''
 Once in office, Mr. McGreevey accelerated both and relied on a bevy of one-time gimmicks to keep the state afloat.
 After two years of modest growth in spending, Mr. McGreevey's final budget in 2004 bulged with a 17 percent increase, and was financed by a $2 billion borrowing plan. The State Supreme Court, in ruling that the plan was in violation of New Jersey's constitutional mandate for a balanced budget, allowed it that year but said similar methods could not be used again.
 The state's debt -- which increased to $15.7 billion from $4 billion in the 1990's -- jumped to $28 billion while Mr. McGreevey was in office. The cost of New Jersey's annual debt service rose to $2.1 billion from $1.45 billion, and Wall Street twice lowered the state's credit rating.
 Robin Prunty, an analyst from Standard & Poor's, said New Jersey's budget problems are a culmination of years of trying to forestall the inevitable and that with the new budget, Mr. Corzine has begun trying to turn the state toward fiscal responsibility.
 ''In many other states they took a more balanced approach to the problem when there was a fiscal downturn, by doing a mixture of spending cuts, revenue increases and nonrecurring income,'' said Ms. Prunty, a director of public finance. ''New Jersey relied more heavily on the nonrecurring income which, of course, just pushes the problem off until next year. And this is what next year looks like.''
 So what about next year? 
 With pension and health care costs rising, the state will probably face another lean budget year and Mr. Corzine will again be forced to choose between more tax increases or painful spending cuts. But even some Republicans acknowledge that Mr. Corzine has changed the terms of Trenton's budget debate by facing down his Democratic rivals and halting the state's reliance on debt and fiscal sleight-of-hand.
 ''I think it also sets a tone for the remainder of Corzine's term,'' said Carl Golden, a spokesman for two Republican governors, Thomas H. Kean and Ms. Whitman, who now does political communications and consulting work. ''He may be new to all of this, but he's going to be firm and very resolute for what he believes in.''

HEADLINE: Tensions Grow Over Mexico Vote as Opposition Plans Rally Today

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and GINGER THOMPSON; Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 7 

 BODY:
Mexico hung in limbo on Friday, as tensions rose between those seeking a recount in the presidential race and those seeking to accept Felipe Calderon as the winner and move on.
 After a tally showed that the two top candidates were separated by 243,000 votes, the election has exposed deep divides in society, along class and regional lines. The voting has put the strength of the young democracy to its toughest test.
A day after election officials said Mr. Calderon, an advocate of free trade, had won the narrowest of victories, the country seemed more on edge than on a high. 
 Supporters of Mr. Calderon's leftist rival, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, girded for fights in court and on the streets, beginning with a rally scheduled for Saturday. Mr. Calderon's supporters and allies called on Mr. Lopez Obrador to concede defeat for the good of the country. 
 The uncertainty caused consternation among citizens of all political persuasions.
 ''This man Lopez Obrador makes people afraid, and his worst fault is that he lies to people and can stir up violence,'' said Sandra Sanchez, 38, a designer who voted for Mr. Calderon. ''He should recognize his defeat already, because if he says he defends the people, he should know the people don't want to fight.''
 Consuelo Castillo Guerrero, 63, an impeccably dressed retired saleswoman, plans to march in support of Mr. Lopez Obrador. ''We want absolute transparency, because we're not convinced,'' Ms. Castillo said. ''I think that if things were as clean as they say, then what's the inconvenience of recounting?''
 The White House was quick to support Mr. Calderon. President Bush called to congratulate him in the early afternoon for receiving the largest number of votes, even though he had not officially been declared president-elect. Mexican law requires the electoral court to ratify the results. 
 ''The president also noted the solid foundation of the U.S.-Mexican relationship and his confidence in Mexican democratic institutions,'' said Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
 The European Union said Friday that there was no evidence of major fraud or irregularity in the election, Reuters reported. Election observers, who visited a third of the country's 300 electoral districts during voting last Sunday, ''did not report incidents or irregularities that could cloud the transparency of the counting process or affect the results,'' said Ignacio Salafranca, head of the European Union team.
 Mr. Calderon took the role of president-elect on Friday in a meeting with foreign correspondents. He discussed plans to improve relations with the rest of Latin America, to strengthen the commitment to human rights and to making the country a magnet for investment to help generate jobs and keep Mexicans from migrating to the United States.
 When asked about the polarization that threatens to undermine confidence in his government, Mr. Calderon, 43, said he would work to rebuild relations among his rivals in Mr. Lopez Obrador's Democratic Revolutionary Party. Mr. Calderon also made clear that he was prepared to use his National Action Party's new plurality in Congress to sway support from other parties and govern without Mr. Lopez Obrador's party if it tries to block him.
 Mr. Calderon said he was not worried about a legal challenge to the election because most evidence indicated that he had won the most transparent presidential election in Mexican history. He said the irregularities found in the first count were minor. And he made clear that he would not support a new count.
 ''This is a plural country,'' he said. ''And everyone's first responsibility, especially mine, is reconciliation.'' Mr. Calderon said he received a congratulatory call on Sunday from President Vicente Fox, who has withheld public comment on the election. Congratulations came from governments that included Canada and Spain, as well as the United States. 
 The Mexican stock market seesawed all week as the news changed. By the end of the week, it had gained 3.6 percent. Wall Street analysts agreed that Mr. Calderon's victory seemed unassailable, but warned investors to settle in for a long wait until the election was confirmed.
 The United States ambassador here, Antonio O. Garza, wrote that although the electoral process was not complete, ''I believe the actions of Mexico's current administration and the political parties, and the transparency of the I.F.E., have not only strengthened civic pride, but assured Mexico of its place in the world as a prime example of the world's strong and vital democracies.''
 The I.F.E., or Federal Electoral Institute, runs the elections.
 Mr. Lopez Obrador, who has made a career of challenging elections, prepared to try to prove that the electoral system remained flawed. His case before the Federal Electoral Tribunal could delay declaring a new president until September.
 Advisers to Mr. Lopez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City, said he would challenge the results in one-third of the 130,000 polling places, focusing on sites with many null votes or where his party did not have representatives to oversee the count.
 The advisers acknowledged that the errors found in each ballot box opened in the final count were small, but argued that together they could add up to enough votes to change the result. 
 ''If they recount the votes and Calderon wins by one vote, then it ends,'' said Mayor-Elect Marcelo Ebrard of Mexico City, a close adviser to Mr. Lopez Obrador. ''If they don't count the votes, there will always be a doubt.''
 If the court does not order a recount, Mr. Lopez Obrador left little doubt at a news conference on Thursday that he was considering mass marches as a next step. ''It's our right,'' he said.
 Rumbling beneath the confidence in one camp and outrage in the other was a debate on whether the most competitive elections in Mexican history had been good or bad. For some people, the cascade of results raised ghosts from a not-too-distant past when the state manipulated elections. Other people feared that if Mexico continued to bow to the old ghosts, it would never break free of them.
 About the only thing that seemed clear was that Mexico has been polarized. Speaking randomly to average Calderon supporters and then to people who support Mr. Lopez Obrador was like playing hopscotch across the gaping economic divide.
 Manuel Arango, a wealthy real estate developer who is active in philanthropies, echoed the feelings of many supporters of Mr. Calderon when he said, ''I hope that everything plays out within the institutions and not on the street.''
 Juan Huerta, 55, who works at a newsstand near a luxury department store, said he thought that the election was riddled with fraud. Mr. Huerta said he tried to cast a ballot for Mr. Lopez Obrador, but was told that rain had soaked all the ballots. ''This is a fraud against the people,'' he said.
 ''The PAN is playing with the country's social peace'' he added about the governing party. ''If there's violence, then so be it. People are fed up. That's why they had the revolution.''

HEADLINE: How to Be a Good Neighbor

BYLINE: By Greg Grandin. 
Greg Grandin, a professor of history at New York University, is the author of ''Empire's Workshop: Latin America, the United States and the Rise of the New Imperialism.''

DATELINE: Miami 

 BODY:
THE Aztecs used to believe that history is not linear but circular, with great events repeating themselves on a regular basis. That certainly seems to be the case with Mexico, which has a revolution once every hundred years. 
 In 1810, peasants thrown off their land by plantation owners led a violent five-year rebellion that paved the way for Mexico's independence from Spain. In 1910, an instance of electoral fraud ignited an agrarian revolution, which in turn kicked off a decade-long civil war in which millions of Mexicans died.
Nearly a century later, Mexico's current electoral crisis likewise is propelled by rural unrest -- this time largely brought about by the anger of agricultural workers displaced by the North American Free Trade Agreement. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the center-left presidential candidate who is contesting the declared victory of Felipe Calderon in last Sunday's election, draws much of his support from this increasingly restive population of rural poor. 
 Before Nafta, Mexico was self-sufficient in corn and bean production. Today, one out of three Mexican tortillas is made with cheap corn meal from the United States. In 1993, more than 10 million Mexicans made their living off the land. Today, even as Mexico's population has grown, that number has plummeted to about seven million. 
 Mexican farmers simply can't compete with capital-intensive United States agribusiness, which continues to enjoy generous government subsidies. Moreover, Mexican commodity importers receive low-interest loans to buy crops from the United States. Every year, nearly three million tons of harvested Mexican corn is left to rot because it is too expensive to sell.
 Mexicans have reason to worry that this is not all the trouble Nafta has in store. In 2008, the agreement's final provision is set to go into effect, eliminating the last tariffs on United States corn and beans and ending the subsidies Mexico gives to its peasant farmers -- all the while leaving untouched the far larger subsidies Washington doles out to its own agricultural sector. During his campaign, Mr. Lopez Obrador pledged to renegotiate this provision, but J. B. Penn, the United States undersecretary of agriculture, last month pre-emptively responded by saying that ''we have no interest in renegotiating any parts of the agreement.''
 For the last decade and a half, Washington and its allies in Mexican politics, including Mr. Calderon, have promoted a free-trade economic model that has failed to deliver the prosperity its advocates promised. Although the Mexican economy grew by 3 percent last year, the country's poverty and inequality indicators remain typical to bad by Latin American standards, with the richest 10 percent of citizens controlling 43 percent of the country's wealth, while some 40 percent of Mexicans live below the poverty line. 
 These problems, combined with Mexican anger over the immigration debate in the United States, run the risk of souring relations between our two countries for the foreseeable future.
 But there is a way the Bush administration can help to set things on a different course. Although election officials say Mr. Calderon won the presidential vote, the United States should not rush to embrace him as the election's victor. The official tally gives Mr. Calderon a razor-thin lead, and there are credible reports of significant irregularities that could, at best, weaken the legitimacy of a Calderon presidency, and at worst, lead to escalating protests. The disputed votes include the 904,000 annulled ballots that come primarily from regions that went heavily for Mr. Lopez Obrador, as well as discrepancies between the numbers handed in by polling stations and the actual ballots cast.
 The best thing the United States can do now is to support the push for a recount and to refrain from calling on Mr. Lopez Obrador to concede. Then, no matter who finally wins the election, the White House should renegotiate Nafta, allowing Mexico to set its own policy in support of its rural economy. If the Bush administration does otherwise, it might help begin yet another season of Mexican upheaval -- just as the Aztecs might have predicted.

HEADLINE: Justices Tacitly Backed Use Of Guantanamo, Bush Says

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7 

 BODY:
In his most detailed comments to date on the Supreme Court's rejection of his decision to put detainees on trial before military commissions, President Bush said Friday that the court had tacitly approved his use of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
 ''It didn't say we couldn't have done -- couldn't have made that decision, see?'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference in Chicago. ''They were silent on whether or not Guantanamo -- whether or not we should have used Guantanamo. In other words, they accepted the use of Guantanamo, the decision I made.''
Mr. Bush's remarks put a favorable spin on a ruling that has been widely interpreted as a rebuke of the administration's policies in the war on terror. The court, ruled broadly last week in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that military commissions were unauthorized by statute and violated international law.
 The question of whether Mr. Bush had properly used Guantanamo Bay to house detainees was not at issue in the case. At issue was whether the president could unilaterally establish military commissions with rights different from those allowed at a court-martial to try detainees for war crimes.
 Mr. Bush has said since the ruling that he will work with Congress to figure out how to use military commissions to try detainees, a promise he repeated on Friday in Chicago.
 ''I am willing to abide by the ruling of the Supreme Court,'' the president said.
 The Chicago news conference, which featured local reporters asking the president questions alongside the regular members of the White House press corps, was designed by the White House to give the president more exposure in the country at a time when his poll numbers are declining and Americans are uneasy with his leadership on the economy and the war in Iraq.
 But members of the Chicago press did not serve up softball questions. The issue of Mr. Bush's polls came up when a reporter asked about a fund-raiser the president planned to attend for Judy Baar Topinka, the Republican candidate for Illinois governor. 
 ''An aide to Judy Topinka was quoted as saying that given your low approval ratings in the polls, they prefer you to come here in the middle of the night,'' the reporter said.
 ''Didn't work,'' Mr. Bush replied. ''I'm coming to lunch.''
 The president also gave an endorsement of sorts to Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor who handled a leak investigation involving Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser.
 Mr. Bush said Mr. Fitzgerald, who is also the United States attorney in Chicago, had done a ''very professional job'' in handling the leak investigation, which resulted in the indictment of I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. Mr. Rove was not indicted.

HEADLINE: Leftist Candidate of Mexican Elections Claims Fraud

BYLINE: By JAMES C. MCKINLEY AND GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 8 

 BODY:
While the announced winner of last Sundays presidential election, Felipe Calderon, kept a low profile Saturday, his leftist rival hardened his position that the poll had been marred by fraud and suggesting there would be instability without a vote-by-vote recount.
 If there is not democracy, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said during a press conference on Saturday, there will be instability. 
Aides to Mr. Calderon said that after a whirlwind schedule of meetings and appearances on Friday including a stop in at ceremonies for his childrens last day of classes the former energy minister was taking the day off Saturday. While Mr. Calderon had begun to give out hints of how he would approach issues like trade, globalization and dealings with the United States on immigration, his day off allowed Mr. Lopez Obrador to claim the spotlight.
 Hours before he was scheduled to lead a rally in Mexicos central plaza, the Zocalo, Mr. Lopez Obrador said that his rival was wrong to begin assuming the role of president-elect before the results of last Sundays contests had been upheld in court. And Mr. Lopez Obrador objected to the congratulatory messages that had been sent to Mr. Calderon from the United States, Spain and Canada. He said it was all part of a strategy by Mr. Calderon to end a process that was not yet over.
 They want to turn the page, but things are not that way, Mr. Lopez Obrador said. This is just started.
 Meeting with foreign reporters on Friday afternoon, Mr. Calderon seemed confident that Mr. Lopez Obradors legal challenges would not stand up in court.
 My triumph is clear and definitive, Mr. Calderon said. There are no legal elements that sustain the possibility of a complaint. In this election, the votes have already been counted, vote by vote, at the time they should have been counted, at the closing of the polls, as happens in all the world.
 Mr. Lopez Obrador, in a meeting Saturday with foreign reporters, said that the pending rally was the first of several actions he would take to demand a recount of the 41 million votes cast last Sunday. The Federal Electoral Institute announced the final tally of votes on Thursday, saying that Mr. Calderon, of the conservative National Action Party, had won by a narrow margin of 243,000 votes.
 Mr. Lopez Obrador, of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, has said he would challenge those results at the Federal Electoral Tribunal. He has until Monday to present his case to the magistrates. On Saturday, he planned to take his case to the people.John M. Ackerman, an expert on electoral laws at that National Autonomous University of Mexico, said that many of Mexicos electoral laws are so new and, and therefore untested, that it is hard to assess Mr. Lopez Obradors chances are for successfully challenging the election results. The electoral tribunal was empowered in 1996 to validate presidential elections, and in the only other election since, in 2000, Vicente Fox handily defeated the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
 Mr. Ackerman said that in the tribunals short history, it had ordered broad though not complete recounts in state and local elections. The largest recount, he said, was six years ago in the state of Jalisco, where the race was so tight and fiercely contested that the state was compared to Florida.
 Mr. Ackerman also said that the magistrates had not hesitated to reverse decisions by the Federal Electoral Institute.
 In this last election alone, Mr. Ackerman said, the tribunal overruled at least two of the electoral institutes decisions, and ordered ads by Mr. Calderon and by President Fox taken off the air, after judging it as either inflammatory or unfair.
 Mr. Lopez Obrador led two volatile demonstrations in 1994 to protest his loss in the governors race in his home state of Tabasco. Mr. Lopez Obrador accused the former Institutional Revolutionary Party of spending millions more on its campaign than was legal and of fraud at the polls.
 In this campaign, Mr. Calderons campaign used that history to argue that Mr. Lopez Obradors could be a danger to Mexico. And several political analysts have said that Mr. Lopez Obradors behavior since Thursday have proven Mr. Calderon right.
 What marks Lopez Obradors attitude is not the construction of democracy, nor the consolidation of his own political force, but an evident ambition for personal power, wrote Jorge Fernandez Menendez, an investigative journalist and political commentator. If it was said that Lopez Obrador was messianic, he is confirming it with each one of his acts since Sunday.
 At the same time,, in the daily newspaper Excelsior, Jose Antonio Crespo wrote in favor of a recount.
 If I were Felipe Calderon, I would try to legitimize my electoral victory, he wrote. That way, I would gain full recognition of my future presidency, taking away from the PRD all of its arguments for questioning my victory, narrow, but genuine. After the Thursday announcement, Mr. Calderon and some of his aides began publicly addressing some policy issues. Arturo Sarukan, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Calderon, said Mr. Calderon intended to put Mexico at the center of the regions debate over globalization. Political analysts have suggested that a Calderon presidency could signal an end to the advance of leftwing politics across Latin America, as neoliberal economic policies from Washington have fallen from favor.
 We will lead the debate on how Latin America will keep competitive in the world, how to keep it from losing ground to Asia, Mr. Sarukan said. We have to figure out how to demonstrate to our societies that free markets, transparency and democracy really can deliver the goods for all.
 Mr. Calderon would seem a certain ally for the United States, and in his press conference with foreign reporters on Friday, said he would not seek to renegotiate agricultural clauses of the North American Free Trade Agreement. I dont see broad probabilities that the winner of such a negotiation would be Mexico, he said.
 On immigration, Mr. Calderon said he would urge the United States and Canada to join with Mexico to create a fund for the construction of infrastructure and other development projects to generate jobs in high-migration states in Mexico like Mr. Calderons home state of Michoacan that would keep people home.
 The solution to migration is not walls, Mr. Calderon said. The only real solution to stop or slow the migration phenomenon is the generation of good-paying jobs.
 He added, I continue to argue that un kilometer of highway in Zacatecasor Michoacan, can do more to reduce migration than 10 kilometers of wall in Texas or Arizona.
 And that is something we need to understand on both sides of the border.

HEADLINE: Mittal Announces Plan for Steel Plant in India 

BYLINE: By AMELIA GENTLEMAN and HEATHER TIMMONS; Amelia Gentleman reported from New Delhi for this article and Heather Timmons from London.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 7 

 BODY:
Fresh from winning the fight for the European steel company Arcelor, Lakshmi Mittal visited India on Friday and said he planned to invest as much as $9 billion in a steel plant in an impoverished eastern area of the country.
 Mr. Mittal said that Mittal Steel, based in Rotterdam, would invest 300 billion to 400 billion rupees ($6.7 billion to $9 billion) to build a steel plant in the mineral-rich state of Orissa. The plant, to be built in two phases, would be one of India's largest, with a capacity of 12 million tons a year. 
 After making his bid for Arcelor in January, Mr. Mittal was roundly criticized by Arcelor executives for his company's practice of relying on low-cost production in emerging markets.
 Analysts said that Mr. Mittal's plans for Orissa were another sign that the overall industry was headed in that direction.
 ''The steel industry really doesn't belong in developed countries any longer; it belongs in developing countries,'' said Roger Nightingale, global economic adviser for Millennium Global Investments in London.
 Mittal Steel spent nearly six months trying to win over Arcelor, and in June the companies finally agreed to a deal valued at 26.5 billion euros ($33 billion). Mr. Mittal said he would thank the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, for his support during his visit to India.
 ''We want to be partners with the growth in India,'' Mr. Mittal said.
 Analysts forecast that demand for steel in India would rise as the country's economy booms, with strong growth in the automobile and construction sectors.
 ''Everyone seems to want a foothold in India,'' said Peter Fish, managing director of Meps International, a consulting firm. Demand for steel in India is high, and the country is rich in iron ore.
 Mr. Mittal may be trying to capitalize on the momentum from his successful deal with Arcelor to get further support for steel projects in India, said Daniel Altman, an analyst with Bear Stearns in New York.
 Mittal Steel already had plans to build a $9 billion steel plant in the neighboring state of Jharkhand, but Mr. Mittal said he was unhappy with the slow pace of negotiations there and was concerned about the poor infrastructure. 
 In India, state governments, not national officials, approve the construction of steel plants, and that support has been difficult to secure. 
 The announcement Friday that Mittal was planning a plant in Orissa might be an attempt to pressure the governments in Jharkhand and in Orissa to smooth the approval process, analysts said.
 ''I think they are playing one state against the other,'' Mr. Altman said.
 Posco, a South Korean steel company, has also been negotiating with Orissa's government to build a plant there. Those negotiations have been going slowly, Mr. Altman said.
 Expansion into India would not threaten jobs in Europe or elsewhere, Mr. Mittal stressed.
 ''When we announced the deal with Arcelor, we said that there would be no job cuts'' he said. ''There will be absolutely no repercussions on jobs in Europe or anywhere else in the group.'' 
 That may not be true in the future, analysts cautioned. 
 ''That's certainly going to be valid in the short term, but what happens in the long term is anybody's guess,'' Mr. Nightingale said.
 Mittal will ''keep Arcelor's facilities in Europe, especially the highest-quality steel facilities and those serving the motor industry,'' Mr. Nightingale predicted, but a lot of Mittal's other products will come from plants elsewhere.

HEADLINE: A St. Petersburg Story

 BODY:
Russia's meeting on July 15 with leaders of the world's richest democracies requires an important historical footnote. President Vladimir Putin will welcome the Group of Eight to St. Petersburg, where leaders are expected to talk about energy, Iran and terrorism. It is an event that would have appealed to Peter the Great, who built his beautiful but extravagant city over 300 years ago to win Russia a place at the European tables of his day. 
 Now it is Mr. Putin's turn to put Russia's post-Soviet power and progress on display. But the international acceptance that Mr. Putin craves will quickly disappear if the Kremlin continues its march toward what critics call a ''staged democracy'' instead of a real one.
 The list of concerns has grown steadily during Mr. Putin's stewardship. The exuberant free press that erupted after the end of the Soviet Union 15 years ago is mostly gone now, and what passes for news increasingly comes straight from the Kremlin fax machine. National television networks now labor under the president's thumb, and the best newspapers are falling into line as well. The Internet, smaller publications and radio broadcasts are still exempt, but many Russian journalists fear it may be only a matter of time.
 Then there are the upcoming presidential election in 2008. Mr. Putin's term is up, and he has said he will step down as required by law. But there are already troubling signs that if his loyal Parliament cannot find a way to keep him on, it will anoint his choice for successor. And woe unto any candidate who doesn't have the Kremlin's seal of approval.
 Hopes for a rule of law are also dimming as the judicial system lands hardest on those out of favor with the Kremlin. Non-government organizations that sometimes criticize the government now see the Kremlin turning on them as well. Organizations like the Moscow Helsinki Group have come under attack for criticizing Mr. Putin's record on human rights and the treatment of ethnic minorities. 
 In the name of fighting extremism, Mr. Putin's government has enacted a new law that can easily be used to harass almost any activists who criticize the powerful. And one of Mr. Putin's TV stations falsely accused four important groups, including Moscow Helsinki, of taking money from British spies. This is a familiar tactic in Russia that should have been retired with the Soviet flag.
 Mr. Putin's Russia is still far better than it was during the bleak decades of Communism. And Russia clearly has the economic clout to sit with France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Britain, Canada and Italy. But the leaders of this club need to make it clear to Russia that membership demands not only the power of wealth but also a democratic government to go with it.

HEADLINE: Now, Add the North Korean Wild Card to the Mix

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
IT was a rough week for crystal-ball gazers. Almost as soon as economists forecast that the economy might continue to grow at a relatively healthy pace in the second half, a steady drip of pessimistic news began to dribble out. And then North Korea provocatively test-fired a phalanx of guided missiles despite warnings from the major powers to desist; stocks fell and oil prices rose as tensions grew.

TOBACCO VICTORY -- The Florida Supreme Court upheld a decision to toss out a $145 billion judgment against tobacco companies, ruling that smokers' cases ''are highly individualized'' and ''do not lend themselves to class-action treatment.''
The decision is a crushing blow to plaintiffs' lawyers, who have pushed for large class-action cases with the potential for multibillion-dollar verdicts. Smokers must now sue one by one, a daunting prospect against big corporations able to mount protracted, and costly, court fights. 
 Investors applauded the decision in Florida, which sharply reduces the possibility of large bank-breaking awards in tobacco cases. In December, the Supreme Court of Illinois threw out a $10 billion judgment against Philip Morris USA in a class-action consumer fraud suit that accused the company of deceiving smokers by marketing its ''light'' cigarettes as having lower levels of tar and nicotine.
 The next big decision, expected in a few months, will come in a federal civil racketeering case filed by the Justice Department against several large cigarette makers and seeking damages of $14 billion over 10 years as well as fines if youth smoking rates do not decline.

TAKING RESPONSIBILITY -- Reeling from production delays for Airbus's flagship A380 superjumbo jet and an investigation into possible insider trading, the co-chief executive of Europe's biggest aerospace company resigned. The man in charge of commercial aircraft manufacturing also stepped down.
 Noel Forgeard, the co-chief of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, and Gustav Humbert, the chief executive of its commercial aircraft division, Airbus, resigned under pressure from their largest shareholders, including Lagardere of France and DaimlerChrysler of Germany.
 The company said a six-month delay in delivery of A380's would reduce earnings by $2.6 billion over the next four years.
 Mr. Forgeard was also under fire for having sold $2.5 million worth of EADS stock shortly before DaimlerChrysler and Lagardere said that they would reduce their stakes in the company, and three months before news of the A380 delay became public. He has denied wrongdoing.
 BAE, a British aerospace company, has called for an independent investigation of the affair, which has derailed its plan to sell its 20 percent stake in EADS.

SIGNS OF A SLOWDOWN -- Manufacturing and construction both grew at slower rates than expected last month, affirming the belief of some economists that a long series of interest rate increases by the Fed has succeeded in cooling overall economic growth.
 If that slowdown is reflected in wholesale and retail prices, the Fed may stop raising rates and start calculating when it can start to cut them again. 
 The Institute for Supply Management, an industry group in Tempe, Ariz., reported the slower growth in manufacturing in June while the Commerce Department noted that construction spending had declined for the second consecutive month -- the first time that has happened in more than three years. 
 Some economists said manufacturing could perk up in the months ahead if the Fed stops raising rates because that could cause the dollar to fall in value, making American goods cheaper abroad.

SLUMPING SALES -- Evidence of how unevenly the manufacturing slump is hitting companies came in the form of monthly auto sales. General Motors' sales fell 25.7 percent last month, hammered by high gas prices and the absence of the rebates and other subsidies that lifted sales last year. Toyota's sales, meanwhile, rose 14.4 percent.
 Ominously for American manufacturers, stubbornly high gasoline prices, which have already crimped sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles, have begun to curb sales of equally profitable pickup trucks. G.M.'s truck sales fell 37 percent in June, while Ford said sales of its light trucks dropped 14.6 percent.
 G.M. is weighing a proposal by Kirk Kerkorian, one of its biggest shareholders, to discuss a possible alliance with Renault, the French automaker, and Nissan Motor, the No. 3 Japanese automaker. Renault owns a controlling stake in Nissan.

STILL HIGHER GAS -- Worries about tensions between Iran and the West, combined with production difficulties along the Gulf Coast of the United States, propelled oil prices to as much as $75.78 a barrel -- a nominal record, though still below historical highs when adjusted for inflation.
 Analysts said the spike could push the national average price of regular unleaded gasoline above $3 a gallon. The last time the national average exceeded $3 was when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita shut refineries in Louisiana and Texas.
 A weekly survey of gasoline inventories next Wednesday could drive prices further if the stockpile has not risen as the country gets deeper into the summer driving season.

A SHOCKING DEATH -- Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman and chief executive of Enron who was convicted of fraud and conspiracy in the company's collapse, died of a heart attack while on vacation in Colorado.
 Mr. Lay, known for his close ties to President Bush, was convicted on May 25 on six counts of fraud and conspiracy and four counts of bank fraud, and was free on a $5 million bond while awaiting his sentencing. Mr. Lay, 64, faced the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.
 Mr. Lay's unexpected death may have spared his survivors financial ruin by effectively voiding the guilty verdict against him, temporarily thwarting the federal government's efforts to seize his remaining real estate and financial assets, legal experts say.

HEADLINE: How 3 Managers Turned Back a Tide

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
THE few stock mutual funds that made money in the second quarter did so in a variety of ways, some by putting big chunks of their portfolios into cash, others by concentrating on energy, financial or media stocks. Managers at three of the best-performing funds spoke recently about their stocks, their strategies and what they see ahead for the market.

Defensive Strategies
 The $2.8 billion Federated Market Opportunity fund used several defensive strategies to earn its 5.4 percent return for the quarter. The fund is 28 percent in cash, 47 percent in short-term government notes and bills and, as a hedge, 4 percent in put options on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The rest is in stocks. ''I'm really focused on not losing money,'' said Steven J. Lehman, 49, who describes himself as a ''defensive contrarian value manager.'' 
 Mr. Lehman looks for what he calls ''cheap, overlooked and unpopular stocks.'' But he cautioned that while the fund made money on several stocks, its overall return was positive because of its cash and its options hedge, which allowed it to weather broad declines in domestic share prices and the dollar.
 Among the fund's profitable stocks was EnCana, of Calgary, Alberta, an oil and gas company whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares rose 12.9 percent in the quarter. ''The stock price had been depressed,'' Mr. Lehman said, ''and it rebounded along with many other energy stocks.''
 The fund also made money on Boots, the big retail drugstore chain in Britain, whose local shares were up 10.5 percent. ''The company has had disappointing results in the past few years,'' Mr. Lehman said. ''With new management, I think its prospects are improving.'' The fund owns American depository receipts as well as shares traded in London.
 Another winner was Daiichi-Sankyo, a Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturer. ''The stock was cheap and unpopular because it didn't have an exciting array of new drugs coming down the road,'' he said. 
 He says investors now recognize that shares were oversold. The stock, which trades in Tokyo, rose 17.3 percent.
 Looking ahead at the overall stock market, Mr. Lehman said, ''I see bad things.'' He said that the market ''is overdue for a correction.'' 

A Focus on Energy
 Energy stocks helped drive the returns of the $2.3 billion CGM Focus fund, which rose 4.5 percent.
 The manager, G. Kenneth Heebner, 65, has invested half the portfolio in oil services companies, refining companies and oil and gas producers. He also had 39 percent in metals and mining companies at the end of the quarter. 
 ''We look for companies where the earnings pattern is going to cause strong relative price performance,'' Mr. Heebner said. 
 Because the fund holds just 22 stocks, its performance can be more volatile than that of more diversified portfolios. 
 One winner was Tenaris of Luxembourg. The fund owns the company's American depository receipts, which rose 13.3 percent. The company is a leading worldwide producer of welded alloy casing for oil wells, as well as other industrial steel pipe products. ''Their business has been extremely strong because of rising drilling activity in a high-oil-price environment,'' Mr. Heebner said. 
 The fund also made money in United States Steel, based in Pittsburgh. ''Steel prices have been rising this quarter, reflecting the strength in the global economy,'' Mr. Heebner said. ''U.S. Steel has been raising prices, creating a robust earnings outlook in this environment.'' Its shares rose 15.8 percent.
 Shares of Allegheny Technologies, also based in Pittsburgh, were up 13.3 percent. ''The stock's appreciation,'' he said, ''reflects robust demand and rising prices globally for stainless and alloy steels.'' 
 As for the future, he said, ''I think that the outlook for the global economy is very strong, and the U.S. economy, although it may slow down, will continue to grow.'' He cautions, however, that he considers the stock market ''fairly priced.'' 

Seeking 'a Margin of Safety'
 Financial services and media stocks propelled the returns of the $2.7 billion Weitz Value fund, up 2.6 percent, and the $1.8 billion Weitz Partners Value fund, up 2.4 percent. The manager, Wally Weitz, 57, looks for growing businesses that generate excess cash. ''We look for management that we trust to allocate the cash well,'' he said, ''and we try to buy earnings at prices low enough that we have a margin of safety.'' 
 Financial services companies performed strongly this quarter, he said, because of ''the perception that the Federal Reserve might be finished raising interest rates.'' 
 One winner was Redwood Trust, in Mill Valley, Calif., a mortgage real estate investment trust whose shares rose 14.4 percent. ''They have been positioning themselves very defensively, so earnings had dropped in the last couple of years,'' Mr. Weitz said. Shares performed strongly this quarter because ''the market is now realizing that earnings are likely to turn around this year and go back up again.''
 The fund also made money on Countrywide Financial, which was up 4.1 percent. Countrywide Financial, a mortgage lender, also has other financial services operations. As the refinancing boom began to slow, ''the stock price generally moved sideways,'' Mr. Weitz said. ''But now the perception is that the company is doing well.''
 A third profitable stock was Comcast, the cable and media company based in Philadelphia. Its shares rose 25.2 percent.
 ''The company has been doing fine for a long time even though its stock price has been weak,'' he said. Fears of competition from satellite and telecommunications companies are ''overdone,'' he said. 
 Mr. Weitz is cautious looking ahead. ''I wouldn't be surprised to see some pretty sharp market volatility, with a correction now and then,'' he said. ''I think the market is somewhat fragile.''

HEADLINE: Drink, Smoke and Gamble, and This Fund Climbs

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BROCKMAN

 BODY:
MORE than 150 mutual funds call themselves socially responsible, investing only in companies that meet a series of ethical standards set by their fund managers. Then there's the Vice Fund.
 Its prospectus says it favors ''products or services often considered socially irresponsible.'' The fund has fulfilled that promise under several different fund managers, investing mainly in companies involved with alcohol, tobacco, gambling and military contracting. This politically incorrect approach has helped the Vice Fund outperform the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index from its inception in 2002. But the fund has had more than its share of management turmoil.
In 2003 and 2004, civil and criminal charges were brought against three executives of the fund's former adviser, Mutuals.com, in connection with market timing. One of the executives, Eric McDonald, was also the co-manager of the Vice Fund. All of those charges are still pending, including civil charges against Mutuals.com and two broker-dealers affiliated with it, Connely Dowd Management and MTT Fundcorp.
 A special monitor appointed by a federal court remains in place for Mutuals.com and all its affiliates, including the Vice Fund, to ensure compliance with securities laws. 
 When Mr. McDonald stepped down from the Vice Fund, he left Dan S. Ahrens as its sole manager. Then, in August 2005, Mr. Ahrens left the fund because of disagreements stemming from the charges against the other executives, he said. In March, he started the Gaming and Casino fund, which has a more narrow focus, concentrating on gambling, casino and lottery companies -- politically incorrect territory it shares with the Vice Fund.
 The Vice Fund, now managed by Charles L. Norton, 32, and Michael J. Henry, 26, has stuck to its knitting. Both funds depend on the insight that stocks that exploit the dark side of human nature are a natural for Wall Street, particularly during economic downturns. This philosophy is articulated in Mr. Ahrens's book, ''Investing in Vice,'' (St. Martin's Press, 2004). 
 ''Certain habits, even during bad economic times, don't change,'' Mr. Ahrens wrote. ''No matter what the stock market is doing, people still indulge in what are known as vices: smoking, drinking and gambling.'' Mr. Ahrens added war to the list, calling these sectors good long-term bets. 
 Lately, the approach has again been paying off. Gambling and hotel casino stocks returned 25.3 percent this year through Thursday and 28.9 percent, annualized, in the last five years , according to Morningstar. The S.& P. 1500 Casino and Gaming Index, which tracks 10 stocks from the 1500 index, was up 10.1 percent through Thursday and 21.4 percent, annualized, over the last five years.
 Tobacco stocks posted annualized five-year gains of 20 percent, while those for alcoholic beverages gained 12 percent a year and the aerospace and defense sector, including military contractors, climbed 11.8 percent, according to Morningstar.
 The Vice Fund returned 9.2 percent this year through Thursday, compared with 3.1 percent for the S.& P. 500. Over the last three years, the fund's return has been 20.6 percent, annualized, outpacing the 10.9 percent of the S.& P. 500. The fund has no load, or sales charge, and has an expense ratio of 1.75 percent. Its allocations as of May 31 included roughly 27 percent to casinos, gambling and lotteries; 24 percent to aerospace and defense; 24 percent to alcohol; and 21 percent to tobacco. 
 From inception in March, the Gaming and Casino fund gained 0.8 percent through Thursday.
 Funds that call themselves socially responsible take a very different approach, of course. ''We have a zero tolerance for weapons, alcohol, tobacco, gambling,'' said Christopher H. Brown, portfolio manager of the Pax World Balanced fund, which has more than $2 billion under management, roughly 40 times as much as the Vice Fund. Pax World Balanced returned 2.8 percent this year through Thursday; 10.2 percent, annualized, over the last three years; and 5.1 percent over the last five. 
 The Vice Fund has not experienced a ''full business cycle,'' Mr. Brown said, so ''it remains to be seen how they do in the long run.'' 
 The Vice Fund's aerospace and military portfolio includes some companies that have had financial windfalls because of the war in Iraq, said David Strauss, an equity analyst at UBS Investment Research. General Dynamics, which manufactures armored vehicles, is a case in point, he said. ''Historically, the defense company stocks have performed fairly well in a period of weak economic growth,'' he said.
 Of course, scores of mutual funds have big dollops of certain holdings of the Vice Fund in their own portfolios. ''I think what they've done is taken a good marketing spin to the consumer discretionary sector,'' said Philip Edwards, S.& P.'s managing director of fund research.
 Mr. Norton, one of the current co-managers of the Vice Fund, says he favors quantitative analysis in evaluating companies for its portfolio. He is married and has two children, and says he may be at a bit of a disadvantage when it comes to hands-on research for the fund.
 ''I drink socially, but not regularly,'' he said. ''I don't smoke. I only gamble when I go to Vegas.'' But he said he had a more rollicking lifestyle as a student at Tulane University in New Orleans. ''I do have some experience in the sector,'' he said.
 Jeff Tjornehoj, an analyst for Lipper, credits the Vice Fund for not focusing ''entirely on household names, which tend to be large companies.'' Some of its more off-the-radar investments include the Central European Distribution Corporation, a Polish importer of alcoholic beverages; CryptoLogic, which supplies Internet gambling software; and Viisage Technology, which provides facial recognition security technology.
 The Gaming and Casino fund, which has an expense ratio of 1.7 percent and no load, according to its prospectus, does not have much of a track record yet, but Mr. Ahrens says its portfolio includes a variety of casino, gambling and lottery stocks, including Las Vegas Sands, Penn National Gaming, Scientific Games and Shuffle Master.
 At the Vice Fund, the run of frequent management changes isn't over yet, Mr. Norton said. The fund's current adviser, Mutuals Advisors, plans to outsource management of the fund to GNI Capital, an investment adviser based in Greenville, S.C., he said. A second fund, Generation Wave Growth, of which he and Mr. Henry are co-managers, will also shift to GNI Capital, he said. Mr. Norton said he planned to remain a co-manager of both funds. Allen R. Gillespie, a principal at GNI, will replace Mr. Henry at both of them, he said. 
 THE civil and criminal charges against the former executives of Mutuals.com were filed by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. In addition to Mr. McDonald, Richard A. Sapio and Michele Leftwich were charged. 
 In December 2003, the S.E.C. filed a civil complaint accusing them of market timing and defrauding investors. In March 2004, the United States attorney charged the three with conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Later, in August, those charges were expanded to include wire and mail fraud.
 None of the charges involve the Vice Fund directly. According to the Vice Fund's prospectus, Mr. Sapio controls Mutual Capital Alliance, the parent company of Mutuals Advisors. 
 ''We are negotiating with both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission,'' said William M. Ravkind, Mr. Sapio's lawyer. ''The judge has been allowing us time to see if we can have some agreement.''

HEADLINE: Why U.S. Companies Shouldn't Whine About Taxes

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TO hear some people talk, the United States is the scourge of the Fortune 500. Despite all the tax cuts that President Bush and Congress have passed in the last five years, business groups and their supporters in Washington complain that the United States imposes higher tax rates on corporate profits than almost any other industrialized country.
 ''Foreign-based competitor companies operate under tax rules that are often more favorable than our own,'' warned R. Glenn Hubbard, a former economic adviser to President Bush and now dean of the Columbia Business School, at a House hearing two weeks ago. ''Current law can result in circumstances that harm the competitiveness of U.S. companies.'' 
Around Washington, the rumblings are growing for ''reform'' of corporate taxes to improve the global competitiveness of American companies. 
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the incoming Treasury secretary, declared at his confirmation hearing that he wanted to increase ''competitiveness'' in the tax code.
 Can it be true that the United States, where bare-knuckled capitalism is a romantic ideal and being nouveau riche is a badge of honor, is harder on big corporations than ''old Europe'' welfare states like Germany, France and Sweden?
 Don't believe it. There are plenty of problems with the corporate tax code -- rococo complexity, perverse incentives, antique ideas -- but overly high taxes is not one of them. 
 By most measures, the corporate tax burden is lower in the United States than it is in the European Union or in Japan or most other industrialized countries. 
 The political danger, at least from a fiscal standpoint, is that arguments for corporate tax reform will be hijacked to justify another round of corporate tax cuts. That was what happened with the corporate tax overhaul of 2004, which became a grab bag of tax breaks to almost every corner of business, at a net cost of $60 billion over 10 years.
 Those who see the American corporate tax as oppressive point to a striking fact: the standard corporate tax rate of 35 percent is now higher than that of most other industrialized countries. The average top rate is 25.8 percent in the European Union, where most nations have cut rates to attract investment.
 But official tax rates are not the same as actual tax burdens. What American companies lose in high tax rates they more than make up in higher tax breaks. 
 One indicator of the true tax burden is corporate tax revenue as a share of gross domestic product. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research organization based in Paris and financed by governments of industrialized nations, corporate taxes in 2003 were 2.1 percent of G.D.P. in the United States, 3.2 percent in the European Union and 4.3 percent in industrialized countries in Asia. 
 Though comparisons of true tax rates are treacherous, the evidence suggests that the United States more than makes up for high statutory rates with generous tax breaks. Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, has calculated that the average corporation paid taxes of about 18 percent in 2004.
 The European Commission, using a more theoretical approach, calculated that the average effective tax rate in 15 Western European nations has hovered between 20 and 22 percent since 1998. When the 10 new Central European members of the European Union are included, the average corporate tax bite was 17.7 percent.
 ''There is good reason to believe that the corporate tax burden in the United States could be less than the rest of the world because the rest of the world has been broadening their tax bases while we have been cutting ours,'' said Martin A. Sullivan, an analyst at the journal Tax Notes. 
 To be sure, many experts contend that the American tax code does impose some competitive disadvantages. One big complaint is that the United States is one of the very few countries that taxes corporate profits worldwide. Almost all other nations use ''territorial'' systems, taxing only profits inside their borders.
 The difference is significant. Thyssen-Krupp, the German steel conglomerate, owes no German taxes on profits from its operations in Brazil, China or Poland. And European value-added tax on domestic sales does not apply to exports to the United States. United States Steel, by contrast, potentially owes American taxes on profits from its subsidiary in Slovakia and must also charge value-added taxes on exports sold in Germany.
 In practice, the disadvantage is smaller than it appears. For one thing, American companies receive tax credits for taxes paid in other countries. More important, American companies have proved extremely adept at shifting profits into low-tax countries like Ireland and then deferring the American taxes on those profits by keeping them outside the United States. 
 Under current federal law, companies can postpone taxes on foreign profits until those profits return to the United States. By some estimates, American multinationals had accumulated more than $400 billion in profits outside the country. 
 Last year, Congress rewarded that behavior. First, it widened companies' ability to claim tax credits against their foreign taxes, at a cost to the Treasury of almost $40 billion over 10 years. Second, it gave companies a one-time chance to repatriate their vast hoard of overseas profits at a tax rate of only 5.25 percent -- a bonanza for many pharmaceutical and electronics businesses.
 ''The current U.S. rules, while complex, represent the best of all worlds for multinational taxpayers,'' declared Stephen E. Shay, a former international tax counsel to the Treasury Department, at a hearing last month of a House Ways and Means subcommittee. 
 MANY analysts agree that today's rules are a mess: they do not raise much revenue from foreign profits, they encourage companies to invest outside the United States, they encourage profit-shifting schemes and they probably put some American companies at a competitive disadvantage. 
 The challenge is to change the system without cutting taxes yet again. Michael J. Graetz, a professor at Yale Law School and a proponent of radical tax overhaul, told lawmakers last month that the top corporate tax rate ought to be cut from 35 percent to as little as 15 percent.
 But Mr. Graetz said Congress would have to make up for the lost revenue. ''It is not possible to achieve this kind of corporate rate reduction without a major restructuring of our domestic tax system,'' he said. 
 President Bush called for exactly such a revenue-neutral restructuring during his re-election campaign. But any overhaul would provoke intense battles between potential winners and losers. With Republicans terrified about losing control of Congress in the midterm elections this year, Mr. Bush has postponed making any proposals until at least next year.

 BODY:
Weighing the Repugnance Factor
 How's this for a repugnant situation? Take someone you love, perhaps your spouse or your sibling, and find a stranger who will accept a really big bet that your loved one will die prematurely -- and if indeed that happens, you pocket a few million dollars.
This, of course, is how life insurance works. And most Americans don't find this idea repugnant at all. They used to, however. Until the mid-19th century, life insurance was considered ''a profanation,'' as the sociologist Viviana Zelizer has written, ''which transformed the sacred event of death into a vulgar commodity.'' 
 Alvin Roth, a Harvard economist who studies the design of markets, has done a lot of thinking about repugnance. On some issues, he notes, repugnance will recede, as with life insurance -- or, even more momentously, the practice of charging interest on loans. In other cases, the reverse happens: a once-accepted behavior like slaveholding comes to be seen as repugnant. 
 One case of repugnance is far from settled: the dispute over how human organs for transplantation should be allocated -- and, perhaps, even sold. If you happen to have a failing heart or liver or kidneys, you will almost certainly die without a transplant, but if you aren't lucky enough to get an organ through an official registry, you can't legally purchase one at any price. So instead of a free market in organs, we have a volunteer market. Some people agree to give up their usable organs once they die. In the case of a living donor, someone sacrifices a kidney or a portion of a liver to a recipient, most likely a family member. 
 In the space of just a few decades, transplant surgery has become safe and reliable (to say nothing of miraculous). But success breeds demand: as more patients get new organs, more patients want them. In 2005, more than 16,000 kidney transplants were performed in the U.S., an increase of 45 percent over 10 years. But during that time, the number of people on a kidney waiting list rose by 119 percent. More than 3,500 people now die each year waiting for a kidney transplant. 
 To an economist, this is a basic supply-and-demand gap with tragic consequences. So what can be done to increase the supply of organs? 
 A big problem is that would-be suppliers are not given very strong incentives to step forward. In much of Europe, the choice is made for them: instead of ''opting in'' to donate, the default assumption is that your usable organs will be harvested upon your death unless your family ''opts out.'' But Europe, too, still has a sizable organ shortage, in part because traffic fatalities -- which tend to produce desirable organs for harvest -- are on a downward trend in Western countries. 
 If it's hard to get people to give up their organs upon death, consider how much harder it is to persuade a living person to donate a kidney. (From a medical perspective, a kidney from a living donor is far more valuable than a cadaver kidney.) Even though most people can live safely on one kidney, there is still a price to be paid in discomfort, risk, fear and lost wages. But the United States, like pretty much every other country in the world, forbids a donor to collect on that price, or any other.
 It is hard to find an economist who agrees with this policy. Gary Becker and Julio Jorge Elias argued in a recent paper that ''monetary incentives would increase the supply of organs for transplant sufficiently to eliminate the very large queues in organ markets, and the suffering and deaths of many of those waiting, without increasing the total cost of transplant surgery by more than 12 percent.'' 
 Some noneconomists may well find this reasoning repugnant. There are many reasons, after all, for banning the sale of organs. Some people consider it immoral to commodify body parts (although it is now commonplace to not only sell sperm and eggs but also to rent a womb). Others fear that most organ sellers would be poor while most buyers would be rich; or that someone might be pressured into selling a kidney without fully understanding the risks. 
 But why, Becker and Elias ask, should poor people ''be deprived of revenue that could be highly useful to them''? Even more compelling is the fact that a poor person is just as likely as a wealthy person (if not more so) to need a new kidney -- and, with no legal market for organs, is just as likely to die while waiting on a list.
 Alvin Roth, even though he is an economist, is smart enough to realize that repugnance will keep Americans from embracing a true market for organs anytime soon. So, along with several other scholars and medical personnel, he has helped design a clever alternative, the New England Program for Kidney Exchange. Imagine that you have a wife who is dying of renal failure, and that you would give her one of your kidneys, but you are not a biological match. Now imagine that another couple is in the same bind. The kidney exchange locates and matches the couples: you donate your kidney to the stranger's wife, while the stranger gives his kidney to your wife; the operations are performed simultaneously to make sure no one backs out. Although this system has yielded only a couple dozen transplants so far, it illustrates an economist's understanding of incentives: if you can't get someone to give an organ out of altruism, and you can't pay him either, what do you do? Find two parties who are desperate to align their incentives. 
 Otherwise, who in his right mind would step forward to donate a kidney to a stranger? In fact, we recently spoke to one such potential donor who asked to remain anonymous. Donor is married, with four children and a precarious financial situation. Because Donor had a sibling who nearly needed an organ transplant, the idea got into Donor's head to perhaps sell a kidney to a stranger. Through a donor Web site, Donor met a potential recipient, whom we'll call Recipient. It wasn't until the process was well under way that Donor learned it was illegal to be paid. In the end, however, Donor's moral mission overrode the financial need, and Donor decided to go ahead with the transplant.
 Donor has undergone extensive testing at the hospital where Recipient will have the transplant. Both Donor and Recipient have had to lie repeatedly to the doctors, pretending they are old friends. ''If they find out you met on the Internet,'' Donor explains, ''they assume it's for money, and they'll call off the operation.''
 If all goes well, the transplant may happen soon. Consider the parties who stand to profit from this transaction: Recipient, certainly, as well as the transplant surgeons, the nurses, the hospital, the drug companies. Everyone will be paid in some form -- except for Donor, who not only isn't being paid but, in return for carrying out a deeply altruistic act, also has to pay the additional price of lying about it.
 Surely there are some people, and not just economists, who would find this situation -- well, repugnant.

My husband and I would like to go to Thailand, but he is reluctant because, at 6 feet 4 inches, measuring 27 inches from back to knee, he just cannot move his legs in an economy seat with a 31-inch pitch, or less. We cannot afford to fly business class. Can one secure seats, such as exit rows, that might enable him to survive a long flight? 
 -- Johanna Read, Ottawa
 Many readers share the same conundrum. Harold Levine in Paris asks, ''Is there something more comfortable than economy but less than business class'' for a flight to Denver; Keith Spicer, also in Paris, writes, ''As a 71-year-old frequent trans-Atlantic traveler with long legs, I am now limiting my travel; the gap between affordable 'sardine' class and high-cost business class is ridiculous. Why don't airlines recognize there is a market between economy and business? I would gladly pay up to $300 extra each way for a basic business class with more space, a better meal and a bit more service.''
 As it turns out, some airlines are indeed offering more space to travelers unwilling or unable to pay business-class fares. Taiwan-based Eva Air, with its Evergreen Deluxe Class (called Elite Class on its 777's), was the first carrier to provide passengers paying the full economy fare with more legroom in a separate cabin, in 1991. It was followed by Virgin Atlantic with its Premium Economy class, British Airways' World Traveller Plus and United Airlines with Economy Plus, all of which typically offer up to seven inches more legroom than regular cattle class for around one-third the price of a business-class seat. United Airlines does not have a specific fare for Economy Plus but reserves the front section of the economy cabin with more legroom for ''elite-level'' frequent fliers (Mileage Plus members with Premier status or above) and full-fare economy passengers. 
 British Airways' round-trip fares between Kennedy Airport and London, for example, range from $482 to $1,665 in World Traveller (economy) and $669 to $2,180 in World Traveller Plus, to a whopping $3,215 to $9,198 (business class). 
 And consider MAXjet, a trans-Atlantic business-class-only start-up airline that operates a fleet of Boeing 767's with 102 seats that recline to an almost horizontal position and offer a full 60 inches of legroom. Round-trip fares between New York and London and Washington and London range from $1,398 to $4,188; promotional fares can be as low as $1,066.

HEADLINE: The Growing Problem of Fraud 

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
WITH interest rates at historic lows in recent years, consumers have raced to get mortgages. So have criminals.
 Industry executives and law-enforcement officials say mortgage fraud continues to climb, with lenders incurring more than $1 billion in fraud losses in the last fiscal year, twice the amount of the previous year. And while no organization has yet tracked how much consumers have lost to fraud, anecdotal evidence suggests that those levels, too, are rising sharply.
''The problem is definitely growing,'' said Tim Doyle, the senior director of government affairs at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. ''The F.B.I. has prioritized this, state attorneys general are looking at this, and more state laws are being passed about it.'' 
 About 80 percent of mortgage fraud involves professional thieves who are bilking lenders, the F.B.I. estimates, while in the remaining cases consumers are involved in one way or another. 
 This second category is known in law enforcement as ''fraud for property.'' Typically, mortgage applicants falsify financial documents so they can qualify for an out-of-reach mortgage, or their lender or broker falsifies the documents on their behalf, looking for profit or a quick commission. Consumers frequently default on such loans, losing their homes and ruining their credit.
 Fraud against a lender is known as ''fraud for profit.'' In such cases a criminal group works with an unscrupulous appraiser, typically finding a house that has sat on the market for a while at a certain price. They offer the homeowner that price, with a stipulation: the homeowner must allow the criminals' appraiser to value the home at, say, 30 percent higher. 
 A criminal in the ring takes out a loan for the higher amount using stolen financial and personal information. When the criminals get the money, they pay the former homeowner the original asking price, then split the remainder among themselves.
 Harry Dinham, the president of National Association of Mortgage Brokers in McLean, Va., said that although the authorities are trying to combat the problem, it is so widespread they have not yet caught up. ''Criminals have figured out this is a way to make extra money and not get caught on a regular basis,'' he said.
 Ira Rheingold, the executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a nonprofit legal group in Washington, said prospective homeowners should be wary of unwittingly involving themselves in fraud.
 According to Mr. Rheingold, most consumers who engage in mortgage fraud are subprime borrowers. A predatory lender will push such cash-poor borrowers into loans they cannot afford by overstating their income and assets on the loan application. ''Some applications created by brokers are the greatest pieces of fiction I ever read,'' he said.
 These borrowers are either not sophisticated enough to catch falsifications on the loan's closing documents or simply don't want to lose the chance to live in a particular house.
 To avoid such situations, Mr. Rheingold said, borrowers should know their credit scores and shop around to get a sense of what loan terms they can reasonably expect. Applicants should also demand closing documents early in the process, so they can catch inaccuracies or falsifications before they pack up for the move.
 And although consumers cannot do much to thwart ''fraud for profit,'' they should be aware that such crimes ultimately cost them money, Mr. Dinham said. ''Companies aren't going to continue to lose money on this without charging more,'' he said. ''Anytime you have a problem this broad, consumers end up paying a premium at some point.''

HEADLINE: Betting on Demand for a Castle

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: SADDLE RIVER 

 BODY:
THERE is a castle being built on speculation here beside the Saddle River: an 18,000-square-foot manse with a turret, two libraries, four laundry rooms, a six-car garage, nine full baths and a 14-seat home theater. The price tag says $12.9 million.
 If they build it, will a buyer come? 
''We're pretty confident -- even in this slower market,'' said Michael Cantor, the head of Pinnacle Homes' custom homes division, which began construction of the castle 11 months ago. ''We could build more $5 million houses here, I guess. I think that's a more risky undertaking in the current environment, frankly, than building this house.''
 Various market reports showed a drastic slowing of the high-end market in New Jersey this spring. Even in highly affluent Bergen County, home of Saddle River, the average time it takes to sell any house priced above $1 million is now 12 months, according to the Otteau Appraisal Group's analyses, which are widely read by real estate professionals.
 Mr. Cantor agreed that the high-end sector is tightening. But in his view, the ''high high-end'' market for a unique house that can set a multimillionaire's heart aflutter in an instant does not wane with interest rate fluctuations or the size of a year-end bonus.
 Even in inflationary times like these, Mr. Cantor noted, ''There are still lots of very rich people around.''
 The 26-room castle, set on an exquisite 4.2-acre property that stretches 850 feet back to the riverbank from East Saddle River Road, was designed with a particular sort of very rich person in mind, he said -- most likely someone in the entertainment field with ties to both coasts. 
 The hip hop mogul Russell Simmons and his brother, the rapper Reverend Run, both live over the line in Upper Saddle River not far from where the castle is rising, as do a number of music and film industry executives. The mystery writer Mary Higgins Clark resides in town. Ashley Olsen, one of the acting twins, has a house here.
 The location provides easy access to the fast lane from a cozy berth of privacy, Mr. Cantor suggested. More than 30 years ago, Richard Nixon found elegant seclusion in Saddle River after leaving the presidency in disgrace.
 On the other hand, this particular abode will most likely appeal to a buyer who relishes holding extravagant parties and inviting revelers to stay over for a few days -- or maybe a few weeks, or months.
 ''Midtown Manhattan is 30 minutes away,'' Mr. Cantor said, ''but here you can live like Great Gatsby. This house is all about entertaining.''
 Designed by the Westwood architect Robert Zampolin, New Jersey's architect to the stars, the house sits behind stone privacy walls and wrought-iron gates opening to a long driveway that terminates in a ''motor court'' accommodating up to 14 vehicles.
 The first floor features an enormous domed foyer opening onto a huge library; a grand dining room with a double-sided fireplace; a breakfast area overlooking the pool and grounds; a kitchen with two islands and a coffee bar (cappuccino available via spigot); an adjoining family room; a household operations room with the computerized controls to the security, electric and heating/cooling systems (also operable by touch screens placed around the house); a pantry; a desk area; a room set aside for wrapping gifts; an elevator vestibule; staff quarters; and a separate guest suite.
 Upstairs, there are numerous bedroom suites and a children's wing with a ''learning center'' and crafts room. The 2,300-square-foot master suite is roughly the same size as the 1950's ranch house that is still standing on the property and is serving as a construction office for Pinnacle Custom until the new house is completed.
 Off the master bedroom, there is a large elevated terrace that shelters another large terrace below, which is part of the pool area.
 The lower level, partly below ground, is the area of the house that is most likely to capture the heart of the person who loves to entertain. It has both a wine cellar and a wine-tasting room, set up like a bistro and featuring a lovely view of the backyard. A fitness center has windows looking onto an indoor basketball court and an adjacent beverage center. 
 This level also has a billiards room and a lounge area with French doors opening to the stone terrace around the pool and the cabana, which itself has a lounge area as well as a full kitchen, full bath, changing room with lockers, and laundry room.
 The history of houses along East Saddle River Road tends to reflect the squat little ranch that will be demolished sometime this fall when work on the driveway and castle motor court begins.
 But the castle is more in line with what is going on now -- there is a gargantuan Mediterranean abode being custom-built two doors away -- and may well point to the future in the neighborhood, Mr. Cantor said.
 His company is always searching the area for opportunities to maximize the value of a special piece of property, he said, just as it is constantly scouting in other tony spots like nearby Alpine and Greenwich, Conn., for a castle-capacity property, he said.
 ''In a place like Greenwich, they do lots of teardowns in order to build new mansion-type homes,'' he said. ''But in this part of New Jersey, there are still some properties like this, in semirural spots and horse farm towns, that have been virtually untouched all this time.''
 There is an ancient grove of trees circling a pond edged with stones that is back by the river on the expansive East Saddle River Road site, he noted. ''It's like having a piece of Central Park in your backyard,'' he said, ''but hardly anyone has ever even seen it. It has just been waiting to be discovered.''

HEADLINE: Deregulating a Stabilized Apartment 

 BODY:

Q. I have heard that once the monthly rent in a stabilized apartment surpasses $2,000, it can be deregulated if the tenants' income is high enough. Can you describe the terms under which this can occur? Mitch Horowitz, Manhattan

A. Mary Ann Hallenborg, a Manhattan lawyer and the author of ''New York Tenants' Rights'' (Nolo, 2002), said that under the ''luxury decontrol'' provision of the rent laws, once a tenant's rent is $2,000 a month or more, the landlord may be entitled to remove the apartment from regulation. 
 For an apartment to be deregulated, total annual income for all tenants in the household must be $175,000 or more for each of the previous two years. '' 'Annual income' means your federal adjusted gross income as reported on your New York State income tax return,'' Ms. Hallenborg said. ''And 'total annual income' means the sum of annual incomes for all permanent occupants of the apartment.''
To deregulate an apartment, the landlord must send the tenant an Income Certification Form by May 1, she said. The tenant must return the form within 30 days, indicating if the total annual household income is $175,000 or not. 
 If the total annual household income is $175,000 or more, the landlord must file a petition for deregulation with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal by June 30. The agency will then issue a deregulation order within 30 days. 
 If the tenant does not return the certification form on time, the landlord can file the petition, and the agency will ask state tax officials to review the tenants' tax returns to determine if the income threshold has been exceeded. 

Does the Managing Agent Have Conflicting Interests?

Q. I live in a co-op, and the managing agent is on the board of directors as the sponsor's designee. Is this a conflict of interest? Valerie Duval, Hartsdale, N.Y.

A. ''The agent's interests as a building manager could easily come into conflict with the agent's fiduciary duties as a board member,'' said Kenneth Jacobs, a co-op lawyer with offices in Yonkers and Manhattan.
 ''And the potential for conflicts would be even greater if the agent was appointed to the board as the sponsor's designee,'' he said, ''because the agent would then have to balance his own interests with the interests of the sponsor and the interests of the co-op.'' 
 Co-op boards rely on their managing agents for advice on running the building, Mr. Jacobs said, and since the sponsor, who is usually a nonresident, may have different opinions from those of residents on many issues, his designee may not be able to render objective advice.
 In this case, the co-op board should keep a close eye on the managing agent, he said, and if necessary, it should replace him.

HEADLINE: Which Fund Does An Adviser Love More?

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IS a mutual fund a better bet if it is managed by a firm that also runs a hedge fund? You might think so, since the arrangement could give investors access to hedge-fund-quality acumen at the lower cost of a mutual fund. 
 It may work out that way for some hedge fund-mutual fund combinations. But a new study has concluded that mutual funds are often victimized in such pairings, because firms that manage both kinds generally have financial incentives that favor hedge funds over mutual funds. 
The study recently began circulating in academic circles as a working paper and was presented late last month at the Western Finance Association. Its authors are Scott Gibson, associate professor of finance at the Mason Business School of the College of William and Mary; Gjergji Cici, who has accepted an appointment as an assistant professor of finance there this fall; and Rabih Moussawi, associate director of research data services at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. A copy is at papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=905600. The researchers say it offers empirical support for concerns expressed in a 2003 staff report of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Until the mid-1990's, when the hedge fund industry began to grow quickly, it was relatively rare for mutual funds and hedge funds to be managed by the same investment advisory firm. In 2004, though, the latest year for which data were available, 325 actively managed equity mutual funds were run by firms that also ran hedge funds. Collectively, those 325 managed more than $448 billion. Professor Gibson says he wouldn't be surprised if such side-by-side management relationships were even more common today.
 While performance incentives are rare among mutual funds, they are the norm among hedge funds. The manager of a hedge fund typically keeps a large percentage of his fund's profits -- as much as 20 percent, and sometimes even more. 
 Another difference is that hedge funds are lightly regulated, and they are free of many of the rules that keep mutual funds from pursuing esoteric and complex strategies like selling short or investing in derivatives. Some of these strategies enable a hedge fund to make money even in a falling market. Because of these differences, talented mutual fund managers have a powerful incentive to become hedge fund managers, according to Joseph Sack, executive vice president of the Bond Market Association, a trade association whose members include senior executives of most major asset management firms. To help prevent a brain drain away from mutual funds, Mr. Sack and many other asset managers argue, mutual fund companies shouldn't be prevented from allowing their managers to run hedge funds as well.
 Such side-by-side management arrangements, however, are fraught with significant conflicts of interest, according to the 2003 report prepared by the S.E.C.'s division of investment management. A firm that manages both kinds of funds generally earns more if its hedge fund performs well than if its mutual fund does. This creates powerful incentives to favor the hedge fund by ''allocating investment opportunities to the hedge fund,'' the 2003 report said. 
 The S.E.C.'s staff hasn't seen the new academic study and has no comment on it, said John D. Heine, an S.E.C. spokesman.
 Until the completion of the new study, the debate over side-by-side management arrangements remained theoretical. Professor Gibson says he is aware of no other study that resolves it empirically. 
 He and his co-authors focused on 457 actively managed equity mutual funds that, at least some of the time from 1994 to 2004, were run by firms that also managed hedge funds. For each of these funds, the professors selected a group of comparable funds that were identical in major respects except that the managers of these corresponding funds were not affiliated with a hedge fund.
 The authors found strong support for the S.E.C.'s concern about the effects of conflicts of interest. On average, the authors found, the 457 mutual funds underperformed the comparable funds by 1.2 percent a year. The researchers estimated that the lower performance in effect represented a wealth transfer of $5.6 billion in 2004 from the advisory firms' mutual funds to their hedge funds. 
 The researchers say that their results reflect an average across the 457 funds, and that some individual mutual funds affiliated with hedge funds did better than the comparable mutual funds. The researchers did not gain access to trading records and therefore had no specific knowledge about how any particular firm might have favored its hedge fund over its mutual fund.
 Nevertheless, the researchers argue that there is no shortage of ways in which a firm could show such favoritism. Some are blatant, like having the hedge fund trade in advance of the mutual fund -- a practice known as front-running -- which in some instances would probably be illegal. Others are subtler -- if a firm, for example, allocates to its hedge fund any portions of hot initial public offerings that the firm receives.
 THIS last practice was the only method of playing favorites that the researchers could nail down with any certainty. They found that mutual funds run by firms that also managed hedge funds received significantly fewer shares of I.P.O.'s than did the comparable mutual funds. Basing their conclusion on statistical analysis, the researchers said they were confident that the difference couldn't be attributed merely to chance.
 The study clearly suggests that investors should avoid mutual funds managed by firms that also run hedge funds. But there is a broader message as well: conflicts of interest are not just theoretical; they can influence managers' behavior. 
 Professor Gibson recommends careful study of the incentives under which an advisory firm operates. If those incentives aren't aligned with your own, he says, stay away.

HEADLINE: In a U-Turn Quarter, a Retreat From Risk

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM

 BODY:
MUTUAL fund investors who hitched their wagons to the speculative frenzy that propelled the markets earlier this year learned a valuable but costly lesson in the second quarter.
 Investment bandwagons have a nasty habit of reversing course without warning. And ''this was one of those U-turn type quarters,'' said Ernest M. Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash.
As central banks around the world tightened monetary conditions, investors appeared to lose all appetite for taking risks. Partly as a result, the average general domestic stock mutual fund tumbled 2.9 percent in the three months through June. 
 The losses would have been much more severe if not for an 11th-hour rally in stocks on June 29, the day before the quarter ended. That was the day the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the 17th consecutive time in the last two years, but intimated that it might soon pause. 
 Among all domestic stock funds, including sector portfolios, the average quarterly loss was also 2.9 percent, according to Morningstar, the fund tracker. That was significantly worse than the 0.1 percent gain of taxable bond funds and marked a reversal from the first quarter, when domestic stock funds gained 6.4 percent.
 Despite the recent sell-off in equities, though, domestic stock funds have managed gains of 10.9 percent over the last 12 months, which is almost exactly in line with historical norms.
 What was not normal was the degree of speculation that stock investors exhibited earlier this year, in the fourth year of an aging bull market. Traditionally, investors bet big on risky assets early in a bull market, and then gradually become more conservative. But in the first quarter, investors were pouring money into speculative stocks, like those in emerging-market funds, which rose 12.3 percent in the first three months of this year. That helped to feed heightened interest in foreign stocks in general.
 Unfortunately, those emerging-market stock funds were slammed harder than domestic holdings during the second-quarter storm that began in May, when the Fed started to sound hawkish on inflation. The average diversified emerging-market stock fund lost 5.1 percent over the last three months, according to Morningstar; stock funds that specialize in Latin America declined 3.2 percent, on average.
 To be sure, over the last five years, emerging-market stock portfolios are still among the best performers, with annualized gains of 20.8 percent. That compares with an average loss of 0.1 percent for large-cap domestic growth funds.
 Nevertheless, the recent rockiness in emerging markets is part of a larger theme, said Jeffrey J. Schappe, chief investment officer at BB&T Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C. ''We're seeing a very significant correction,'' he said, ''in the riskiest asset classes.'' 
 Tom Roseen, senior research analyst at Lipper, the fund tracker, said that among domestic stock funds, ''the area that probably got punished the worst was science and technology.'' The average technology fund lost 9.7 percent of its value in the second quarter, while telecommunications funds, on average, dropped 4.4 percent.
 AMONG general domestic stock funds, those that invest in growth-oriented equities were hit much harder than so-called value funds. The average large-cap growth fund lost 4.7 percent, while the average large-cap value fund fell 0.1 percent.
 Investors in the second quarter also saw a long-anticipated end to small-stock dominance. For the first time in a long while, large blue-chip stock funds outperformed riskier small-company stock portfolios by a meaningful margin. Small-cap growth funds sank 6.7 percent.
 Already, professional money managers have begun shifting their emphasis back toward large-cap stocks.
 According a June survey of money managers by the Russell Investment Group, a vast majority are now bullish on large-cap shares in general. When asked about their view of small-cap growth and small-cap value stocks, meanwhile, more money managers called themselves bearish than said they were bullish. 
 Mr. Roseen of Lipper said he would not be surprised if the same shift in attitude occurred among mutual fund investors. He said those investors, fearful of rising market volatility, ''now have a 'pay me now' mentality,'' which is likely to renew interest in large-cap portfolios. Such funds tend to throw off more dividends than their small-cap counterparts. 
 A shift toward stability and away from speculation has already begun to drive some investors out of the emerging markets. While international stock funds in general continued to attract net inflows of new money in May, investors redeemed a net $916 million out of emerging-market stock funds, according to Lipper. 
 Because of hefty losses in the emerging markets and Japan -- the average Japanese stock fund was down 7.8 percent in the last quarter -- the average international stock fund fell 1.5 percent. Still, that was better than the performance of domestic portfolios.
 Whether investors in the United States continue to bet big overseas may well depend on how the domestic stock market performs for the remainder of the year.
 Some market watchers said the volatility that began in May could mean a rocky summer for equities. Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor of The Stock Trader's Almanac, said he thought that the equity market was headed for ''an old-fashioned bear market'' sometime later this year. ''We've got a bull that's running out of reasons to be bullish,'' he said.
 Mr. Hirsch added that because this was the second year of a presidential term, the markets were ripe for a real downturn. These midterm years have historically been the worst for stocks. 
 Others are not so pessimistic. Neil J. Hennessy, president and portfolio manager of Hennessy Funds, said that while economic and corporate-profit growth might be slowing somewhat, the underlying health of the economy was still strong.
 ''By historic standards, we still have relatively low interest rates, low unemployment and low inflation,'' he said. 
 Mr. Hennessy said the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed as high as 11,642.65 on May 10 before falling nearly 1,000 points by mid-June, could hit 12,000 by the end of the year. ''We've got 180 days before year's end,'' he said. ''All it would take is 10 days of 100-point moves, and everything could be a wash for the rest of the year.''
 REGARDLESS of the economic outlook, Mr. Schappe of BB&T Asset Management said investors should consider focusing more on higher-quality stocks. Just as blue-chip stocks and stock funds are likely to hold up better in a downturn, they may also provide decent growth if the market regains its footing this year, he said. Wall Street, he said, has largely overlooked the strong earnings and fundamentals of large-cap companies lately. 
 An emphasis on quality also applies to foreign investing, he said. Investors would do well to embrace high-quality large-cap foreign stocks and stock funds in the developed markets, he said, rather than playing the momentum game of the emerging markets or fleeing international equities altogether. 
 Investors enjoyed huge returns with seemingly little risk even in highly volatile investments at the start of the year. But that was when equity prices were going through the roof. If the second quarter proved anything, Mr. Schappe said, it was that ''risk is being put back'' into the risk-return relationship.

HEADLINE: Calories, Economics And the Sweetener Debate

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Does This Goo Make You Groan?'' (July 2), about the debate over high-fructose corn syrup: 
 It's not that high-fructose corn syrup, in and of itself, is harmful. As you point out, its mixture of fructose and glucose is nearly the same as that in sucrose, table sugar. The importance of the syrup lies in its economics: it is much cheaper to produce than sucrose, and its consumption has soared as the food industry has pushed all of us to consume more of it in processed foods. 
 Total caloric consumption is what matters in obesity, and caloric sweeteners are especially important, whether high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose or the mixture of naturally occurring sugars in ''100 percent fruit juice.'' Government data demonstrate unequivocally that Americans are taking in more calories now than 25 years ago.

 I am a scientist with 25 years in the food industry, including involvement in research leading to the replacement of sucrose with high-fructose corn syrup in carbonated beverages. 
 Though high-fructose corn syrup is easy to spot on many labels on grocery store shelves, its purposes in foods and beverages are not fully appreciated by most consumers. More than just a sweetener, it keeps food fresh longer by inhibiting microbial growth, enhances fruit and spice flavors, improves surface browning of breads and gives a soft texture to baked goods. 
 Like all nutritive sweeteners, it contains calories. But critics who attack a single ingredient as the sole cause of obesity are wrong and counterproductive. A quixotic search for an easy answer means true solutions to the obesity problem are not being found.

To the Editor:
 Glucose, sucrose, fructose. What does it matter? Isn't weight gain or loss ultimately the equation of ''calories in'' minus ''calories burned''? Every drop of high-fructose corn syrup you ingest adds to your waistline, while benefiting its manufacturers' bottom line.

To the Editor:
 What isn't mentioned in debates over high-fructose corn syrup is the taste. As far as I'm concerned, this is the real objection to putting the syrup into so many products. 
 High-fructose corn syrup has a quality, absent from cane sugar, that I would call cloying, an undertone that most people come to take for granted after a few decades of eating it in everything they buy.

HEADLINE: Are Large Caps Back in Style?

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN

 BODY:
AMID rising interest rates and market volatility, many investment strategists say it is time to refocus on those core investments: large-capitalization domestic stock funds. 
 ''We feel very strongly that the tide has gone out with respect to more-risky asset classes,'' said Nick Bohnsack, investment strategist at the ISI Group in New York. ''Investors should look toward higher-quality asset classes, and in our view the most attractive is U.S. large caps.''
 Despite their usually prominent position in investor portfolios, large-capitalization domestic stocks and stock funds, which include Standard & Poor's 500-stock index funds, have been out of favor with investors in recent years, and no wonder. Domestic small-cap stock funds and emerging-market funds outperformed domestic large caps for the three years through April 2006, posting gains of better than 20 percent a year. The S.& P. 500 returned 14.7 percent, annualized, during that period. 
 Investors actually pulled a net $10.2 billion out of large-cap blend funds in 2005 and early 2006, according to the Financial Research Corporation. That was the first time investors took money out of this group of core stock funds since 1994, when the company began tracking fund categories. Large-cap blend funds meld growth and value characteristics in a single portfolio. 
 ''Market history is highly cyclical: winners become losers and vice versa,'' said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in the investment counseling and research group at Vanguard. ''Investors would do themselves a huge service by going back to core funds,'' he said.
 At the end of June, there were signs that money was flowing back into large-cap stock funds, with domestic funds reporting net inflows of $20 million for the week ended June 28, according to AMG Data. TheiShares Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks reported net outflows of $2.47 billion, AMG reported.
 The valuation of large-cap domestic stocks has become more attractive. Since December 2001, operating earnings for the stocks in the S.& P. 500 have soared 113 percent, to an estimated $21.22 a share at the end of the second quarter. The S.& P. 500 index, meanwhile, rose a total of 10.6 percent. 
 Because of investor neglect of large caps in the face of rising earnings, the average price-to-earnings ratio of S.& P. 500 stocks has fallen almost in half since 2001. It was 15.7 times estimated 2006 operating earnings at the end of the second quarter, compared with a multiple of 29.55 in 2001. That P/E is 20 percent below the average since 1988, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P.
 Jeffrey S. Coons, co-director of research at Manning & Napier Advisors, which manages $12 billion in assets, notes that the Russell 2000 small-cap index now sells at a 20 percent premium to the Russell 1000 large-cap index, based on their price-to-earnings ratios. The last time that happened was in 1983, just before large caps embarked on an extended period of superior performance. 
 ''Right now, we're finding many more good large-cap opportunities,'' said Mr. Coons, whose firm invests in both large- and small-cap stocks. The company manages the Exeter Pro-Blend Maximum Term and Exeter Tax-Managed funds.
 Large-cap earnings are expected to continue to grow at a healthy clip. Earnings of S.& P. 500 companies are likely to rise 12 percent in 2006, according to Standard & Poor's. 
 The economic and market environment, meanwhile, has become increasingly difficult. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates 17 times in the last two years, and those higher rates will eventually result in slower economic growth. And slower growth and less liquidity in the financial system are expected to exact a higher toll on small companies than on large ones. 
 Large companies generally have more diversified product lines and access to cheaper sources of capital than small companies do. ''A bigger ship can handle a blow better than a rowboat,'' said Christopher Davis, a fund analyst at Morningstar. 
 In the second quarter, large-cap core funds were down 2.13 percent, compared with a 4.4 percent decline in small-cap funds, according to Morningstar.
 No one really knows whether small caps' day in the sun is really over, of course.
 ''We continue to see earnings forecasts for small- and mid-cap stocks that are very good,'' said Philip Edwards, managing director of portfolio services at S.& P. ''I'm not predicting a time when small caps won't do as well as large caps, but all good things must come to an end.'' Earnings for the S.& P. 600 SmallCap index are expected to rise 18 percent this year. But even if small-cap funds continue to perform well, some advisers say, investors should consider taking profits in sectors that have done well and redirect money to areas of the market with better value.
 ''People have overallocated to small-cap and international in the last three years, plus those markets have outperformed,'' said Gregory D. Sullivan, managing director at Sullivan Bruyette Speros & Blayney, a wealth management firm in McLean, Va. ''Now's the time to trim back on the parts of your portfolio that have done so well and reallocate your investments back to the core.'' 
 Mr. Sullivan's preferred method for investing in large-cap stocks is exchange-traded funds that track the S.& P. 500 or the Morgan Stanley Capital International U.S. Prime Market 750 index. Since 2001, Mr. Sullivan has bought $170 million of large-cap core E.T.F.'s for his clients. 
 He likes E.T.F.'s because of their low cost, tax efficiency and ability to trade throughout the day. ''That provides some peace of mind for clients,'' he said. 
 The expense ratio on the SPDR E.T.F., which tracks the S.& P. 500 index, is 0.1 percent, while the expense ratio for the Vanguard Large-Cap E.T.F., which tracks the MSCI 750 index, is 0.07 percent. 
 ''They're just an incredibly efficient way to buy into this basket of stocks,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
 Other options are index mutual funds like Fidelity Spartan 500 Index, with an expense ratio of 0.1 percent, or Vanguard 500 Index, at 0.18 percent. 
 ''These funds are the low-cost leaders,'' Mr. Davis of Morningstar said. ''That's why they're our favorites.'' 
 Actively managed large-cap blend funds are another way to gain exposure to large-cap stocks, said Josh Weiss, a partner and co-chief investment officer at Litman/Gregory Asset Management in Orinda, Calif., an investment adviser and sponsor of the Masters Select group of funds.
 ''We believe we can find great managers,'' he said.
 Among large blend funds, Mr. Weiss recommended Selected American, a fund run by Christopher C. Davis and Kenneth C. Feinberg. Mr. Weiss said this was a ''true core fund'' with a well-diversified portfolio. 
 Mr. Davis and Mr. Feinberg run a portion of the Masters Select Equity fund, as does Bill Miller, manager of Legg Mason Value Trust, another fund that Mr. Weiss likes. 
 AMONG actively managed funds, Mr. Davis of Morningstar recommends Vanguard PrimeCap Core, which opened in December 2004. The team that runs the fund is the same one that manages the Vanguard PrimeCap fund, which is closed to new investors. 
 In the large-cap blend category, Mr. Edwards of S.& P. likes the Pioneer Fund, the Thornburg Value fund and the Victory Diversified Stock fund. All have managers who have compiled strong, consistent track records over an extended period.
 Mr. Davis said investors should not overthink the current state of the market when they rebalance their portfolios.
 ''I wouldn't focus on trying to time this just right,'' he said. ''No one knows when or what is going to turn things around for large-company stocks. But this is the area of the market where you're going to find core holdings for your portfolio. You need core holdings in any environment.''

HEADLINE: Cash May Not Be King, but It's Wielding More Power

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AFTER 17 interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve over the last two years, money managers are souring on many investments, including small-company stocks, emerging market equities and real estate.
 But investors have become more bullish on at least one investment of late: cash. In fact, nearly 40 percent of fund managers are holding more cash in their portfolios than they normally do, according to a recent survey by Merrill Lynch.
''I can't recall a time when we've used cash the way we've used it this year,'' said Jeffrey L. Knight, lead manager of the Putnam Asset Allocation funds. Usually, his funds hold close to no cash, in an effort to be fully invested in stocks and bonds. But this year, Mr. Knight has increased his cash positions to around 10 percent. 
 For individual investors, the question is, are there ways to follow the lead of Mr. Knight and other fund managers without upsetting long-term asset allocation plans?
 It's understandable why the pros are so enamored of cash. Thanks to the Federal Reserve, which has gradually lifted its target for its benchmark short-term interest rate to 5.25 percent from 1 percent in 2004, money market mutual funds are now paying out 4.6 percent, on average, three-month Treasury bills are yielding nearly 5 percent and some one-year bank certificates of deposit are paying 5 percent or more.
 ''It's hard to pass up a sure thing earning 5 percent,'' said Ernest M. Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash. The risk-free returns being offered in the money markets are especially attractive in a volatile year when many blue-chip stocks are showing losses.
 But unlike professional fund managers, individuals shouldn't just weigh the short-term prospects of one asset class against another and shift accordingly. Individuals have to consider their long-term goals and should be careful not to let day-to-day market trends lead them astray.
 Still, there are ways for individuals to ''incorporate some flexibility'' into asset allocation plans, to take advantage of today's cash returns, Mr. Knight said. 
 For starters, you can simply be more patient when you deploy new money. 
 After the market sell-off that began in May, many assets are trading 5 percent to 10 percent below their recent highs. Some investors may be tempted to step back into the market and buy on the second-quarter dip.
 But Nick Nanda, asset allocation specialist at GMO, the investment management firm in Boston, said the relatively high yields of cash allow investors to take a wait-and-see approach. ''Why should I be greedy?'' Mr. Nanda said. ''Why not wait until there's more clarity in the markets?''
 The historically high return for cash ''makes waiting more palatable,'' said James B. Stack, editor of InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter. And if stocks fall more this summer, cash will become even more valuable to investors than the current 5 percent yields imply. That's because ''cash will buy more stocks later on when they're cheaper,'' Mr. Stack said. 
 ''People tend not to think of it this way,'' he added, ''but the value of cash in your portfolio literally rises whenever other assets fall.'' Investors are often reminded that they should rebalance their portfolios at least once or twice a year. That means taking some profits off the table in winning investments and using the proceeds to add to positions in other asset classes that haven't been performed as well. 
 But there's no rule that says you have to rebalance in one fell swoop. Instead of immediately redeploying money back into the markets when you sell some of your winning stocks, consider dollar-cost averaging that money back into the markets. Dollar-cost averaging means spreading out your purchases over routine intervals, perhaps every month or every quarter, instead of making one lump-sum investment.
 Normally, the downside of such a strategy is that by waiting to put all your money back to work, you'll lose out on some stock market gains, because cash generally underperforms stocks and bonds. The cash drag is one reason that many professional money managers try to be fully invested at all times. 
 But today, cash probably isn't dragging your portfolio. It may be leading it. And ''dollar-cost averaging can be a very effective way to moderate the downside risk of an investment, particularly an investment in a volatile category'' like emerging markets, Mr. Knight said. 
 ''Of course, equity investors aren't the only ones thinking of raising cash. Bond investors are probably asking themselves, ''Why do I need to buy a 10-year Treasury note when I can get a C.D. paying 5 percent?'' said Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management, based in Los Angeles.
 Generally, long-term bonds pay investors higher yields than short-term securities because they tie up your money for longer periods of time. But today, this so-called yield curve between short- and long-term securities is pretty flat. 
 Ms. Cohen says fixed-income investors can take advantage of the attractive yields of cash, without upsetting their long-term allocations, by simply investing the interest income thrown off by their long-term bonds into cash instruments rather than re-investing it into new long-term bonds. ''There's real value in six-month and three-month Treasuries,'' she said.
 BUT if you take this approach, ''you have to be nimble,'' she said. Given the uncertainties surrounding the economy, the Fed may have to start cutting interest rates early in 2007. If that happens, your cash accounts are likely to pay less next year than they do today. 
 ''The big challenge for individual investors, once they're in cash, is to know when to get out of cash,'' said Mr. Ankrim of the Russell Investment Group.
 For individuals, it's important to remember that cash, by its nature, is a short-term asset. It's often simply a place to park your money while you decide what to do in the long term. 
 So if you choose to raise cash in the coming weeks, remember that the meter is running. Be on the lookout for better long-term places to stash that cash as opportunities present themselves in stocks and bonds later this year.

HEADLINE: A Bond-Market Puzzler: Which Way the Fed? 

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
FOR more than two years, investors in bonds and other fixed-income securities have struggled against the fierce headwind of the Federal Reserve's unremitting drive to keep inflation in check.
 Now, having lifted the benchmark overnight interest rate to 5.25 percent, the Fed seems close to finishing its work for this cycle, giving income-seeking investors some respite from attendant losses in the value of their holdings. In fact, it may not be long before they enjoy a breeze at their backs, as Fed watchers have begun to predict the start of rate cuts.
''I think the Fed has things under control,'' said Dan Shackelford, head of fixed-income strategy at T. Rowe Price, asserting that much of the rate-raising has yet to bite into economic growth. Perhaps one or two more increases, he suggested, will produce ''the most compelling buying opportunity'' in years, at least for Treasury securities.
 Other specialists concur that some elements of the credit market have become attractive and are no longer destined to lose more from declining portfolio value than they make from interest, quite apart from the further drag of inflation and taxes. 
 Many favor intermediate-maturity Treasury obligations, but even one of the safest havens -- the money market -- now provides tempting yields that rival those of the longest-term bonds.
 ''Money market funds look great right now,'' said Robert F. Auwaerter, head of fixed-income portfolio management at Vanguard. As for securities that come due not in months but in several years, he suggested, ''It's time to nibble.''
 Despite such cautious optimism, the Federal Reserve may tighten more. Some people say it will raise rates not only in August but also later in the year, perhaps pushing them as high as 6 percent by year-end.
 ''I don't think that's out of the realm of possibility,'' said Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a research group, because the Federal Reserve seems unusually ''inflation-phobic,'' to use his phrase.
 Many investors think that the new Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, needs to show his anti-inflation resolve. His hand is strengthened, they say, in that he is a longtime authority on monetary policy during a time of turnover on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. What is more, central banks in Europe and Asia are raising rates or may be about to do so. So while the fixed-income market is providing the highest inflation-adjusted yields in three years, investors are advised to be selective and alert to the possibility that inflation, already edging above the comfort levels of various Fed officials, will prove hard to contain.
 For starters, many strategists agree that long-term bonds, which are subject to hefty price swings, are designed for institutional investors who seek to match long-term liabilities. But they are not generally advisable for individual investors who do not intend to hold them for decades until maturity.
 ''We never have, never will use 20- or 30-year bonds'' for clients, said Bruce J. Berno, president of Berno Financial Management in Cincinnati. Not only do such bonds suffer from big swings in price, but the current yield curve -- the array of rates across the maturity spectrum -- is flat. This means long-term rates are not significantly better for high-quality securities than rates for the short term, providing little incentive for investors to assume the extra risk.
 Traditionally, Mr. Berno said, the optimum risk-reward tradeoff has been 5 to 10 years. Aside from buying bonds of short maturity, what else can an investor do if inflation requires stronger-than-expected countermeasures by the Fed? 
 Other than staying in the safe harbor of money market funds, where yields rise fairly promptly in the wake of Fed increases, one can consider investing in floating bank loans. Jennifer K. Wynn, vice president and principal of Merganser Capital Management, a bond firm catering to institutions, noted that such bank loans reset interest rates periodically to stay competitive.
 ''What this does is protect the principal value of that portion of your portfolio,'' she said. ''The price is not going to vary much from par as interest rates rise or fall.'' 
 Another way to conserve principal is to buy amortizing securities, backed by mortgages or other assets that repay a portion of one's investment before maturity. The cash generated by these securities, like Ginnie Maes, can be reinvested at progressively higher rates. 
 In the case of collateralized mortgage obligations, specific security classes are created to receive interest payments funneled from the entire pool, ensuring payoff at a particular time.
 Individual investors are almost always better off using mutual funds as a route to floating bank loans and amortizing investments, which are not always of the highest quality and can pose tax and bookkeeping complexities.
 Then there are Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. First offered in 1997, they have become highly popular with investors seeking an assured, albeit modest, yield that keeps them ahead of inflation.
 ''You're going to earn 2 1/2 to 3 percentage points above the rate of inflation, which over long periods is really not a bad return,'' Mr. Shackelford said.
 A dozen mutual funds and the iShares Lehman U.S. TIPS Bond fund, one of the biggest fixed-income exchange-traded funds, invest in these securities, whose principal increases twice a year to reflect consumer inflation. A new 10-year issue is to be marketed this month. There are also several foreign versions of inflation-protected bonds.
 Specialists caution, however, that fears of inflation have recently run ahead of increases in prices, so TIPS have been bid to relatively high prices, depressing yields.
 Municipal bonds have been stellar performers of late. In many cases, their valuations have been so compelling that T. Rowe Price fund managers have bought some for taxable portfolios. The higher prices, however, have now made them less attractive, Mr. Shackelford said.
 Many fixed-income specialists caution against buying individual corporate bonds. The marketability of individual issues may be poor, specialists say, and some bonds could suffer if Fed tightening slows the economy so profits shrink or something else happens to impair a company's ability to pay its debt, as can occur with heavy borrowing for a takeover or leveraged buyout. 
 ''We're in a period of increasing event risk,'' Ms. Wynn at Merganser observed. ''The amount of money that has accumulated in the private equity funds is just tremendous.'' 
 She minimized, however, the chance of a major shift out of United States Treasury securities by central banks of developing countries, a move that Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary, has said would help those countries if they invested instead in stocks. 
 Mr. Berno, refusing to take on the risk of extended maturities without commensurate returns, has adopted a cautious strategy for fixed-income clients that allocates one-third of their money to TIPS, one-third to short-term Treasuries and corporate bonds and one-third to intermediate-term bonds. He also said tax-exempt bonds were good even for people in moderate tax brackets.
 MR. SHACKELFORD, who runs two bond funds at T. Rowe Price, summed up by calling the current bond environment ''very healthy,'' but he said he would shun lengthy maturities until it was clear how long the Fed would continue to raise rates. 
 ''With higher rates, investors probably should look to add to their fixed-income allocation,'' he said, ''because they're earning a decent amount over and above what I anticipate to be a relatively mild rate of inflation -- 2 to 2 1/2 percent.''
 ''The intermediate part of the curve, three to five years, is going to be a really interesting spot to be,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A City on a Hill, or a Looting Opportunity

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
JUST for my own bad self, I love living in the United States of America. 
 Every night before I go to sleep, I lie in bed next to my wonderful German short-haired pointer, Brigid, and my Dalmatian, Susie, and I look out at the palm trees and the stars and think that the Gestapo isn't chasing me, and that I am grateful. I think that the Soviet NKVD cannot come knocking on my door and send me to Lubyanka prison, and I am ecstatic. I listen to my dogs' soft breathing, and I know my wife is next door in her inner sanctum with her four cats, reading, and I feel safe and grateful.
Life in America in 2006 for an upper middle-class person like me -- who, although overweight, still has decent health -- is just paradise. There is no place like this place, a shining city on a hill, a gift from God every moment of every day. 
 But still, with all of that, something is seriously wrong. I could put it into statistics, and in a small way, I will, but I'll mostly put it in layman's terms.
 When I was a lad, the chief executive of a major public company was paid about 30 or 40 times what a line worker was paid. Now the multiple is about 180. What did they do in the executive suite to become so great? Upon what meat do they feed? Why, as we are being killed by foreign competition, do we need to pay our executives so much?
 We have investigators looking into whether some corporations paid their executives with stock options whose strike price was retroactively determined to be the lowest price of the quarter, so that the options were ''in the money'' from Day One. After opening investigations into the remarkable timing of some of their own option grants, several companies restated their financial reports, which makes it straight-up fraud in my book. Not one person has been charged with any crime, while young black men and women who sell a tiny amount of drugs on a street corner do hard time. How can this be right?
 We have immense corporations that cry the blues all day long about how their pension costs are ruining them and how they have to freeze pensions or lay off workers or end pensions altogether (can you say ''Friendly Skies?'') and turn over the pension liabilities to the taxpayers. And the same corporations set aside many millions for the superpensions of the top executives. 
 Even at my own beloved General Motors, whose Cadillacs I love so much -- precisely because I think of them being made by the sons and grandsons of men who fought in Vietnam and at Peleliu and other bloody World War II battlefields -- there is severe action to have workers quit and to lower their pensions. 
 At the same time, however, spectacularly large executive pensions, coming straight out of profits, keep G.M.'s retired top dogs happily playing golf at the Vintage, while the men who actually made the cars are saying: ''Welcome to Wal-Mart. How can I help you?''
 As I endlessly point out, taxes for the rich are lower than they have ever been in my lifetime. (To be fair, taxes for the nonrich taxes are very low as well.) And this is occurring as we accumulate government liabilities that will kill us in the long run. (And cutting spending will not work. Most federal and state spending is for items that are untouchable, like Medicare, education, the military -- and, most cruelly of all, interest on the national debt. Every president promises to cut spending and not one of them does it unless a war comes to an end.)
 We are mortgaging ourselves to foreigners on a scale that would make George Washington cry. Every day -- every single day -- we borrow a billion dollars from foreigners to buy petroleum from abroad, often from countries that hate us. We are the beggars of the world, financing our lavish lifestyle by selling our family heirlooms and by enslaving our progeny with the need to service the debt.
 I don't see this -- except for the taxes -- as a Republican thing or a Democratic thing. It's just the way we live today. Drunken sailors from the Capitol to the freeways. Heirs living on their inheritance and spending it fast. The titans of corporate America getting as much as they can get away with and hiring lawyers and public-relations people if there is a problem. It is later than anyone dares to think.
 Is this America, where far too many of the rich endlessly loot their stockholders and kick the employees in the teeth, the America that our soldiers in Ramadi and Kirkuk and Anbar Province and Afghanistan are fighting for? Is this America, where we will end up so far behind the financial eight ball we won't be able to see because of mismanagement by both parties, the America that our men and women are losing limbs for, coming home in boxes for?
 The Saturday before Memorial Day, I spoke at a gathering of widows and widowers, parents and children of men and women in uniform who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. The person who spoke before me was a beautiful woman named Joanna Wroblewski, whose husband of less than two years -- after four years dating at Rutgers -- had been killed in Iraq. 
 She cried as she spoke, and she was right to cry, but she said she tried to keep love and trust in her heart. She spoke of her devotion to her country and her husband's pride in the flag. There was not a dry eye in the room, nor should there have been.
 ARE we keeping the faith with Joanna Wroblewski? Are we keeping the faith with her husband? Are we maintaining an America that is not just a financial neighborhood, but also a brotherhood and a sisterhood worth losing your young husband for? 
 Is this still a community of the heart, or a looting opportunity? Will there even be a free America for Mrs. Wroblewski's descendants, or will we be a colony of the people to whom we have sold our soul? Are we keeping the faith with this young widow? That is the question I ask about this beloved and glorious America for which her husband, Lt. John Thomas Wroblewski, died. If we are, we should be proud. If we are not, we'd better change, and soon.

DATELINE: CHICO, Calif. 

 BODY:
IT was the sixth inning of a one-run game between the Chico Outlaws and the Fullerton Flyers when the commissioner of baseball, on his third or fourth beer, stepped into a darkened skybox to explain how he and his partners planned to grow very rich by employing rejects from major-league farm teams. 
 Several hundred fans had gathered here on a Tuesday night earlier this summer to cheer on the Outlaws, one of six teams in the recently birthed Golden Baseball League, but its commissioner, Kevin Outcalt, was distracted. A former Silicon Valley executive who secured this post two years ago after giving the league its first $1 million, Mr. Outcalt was deep into his tale of how he met two Stanford graduate students, David Kaval and Amit Patel, who dreamed up a baseball franchise that all three men describe as an ''alternative entertainment platform.'' 
On the field below, Todd Gossage, the 23-year-old son of Goose Gossage, who pitched for the New York Yankees and other teams, scratched out a base hit. The crowd cheered, but the commissioner barely noticed. The next batter was one of the Golden League's bona fide stars, Desi Wilson, a 37-year-old whose claim to fame is the 41 games he played for the San Francisco Giants in 1996. He began fouling off pitch after pitch, and that got Mr. Outcalt's attention.
 ''There goes $3,'' Mr. Outcalt said as he ruefully watched one of the foul balls sail into the stands. Wilson eventually flew out, but the next batter, a 25-year-old who had washed out of the Chicago Cubs farm system, cracked a two-run homer -- and cost the league another three bucks. This time Mr. Outcalt put a more positive spin on his expenses. 
 Last year, he pointed out, his league had to pay $4 for each baseball it bought. ''This year I was able to negotiate much more favorable terms,'' he said, beaming. Such small victories, he said, aid his quest ''to streamline the cost factors that can otherwise make running a professional baseball league an expensive proposition.''
 Baseball leagues that operate independently from Major League Baseball and its extensive minor league system are not new, but Mr. Outcalt and the Golden League's other founders bring an unusual set of expectations to their two-year-old gambit: the venture capitalists and other lords of Silicon Valley who have so far poured roughly $15 million into the Golden League view their investments no differently from the ones they have in other start-ups. They expect the six-team league to expand to at least 40 teams in the coming years, or maybe even 80, and then to provide them all with a rich payout -- if not through a public stock offering, then through a high-priced sale to a large entertainment conglomerate like Viacom or Disney.
 Golden League investors offer a baseball philosophy that probably would have never passed the lips of a Yogi Berra or Casey Stengel, let alone more money-minded owners like Branch Rickey or Bill Veeck. Today's boys of summer have dollar signs in their eyes.
 ''We're not afraid to put advertising on a helmet,'' said James C. Peters, who became the league's chief operating officer after investing $1.5 million last year.
 NOR have Mr. Peters and his colleagues shown themselves to be afraid of selling the league's very name. Technically, teams are part of the Golden Baseball League Presented by Safeway Inc., an honor secured after Safeway, the supermarket chain based in California, bought three years' worth of naming rights for $3 million.
 So aggressively has the Golden League sold itself that every player in it wears a shoulder patch promoting a fish-oil product called AlphaFlex Omega5 that its manufacturer, Sierra Life Sciences of Reno, Nev., says helps to ease joint pain. The league's team in Yuma, Ariz., constructed a second, taller outfield wall behind the original just to accommodate extra advertisers.
 The league is also willing to stretch when it comes to recruitment. Several days ago, it announced that the San Diego Surf Dawgs signed Jose Canseco, a 42-year-old who once ranked among the most feared hitters in Major League Baseball. He struck out three times in his Golden League debut and the Surf Dawgs traded him after that game to another California team, the Long Beach Armada. But other cheap thrills are in store. The league promises that Canseco, who pitched but one inning in the majors back in 1993, ''will showcase his knuckleball'' this summer.
 Elsewhere in the country, local business leaders generally buy pieces of sports franchises to fulfill childhood dreams or to live life as mini-sports moguls. But the Golden League was christened in Silicon Valley, an area that in recent years has shown as great a devotion to start-ups that provide a potentially rich payoff for investors as it has to wow-inspiring new technologies.
 ''I put in enough where I very much expect to see a return on my investment,'' said Terry Garnett, a venture capitalist who wrote a $1 million check to help get the Golden League started. 
 Other investors in the league whistle a similar tune. ''I made this investment because I think I'm going to make a lot of money on this thing,'' said the venture capitalist William Del Biaggio III, who has earned a tidy fortune by providing loans to technology start-ups that had fallen on hard times.
 To be sure, some of the league's sponsors are in it for more than the money. Pat Sajak, the host of the TV game show ''Wheel of Fortune,'' paid an amount he declined to disclose for a stake in the league, but he said he was motivated ''more out of a love of the game'' than any expectation that he would realize a handsome return.
 ''Although I make a good living, it's not like I can buy the L.A. Dodgers anytime soon, so this seemed a nice way to get involved,'' Mr. Sajak said by telephone.
 THE modern independent baseball era began in 1993 with the resurrection of the long-defunct Northern League, which now fields teams in Fargo, N.D., Schaumburg, Ill., and elsewhere. That league's founder, Miles Wolff Jr., years ago owned the Durham Bulls, the team made famous by the movie ''Bull Durham,'' and his resume includes a stint as a general manager for a Class AA minor league team.
 ''For a long time, I had been frustrated with Major League Baseball controlling Minor League Baseball,'' Mr. Wolff said. Minor league teams are entirely beholden to the major league parent team with which they are affiliated, and that often means that minor league clubs are sometimes not fielding their best teams or doing all they can to win games, Mr. Wolff said. 
 ''The attitude of the major league teams is, 'We gave this guy a big bonus; he has to play,' '' he said. ''Or maybe a guy is a great prospect but he needs work on his curveball, so he's going to throw 27 curveballs in a game whether that helps the team or not.'' 
 The Northern League has had staying power -- growing to eight teams from an initial six -- and has inspired many imitators. But only a small number of them have thrived. (''Just surviving is success in my world,'' Mr. Wolff said.)
 ''Something like 20 independent leagues have started, and today we have around five,'' said Mr. Wolff, who left the Northern League in 2002 and now serves as the commissioner of two others, the American Association and the Can-Am League. The American Association includes teams from smaller markets scattered through the middle of the country, from Texas to Minnesota, while the Can-Am fields teams in New England and Canada. 
 Mr. Wolff is dubious that the founders of the Golden League, which currently fields teams in California, Arizona and Nevada, can strike it rich on independent baseball. ''They can survive and make it,'' he said. ''But I don't look on any of these leagues as significant money-making opportunities.'' 
 One difference between the Golden League and the other surviving independent leagues is in team ownership. The Golden League owns each of its teams, in contrast with other professional baseball leagues, where individuals -- think George Steinbrenner of the Yankees -- or groups of people own an individual team. Theoretically, centralized ownership means that the league's stronger markets can subsidize the weaker ones that have yet to build large-enough fan bases. Centralization should also help keep costs in line in a league where profitability is paramount. 
 ''The biggest advantage of the single-entity model is it gives you control over labor expenditures, because you don't have owners bidding against each other for player services,'' said Scott Rosner, who teaches the business side of sports at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
 So far, player costs in the Golden League have not been a problem -- a distinct advantage when fielding teams made up largely of players in their early 20's who are still hoping for a crack at the majors. 
 And then there are players like A. J. Ampi, 27, the star relief pitcher of the Chico Outlaws, who worked as a used-car salesman in the seven months leading up to the start of the season. The Outlaws' first-base coach is a former police officer from Los Angles whom the team manager, Mark Parent, a former big-league catcher, chose ''because I like hanging around with him and I got to pick who I wanted.''
 Each Golden League team costs $900,000 to $1 million a year to operate, according to the league's founders. Less than 10 percent of those costs are devoted to paying each team's 22 players, given a salary cap of $88,000 per team for the entire three-month, 80-game season.
 No player on the Chico Outlaws is paid more than $1,800 a month, according to the team's general manager, Bob Linscheid, who also runs his own marketing and public relations firm on the side. The median salary on the team, he said, is $1,150 a month -- and at times it shows. 
 The team's newest pickup is Gossage, a third baseman who can hit but is not much of a fielder. And he plainly still has much to learn about base running. In a game late last month, he drifted precariously far from first base after stroking a single. The pitcher whipped the ball to first, and Gossage, whose physique calls to mind nothing so much as a scarecrow, flung himself back to the bag as if a young Superman learning to fly, prompting several teammates to break into the ''Mighty Mouse'' theme song. The same teammates groaned moments later, after the pitcher successfully picked off Mighty Mouse.
 ''There's a reason players here were overlooked,'' said Mr. Parent, whose major league career spanned 13 years and included stints in seven cities. ''They need to work on some part of their game.'' Players hope to round out their game while in the Golden League, he said, and then sign with a major league organization. 
 The quality of play was never an issue when David Kaval conceived of the Golden League while he was still enrolled at Stanford's graduate school of business in 2002. Then 27, Mr. Kaval saw a prime business opportunity in the surging popularity of minor league baseball. That opportunity seemed particularly ripe on the West Coast, which had gone without an independent baseball association since the folding of the Western Baseball League that same year. That league went out of business, several people associated with it said, in large part because of the shaky finances of several of its franchises. 
 As Mr. Kaval saw it, there would never be a shortage of players with skills on a par with those playing for Class A and AA franchises associated with major league teams. ''A lot of these players are really good players,'' he said, ''but their teams don't think they'll ever make it to the majors, and they need to make room for younger players just coming up.'' 
 The real challenge, Mr. Kaval said, is finding cities west of the Rockies that are large enough to support a team and hungry for the kind of wholesome, community-oriented entertainment he seeks to sell. He describes these as ''captive markets,'' which he acknowledges is a more polite way of saying towns ''where there's not really much else to do at night.''
 What does exist in every town, he believes, is an enjoyment of spectacle at bargain prices. 
 ''Minor league baseball is $5 tickets and $3 beers,'' Mr. Kaval said. ''It's team mascots and the stuff that goes on between innings.''
 Mr. Kaval and several classmates worked on a business plan for the league in a Stanford entrepreneurship class. It was there that they hit on the idea of centralized ownership. 
 ''We saw that that was a superior business model and that we could grow to 20 to 30 teams with that model,'' Mr. Kaval said. Their plan called for plowing profits from the more successful teams back into the league, to help with expansion, rather than allowing individual owners to pocket the profits. Even before they completed the class on entrepreneurship, Mr. Kaval and one of his fellow graduate students, Mr. Patel, decided that they would try to sell their idea in the real world. 
 ''A lot of people told us we were out of our minds,'' Mr. Patel said. ''Dave and I were two young guys with no baseball pedigree, and here all these other leagues were started by former Major League Baseball executives with 20 or 30 years in the industry.''
 THEY began peddling their idea in early 2003, when Silicon Valley was still reeling from the dot-com crash and, fortunately for them, looking for new ideas. When Mr. Kaval and Mr. Patel began making the rounds, money was burning a hole in the pockets of those people for whom investing is something between a hobby and a noble calling.
 ''I invested largely on Dave's drive,'' said Timothy C. Draper, a venture capitalist who put $500,000 of his own money into the league. ''He's that great entrepreneur who sees something so clearly in his head and wants to move the world to his vision.'' 
 Mr. Draper said that he might make a lot of money on his investment -- or that he might lose the entire thing. ''But Dave is so driven to see his vision through that it's just fun to watch,'' Mr. Draper said. 
 Still, it took the two young entrepreneurs a year to raise the first $5 million they needed to start the league. Another year would pass before opening day in May 2005 in Surprise, Ariz., where Mr. Sajak was on hand to throw out the first ball. By then the ambitions of Mr. Kaval and Mr. Patel had grown considerably, stoked by rubbing shoulders with the venture capital set. Where once Mr. Kaval spoke about a 10- or 20-team league in a limited regional market, he now talks about the possibility of growing to 80 teams in a league that stretches across the United States. 
 The first year proved a mixed one for the Golden League. Attendance in Surprise and Mesa, Ariz., proved so anemic that league officials shut down its operations in both towns. That meant that an eight-team league that hoped to eventually expand to 40 teams within seven years would start its second season with just six teams. The original business plan called on the league to play a large portion of its games in new stadiums that could accommodate up to 10,000 fans. Currently, most games are being played in college stadiums that hold 3,000 to 4,000. 
 ''It's a very chicken-and-egg problem,'' Mr. Kaval said. ''Cities want to be sure we'll be around for a while before they commit to building a stadium.'' 
 From the start, the league has sought to field a team representing northern Mexico, to help whip up interest among the sizable Latino population in California, but so far that has proved elusive.
 Over time, Mr. Kaval and Mr. Patel figured, they can capitalize on economies of scale to drive down costs. ''But already we have seen great savings on the cost side,'' Mr. Kaval said -- including those $3 baseballs that Mr. Outcalt, the commissioner, so adores. The league is poised to add at least two more teams next year, Mr. Kaval said, including one in St. George, Utah, a city of roughly 60,000 residents that is about 120 miles from Las Vegas.
 Another positive development, Mr. Outcalt said, is that major league franchises have so far purchased three dozen Golden League players and assigned them to farm teams. ''That keeps the dream alive for these guys, and keeps them playing hard,'' said Mr. Peters, who was a top executive at Ross Stores before becoming the league's chief operating officer. 
 Mr. Kaval and his colleagues say they expect the Golden League to start turning a profit next year, in its third season. The league's attendance averaged 1,350 a game in the first year, he said, and the figure is hovering at just over 1,500 this season. The league needs roughly 1,700 fans per game to reach profitability, Mr. Kaval said. 
 ''Year One was about survival,'' Mr. Outcalt said. ''The second year had been about streamlining costs. Year Three will be when we really pay attention to driving profits.'' 
 So far, teams playing in so-called captive markets -- places like Chico and Yuma, Ariz., both of which are hours from the nearest large city and have populations of roughly 80,000 -- are faring better than those in suburban markets like Long Beach and Fullerton, Calif., near Los Angeles. That is to be expected, Mr. Kaval said, based on the experience of other independent leagues. 
 ''The suburban markets usually take a little longer to develop, but the upside is higher,'' he said. ''You can make $3 million or $4 million in those markets.''
 FOR as much financial firepower and savvy that Mr. Kaval and his partners bring to their endeavor, and as unusually bottom-line-oriented as they are, they are still beholden to the vagaries of a sport that rises and falls on the unpredictable whims of fans and the quality of play.
 ''The league has some very interesting ideas, and they're in some very interesting markets,'' said Professor Rosner at the Wharton School. ''At the same time, they have some challenges if they're going to deliver on the expectations of some of their investors.'' One problem is the league's reliance on college stadiums, which are too small and ''lack that feel that makes minor league baseball special,'' he said. 
 Another potential pitfall is that while some minor league franchises thrive, others falter. And that could crimp the Golden League's plans to expand as aggressively as Mr. Kaval and his investors expect.
 Or even as aggressively as some of his investors anticipate. ''I know some people expect this thing to be a home run,'' said Mr. Sajak, the game-show host. ''But me, I'd settle for a ground-rule double.''

THE GREAT DELUGE
 Hurricane Katrina,
 New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

BREACH OF FAITH
 Hurricane Katrina and
 the Near Death of a Great American City.
 By Jed Horne.
 412 pp. Random House. $25.95.
When Hurricane Katrina reached the coastal town of Buras, La., on Monday, Aug. 29, 2005, there was no mistaking its power. Starting as a tropical depression, it had first made landfall near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., feeding on the moisture-rich Everglades as it headed west into the Gulf of Mexico. By Saturday, Aug. 27, Katrina's fierce winds and plummeting barometric pressure had served notice of its deadly intent. That evening, Max Mayfield of the National Hurricane Center warned the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, that his city was in peril. ''He said, 'Mr. Mayor, I've never seen a storm like this,' '' Nagin recalled, adding, ''Max scared the crap out of me.'' 
 Hurricanes draw strength from warm, open water, making the gulf an ideal host. Camille in 1969 packed winds of nearly 190 miles per hour; the Galveston hurricane of 1900, America's deadliest natural disaster, killed more than 8,000 people. Recently, as gulf waters have become even warmer, the storms have grown larger and more intense. Katrina would pummel an area the size of Britain -- 90,000 square miles. 
 The hurricane hit Buras with a storm surge two stories high before moving north toward New Orleans, 63 miles away. In its path were the vanishing wetlands that serve to buffer inland communities from an onrushing storm. As it reached the city's edge, Katrina veered eastward, sparing New Orleans a direct hit as it closed in on the Mississippi coast. Though windows popped from buildings and power went out, there was a moment when it seemed that New Orleans had dodged a bullet. And then, as the sun reappeared, the water began to rise.
 In his preface to ''The Great Deluge,'' Douglas Brinkley writes, ''My hope is that this history, fast out of the gates, may serve as an opening effort in Katrina scholarship.'' He needn't worry. A prolific author, known for publishing at breakneck speed, Brinkley has put his skills to good use by interviewing hundreds of Katrina survivors, disaster responders and public officials, and then weaving their disparate stories into a seamless narrative of the hurricane's momentous first week. It's a microhistory, logging in at more than 700 pages, but its thick detail provides a ground-level view of human behavior far richer than the breathless news reports that stunned and shamed the nation in the summer of 2005. 
 For Brinkley, who teaches history at Tulane University in New Orleans, Katrina has a deeply personal edge. One can easily read ''The Great Deluge'' as a morality tale, pitting helpless victims, heroic citizens and a few decent politicians against an inept bureaucracy at every link in the chain. This was an avoidable catastrophe, more the fault of man than of nature, Brinkley says, and those responsible must be held to account. 
 City administrators had done no serious hurricane planning, despite repeated warnings from the scientific community. Residents, for their part, had grown comfortable with the notion that hurricanes always seemed to skirt their city at the last moment, just like Georges in 1998 and Ivan in 2004. Furthermore, they sat behind a levee system built to withstand a Category 3 storm (exactly what Katrina turned out to be). Or so they thought.
 Still, the initial news reports of Katrina's destruction led many to flee. By Saturday evening, when Mayfield phoned Nagin, an exodus was under way, part of a pattern known as ''contra-flow'' in which all lanes of traffic were directed out of New Orleans. Though Nagin ''strongly advised'' people to leave, he didn't issue a mandatory evacuation order until the following day. By then, about 20 percent of the 460,000 residents were still in the city. 
 Why did they stay? Brinkley's interviews show that some believed Katrina to be yet another false alarm. Others were determined to protect their property against looters. But most were poor, elderly or infirm -- and couldn't leave on their own. Buses were supposed to evacuate them, but many of the drivers had fled the city and hardly anyone knew where to go to be picked up. Among the most infamous photos of the Katrina disaster are the ones showing rows of buses sitting idly on flooded ground.
 On Monday, Katrina's storm surge overwhelmed the levees, eventually leaving 80 percent of the city underwater. (A recent report by the Army Corps of Engineers accepted responsibility for flaws in design and construction.) Americans were shocked by images of families huddled on rooftops and stranded on highway overpasses. The flooding produced a toxic swill of sewage, chemicals, rats, snakes and bloated corpses. Fires raged because there was no water available in a drowning city. Looters stripped stores of CD's and Nikes as well as bread and diapers. The New Orleans police performed dismally. Some officers fled the city in their cruisers; others stole Cadillacs from a dealership, claiming the cars were needed to transport Katrina victims. If that had been the case, Brinkley says, ''they could have taken the Chevrolets.'' 
 By Tuesday, public order had collapsed. Survivors straggled into the Superdome and the convention center, the refuges of last resort. Brinkley's descriptions of the living conditions, based on richly detailed interviews, are not for the faint of heart. Rarely have so many desperate Americans been so completely abandoned by their government. 
 Planning meant everything, notes Brinkley, who shrewdly lists the preparations of some groups in advance of the storm. The Louisiana S.P.C.A. safely trucked its pets to Houston. By stocking supplies and keeping its staff on site, the New Orleans Zoo saved all but four of its 1,400 animals. Though sustaining terrible losses, the aquarium airlifted penguins and other surviving animals to California; the piranhas were destroyed so they couldn't escape and start breeding in local waters. The United States Coast Guard positioned its boats and aircraft in safe havens just beyond Katrina's reach, allowing it to rescue thousands of victims and earning plaudits as ''the little agency that could.'' 
 These are the exceptions. Brinkley hands down harsh but familiar judgments on others. The White House was remote and unresponsive, viewing natural disaster relief as a distraction from the war on terror. Michael Chertoff, secretary for homeland security, remained willfully ignorant of events in New Orleans, while Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, personified the cronyism that had corrupted FEMA in recent years. Following Brown's behavior during the crisis -- his broken promises about sending buses and supplies, his private concerns about looking stylish and eating well -- is an ordeal. Worse, FEMA routinely prevented others from lending a hand. In one instance, dozens of first responders -- including firefighters and paramedics -- were diverted from New Orleans to Atlanta ''for training on rules against sexual harassment.'' 
 While the government dithered, others filled the breach. Some of Brinkley's best writing describes the heroics of groups like the ''Cajun Navy,'' composed of rural whites who strapped their boats to their pickups and traveled in caravans to New Orleans. Sweeping through black neighborhoods by day, sleeping in their trucks at night, the Cajuns saved close to 4,000 lives. 
 On the local level, Brinkley sees one villain above all. The Ray Nagin we meet in these pages is part coward, part showboat, part Uncle Tom. A pawn of the city's business elite, ''always deferential to whites,'' he sold out his race, Brinkley insinuates, by breaking with ''the civil rights tradition of the city's black leadership.'' When it came to poor people, the book suggests, the mayor couldn't have cared less. 
 It was Nagin who waited too long to order a mandatory evacuation, who left the buses to rot, who turned his back on those who couldn't leave. It was Nagin, ''terrified for his own personal safety,'' who rarely visited the frantic throngs at the Superdome and the convention center, squandering the ''bullhorn moment'' that might have revived flagging spirits in New Orleans. 
 Nothing about him is too small to ignore. Before a meeting with President Bush on Air Force One, an attendant offered Nagin a chance to shower. Having been unable to bathe or change his clothes for several days, he gladly accepted, lingering under the steamy spray. ''What was truly important to Nagin,'' Brinkley writes, ''was that his head was shaved and waxed just right for his photo op. . . . There was something chillingly vain about Nagin's sense of judgment and his coiffing with the underclass suffering all around him.'' Forget the bullhorn moment. In Brinkley's view there is no such thing as an innocent moment for Nagin, who remains, from cover to cover, the fall guy of this book. 
 Those seeking a more condensed take on Katrina may prefer ''Breach of Faith,'' a splendid mix of reporting and commentary by Jed Horne, a metro editor at The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, which won two Pulitzer Prizes in 2006 for its hurricane coverage. The books tread similar ground. Horne, too, sees dysfunctional bureaucracy, not simply racism, as the key to the Katrina disaster, and his judgments of Bush-Brown-Chertoff are equally harsh. But Horne, with a sure grasp of local politics and culture, provides a clearer sense of why things fell apart so completely in New Orleans. 
 Tourists loved the Big Easy. They could stroll the French Quarter without ever seeing the New Orleans of those who served them their meals and cleaned their rooms. The city scraped bottom in every social category. Its politics were so corrupt that major companies loathed doing business there. Nagin promised change, Horne writes, and he made a pretty good start. Elected in 2002, he moved away from ''the politics of backslapping and stuffed envelopes,'' especially alienating black pastors who were used to getting hefty government grants. By 2005, Nagin was legitimately funneling city contracts to a wide range of minority businesses. He had just announced plans to have the Trump organization build a luxury downtown condo tower, a huge ego boost for the city, when Katrina arrived.
 Though Horne can be merciless in describing Nagin's failures during the storm, he never loses perspective. Given the city's crushing problems, hurricane planning was no one's priority. Indeed, when Nagin urged residents to evacuate during Hurricane Ivan, he was ridiculed after the storm missed the city. Determined not to be another Chicken Little, worried about the legal and economic consequences of closing down hotels and hospitals, Nagin held off too long. But late or not, symbolic or not, his mandatory evacuation order was the first one in the history of New Orleans.
 Much has happened in the past 11 months. Nagin has been re-elected. The patched-up levees are supposedly stronger, and federal aid is flowing in. The population is two-thirds smaller now, with whites easily outnumbering blacks. How many people will return home from places like Houston, which offer more opportunity, is anyone's guess. New Orleans today is ''a city on the brink,'' Horne concludes, perched ominously between ''revival'' and ''permanent decline.''

HEADLINE: Matching Digital Maps to America's Ever-Changing Roads

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
SATELLITE navigation systems have largely delivered all they promised when the technology first took to the highway: that drivers would always know where they were. 
 The trouble is, there are times when simply knowing your position on the planet is not enough. A G.P.S. unit is of little help in guiding you to a chosen destination when the route it calculates is outdated, if it instructs you to take an exit that has been closed or if it tells you to turn onto a road that has been converted into a pedestrian mall.
Technically speaking, you are not lost, but it's still a frustrating case of ''can't get there from here.'' 
 To cope with this situation, digital mapping companies are rushing to keep up with road construction projects and new subdivisions popping up in what were cornfields only yesterday. Their goal is to assure that the digital maps used by navigation systems, stored on a DVD, hard disc or memory card, do not lag too far behind the reality. 
 The task is huge. On any given day at Navteq, the nation's largest digital map company, as many as 550 field analysts in 131 offices around the world may be on the road charting street grids. One recent bright and breezy afternoon in the far reaches of Queens, two of the company's analysts were navigating their white Ford Escape around quiet streets in the Rockaway Peninsula.
 ''I think you can delete what's in front of us because that doesn't exist anymore,'' Chris Arcari, a Navteq geographic analyst told his colleague, Shovie Singh, who was serving as the map plotter on this excursion. 
 Mr. Arcari was referring to the scene ahead, where a street that once ran through a new condominium development had been torn up and barricaded with ''road closed'' signs. The last time he and Mr. Singh were mapping the neighborhood -- just a couple of months ago -- the road went all the way through.
 That's how quickly maps can become obsolete. 
 Using a graphics tablet -- a computer input device used to mark up the map by drawing with a pen instead of clicking a mouse -- Mr. Singh made a series of yellow X's over the closed road, which was displayed on a computer monitor on the dashboard.
 The analysts record every little change they find. A stretch of West 66th Street on the Upper West Side of Manahattan, which has been renamed Peter Jennings Way to honor the late television anchorman, is now listed under both names on their maps. A series of crosstown streets in Midtown that were recently designated as ''through'' streets -- no left or right turns off the streets are allowed during peak traffic hours -- are now all marked as such so navigation systems will not instruct drivers to make turns.
 The mapping system aboard the Ford Escape is relatively simple. It consists of a G.P.S. receiver with a roof-mounted antenna; an electronic input tablet; and a laptop computer that transfers raw geographic data accumulated on the drive to a monitor between the driver and the plotter, as Navteq calls the analyst in the passenger-side seat. There is also a video camera used to make a visual record of the trips.
 The electronics record the vehicle's exact path, as determined by the G.P.S. unit. The data that the analysts see is much less refined than the maps that end up in a vehicle's navigation system. To the untrained eye, it is an undecipherable jumble of cartography symbols and color-coded lines. 
 Red lines represent major arteries, light blue lines are closed roads, blobs of blue mark non-navigable areas like marshes or fields, and so on. The equipment can code 150 attributes for any given road, noting details from how many lanes there are to whether the stretch of pavement is part of an underpass.
 When there are holes in the map data -- missing addresses, a road that was not indicated or a landmark with no name -- the geographic analysts have to do a little detective work. 
 For instance, a short road on the Rockaway Peninsula -- it dead-ends into a canal -- has been unnamed on Navteq maps for some time now. Mr. Arcari pulled the Escape to the side of the road, got out and inspected a mailbox to see if the street name was there. No luck. In such a case, he will consult New York City records and use whatever name appears there for the street. 
 Map technicians spend a lot of time trying to match city and county records across the country with the actual roads. They verify and reverify, making trips into the field several times a week so their data will be reliable for car companies, makers of accessory and hand-held G.P.S. units and Internet map providers like Google and Yahoo. 
 Navteq updates its database continuously, releasing new versions several times a year so its customers are not selling maps that are long out of date. But as long as G.P.S. units depend on digital maps stored onboard -- the satellite's signal provides information only to determine a position, not the street grid itself -- they are always going to have some holes because road networks are constantly evolving. 
 And with navigation systems becoming more and more sophisticated, offering features like the locations of A.T.M.'s or Italian restaurants nearby, it is a never-ending undertaking to keep data current. 
 ''You see changes all the time,'' Mr. Arcari said. ''There are new turn restrictions, street directionality, speed limits.''
 Navteq, based in Chicago, and Tele Atlas, a competitor with headquarters in Belgium, gather all this information and create the databases for companies that sell navigation systems and services. While Tele Atlas relies more on existing data sources and less on fieldwork to update its records, the companies' methods of making a digital map have similarities. The raw information -- geographic coordinates of latitude and longitude -- is stored with other essential details as a data file called a vector map.
 Once field analysts are done charting streets and points of interest and the information has been added to the map file, the data can be sold to companies like Garmin, Magellan and auto industry suppliers, which then convert the map data into a form that can be displayed on vehicle navigation system screen. Technicians at the G.P.S. companies encode the maps into a format appropriate for their systems, writing the software that controls functional features like the soothing electronic voices that announce directions.
 For consumers, keeping a navigation system up to date requires purchasing a new digital map. Automakers typically issue annual updates for their systems; most recent models require a new map DVD at $200 and up. (One for a Cadillac Escalade or a Jeep Grand Cherokee is $199, while the latest Lexus update is about $350.) 
 Owners should check with their dealers for special replacement programs. General Motors, for example, is offering owners of 2006 models free update discs after the first and second years.
 Maps for handheld G.P.S. units need to be updated as well, usually by uploading the new data to a memory card. An update for Garmin's popular MapSource unit is $75.

HEADLINE: Are There Enough Buyers To Go Around?

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
CONDOMINIUMS have become a familiar sight in Manhattan in the last couple of years, punctuating the skyline from Battery Park to Harlem and most neighborhoods in between.
 But as these condos are marketed -- each carrying sky-high prices and a competitive list of amenities -- and still more are breaking ground, it is hard not to wonder whether there are enough buyers to go around.
Not only are there thousands of condos currently on the market, but a review of building plans submitted by developers to the state attorney general's office shows that this building binge has not yet slowed down and may produce a supply of new apartments that could be around for a while. 
 So far, applications have been submitted for more than 24,000 condominium apartments since January 2004, 7,000 of them in the first half of this year alone. This increase in filings comes as supply in the current market has been rising steadily, with broker listings nearly doubling since 2004. And since many developers list only a sampling of apartments in new buildings, the numbers of apartments available for sale is probably significantly larger than the inventory listed with brokers. 
 Still, despite caution by some lenders and some customers, many others, including condo developers, brokers and buyers who are still signing contracts and putting down hefty deposits, say they have an abiding faith in the resilience of the market in Manhattan.
 Sales slowed sharply at the beginning of the year, when buyers hesitated because of the uncertainty about the direction of housing prices. But now brokers say that the pace is picking up, and they are seeing a slow but steady stream of visitors to sales offices and of contracts signed for new apartments. 
 Asking prices on new developments are no longer rising sharply, but confounding skeptics, they have remained fairly steady, at prices that are higher than buyers ever imagined five or 10 years ago. Developers say they are, for the most part, holding the line on prices, convinced that they have produced the right product for the right market. 
 ''How strong is the market for $2 million apartments? Extraordinarily strong,'' said Gary Barnett, the president of Extell Development, which is currently marketing six condominium projects across Manhattan. ''The market for $3 million and $4 million apartments is strong, too.''
 He said that the rising prices for land, soaring construction costs and careful reviews by lenders would eliminate weaker projects now under development, especially those by inexperienced developers, limiting the growth in supply over the next few years. 
 Jeffrey Jackson, the president of Mitchell, Maxwell & Jackson, an appraisal company, said he had been consulted on half a dozen projects that may be postponed or converted to rentals.
 The Manhattan market is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as the rest of the country. But the bullish view of the Manhattan real estate market is based on the belief that it is unique. The first tenet is that it is a magnet for wealth from across the country and around the world. The second tenet is that there is a strong demand for larger apartments with higher ceilings, open views and well-designed kitchens and bathrooms -- the type of apartments that have not been built in large numbers in a generation. 
 While rising interest rates may reduce the purchasing power of middle-income buyers, the market for the affluent will remain strong, brokers say, as the local economy remains solid; incomes for hedge fund managers, investment bankers and law partners remain high; and buyers from across the globe continue to view New York as a good place to invest. 
 ''There is a tremendous amount of demand, and there is little housing in New York,'' said Stephen G. Kliegerman, the director of marketing development for Halstead Property. ''There is a desire to live in New York City, and as fuel costs go up, even more people will want to live here.''
 Or as Mr. Barnett of Extell put it, ''New York is the epicenter of the world, and everybody wants to own something here.''
 Of course, even the Manhattan market has had its low points. Park Avenue palaces faced foreclosure in the Depression, and town houses on the West Side sold for a pittance in the 1950's. In the 1980's, after a wave of apartment construction and conversions, many developers faced foreclosure. And the terrorist attack in 2001 sent rumbles through the market. 
 Frederick W. Peters, the president of Warburg Realty, said that he had experienced several downturns over the decades and likened the experience to driving off a cliff. And he does not see that occurring now. ''The fact that we have experienced minimal price growth for a year suggests that the market has slowed down,'' he said. ''The 'driving off a cliff' experience doesn't seem to be happening.'' 
 Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser and the president of Miller Samuel, said he believed that many prospective buyers were ready to act but were holding back because of market uncertainty. At the same time, he said, Manhattan developers were holding the line on prices, confident that the new condos were worth their high prices.
 ''There are a lot of buyers, with money to spend, on the sidelines,'' Mr. Miller said. 
 Susan Petri, who works in communications for American Express, said that she and her husband have been shopping for a condo and that they found the same high prices at every place they looked. ''This is New York -- the demand will always exceed the supply,'' she said. ''Everyone wants to live here.''
 But her husband, Roland, was more skeptical. They are trying to decide whether to settle in New York, where she now works, or in Scottsdale, Ariz., where he practices emergency medicine. He observed that the amenities touted in buildings in Manhattan were not that different from those found in new homes in Scottsdale and wondered whether they should wait to see if prices came down. 
 Julia Bohan said she carefully researched the housing market, systematically comparing prices per square foot, before signing a contract a few weeks ago to buy an apartment at the Ariel East, one of the two glass towers facing each other across Broadway at 99th Street. But in the end, she said she relied as much on intuition as cold, hard facts.
 Two years had passed since her husband died, and she was in contract to sell their Upper East Side apartment, with a wraparound terrace and park views. The sale price was high enough to enable her to spend about $2 million at the Ariel for about 2,000 square feet of space, and put away some money for tuition, too. The apartment had lots of space at a better price than she found elsewhere in Manhattan. 
 ''It is scary to do it alone after being married for 15 years,'' she said, ''But I really feel confident that it is a solid investment. And it feels right, too.
 During the years when prices were rising sharply and apartments were scarce, buyers were conditioned not to ask for concessions. If the price was too high, they would walk away. Today, Mr. Miller has this advice to buyers: ''Always try to negotiate. Developers may be more open than in past years to negotiating. You have to ask.''
 Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group, agreed but added that the developer's response would depend on ''the mind-set of the building, how the building is doing.'' 
 ''We have buildings where we have not done one penny of negotiation,'' she said. 
 During the ultrahot seller's market a few years ago, some developers would submit weekly or even daily amendments to offering plans, raising prices on new condominiums. Price increases come less frequently now, and a few developers have filed amendments lowering prices, though they attribute that to pricing errors, rather than to a faltering market. 
 At the Avery, which Extell is building on Riverside Boulevard at West 65th Street, buyers learned that many of the closing costs would be picked up by the developer, up to a total of 3.7 percent of the purchase price. But that's down from the 5 percent offered a few months ago. 
 Mr. Barnett, the Avery's developer, said that close to half of the apartments were now sold and as sales continued, help with closing costs would end entirely. 
 At 170 East End Avenue, Skyline Developers' 19-story glass tower near 87th Street, brokers were saying earlier this year that sales were slow. Orin Wilf, Skyline's president, disputed this but added, ''We have been negotiable on our prices.''
 ''We feel that our sales have been very steady because we are willing to work with customers,'' he said. ''If a customer walks into our sales office and wants to spend $5 million on an apartment, and the apartment they want is $5.4 million, over 99 percent of the time the deal gets done.''
 He said that he had not offered to pay closing costs and expects prices to tighten in the future. ''At almost 50 percent sold, we plan on doing less negotiations and more selling at higher prices.''
 When sales were slow at the Ariel East, Extell filed an amendment with the attorney general lowering prices on 42 apartments, with cuts ranging from $5,000 to $260,000 for one sixth-floor apartment. But prices on some upper-floor apartments were raised. 
 Mr. Barnett said that the price cuts were made because apartments in the Ariel West building had been selling faster, and that he wanted to encourage buyers to consider Ariel East. He said that when the price changes at the two condominiums were combined, prices actually went up.
 At another smaller project, the Abbey, a former parish building on East 16th Street being converted to condominiums, most of the apartments sold for the asking price, or close to it. But according to property records, one apartment, a duplex on the top two floors, sold at a discount of $500,000, or about 27 percent below the asking price. Eight of 31 apartments are still listed as available.
 The developer, Herbert Hirsch, said that he became convinced that a sloping triangular roof limited the use of some of the top floor of the duplex, so he reduced the price to account for this. He said buyers were out there looking but were worried by press accounts about the market and were postponing purchases. 
 ''From the developers' standpoint the market talks to you,'' he said. ''The market tells you what your property is worth, to the extent that people come through and love your product and pay the prices.''
 The New York Times reviewed condominium plans for larger projects -- those with at least 30 units or those valued at more than $20 million -- filed with the attorney general's office, which oversees all co-op and condominium offering plans for their compliance with state laws. But in addition to apartments, the listings of condominium units provided by the state often included retail stores, storage lockers and parking spaces, sometimes even wine cellars. So to get an accurate estimate of the number of apartments in the pipeline, those filings were compared with records from the New York City Buildings Department. 
 The review found that applications for 24,400 apartments in 240 larger projects in Manhattan and 5,000 apartments in 75 projects in Brooklyn had been submitted since January 2004. Of these, by the middle of June more than 13,000 had been approved for sale in Manhattan and 2,900 in Brooklyn. It is not known how many of these apartments were actually built and, if built, how many have been sold.
 What is known is that the 24,400 applications far exceed the number of apartments actually on the market. 
 Last week, a report by Prudential Douglas Elliman put the current inventory at 7,640 apartments, both co-ops and condominiums, up from 3,922 in 2004. In recent years, the total number of annual apartment sales in Manhattan has been estimated at 10,000 to 12,000. 
 The filings with the attorney general's office also show that many newer projects, including conversions of rental buildings, are also in the works. There were 10,800 apartments in large Manhattan projects still awaiting approval for sale, including the 7,250 apartments in 59 projects submitted this year. About 2,300 apartments in Brooklyn are also awaiting approval for sale. If all these apartments are actually built, they could weigh on the market for several years to come. 
 But many developers said they believed that the condominium market was beginning to correct itself, and that the weakest projects may never get built. Banks, worried about overbuilding, have tightened up on financing. The boom in construction has pushed up land prices and construction costs, making fewer projects profitable. 
 In the meantime, some developers are not cutting prices no matter what. At 165 Charles Street, Izak Senbahar thought he had his finger on the pulse of the market when he put up a 16-story glass building designed by Richard Meier along the Hudson River, next door to two other Meier projects, and set prices as high as $20 million for the 31 apartments.
 But last October, after about half the building was in contract, sales stalled. Not a single contract was signed for about six months, until April 2006. 
 Mr. Senbahar received a series of offers below the asking prices and could have sold out long ago, said James Lansill, a senior managing director of the Sunshine Group, which is marketing the building. Even brokers urged him to cut his prices, but he would not.
 ''He placed his bet and stuck with his bet,'' Mr. Lansill said. ''He had a belief in his goal that is unwavering. He just said when the building is completed, people are going to come and buy this.''
 After vacant apartments were used for an exhibition of modern furniture earlier this year, sales took off once more, Mr. Lansill said. Since April, he said, five apartments have been sold, leaving five apartments available. 
 Two of those five apartments are being combined into a larger unit, he said, and a price increase was just filed with the attorney general's office.

HEADLINE: What You Gonna Do If It Comes For You?

BYLINE: By NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
THE Dodge Charger, a favored getaway car for bad guys in memorable roles from ''Bullitt'' to ''The Dukes of Hazzard,'' has turned state's evidence. 
 The shapely muscle cars that won stoplight showdowns and Nascar championships four decades ago have gone straight and joined the police force.
One could argue that the 21st-century Charger was born to be a cop car. Even in civilian trim, the brutish design exudes an ''outta my way'' attitude, its cross-hair grille set in a scowling maw -- not the smiley face seen on so many of today's models. The brow above the headlights slants upward at its outer edges, giving the skeptical expression of a raised eyebrow: ''Sir, you didn't see that 30 m.p.h. speed limit sign back there?'' it seems to ask. 
 Decked out in black and white livery, the message to lawbreakers from the Charger police model I drove last month was an unambiguous ''To Threaten and Intimidate.'' While I am not a police officer (nor do I play one on TV), I talked Chrysler into handing over the keys to what is probably the most important police car in a decade, well before most departments had taken delivery. 
 With the sense of power that comes only from having Dodge City Police insignias on your doors, plus flashing lights and a siren, I ventured out to gauge the effect. The fact that the side shields carried Dodge ram's-head logo did little to soften the visual impact.
 A linebacker's stance, reinforced by 18-inch tires on black-painted steel wheels that filled the wells, added to the no-nonsense aura. The low-profile light bar on the roof and chrome spotlights on the windshield pillars completed the image, but the Charger's purpose would have been clear enough without them. Even as an unmarked cruiser, I suspect this car would never be mistaken for a livery cab, as an undercover officer's Ford Crown Victoria might be. 
 Other drivers acknowledged this image of authority, immediately deferring to the Charger's imposing presence. A drive on Route 3 in New Jersey became a series of Moses moments, the Charger parting traffic as if it were the Red Sea, civilian drivers scattering left and right to make way for the authority figure in the rear-view mirror. In the passenger seat, my neighbor howled each time we came up behind a car, watched as the driver noticed us in the mirror and pawed for the turn-signal stalk.
 There is, as you might expect, another side to this air of officialdom. Pedestrians walk up at stoplights and ask for directions -- and they expect a courteous response. I was called ''officer'' for the first time ever.
 There is far more to the fitness of the police-edition Charger for peacekeeping duty than looking smart in a well-tailored uniform. Modifications range from practical necessities like relocating the gearshift to the steering column (which permits console-mounting of a computer and a control panel for the siren and lights) to major upgrades in the chassis -- some of which are available only in the police car. 
 My test car, a prototype circulated among law enforcement agencies for evaluation, had the 340-horsepower 5.7-liter Hemi V-8; a 3.5-liter, 250-horse V-6 is also offered. 
 The Hemi Charger police car carries a nominal price of $29,055 without lights or siren, about the same as the civilian car despite all the extra equipment. Sales to law enforcement fleets are intensely competitive, with volume discounts a requirement, and the alternative sedans -- the Chevrolet Impala and Crown Victoria Police Interceptor -- are likewise priced to appeal to civic watchdogs. Adding a complement of service equipment including lights, siren, radios, computer system, video recorder and radar guns -- specialized outfitters usually supply this gear -- can add $15,000 in an eye blink.
 Among the features standard on the police-specification Charger were a speedometer certified to 160 m.p.h., a heavy-duty cooling system and a stealth mode that dims almost all the interior lighting -- very useful on stakeouts. Options appreciated in the line of duty included vinyl floor covering (ideal for parents of young children, I thought) and a dome light with red L.E.D. illumination. 
 Then there are items specific to the police package and not available to the citizenry. For instance, the stability control system offers three-stage operation: a normal level, like that in the conventional Charger; a minimal level that sends in the electronic nanny only at the extremes; and a full-off setting that disables the stability system entirely but leaves on the antilock brakes.
 The suspension uses the same stabilizer bars as the Charger R/T, but spring rates are increased in anticipation of carrying 500 pounds of equipment at all times. The brakes are upgraded with special pads, a larger master cylinder and bigger rear rotors, and a special calibration for the antilock system. 
 The car's high-output alternator is available on other models, but for police use the engine-management system will increase idle speed to raise the power output when the electrical loads are high. Likewise, the cooling system includes transmission and power steering radiators that are available on other models, but adds an engine oil cooler that cannot be ordered on other Chargers.
 The police-edition Charger drives like no other large American car, solid and well mannered, crisp and positive in all its responses. The hefty 18-inch tires contribute to this, and despite the extreme-duty suspension, the ride is reasonably compliant, even on rough stretches in the outer boroughs. The Hemi engine is quieter than expected -- perhaps a stealth measure -- and though it will bark the tires from a standstill, the 4,100-pound car doesn't exactly leap off the line.
 The cloth-upholstered front seats have little obvious contouring, but turn out to be supportive and comfortable just the same -- a vital factor in this duty. Accommodations were less gracious in the test car's rear seat -- what development engineers call the ''guest accommodations'' -- thanks to the thoughtful installation of a prisoner barrier. The test car had vinyl rear seat cushions, which easily lift out so officers can make sure that a perp didn't leave any contraband behind; many departments replace the cushions with a one-piece hard plastic shell that is easier to clean. 
 But what do I know about police cars? Have I spent enough time in one to make a useful evaluation? 
 Field research dictated some time with customers, which is how the Charger found itself the center of attention at the former 44th Precinct headquarters in the Bronx, now home to a special police task force. Parked out front for photos, the car was quickly surrounded by officers (including one who owns a Hemi Charger) who did quick-draws with cellphone cameras. It was the most fun I've had under police scrutiny.
 There were new-puppy oohs and aahs, to be sure, but also some knowing insights from the experts: the test car's spotlights would not be ordered, because in the past they were prone to break; the trunk is too small for all the equipment that must be carried, like ropes, road cones, helmets, riot shields and, gulp, body covers. Just one more fact, ma'am: a single cup holder is not enough.
 In pre-Daimler days, the Chrysler Corporation had a solid foothold in the police car business, accounting in some years for as much as half of the sales to United States agencies. Today DaimlerChrysler offers a full line of enforcement vehicles, from the GEM electric runabout for security patrols to a right-hand-drive Jeep Wrangler for parking enforcement and even a specially outfitted Sprinter van that, in Dodge's words, ''seats up to nine detainees.'' 
 Choosing vehicles for the police fleet is a matter of careful consideration. Many agencies around the country defer to the testing done by large departments with established programs, notably those of the Michigan State Police and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Both are excrutiatingly scientific evaluations of the available vehicles, and the ratings are done not only for handling, braking, acceleration and top speed, but also for issues important in day-to-day use like ergonomics and fuel economy.
 The Charger was added to the mix last fall when '06 models were tested. The results will not make fleet sales executives at Ford and G.M. happy.
 The Dodge trounced their cars in performance measures: Michigan's test pegged the Hemi Charger at 6.5 seconds in the 0-60 run, more than 2 seconds quicker than the Crown Victoria or Impala (and about 7 seconds quicker to 100 m.p.h.). The Dodge's top speed (150 m.p.h.) exceeded its competitors' by a wide margin. The car was quicker on the handling course and it stopped nearly 10 feet shorter from 60 m.p.h. The final embarrassment: the Charger's E.P.A. mileage rating is better than the Ford V-8's and at 25 m.p.g. on the highway ties the Impala V-6. 
 With this car, Dodge has the firepower. The 3.5-liter V-6, with 250 horsepower, matches the output of Ford's V-8, and when the Hemi is unholstered its rivals can only hope for a merciful surrender. The novelty we enjoyed on city streets in New York -- thumbs-up signals were constant -- is bound to wear off fast as agencies replace their tired fleets with this fresh entry. 
 Even without that magnum-force engine, the Charger is a formidable new presence in law enforcement. Don't take my word: consider the wisdom of a scruffy character on a ratty chopper who rattled noisily past the Bronx cop shop. Reading the Charger Hemi lettering on the flank, he paused a moment before shouting over the mechanical din: ''The bad guys are in trouble now.''

HEADLINE: The Latest Dish, for Four-Legged Friends

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MICHELLE LEWIS had cooked some chickens and had broken the meat into small pieces. Now she was cutting fresh squash, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and celery into even smaller pieces, which she would briefly boil. She would later mix everything together, along with safflower oil, flaxseed oil, coconut oil, brown rice and hard-boiled eggs and their ground-up shells.
 ''Healthy food,'' she said, though she allowed that some people might be put off by the idea of the eggshells, even if that addition, for calcium, could not be detected in its powdery state. 
But that was beside the point. Ms. Lewis was not cooking for people. She was in a commercial kitchen in Brooklyn on a recent day, preparing a batch of her start-up company's product: handmade dog food with human-grade ingredients, natural nutrients and no chemical preservatives.
 Ms. Lewis, 43, has invested $30,000 of her own money and much effort over the last two years in the proposition that there is a profitable place for her in America's huge pet food industry, even if only as a minnow in an industry dominated by whales. 
 Now she has reached the point where she may soon receive the first indications of whether her very high-end food will find a profitable niche among the more than 600 companies producing dog and cat food in the country.
 The batch she was recently cooking was for her first shipment to her first, and so far only, outlet, a Brooklyn veterinary clinic that sells pet food. Last weekend, she sent the clinic 40 pounds worth of two of her meals, chicken with vegetables and salmon with vegetables, to be sold for about $7 for a one-pound container and $11 for two pounds. 
 By contrast, a 13.2-ounce can of Alpo Prime Cuts in gravy was priced at $1.05 at a Brooklyn supermarket last week. Alpo is produced by Nestle Purina PetCare, whose brands accounted for 30 percent of pet food sales in the United States in 2004, according to a study of the industry. 
 The study, by Nora Ganim Barnes, director of the Center for Marketing Research at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, found that with Nestle Purina in the lead, seven large companies had an 86 percent share of the market.
 Acknowledging the high price for her offerings, Ms. Lewis said she would promote them not only as full meals, but also as toppings on standard dog fare, which would at least cut the consumption of such fare. 
 ''I hate the word 'gourmet,' '' she said of her meals. ''I prefer 'healthy food.' ''
 Ms. Lewis, a Brooklyn resident who also works as a relocation consultant, said she decided two years ago to turn her practice of feeding homemade meals to her mixed terrier and English sheepdog, Scooter Mae, into a commercial venture called ScooterFood. 
 ''I thought I'd have it out on the market in two months,'' she said of what seemed like a fairly simple project: cooking food and getting it placed in store refrigerators and freezers for dog owners who believe that the preservatives and offal in mass-market dog food are harmful to their pets -- and that even the higher-end commercial brands are inferior to human-grade food. Commercial producers say their products meet the animals' complex nutritional needs.
 Her own research into those needs was easy, said Ms. Lewis, who, among other things, already knew that not everything people ate was good for dogs, which is why she prepares separate meals for Scooter Mae. But moving ahead on other fronts was more intricate. She learned, she said, that to sell her meals commercially, she would have to have them analyzed for percentages of protein, fat, moisture and the like, and put the information on the packaging. 
 She also learned that she could not call her meals anything she wanted. ''Salmon with vegetables,'' for instance, has to have more salmon than vegetables, ''otherwise it's salmon dinner or salmon-flavored,'' she said.
 Nor had she known, she recalled, that she would have to register her meals with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, and use a commercial kitchen, which is subject to city health inspections.
 ''I had to hire a consultant because I couldn't keep it straight,'' she said. 
 Now seeking outlets beyond her first, the Hope Veterinary Clinic in Boerum Hill, Ms. Lewis said she was optimistic because people increasingly ''want better food for their dogs and cats.''

HEADLINE: Poor, Misunderstood Sprawl

BYLINE: By Robert Bruegmann. 
Robert Bruegmann, a professor of art history, architecture and urban planning at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is the author of ''Sprawl: A Compact History.''

DATELINE: Chicago 

 BODY:
FOR years, opponents of sprawl have argued that the growth of suburbs and exurbs saps the vitality of central cities. They claim that the result has been homogenous, affluent, white bedroom communities at the urban periphery, and at the core an increasing number of poor and minority neighborhoods. They also blame sprawl for longer commuting times, more traffic congestion and increased pollution. 
 Many of these observers hailed recent news from the Census Bureau that New York City is expected to grow by more than a million people by 2025. Some have even suggested that this might mark the end of suburban growth in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York as people move back toward the center to take advantage of shorter commuting times, more demographic diversity and all the other benefits that higher-density living can bring. 
These suggestions, however, are based more on dislike for suburbs and wishful thinking than on any rational analysis of what has actually happened or is likely to happen to the metropolitan region over the next decades. 
 It makes little sense to think of suburbs as different from the city. The story of urban development is of a continuous outward push with little regard for municipal boundaries. The suburban growth of one generation is ringed by newer growth, and the older suburbs become more like the urban core itself. So, for example, the area north of Wall Street in Manhattan or the small settlement of Brooklyn Heights, both of them suburbs in the 18th century, soon became denser and, eventually, part of the city itself. 
 As the suburban fringe expands, the rest of the urban area changes too, often in complex and unexpected ways. So, for example, strong continuing growth at the edge of suburban development in Connecticut's Litchfield County, Morris County, N.J., and New York's Putnam and Suffolk Counties has been accompanied by increasing densities and more diversity of land use and population in closer-in counties like Essex, Fairfield, Nassau and Westchester. For evidence of this increased density and diversity, just look at the growing number of Mexican markets and Buddhist temples popping up amid tract houses and strip malls in Nassau County. 
 Contrary to accepted wisdom, the expanding outer edge of suburbia is not being fueled by wealthy residents fleeing the city and seeking increasingly large lots. More often than not, the people driving growth in the furthest subdivisions of Connecticut, Long Island and central New Jersey are families of modest means looking for more house for their dollar than they can afford closer to the old urban centers. 
 This outward expansion should not be blamed for increased traffic congestion and pollution. What has caused congestion is the increase in affluence that has allowed more families, both in the central city and the suburbs, to own and use cars, together with a failure by governments to increase road capacity or provide a transit system that can compete with the private automobile. 
 And there is little evidence that sprawl is necessarily detrimental to the health of central cities. Even as the New York, San Francisco or Chicago regions have sprawled in recent years, neighborhoods in the central city and inner suburbs have come roaring back. At first glance it might appear that this much-heralded rebirth is the opposite of the outward drift to suburbia. But it seems more logical to see them as flip sides of the same coin. The rebuilding of the South Bronx and the gentrification of Williamsburg and Hoboken started with a precipitous decline in population and density as the existing residents became affluent enough to move to newer and less dense housing further out in the urban area. The newly available space freed by this exodus is a magnet for new urban energy.
 The ''urban renaissance'' that is under way, while real and very welcome after decades in which central cities were buffeted by the loss of jobs and residents, is hardly likely to end suburban sprawl. Most Americans, when asked about their housing preferences, would prefer a single-family detached house, and the majority of the jobs are now in the suburbs. Manhattan is home to less than 20 percent of the jobs in the New York region, a proportion that has been steadily declining, while the outer suburbs have more than 30 percent.
 The population of the United States is expected to boom over the next century, adding as many as 100 million new residents by 2040, according to the Census Bureau. If New York City and the metropolitan region hope to maintain their global competitiveness it will be important to attract some of that growth, and clearly it can't all be accommodated in the central city and inner suburbs. 
 Perhaps the most important thing that policy makers can do at this point is to reject shopworn notions about sprawl and decentralization, dismantle divisive notions that pit city against suburbs, abandon the fierce debate between public versus private transportation and concentrate on making the entire region, from the central city to the far exurbs, a more efficient and attractive place to live.

HEADLINE: In the Southeast Bronx, a Bank for the Bankless

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
ABOUT twice a month, Mary McKinney, a retired hospital worker, leaves her apartment to go to the bank. The journey, which covers three miles and requires two buses, takes her from Soundview in the southeast Bronx to Parkchester, a commercial hub to the north. Often she spots a friend on the same errand. ''I'll call, 'Hey, you going to the bank?' '' said Ms. McKinney, a bustling 64-year-old with rimless glasses who wears her hair in a tight bun. 
 Treks like that one are a part of life in Soundview, one of the New York neighborhoods where banks are most scarce. In the hundred blocks of Soundview that lie west of White Plains Road, an isolated area dotted with huge public housing projects and middle-income towers, there are no bank branches at all.
The community board district that includes the neighborhood has an average of about one bank per 24,000 people, much lower than the borough's overall average of about one bank per 11,000. And the Bronx ratio is the lowest of any borough. Queens, for example, has one bank branch per 6,025 people.
 People in Soundview who can't or won't travel to a bank have generally had to use check-cashing stores or ATM's in bodegas, which typically charge fees. 
 As a result, many residents were happy to hear that City and Suburban Federal Savings Bank was planning to open a branch in September in Bruckner Plaza, a forlorn shopping center just off the Bruckner Expressway near Morrison Avenue.
 ''That would be really cool,'' said Sade Arogundade, 24, who was having her nails buffed at Sammy's Nail Salon, in the shopping center. Right now, she added, ''You have to drive to get to a bank, or you have to use your debit card.''
 The arrival of City and Suburban is one sign of change in Soundview, long one of the city's poorest communities, where a boom in new housing is transforming once-empty streets. But the neighborhood is still too poor to support a bank on its own, so City and Suburban has applied to have up to $20 million from New York City and the state's Banking Department deposited at the bank at below-market interest rates.
 ''There was a huge consensus that something like this was needed in our district,'' said Annabel Palma, who represents the area on the City Council and is supporting the bank's application.
 Not everyone agrees. ''A lot of people in our community don't like banks,'' said Roberto Callaghan, the manager at Club Check Cashing, located three blocks from the proposed branch. ''They don't open bank accounts. They just want the cash on hand.'' 
 But Richard Karpowich, a senior vice president with City and Suburban, says that his company can succeed. ''We're going to be cutting into the check-cashers' turf,'' he said. ALEX MINDLIN

HEADLINE: An 'A' That's Not a Scarlet Letter

BYLINE: By LAURA SCHENONE. 
Laura Schenone is the author of ''A Thousand Years Over a Hot Stove: A History of American Women Told Through Food, Recipes, and Remembrances.''

 BODY:
MY older son, Gabriel, is in his room, propped up on elbows over a copy of ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' 
 ''Hey Mom, want to see a picture of the man with fireproof skin?''
I sit beside him and peer at the photo of a man who holds a torch to his body with no apparent repercussions. Awesome. Next, he shows me the smiling woman, arms knotted behind her back. Then another who writes her name with both hands simultaneously upside down and backwards. Wow. 
 Like many 10-year-olds, mine is fascinated by the ''amazing, strange, inexplicable, weird and all true'' found within these 500 pages. Who can blame him? Different is interesting. Different is cool. 
 But different can also be deeply troubling when it's happening to you. 
 Last year, I had to label my son M.D. (multiply disabled), a broad classification for children with a combination of learning problems. Most recently, we changed the label to something beginning with the letter A -- the hardest thing I'd ever done. What is A, you wonder? Attention deficit disorder? Anxiety? Autism? Can we hold off a moment, please? There's so much more to tell. 
 Last March, the big yellow school bus stopped coming by our house; instead, a small van now takes my boy off to a special school. Everything is different now. So much is better. 
 The labeling game is a tricky one. Like any good parent, I wanted no part of it. I intended to emphasize my child's strengths, not spend years studying his problems and repeating them over and over again to teachers, therapists and lawyers in order to get help.
 Years ago, I developed my own labels to explain my son's uniqueness: Gifted, Scientist, Voracious Reader, Dry Wit, Out-of-the-Box-Thinker, Shy, Creative-Probably-an-Artist and Kind Older Brother.
 But none of these labels could explain why such a bright child could not survive in a public school. Why, in kindergarten, he was alone at lunch. Why, in first grade, it seemed he was writing with paws rather than hands. Why, in second grade, he could not pay attention. Why, by third grade, he developed insomnia, became nauseous each morning, and said he would rather die than go to school. And why, by fourth grade, he looked me in the eye one morning and said, teeth gritted, ''I am not going.'' The only way to get him up would have been with a crane. 
 Now that the van comes each day, we've had an astonishing turnaround. He calmly goes out the door, like, well, a norma -- I mean, a typical child. He attends a class with 12 students, receives motivating points for good behavior, has successes and is accepted and respected for who he is. Suddenly, we are all feeling hopeful and whole again. The label -- which I once feared and despised -- may have saved our lives.
 Of course, lots of people are skeptical about all these learning disabilities that have suddenly beset our society. Where did all this dyslexia, and A.D.D., and autism come from? We didn't have all this stuff back then. We turned out all right. 
 I'm not so sure. What about the alcoholics, the chronically unemployed, the angry antisocial loners of the past? What was at the root of their problems? 
 New developments in neuroscience and brain imaging now reveal that learning disabilities are not a fad, not an excuse, not a reflection of baby boomers' obsession with their children -- but the result of brain wiring that is different from typical brains. 
 Sure, it's good to be skeptical about labels. Plenty of children with academic troubles don't require classification, and most don't need special schools. Diagnoses can be baffling and imprecise. Doctors don't always agree (ours sure didn't at first), and symptoms may be nebulous -- some fit, others do not. Like many children with learning difficulties, our son has a plateful of overlapping challenges; it's hard to know which one is in charge. Some days, my guy doesn't look like he has any of the A's . 
 But once we got a decent diagnosis (one that fit at least most of the time), we began to cope. We found the right people to help, and other parents who understood. Perhaps, most important, we began to forgive. Our son will have to work harder. We'll all have to work harder. But we understand now that he is not lazy or naturally defiant, and his path will be unique. 
 In his book ''The Misunderstood Child,'' Dr. Larry B. Silver, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown, poignantly describes his own tortured experience having learning disabilities and writes that at least 10 percent of school-age children have them. 
 Our own psychiatrist makes a larger estimate. He says, ''Listen, there's a 50 percent chance you'll get at least a little bit of something.'' Here he's talking about the whole gamut of psychiatric quirks, conditions and syndromes, not all of which even merit treatment. But the idea is a comfort -- sort of like Ripley's -- busting open our ideas of ''normal'' to a bigger and more accepting place. 
 Complain if you wish about video games and the stresses of our modern world. This is one area where we as a society are improving as we accept the big variety of human life. 
 ''Gabriel, what do you think of the term 'learning difference'?'' 
 ''I think it's fair,'' he replies. ''It's better than learning disabilities. I hate that term. It makes you sound like you're mentally ill or something.''
 ''What do you think of the term Asperger's syndrome?'' I ask cautiously--for yes, this is his label, a neurobiological condition at the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Symptoms range in intensity but include social difficulties, developmental delays, some quirky behaviors and, sometimes, great talents. (Parents love to tell you that Einstein and Mozart probably had it, too.)
 ''You say I have this,'' he replies. ''But I really have no idea what it means.'' Then he adds: ''You know, it would have been much easier not to have all this. I know I'm different. But I don't feel different at all, really. It's just like I'm me. Most of the time I just try to act like normal.'' 
 ''Do you mean typical?'' 
 ''O.K., typical. I try to act typical. I only want to pay attention to my learning difference when I have to.'' 
 I ask for the twentieth time how he likes his new school.
 ''I like it,'' he replies calmly and maturely. ''I feel better. I see that mine isn't the only problem. Some kids have it worse. Some have it better. And, Mom, you've asked me enough now. Really, you don't need to ask me again. I do like it.''
 To tell you the truth, we're feeling more typical each day. Yes, we've got a lot ahead. But it's time to give labels and worries a rest right now. Things are going well. It's time to focus on the positives and his individuality, and the divine spark of how we never know where the future will lead.
 No label can predict.

HEADLINE: Poor, Misunderstood Sprawl

BYLINE: By Robert Bruegmann. 
Robert Bruegmann, a professor of art history, architecture and urban planning at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is the author of ''Sprawl: A Compact History.''

DATELINE: Chicago 

 BODY:
FOR years, opponents of sprawl have argued that the growth of suburbs and exurbs saps the vitality of central cities. They claim that the result has been homogenous, affluent, white bedroom communities at the urban periphery, and at the core an increasing number of poor and minority neighborhoods. They also blame sprawl for longer commuting times, more traffic congestion and increased pollution. 
 Many of these observers hailed recent news from the Census Bureau that New York City is expected to grow by more than a million people by 2025. Some have even suggested that this might mark the end of suburban growth in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York as people move back toward the center to take advantage of shorter commuting times, more demographic diversity and all the other benefits that higher-density living can bring. 
These suggestions, however, are based more on dislike for suburbs and wishful thinking than on any rational analysis of what has actually happened or is likely to happen to the metropolitan region over the next decades. 
 It makes little sense to think of suburbs as different from the city. The story of urban development is of a continuous outward push with little regard for municipal boundaries. The suburban growth of one generation is ringed by newer growth, and the older suburbs become more like the urban core itself. So, for example, the area north of Wall Street in Manhattan or the small settlement of Brooklyn Heights, both of them suburbs in the 18th century, soon became denser and, eventually, part of the city itself. 
 As the suburban fringe expands, the rest of the urban area changes too, often in complex and unexpected ways. So, for example, strong continuing growth at the edge of suburban development in Connecticut's Litchfield County, Morris County, N.J., and New York's Putnam and Suffolk Counties has been accompanied by increasing densities and more diversity of land use and population in closer-in counties like Essex, Fairfield, Nassau and Westchester. For evidence of this increased density and diversity, just look at the growing number of Mexican markets and Buddhist temples popping up amid tract houses and strip malls in Nassau County. 
 Contrary to accepted wisdom, the expanding outer edge of suburbia is not being fueled by wealthy residents fleeing the city and seeking increasingly large lots. More often than not, the people driving growth in the furthest subdivisions of Connecticut, Long Island and central New Jersey are families of modest means looking for more house for their dollar than they can afford closer to the old urban centers. 
 This outward expansion should not be blamed for increased traffic congestion and pollution. What has caused congestion is the increase in affluence that has allowed more families, both in the central city and the suburbs, to own and use cars, together with a failure by governments to increase road capacity or provide a transit system that can compete with the private automobile. 
 And there is little evidence that sprawl is necessarily detrimental to the health of central cities. Even as the New York, San Francisco or Chicago regions have sprawled in recent years, neighborhoods in the central city and inner suburbs have come roaring back. At first glance it might appear that this much-heralded rebirth is the opposite of the outward drift to suburbia. But it seems more logical to see them as flip sides of the same coin. The rebuilding of the South Bronx and the gentrification of Williamsburg and Hoboken started with a precipitous decline in population and density as the existing residents became affluent enough to move to newer and less dense housing further out in the urban area. The newly available space freed by this exodus is a magnet for new urban energy.
 The ''urban renaissance'' that is under way, while real and very welcome after decades in which central cities were buffeted by the loss of jobs and residents, is hardly likely to end suburban sprawl. Most Americans, when asked about their housing preferences, would prefer a single-family detached house, and the majority of the jobs are now in the suburbs. Manhattan is home to less than 20 percent of the jobs in the New York region, a proportion that has been steadily declining, while the outer suburbs have more than 30 percent.
 The population of the United States is expected to boom over the next century, adding as many as 100 million new residents by 2040, according to the Census Bureau. If New York City and the metropolitan region hope to maintain their global competitiveness it will be important to attract some of that growth, and clearly it can't all be accommodated in the central city and inner suburbs. 
 Perhaps the most important thing that policy makers can do at this point is to reject shopworn notions about sprawl and decentralization, dismantle divisive notions that pit city against suburbs, abandon the fierce debate between public versus private transportation and concentrate on making the entire region, from the central city to the far exurbs, a more efficient and attractive place to live.

HEADLINE: On the Road With Four TV's and a Fireplace

BYLINE: By BILL MARSH

 BODY:
AH, the life of the modern R.V. owner. The freedom of the open road. The adventure of finding new places and meeting new people.
 The scenic vistas.
The four flat-screen televisions.
 Plus the fireplace, the washer/drier, the computer workstation, the motorized slideout dining room, the master bedroom, the home theater system, and so on.
 It may seem that recreational vehicles (the term covers all manner of trailers and motor homes) are getting bigger all the time. After all, they have evolved from tents-on-wheels in the 1920's to rolling households, some stretching 40 feet or more. But federal regulations limit their floor area to 400 square feet, so R.V. builders face challenges like those faced by apartment dwellers in Manhattan: how to pack in all the comforts of a furnished condominium. 
 Take those televisions. The Sportscoach Elite motor home, by Coachmen, offers one above the ''cockpit'' (drivers, keep your eyes on the road), one in the dining room and one in the bedroom. An optional fourth TV is outdoors, part of an ''exterior entertainment center'' with built-in speakers playing CD's and DVD's in stereo.
 No matter how remote the destination, the TV's need never go dark: a satellite dish keeps broadcasts uninterrupted, even while flying down the highway.
 ''It used to be that you would do this to get away from it all,'' said Stew Oleson, the host of the cable TV show ''R.V. Today.'' ''Now you take it all with you.''
 Get your kicks on Channel 66.
 Homes have garages, and now trailers do too. ''Toy haulers'' combine living space with ample storage for motorcycles, dune buggies and snowmobiles via a garage-type door in the rear. They are among the fastest-selling R.V.'s, especially in the West -- ''anywhere you have wide open spaces and people who want to waste gas,'' Mr. Oleson said.
 The intersection of rising fuel prices and R.V. girth would seem to invite comparisons to the dinosaurs, which were ultimately doomed.
 But so far, the cost of gas hasn't dampened enthusiasm for R.V.'s the way it has for S.U.V.'s. A study by PKF Consulting, which tracks the travel industry, found that gas prices would have to triple to make R.V. vacations more expensive than other types of travel. (Rising interest rates are more worrisome, according to manufacturers.) The industry is on course for its second-biggest year in a quarter-century.
 THE most tricked-out models may seem like McMansions on wheels, but for many buyers, R.V.'s are just the opposite: affordable housing.
 Besides the retirees who replace their houses with R.V.'s, taking their lives on the road, others opt for so-called park trailers, which reach the 400 square foot maximum but are parked on plots in resort areas for a fixed address. Costs, including land and a sun room addition, can come in well under $100,000.
 Gaylord Maxwell and his wife are about to join the full-timers, having traded their Idaho home on 47 acres for a 40-foot Sportscoach Elite. Still, Mr. Maxwell, who runs ''Life On Wheels'' conferences on R.V. living in conjunction with the University of Idaho and other schools, advises against full-timing just to save money.
''It can be expensive,'' he said, especially a motor home like his. ''You're going to spend a quarter of a million on an R.V. and you're going to get eight miles per gallon.'' Campsite charges can reach $150 a night at the top parks.
 Mr. Maxwell, 80, says he isn't worried about marital claustrophobia on the road. This will be the couple's third time living in an R.V. over a half-century of travel. He surveys full-timers as part of his research and hears few complaints of crowding, even though couples suddenly find themselves sharing the space equivalent of a studio apartment. ''I would rather use the word cozy than claustrophobic,'' he said.
 As the big R.V.'s roll off the factory lots, other enthusiasts are embracing the truly snug dimensions of vintage trailers from the 1950's and 60's, dubbed ''canned hams.''
 Restorations start at a few thousand dollars and go up -- way up, depending on the client's obsessiveness -- from there.
 Living spaces can be spartan compared with those of their modern descendants, but the most elaborate rehabs have plenty of period kitsch -- wildly colored upholstery, Leg-o-Matic folding chairs, birchwood paneling.
 Toilets? Not necessarily.
 In the modern R.V., they're mandatory. Fleetwood, a major manufacturer, debuts some of its 2007 models this week -- with second bathrooms.

HEADLINE: A Musician's Death Has a City Taking Stock 

BYLINE: By BRIAN WISE

 BODY:
AFTER the death of Jackie McLean, jazz saxophonist and educator, on March 31, the jazz world turned its attention to Hartford. The globe-trotting musician was the most visible figure in the city's arts and education arena, helping to create and oversee two of its better-known institutions: the Artists Collective, a nationally recognized community education center on the North End that he founded with his wife, Dollie McLean, and the jazz program at the University of Hartford's Hartt School of Music, known since 2001 as the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz.
 Both programs have nurtured thousands of young musicians since their start in the early 1970's, and along with other schools in the area, they have given Hartford credibility in wider jazz circles. The city has produced nationally recognized musicians like the pianist Brad Mehldau, who combines jazz with classical music and rock; Jimmy Greene, a rising young saxophonist with a busy international career; and Nat Reeves, a bass player who teaches at the McLean Institute. In addition, Hartford's location, midway between New York and Boston, allows it to attract some of the finest players in the Northeast. 
But many musicians say that Hartford is also a case of unrealized potential. Unlike New Haven, with its active club scene, Hartford lacks a single full-time jazz club, so fans must get their jazz doses at a handful of annual events. Two of them get under way in the next few days at Hartford's Bushnell Park. Starting Friday night and continuing through July 16, the Greater Hartford Festival of Jazz will present a free, eclectic mixture of Latin, fusion and mainstream jazz, opening with a double bill featuring the Latin jazz trumpeter Ray Vega and Bobby Matos and his Afro Latin Jazz Ensemble. And the Paul Brown Monday Night Jazz Series -- billed as the country's longest-running free jazz concert series -- opens its 39th season on July 10 with Clark Terry, the legendary trumpeter who was a mentor to Miles Davis and performed with Count Basie and Duke Ellington.
 Last year, because of a budget shortfall, the Monday Night Jazz Series moved out of its longtime residence in Bushnell Park for a shortened run on the campus of Trinity College. Paul Brown, the 72-year-old founding director of the chronically underfunded series, said the city of Hartford had begun asking the series organizers for $30,000 annually to pay for insurance, police coverage and other costs. The city had long waived such fees but in recent years it had begun to pass those costs on to organizations using the park. As a result, Mr. Brown said, he also had to reduce the original schedule to four concerts from eight, and drop a performance by Sonny Rollins. 
 ''The city should have been backing me up,'' Mr. Brown said. ''It's a public park. It's there to be used. They should be waving the flag to see this happen.'' Kelvin Roldan, the director of community initiatives for the city and a special assistant to the mayor, said the city government had been ''very supportive of the series.''
 ''The city does have a policy that every park event, every parade has to cover its share of the costs,'' Mr. Roldan said. ''We treat every event equally and we do waive 50 percent'' of the total costs.
 ''At one point the city did pick up 100 percent,'' he said, and while he acknowledged that ''that was a number of years ago,'' he said that the city provided additional funding for the jazz series through the Greater Hartford Arts Council.
 This year, Prudential Retirement stepped in to become the main sponsor of the series, allowing organizers to move it back to the park. Headliners will include several luminaries: the saxophonists David (Fathead) Newman and George Coleman, the trombonist Curtis Fuller and the pianist Junior Mance. 
 In keeping with the city's reputation, both the Monday night series and the Festival of Jazz feature younger, local musicians as part of their lineups. 
 Some of those young musicians come from the Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts, a magnet school on the city's South End. Others got their start at West Hartford's Hall High School, whose products include Mr. Mehldau and the saxophonist Joel Frahm. Students from those schools often spend their after-school hours at the Artists Collective, taking courses not only in music but also in drama, dance and the visual arts. Some eventually go on to study at the McLean Institute. 
 Jimmy Greene is one of them. Mr. Greene, 31, grew up in Bloomfield and studied the saxophone at the Artists Collective in the early 90's, then at the Hartt School, where he studied with Mr. McLean. After graduating in 1997, Mr. Greene left Hartford for New York City. He has recorded several albums for the RCA and Criss Cross labels and tours internationally with his own quartet. 
 ''As a scene I think it has seen better days,'' he said of Hartford. ''There's a vibrant jazz education scene. A lot of good students come through school and go on to do great things. As far as jazz clubs, it's hit and miss. There are some places that have jazz, but there's no club that has jazz seven nights a week.''
 Mr. Brown agreed that the ''club scene is very sparse,'' adding, ''There's not one place in town with a real piano. That sets the tone for a scene.''
 Mr. Brown added that the last significant jazz club in Hartford was the 880 Club, a South End institution that thrived in the 1980's but closed in 2000. Today, a handful of restaurants offer weekly jam sessions, like Szechuan Tokyo and Kenney's Restaurant, where the trombonist Steve Davis is host of a popular jazz night on Tuesdays. Meanwhile, some of the bigger performing arts centers and museums offer jazz in a more formal setting; major artists at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art this past year included the pianists Jason Moran and Randy Weston and the trumpeter Wallace Roney.
 The Artists Collective has also presented major jazz musicians like the drummer Art Blakey, the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson in its 40,000-square-foot headquarters on the city's beleaguered North End. According to Ms. McLean, its executive director, the Artists Collective has struggled to cover its overhead expenses, and a recent surge in violent crime in the neighborhood -- with 20 people shot from May 24 through the end of June -- has hurt enrollment.
 ''Our registration has been down,'' Ms. McLean said. ''We live in a very high unemployment area. People's schedules change. This year has been a very difficult year for us.''
 Stretched financing and the threat of crime have hurt Hartford's performance sites all around, say local musicians, and some are concerned that with Hartford losing one of its major figureheads in Mr. McLean, the city's reputation will only decline further. But others are optimistic that his former students and colleagues will carry on. 
 ''As a jazz saxophone player from Hartford, I could say Jackie McLean is Hartford,'' said Mr. Greene. ''There's no way that J-Mac can be replaced. In saying that, in the past 10 to 15 years, he gave so many musicians teaching positions there. He had delegated responsibility to people like Nat Reeves and Peter Woodard. They've been carrying the torch.''
 Mr. Woodard, the chairman of the Jackie McLean Institute, said he was finding more musicians starting jam sessions in Hartford and expressed confidence that fewer of them will automatically move to New York City to seek success.
 ''New York City engendered modern jazz and still symbolizes the fact that there is a geographic reality to the development of great art,'' he said. ''But the question remains: In this age of total access to everything, where every town has its own recording facilities and there is less emphasis on small-scale live performance, will we find other ways to stay authentically connected to the history of this music rather than rely on the obligatory route through New York?''

The Greater Hartford Festival of Jazz is July 14 through 16 at Bushnell Park. Admission is free. Information: (866) 943-JAZZ or www.hartfordjazz.com. The Monday Night Jazz Series begins July 10 at 6 p.m. and continues Monday nights through Aug. 7 at Bushnell Park. Admission is free. Information: (860) 521-4877 or www.mondaynightjazz.org.

HEADLINE: 2 Visions Vie in Hempstead For Former Bus Terminal

BYLINE: By BEN GIBBERD

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
TWO proposals for converting a building that takes up a city block in the heart of Hempstead Village into a commercial and residential development have revealed markedly different visions for revitalizing the downtown. 
 The building, at 100 Main Street, is a former bus terminal and, possibly, a future anchor for downtown. But it is unclear who will develop the site or what it will eventually contain.
The 100 Black Men of Long Island Development Group, a project of the Island chapter of 100 Black Men of America, bought the building from Nassau County in 2001 and has since proposed a $28 million plan to install commercial tenants, including some social service agencies, on the first two floors and sell the rights to build 80 condominiums on two floors above. The commercial space is half-empty now.
 Clarence Little, the group's executive director, said 30 percent of the condos would be priced below market rates, and 5 percent would be earmarked for people with disabilities, also at lower rates.
 The village's own Community Development Agency has a far more ambitious plan, estimated at $180 million. It involves the demolition of 100 Main Street and the construction of an eight-story building that would include 420 condominiums.
 The village would also build a performing arts center, a multistory parking garage and an expanded library on about six acres it owns surrounding 100 Main Street, said Claude Gooding, the agency's commissioner. He said 10 percent to 15 percent of the condos would sell below market rates.
 Mr. Gooding said that although he admired the desire of the 100 Black Men group to improve the neighborhood, it was necessary ''to be realistic about their capacity to do this.'' He pointed out that Mr. Little's group had financial difficulties.
 The group owes about $800,000 in property taxes, Mr. Little said, and has not made payments on a $10 million loan from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 Mr. Little said the group recently restructured its debt with a package put together by the Long Island Fund for Sustainable Development and was working with the county, a guarantor of the loan, to avert foreclosure.
 On June 20, a state Supreme Court justice gave the 100 Black Men group a 60-day reprieve from foreclosure in order to prepare a new plan, Mr. Little said, and the county Assessment Review Board lowered its property taxes for next year by 32 percent.
 Lance Clarke, a lawyer for the 100 Black Men of Long Island Development Group and a former Hempstead Village trustee and deputy mayor, said that the village could not sustain a project of the magnitude it had proposed and that its plan had not been subjected to an environmental impact review or presented to the community for comment.
 The 100 Black Men group will retain the development rights unless it defaults, and Mayor Wayne J. Hall Sr. is not pushing the village development agency's proposal. Referring to the 100 Black Men group, he said, ''If they come up with a viable plan and make themselves solvent, I don't have a problem with that.''
 Still, officials at the village development agency have hopes for its plan.
 ''Is it ambitious?'' Mr. Gooding said. ''Of course it is. It has to be if we're ever going to attract the tenants and the type of economic strata we need.''

HEADLINE: Poor, Misunderstood Sprawl

BYLINE: By Robert Bruegmann. 
Robert Bruegmann, a professor of art history, architecture and urban planning at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is the author, most recently, of ''Sprawl: A Compact History.''

DATELINE: Chicago 

 BODY:
FOR years, opponents of sprawl have argued that the growth of suburbs and exurbs saps the vitality of central cities. They claim that the result has been homogenous, affluent, white bedroom communities at the urban periphery, and at the core an increasing number of poor and minority neighborhoods. They also blame sprawl for longer commuting times, more traffic congestion and increased pollution. 
 Many of these observers hailed recent news from the Census Bureau that New York City is expected to grow by more than a million people by 2025. Some have even suggested that this might mark the end of suburban growth in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York as people move back toward the center to take advantage of shorter commuting times, more demographic diversity and all the other benefits that higher-density living can bring. 
These suggestions, however, are based more on dislike for suburbs and wishful thinking than on any rational analysis of what has actually happened or is likely to happen to the metropolitan region over the next decades. 
 It makes little sense to think of suburbs as different from the city. The story of urban development is of a continuous outward push with little regard for municipal boundaries. The suburban growth of one generation is ringed by newer growth, and the older suburbs become more like the urban core itself. So, for example, the area north of Wall Street in Manhattan or the small settlement of Brooklyn Heights, both of them suburbs in the 18th century, soon became denser and, eventually, part of the city itself. 
 As the suburban fringe expands, the rest of the urban area changes too, often in complex and unexpected ways. So, for example, strong continuing growth at the edge of suburban development in Connecticut's Litchfield County, Morris County, N.J., and New York's Putnam and Suffolk Counties has been accompanied by increasing densities and more diversity of land use and population in closer-in counties like Essex, Fairfield, Nassau and Westchester. For evidence of this increased density and diversity, just look at the growing number of Mexican markets and Buddhist temples popping up amid tract houses and strip malls in Nassau County. 
 Contrary to accepted wisdom, the expanding outer edge of suburbia is not being fueled by wealthy residents fleeing the city and seeking increasingly large lots. More often than not, the people driving growth in the furthest subdivisions of Connecticut, Long Island and central New Jersey are families of modest means looking for more house for their dollar than they can afford closer to the old urban centers. 
 This outward expansion should not be blamed for increased traffic congestion and pollution. What has caused congestion is the increase in affluence that has allowed more families, both in the central city and the suburbs, to own and use cars, together with a failure by governments to increase road capacity or provide a transit system that can compete with the private automobile. 
 And there is little evidence that sprawl is necessarily detrimental to the health of central cities. Even as the New York, San Francisco or Chicago regions have sprawled in recent years, neighborhoods in the central city and inner suburbs have come roaring back. At first glance it might appear that this much-heralded rebirth is the opposite of the outward drift to suburbia. But it seems more logical to see them as flip sides of the same coin. The rebuilding of the South Bronx and the gentrification of Williamsburg and Hoboken started with a precipitous decline in population and density as the existing residents became affluent enough to move to newer and less dense housing further out in the urban area. The newly available space freed by this exodus is a magnet for new urban energy.
 The ''urban renaissance'' that is under way, while real and very welcome after decades in which central cities were buffeted by the loss of jobs and residents, is hardly likely to end suburban sprawl. Most Americans, when asked about their housing preferences, would prefer a single-family detached house, and the majority of the jobs are now in the suburbs. Manhattan is home to less than 20 percent of the jobs in the New York region, a proportion that has been steadily declining, while the outer suburbs have more than 30 percent.
 The population of the United States is expected to boom over the next century, adding as many as 100 million new residents by 2040, according to the Census Bureau. If New York City and the metropolitan region hope to maintain their global competitiveness it will be important to attract some of that growth, and clearly it can't all be accommodated in the central city and inner suburbs. 
 Perhaps the most important thing that policy makers can do at this point is to reject shopworn notions about sprawl and decentralization, dismantle divisive notions that pit city against suburbs, abandon the fierce debate between public versus private transportation and concentrate on making the entire region, from the central city to the far exurbs, a more efficient and attractive place to live.

HEADLINE: Yonkers to Restore Historic City Hall Murals

BYLINE: By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
A collection of historic but fading murals that adorn the walls of Yonkers City Hall will be restored early next year in time for the hall's centennial in 2008.
 The 11 murals hang from the walls of the City Council chambers and tell the story of Yonkers since it was first settled by Lenape Indians hundreds of years ago. They were painted by the muralists Vincent Aderente and A. E. Foringer when City Hall was built a century ago and are among the building's most recognizable features.
But the murals have taken such a beating from dust, sunlight and cigarette smoke that many of their scenes are barely discernible, and after several failed efforts at starting a restoration project, the City Council decided last month that it needed to bring the paintings back to life in time for the centennial, said Joan Deierlein, the city clerk. 
 One of the prized paintings shows the Dutch settler Adriaen van der Donck negotiating with Indians in 1646. Van der Donck was known locally as ''Jonkheer,'' or ''young gentleman,'' the Dutch word from which the name Yonkers was derived.
 The restoration project will begin at the end of the month and will cost $150,000, about half of what the city was expecting to pay. The company that will do the work, Evergreene Painting Studios in Manhattan, will mainly stabilize flaking paint and clean the surfaces of the paintings, Ms. Deierlein said.
 ''We really thought the murals would need a lot more work, but it turns out -- thank goodness -- that they don't,'' she said. ''We really were prepared for the worst.''
 The story of the murals is almost as rich as the history they portray. They were commissioned at the turn of the 19th century, at a time when cities across the country were beginning to spend more money on improving the look of their public squares and spaces, an effort known as the City Beautiful Movement, said Mario Caruso, a city planner who gives historical tours of Yonkers. The paintings were so important that the chambers where they hang was designed around them, and Mr. Aderente gave his input on everything from the layout of the room to the color it was painted.
 The murals add not only to the historic quality of the building, but also to its grandeur, Mr. Caruso said.
 ''Maybe now that they're being restored, the city can start showcasing them,'' he said.

Rye Homeowners Get Tax Relief
 Officials in Rye announced last week that property owners would get an unexpected tax break because of a discrepancy in the school district's budget for next year.
 The district's $59.9 million budget was approved in May with an estimated tax rate increase of 6.75 percent. But shortly after that budget passed, the district learned from the city assessor that the tax base was higher than expected, and instead of collecting excess revenue, members of the school board decided to lower the tax rate by nearly an entire point, to 5.98 percent. As a result, the average homeowner in Rye will pay about $84 less this year than expected, school officials said.
 Two factors were largely responsible for the decrease, which came as a welcome surprise to many people in Rye. Property values have increased in the area, and the district is also expecting to earn more money on its investments because of higher interest rates, said Robert G. Walsh Jr., the assistant school superintendent.
 ''We felt that we could add an additional $30,000 of interest earned because of the ongoing rise in interest rates,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''That was something that really helped decrease the burden that we needed to raise from the tax levy.''
 Rye, which has a median household income of nearly $60,000, is one of the wealthiest towns in Westchester and generally has some of the lowest tax rate increases in the county from year to year. James Culyer, president of the school board, said he was thrilled with the decrease because the district had made an effort in the last few years to maintain its relatively low rate of increase.
 ''This year we can do that without having to reduce or change any of the programs that the citizens of Rye are used to having,'' Mr. Culyer said. ''And when you have an opportunity to give money back to the taxpayers, it's always a good thing.''

Death at Playland Spurs Safety Measures
 Westchester County officials said they were stepping up safety procedures at Playland Amusement Park after a 43-year-old Queens man died there last week, the fourth death at the park in the last four years.
 The man, Won Yong Kim, a sushi chef from Flushing, was visiting the park with relatives on the Fourth of July when he drowned in a lake. Mr. Kim was at a relatively isolated section of the beach where vandals had removed several ''no swimming'' signs, the police said, and he had apparently been drinking with friends.
 On Thursday, two days after the death, county officials said they were reviewing their policies on drinking at county-run parks and had already installed 20 new signs at the lake.
 It was not clear last week whether alcohol played a role in Mr. Kim's death. As a precaution, the county was re-examining its alcohol consumption policies at its roughly 50 parks, said Susan Tolchin, chief adviser to Andrew J. Spano, the county executive. County policy permits park patrons to have alcohol, but not in large quantities, like kegs or cases.
 ''We don't know what happened in this particular case yet,'' Ms. Tolchin said. ''We have millions of visitors who come to our parks each year and act responsibly. We're looking at our policies because that's the responsible thing to do, but whether they will change remains to be seen.''

HEADLINE: France's Aging Magician Conjures a Final Trick

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN; Maia de la Baume contributed reporting from Paris for this article.

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 8 

 BODY:
His shaved head glistening, sweat beading off his chin, the French midfielder Zinedine Zidane set up for a penalty kick in the World Cup semifinals with revived and direct intent.
 The Portuguese goalkeeper knew exactly where the shot was going, but he could only dive helplessly as the kick rocketed inside the left goal post. That goal in Wednesday's game proved decisive in a 1-0 victory that put France in the World Cup final against Italy here Sunday and illustrated Zidane's masterly assurance and control at age 34, even as he plans to retire after the championship match.
 With a victory, France would secure its second World Cup title in eight years and Zidane would cement his position as perhaps soccer's greatest player of the last 20 years. He is a modest man who summons an elegant flamboyance on the field. Yet his performance here has been as improbable as it has been rejuvenating, and he has led what France's coach, Raymond Domenech, affectionately calls ''a little team of old men'' to the brink of a title. 
 For the French to win, Zidane will have to lead a successful attack against an Italian team that has displayed an impenetrable defense, allowing one goal -- a ball kicked into its own net in a match against the United States -- so far in the tournament. 
 ''It's amazing that someone 34 is still able to do such incredible things on the pitch,'' the French defender Willy Sagnol said of Zidane. ''He is a natural leader. It is a pleasure to follow in his footsteps.''
 Another teammate, Lilian Thuram, said, ''It is others who should be stopping, not him.''
 Zidane did stop once already. He had no intention of participating in this tournament, leaving France's national team in 2004, two years after it embarrassingly exited the 2002 World Cup in the first round without scoring. He was coaxed to return by a coach seeking one last flicker of greatness, and by what Zinedine Zidane (pronounced ZIN-ay-deen zee-DAHN) has described as an eerie nighttime visit from a mystical figure, all very French and inexplicable.
 His comeback was alternately welcomed, met with skepticism, then disparaged by many fans and by the French news media. Zidane appeared slow and old as France failed to win its first two matches of this World Cup, and he was disqualified from the third match after receiving two yellow-card warnings for excessive fouls.
 The son of Algerian emigres, Zidane was even accused of mumbling ''La Marseillaise,'' France's national anthem, by the far-right politician, Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the anti-immigration National Front, who has complained that there are too many members of minority groups on the World Cup team.
 ''We are proud to represent this country,'' Thuram told reporters in rebuke of Le Pen. ''So vive la France, but the true France. Not the France that he wants.''
 The criticisms have since stopped as Zidane has resuscitated France and his own image with a determined will and a wizardry that makes the ball seem as if it is tethered to a string, like a yo-yo. He grew up playing street soccer in a housing project in Marseille and lived, it is said, in an apartment so cramped that his family had to eat in shifts. If so, this may help to explain why the 6-foot-1, 172-pound Zidane is such a magician in tight, impossible spaces.
 In the World Cup quarterfinals against flamboyant and skillful Brazil, Zidane made the ball do tricks as if it were a pet. He was more Brazilian than the Brazilians themselves. Juggling off his thigh. Spinning 360 degrees at a full sprint. Flicking the ball over the head of Ronaldo, a Brazilian forward, to start a play that culminated with Zidane's free kick and a volley by Thierry Henry that provided the game's lone goal.
 ''A player like Zidane can be 30, 40, 50 years old, and he will always know what to do with the ball at his feet,'' the Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos said.
 Pele, the Brazilian considered by many the greatest player in the history of the game, refers to Zidane as Maestro. Michel Platini, a former French star, told Agence France-Presse, ''I think he is the king of what's fundamental in the game: control and passing.''
 With this remark, Platini struck upon something essential in Zidane's appeal -- individuality in service of the team. This has become a rallying point for France's aging squad. 
 ''Our slogan is, 'We will live or die together,' '' Zidane said after France's semifinal victory.
 Two years ago, it seemed that his international career had been forever interred. Zidane retired from France's national team in August 2004. Six years earlier, he had scored two goals in the World Cup final against Brazil, and France's 3-0 victory outside Paris had touched off the largest celebration on the Champs-Elysees since World War II ended. Zidane's likeness was projected onto the Arc de Triomphe.
 But he was tired and injured at the 2002 World Cup, playing with a wrap around his thigh and a figurative tourniquet around his seemingly withered talent. Then France exited meekly in the quarterfinals of the 2004 European Championships. That was it. Zidane was done with the national team.
 ''You have to stop one day,'' he said in a statement.
 A year later, in August 2005, he came back, with an exotic explanation for his return. He told the magazine France Football: ''One night at 3 in the morning, I suddenly woke up and I spoke with someone. But no one knows about it, not even my wife.''
 What happened to him was ''mystical, and even escapes me a bit,'' Zidane said. He vowed not to identify this convincing voice, promising: ''Until my last breath, I won't say. It's too intense.''
 He added that he felt pushed by an irrepressible force, saying: ''I had to obey this voice that was advising me. It's an enigma, but don't try to find an explanation. You will never find it. You will probably never meet this person. Even I cannot explain this meeting.''
 After the snickering class began to wonder about this disembodied voice and whether it belonged to a deity, President Jacques Chirac of France or to Zidane's corporate sponsors, he offered a clarification. The visitor had been real enough, he said. It was his brother.
 Whatever the motivation for his return, Zidane's eccentric account did provide at least a hint of the unbound way he plays soccer.
 In the recent documentary ''Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait,'' he became mystical again as he said: ''The game, the event, is not necessarily experienced or remembered in real time. I remember playing in another place, at another time, when something amazing happened. Someone passed the ball to me, and before even touching it, I knew what was going to happen. I knew I was going to score. It was the first and last time it ever happened.'' 
 Whatever the outcome of Sunday's final, Zidane's place in soccer is secure. So is his place in French culture, where he, as a married father, is perceived to represent family values, a fondness for effort, a willingness to take responsibility and general decency.
 ''In a country like France, where people are often considered as arrogant and proud and sermonizers, he's an example of discretion and shyness,'' said Elie Cohen, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and, like almost all French intellectuals, a fan of the team.
 Real life, though, does not always come tied in the same neat bow as sports.
 In 1998, France's victory, achieved with an ethnically diverse team, became a symbol of multiculturalism anda repudiation of Le Pen's anti-immigrant stance. In France's 2002 presidential elections, Zidane urged voters to cast their ballots for the incumbent, Chirac, derisively referring to his opponent, Le Pen, as ''the other one.'' 
 Yet the jubilant, inclusive promise of 1998 has met a less sanguine reality. In 2001, supporters of Algeria booed the French national anthem before an exhibition match with France outside Paris, then halted the game with 10 minutes remaining by running onto the field. Riots last fall by French-Arab and French-African youths underscored the alienation from jobs and opportunity felt by immigrants and the failure to integrate them into French society. 
 ''The '98 victory has shown that there is space for everyone in France, and that for those who think immigration is inconvenient, they're wrong, because France's success is due to immigration's contributions,'' said Pascal Boniface, director of France's Institute for International and Strategic Relations, and author of a book on soccer and globalism.
 ''Unfortunately, soccer, instead of being a steppingstone to allow integration, it has become ghettoized. Black people and Arabs are much more able to succeed in football or sport in general than in politics and the economy. We should get our inspiration from soccer rather than considering it as a space for the achievement of minorities.''
 Even a magician like Zidane can only do so much to sustain optimism and conviviality in a troubled nation, social experts said.
 ''The final will be a great moment of communion and shared happiness, but we'll never wipe out France's real problems like the suburb riots only with Zidane's image,'' Cohen said.
 Even if, by Sunday night, it is again beaming from the Arc de Triomphe.

HEADLINE: Investors Lead Home Sale Boom For New Orleans

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 8 

 BODY:
In a market spurred by speculators and bargain hunters, an extraordinarily large number of houses in the flood-ravaged metropolitan area here are being sold, according to real estate analysts, who say volume and sales prices exceed levels before Hurricane Katrina.
 The higher prices are largely due to an increase in value in suburban areas, many of which were not heavily flooded, or in dry areas of New Orleans. But flooded houses in the city are being bought as well, often at deep discounts of as much as $50 a square foot less than they would have sold for before the hurricane.
 ''We have a stronger housing market than before,'' said Wade R. Ragas, professor emeritus of finance at the University of New Orleans and the president of a local consulting firm, Real Property Associates.
 ''There is renovation activity in every ZIP code of Orleans Parish,'' Dr. Ragas added, ''but the strongest buying activity is, in general, closest to where it did not flood or where there was under two feet of water.'' 
 Across the nine-parish region that includes New Orleans, 7,506 single-family homes were sold between January and the end of last month, compared with 6,449 in the same period last year, according to statistics from the New Orleans Metropolitan Association of Realtors and the Gulf South Real Estate Information Network. The average price so far this year is $221,244, compared with $193,097 in the same period last year.
 The interest in buying, selling and renovating has been a bright spot since the last months of 2005, and has confounded some people who thought the flooding would cripple the housing market for years. But it is just one of many counterintuitive contrasts that are defining the area and making easy predictions unreliable.
 Before the storm, Jennifer and Rodney Greenup lived in the Gentilly neighborhood of New Orleans, in a 1950's-era, 2,600-square-foot house with a red tile roof that they bought nine years ago for $108,000. It was appraised for nearly $240,000 before Hurricane Katrina. 
 But after the storm, when the levees broke, Gentilly was inundated, and the house sat in deep, murky water for weeks.
 It sold after just two weeks on the market in February for $110,000. The house had been gutted and still lacks walls, floors, appliances and other standard fixtures.
 ''We didn't think we'd be able to get anything remotely normal when we decided to sell it,'' said Ms. Greenup, a pharmacist. ''We just wanted to do all right and would have been happy to get 80 grand.''
 The buyer was a firefighter who said he had admired the house for years and planned to fix it up and live in it.
 Kim and Reginald Glass are among the local investors betting on flood-ruined areas like Gentilly, which was a solidly middle-class neighborhood north of downtown toward Lake Pontchartrain. They have bought eight damaged houses for prices from $50,000 to $112,000, which Ms. Glass says probably represents about half the houses' market value before the storm.
 ''We had too much invested in New Orleans to walk away,'' said Ms. Glass, a lawyer who grew up in Gentilly. ''We needed to figure out a way to stay here and make a living. So we decided to purchase properties in Gentilly. We looked to purchase any property that had potential, in hope of being able to renovate and rent. I think we're going to try the rental market, because there are so many people looking to come back.''
 The home the Glass family lived in had flood damage, and a house they were building on the lakeshore suffered wind damage. Undaunted, they returned to the city as early as possible, in October, and got to work.
 ''The biggest problem has been getting things like cabinets and appliances in,'' Ms. Glass said. ''It's been quite an experience. But we knew that we were coming back to fight.''
 For-sale signs are everywhere, even in neighborhoods that feel dead, in this city of contrasts.. Some flood-ruined areas are still foul-smelling and dirty, while other neighborhoods are vibrant and clean. Some areas still have looting and other crimes, while many neighborhoods are generally safe, and tourists roam the French Quarter with drinks in hand.
 Though billions of dollars in federal housing aid will begin pouring into the city this fall, there is no clear vision for renovating vast parts of the area, and some experts say speculators are taking a significant risk. In addition, there has been a 20 percent increase in the cost of construction materials, and the city continues to have a shortage of workers, experts say.
 ''We don't know how things will pan out,'' said Ivan J. Miestchovich Jr., director of the Real Estate Market Data Center and the Center for Economic Development, both at the University of New Orleans. ''There's a readjustment period right now. I think there's still a big question mark.''
 Amy Liu, deputy director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution in Washington, which is studying the post-storm recovery, said she was stunned by the number of houses on the market, but like Dr. Miestchovich was not sure what to make of it.
 ''What it means to us is that people are finally making decisions,'' Ms. Liu said. ''If people are choosing to leave, that could be a bad thing. But if inventory is moving, then that's a good thing. To us, this is part of the natural churning that has to happen.''
 If much of the movement is being driven by speculators, that is not necessarily bad either, Ms. Liu said.
 ''If there are folks who are not financially able to clean up their homes,'' she said, ''it is much better to have someone buy it than have it be abandoned and foreclosed.'' 
 Some sectors of the economy, of course, depend on optimism to survive, particularly real estate. Dee Luscy, president of the New Orleans Metropolitan Association of Realtors, said she thought the fear about the future was beginning to lift around the region.
 ''I think in the beginning people were afraid,'' Ms. Luscy said. ''A lot of people thought, 'We'll never be able to give this stuff away.' Now we're seeing that things are selling. I think people are over the initial shock and are starting to feel O.K. about going on with life. What happened was like death. You go through stages of grief.''
 Vicki Shreves sold her gutted, 1,600-square-foot house in the Uptown section of New Orleans without putting up a for-sale sign. A friend of the family visited the house, on a street that had eight feet of water, ''and wanted to know if we wanted to sell it,'' Ms. Shreves said. ''It just seemed like such an easy thing, we said fine.'' 
 To Ms. Shreves, an accountant, the thought of rebuilding was depressing, and mold was a concern. But she had not decided to sell when she and her husband got the offer, which was close to $100 a square foot.
 Before the storm, she said, she probably could have sold the house for $330,000. ''When the storm came and obliterated it,'' she said, ''we were happy to get $150,000.''
 ''We got a check right there and closed the sale,'' she added. 
 Beth Amadon bought a flooded house in a neighborhood near Lake Pontchartrain for about 50 percent of its prestorm value of more than $600,000. Ms. Amadon knows what the houses are worth because she put in an offer on a different house in the same neighborhood just days before Hurricane Katrina. 
 ''After the storm we couldn't get back to the city, so we agreed to walk away from that sale,'' she said. ''That's how we ended up buying a different house.'' 
 In addition, Ms. Amadon sold several distressed properties that she and her husband, a real estate developer, had owned in the Treme area near the French Quarter for about 20 percent more than they would have expected before the hurricane. The buyer was a resident who said he intended to rent the houses. 
 ''People seem anxious to buy historically relevant houses close to the French Quarter,'' Ms. Amadon said. ''It's been an interesting year.''
 Joan Farabaugh, a real estate agent in New Orleans, said she had earned as much income in the past six months as she did in all of last year.
 ''And I have as much business with nonflooded as flooded'' houses, Ms. Farabaugh said. ''Most of my sales are people who are locals, buying and fixing up.''
 She said she believed that her clients had faith in the future.
 ''They feel that what happened was unusual, and they don't feel that this will happen again,'' she said of the levee breaches and catastrophic flooding. ''They feel they will be fine.''

HEADLINE: SURPRISING JUMP IN TAX REVENUES CURBS U.S. DEFICIT

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8 

 BODY:
An unexpectedly steep rise in tax revenues from corporations and the wealthy is driving down the projected budget deficit this year, even though spending has climbed sharply because of the war in Iraq and the cost of hurricane relief.
 On Tuesday, White House officials are expected to announce that the tax receipts will be about $250 billion above last year's levels and that the deficit will be about $100 billion less than what they projected six months ago. The rising tide in tax payments has been building for months, but the increased scale is surprising even seasoned budget analysts and making it easier for both the administration and Congress to finesse the big run-up in spending over the past year.
Tax revenues are climbing twice as fast as the administration predicted in February, so fast that the budget deficit could actually decline this year.
 The main reason is a big spike in corporate tax receipts, which have nearly tripled since 2003, as well as what appears to be a big increase in individual taxes on stock market profits and executive bonuses. 
 On Friday, the Congressional Budget Office reported that corporate tax receipts for the nine months ending in June hit $250 billion -- nearly 26 percent higher than the same time last year -- and that overall revenues were $206 billion higher than at this point in 2005.
 Congressional analysts say the surprise windfall could shrink the deficit this year to $300 billion, from $318 billion in 2005 and an all-time high of $412 billion in 2004. 
 Republicans are already arguing that the revenue jump proves that their tax cuts, especially the 2003 tax cut on stock dividends, would spur the economy and ultimately increase revenues.
 ''The tax relief we delivered has helped unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of America and kept our economy the envy of the world,'' President Bush said in his weekly radio address on Saturday.
 Democrats and many independent budget analysts note that overall revenues have barely climbed back to the levels reached in 2000, and that the government has borrowed trillions of dollars against Social Security surpluses just as the first of the nation's baby boomers are nearing retirement. 
 ''The fact is that revenues are way below what the administration said they would be a few years ago,'' said Thomas S. Kahn, staff director for Democrats on the House Budget Committee. ''The long-term prognosis is still very, very bleak, and the administration doesn't have any kind of long-term plan.''
 One reason the run-up in taxes looks good is because the past five years looked so bad. Revenues are up, but they have lagged well behind economic growth. 
 The surge could also evaporate as quickly as it appeared. Over the past decade, tax revenues have become much more volatile, alternately soaring and plunging in the wake of swings in the stock market and repeatedly defying government projections. 
 Nevertheless, the short-term change has been striking. At the beginning of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that this year's deficit would be $371 billion and the White House Office of Management and Budget put the figure at $423 billion.
 Corporate tax payments are expected to exceed $300 billion, up from $131 billion three years ago. The other big increase is an extraordinary jump in individual taxes that were not withheld from paychecks, usually a reflection of taxes on investment income and executive bonuses.
 The jump in receipts is providing Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress with a new opportunity to assert that tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 are working and that Congress should make them permanent. 
 Pat Toomey, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political fund-raising group, said: ''The supply-siders were absolutely right. All the major sources of revenue have grown, especially in areas where we said they would.''
 But budget analysts, supporters and critics of Mr. Bush alike, cautioned that this year's windfall would do little to improve the government's long-term budget woes. 
 Government spending under Mr. Bush continued to climb rapidly this year, more than twice as fast as the economy. Spending on the war in Iraq has accelerated, to about $120 billion this year. 
 Far more ominously, the nation's oldest baby boomers will be eligible for Social Security benefits in just two years. Conservatives and liberals alike predict a huge escalation in costs of Social Security and Medicare over the next several decades. 
 ''The long-term outlook is such a deep well of sorrow that I can't get much happiness out of this year,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a former White House economist under President Bush.
 Despite almost five years of economic growth, individual income taxes -- the biggest component of federal tax revenues -- have yet to reach the levels of 2000. Even with surging payments for investment profits and business income, individual tax payments in 2005 were only $972 billion -- below the $1 trillion reached in 2000, even without adjusting for inflation.
 Over all, individual and corporate taxes have lagged well behind the economy's growth over the past five years. Government spending, by contrast, mushroomed far faster than the economy. 
 And federal debt has ballooned to $8.3 trillion, up from $5.6 trillion when Mr. Bush took office. Republicans are trying to raise the authorized debt ceiling to $9.6 trillion.
 War costs for Iraq and Afghanistan have totaled more than $300 billion since 2003, and the Bush administration has not included any war costs in its budget estimates beyond next year.
 Domestic discretionary programs, like education and space exploration, have slowed their growth after climbing rapidly in Mr. Bush's first term. But entitlement programs, particularly Medicaid and Medicare, are climbing rapidly as a result of rising medical prices and Mr. Bush's prescription drug program. 
 Outlays for Medicare have climbed 15 percent this year and are expected to hit $300 billion. About half of that increase results from the new prescription drug program, which is expected to cost nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years. 
 ''Even if spending is not going up as fast as it was before, it's not coming down,'' said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that advocates budget discipline.
 Despite a public outcry this year over pork-barrel spending sought by individual lawmakers for local projects, Mr. Bixby said, the main causes of higher spending stem from the war in Iraq and entitlement programs. 
 Both supporters and critics of Mr. Bush cautioned against attributing much long-term significance to the recent fiscal improvement, in part because tax revenues have become more volatile.
 In the late 1990's, revenues exceeded predictions by more than $100 billion a year. After the recession of 2001, revenues plunged about $100 billion below what could be explained by slower economic growth and higher unemployment.
 One reason for the increased volatility may be that, contrary to a popular assumption, a disproportionate share of income taxes is paid by wealthy households, and their incomes are based much more on the swings of the stock market than on wages and salaries. About one-third of all income taxes are paid by households in the top 1 percent of income earners, who make more than about $300,000 a year. Because those households also earn the overwhelming share of taxable investment income and executive bonuses, both their incomes and their tax liabilities swing sharply in bull and bear markets.
 ''These people have incomes that fluctuate much more rapidly, so when the economy is doing well and the stock market is doing well, tax revenues will be up,'' said Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization. ''Rapidly fluctuating tax revenues will continue to be the norm for years to come.'' 
 Compared with the size of the economy, tax revenues are still below historical norms and far below what the administration predicted as recently as 2003.
 Tax receipts amounted to about 17.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in 2005, far below the level five years ago and still slightly below the average of 18 percent since World War II. Spending, by contrast, is running at about 20 percent of gross domestic product .
 ''Spending has not been restrained,'' Mr. Riedl said. ''One hundred percent of the reduced deficit is because taxpayers are sending more money to Washington.''

HEADLINE: At Colleges, Women Are Leaving Men in the Dust 

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Nearing graduation, Rick Kohn is not putting much energy into his final courses.
 ''I take the path of least resistance,'' said Mr. Kohn, who works 25 hours a week to put himself through the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. ''This summer, I looked for the four easiest courses I could take that would let me graduate in August.''
 It is not that Mr. Kohn, 24, is indifferent to education. He is excited about economics and hopes to get his master's in the field. But the other classes, he said, just do not seem worth the effort.
 "What's the difference between an A and a B?'' he asks. ''Either way, you go on to the next class.'' 
 He does not see his female classmates sharing that attitude. Women work harder in school, Mr. Kohn believes. ''The girls care more about their G.P.A. and the way they look on paper,'' he said.
 A quarter-century after women became the majority on college campuses, men are trailing them in more than just enrollment.
 Department of Education statistics show that men, whatever their race or socioeconomic group, are less likely than women to get bachelor's degrees -- and among those who do, fewer complete their degrees in four or five years. Men also get worse grades than women. 
 And in two national studies, college men reported that they studied less and socialized more than their female classmates. 
 Small wonder, then, that at elite institutions like Harvard, small liberal arts colleges like Dickinson, huge public universities like the University of Wisconsin and U.C.L.A. and smaller ones like Florida Atlantic University, women are walking off with a disproportionate share of the honors degrees.
 It is not that men are in a downward spiral: they are going to college in greater numbers and are more likely to graduate than two decades ago.
 Still, men now make up only 42 percent of the nation's college students. And with sex discrimination fading and their job opportunities widening, women are coming on much stronger, often leapfrogging the men to the academic finish.
 ''The boys are about where they were 30 years ago, but the girls are just on a tear, doing much, much better,'' said Tom Mortenson, a senior scholar at the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education in Washington.
 Take Jen Smyers, who has been a powerhouse in her three years at American University in Washington. 
 She has a dean's scholarship, has held four internships and three jobs in her time at American, made the dean's list almost every term and also led the campus women's initiative. And when the rest of her class graduates with bachelor's degrees next year, Ms. Smyers will be finishing her master's.
 She says her intense motivation is not so unusual. ''The women here are on fire,'' she said.
 The gender differences are not uniform. In the highest-income families, men 24 and under attend college as much as, or slightly more than, their sisters, according to the American Council on Education, whose report on these issues is scheduled for release this week.
 Young men from low-income families, which are disproportionately black and Hispanic, are the most underrepresented on campus, though in middle-income families too, more daughters than sons attend college. In recent years the gender gap has been widening, especially among low-income whites and Hispanics. 
 When it comes to earning bachelor's degrees, the gender gap is smaller than the gap between whites and blacks or Hispanics, federal data shows.
 All of this has helped set off intense debate over whether these trends show a worrisome achievement gap between men and women or whether the concern should instead be directed toward the educational difficulties of poor boys, black, white or Hispanic.
 ''Over all, the differences between blacks and whites, rich and poor, dwarf the differences between men and women within any particular group,'' says Jacqueline King, a researcher for the American Council on Education's Center for Policy Analysis and the author of the forthcoming report.

Differences Seen Early
 Still, across all race and class lines, there are significant performance differences between young men and women that start before college.
 High school boys score higher than girls on the SAT, particularly on the math section. Experts say that is both because the timed multiple-choice questions play to boys' strengths and because more middling female students take the test. Boys also score slightly better on the math and science sections of national assessment tests. On the same assessments, 12th-grade boys, even those with college-educated parents, do far worse than girls on reading and writing. 
 Faced with applications and enrollment numbers that tilt toward women, some selective private colleges are giving men a slight boost in admissions. On other campuses the female predominance is becoming noticeable in the female authors added to the reading lists and the diminished dating scene.
 And when it gets to graduation, differences are evident too. 
 At Harvard, 55 percent of the women graduated with honors this spring, compared with barely half the men. And at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, a public university, women made up 64 percent of this year's graduates, and they got 75 percent of the honors degrees and 79 percent of the highest honors, summa cum laude.
 Of course, nationwide, there are young men at the top of the class and fields like computer science, engineering and physics that are male dominated. 
 Professors interviewed on several campuses say that in their experience men seem to cluster in a disproportionate share at both ends of the spectrum -- students who are the most brilliantly creative, and students who cannot keep up. 
 ''My best male students are every bit as good as my best female students,'' said Wendy Moffat, a longtime English professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. ''But the range among the guys is wider.''
 From the time they are young, boys are far more likely than girls to be suspended or expelled, or have a learning disability or emotional problem diagnosed. As teenagers, they are more likely to drop out of high school, commit suicide or be incarcerated. Such difficulties can have echoes even in college men.
 ''They have a sense of lassitude, a lack of focus,'' said William Pollack, director of the Centers for Men and Young Men at McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School.
 At a time when jobs that require little education are disappearing, Mr. Mortenson predicts trouble for boys whose ''educational attainment is not keeping up with the demands of the economy.'' 
 In the 1990's, even as women poured into college at a higher rate than men, attention focused largely on their troubles, especially after the 1992 report ''How Schools Shortchange Girls'' from the American Association of University Women.
 But some scholars say the new emphasis on young men's problems -- recent magazine covers and talk shows describing a ''boy crisis'' -- is misguided in a world where men still dominate the math-science axis, earn more money and wield more power than women. 
 ''People keep asking me why this is such a hot topic, and I think it does go back to the ideas people carry in their heads,'' said Sara Mead, the author of a report for Education Sector, a Washington policy center, that concluded that boys, especially young ones, were making progress on many measures. It suggested that the heightened concern might in part reflect some people's nervousness about women's achievement. 
 ''The idea that girls could be ahead is so shocking that they think it must be a crisis for boys,'' Ms. Mead said. ''I'm troubled by this tone of crisis. Even if you control for the field they're in, boys right out of college make more money than girls, so at the end of the day, is it grades and honors that matter, or something else the boys may be doing?''

Women in the Majority
 What is beyond dispute is that the college landscape is changing. Women now make up 58 percent of those enrolled in two- and four-year colleges and are, over all, the majority in graduate schools and professional schools too. 
 Most institutions of higher learning, except engineering schools, now have a female edge, with many small liberal arts colleges and huge public universities alike hovering near the 60-40 ratio. Even Harvard, long a male bastion, has begun to tilt toward women.
 ''The class we just admitted will be 52 percent female,'' said William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of admissions.
 While Harvard accepts men and women in proportions roughly equal to their presence in the applicant pool, other elite universities do not. At Brown University, men made up not quite 40 percent of this year's applicants, but 47 percent of those admitted.
 Women now outnumber men two to one at places like the State University of New York at New Paltz, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and Baltimore City Community College. And they make up particularly large majorities among older students.
 The lower the family income, the greater the disparity between men and women attending college, said Ms. King of the American Council on Education's Center for Policy Analysis.
 Thomas diPrete, a Columbia University sociology professor, has found that while boys whose parents had only a high school education used to be more likely to get a college education than their sisters, that has flipped. 
 Still, the gender gap has moved to the front burner in part because of interest from educated mothers worrying that their sons are adrift or disturbed that their girls are being passed over by admissions officers eager for boys, said Judith Kleinfeld, a University of Alaska professor who has created the Boys Project (boysproject.net), a coalition of researchers, educators and parents to address boys' troubles.
 ''I hate to be cynical, but when it was a problem of black or poor kids, nobody cared, but now that it's a problem of white sons of college-educated parents, it's moving very rapidly to the forefront,'' Dr. Kleinfeld said. ''At most colleges, there is a sense that a lot of boys are missing in action.''
 Beyond the data points -- graduation rates, enrollment rates, grades -- there are subtle differences in the nature of men's and women's college experiences.
 In dozens of interviews on three campuses -- Dickinson College; American University; and the University of North Carolina, Greensboro -- male and female students alike agreed that the slackers in their midst were mostly male, and that the fireballs were mostly female.
 Almost all speculated that it had something to do with the women's movement.
 ''The roles have changed a lot,'' said Travis Rothway, a 23-year-old junior at American University, a private school where only 36 percent of last year's freshmen were male. ''Men have always been the dominant figure, providing for the household, but now women have broken out of their domestic roles in society. I don't think guys' willingness to work and succeed has changed, it's more that the women have stepped up.''
 Ben Turner, who graduated from American this spring, said he did not believe that work habits were determined by gender -- but acknowledged that he and his girlfriend fit the stereotypes.
 ''She does all her readings for classes, and I don't always,'' Mr. Turner said. ''She's more organized than me, so if there's a paper due a week from Monday, she's already started, and I know I'll be doing it the weekend before. She studies more than I do because she doesn't like cramming and being stressed. She just has a better work ethic than I do.''
 Ms. Smyers, also at American, said she recently ended a relationship with another student, in part out of frustration over his playing video games four hours a day.
 ''He said he was thinking of trying to cut back to 15 hours a week,'' she said. ''I said, 'Fifteen hours is what I spend on my internship, and I get paid $1,300 a month.' That's my litmus test now: I won't date anyone who plays video games. It means they're choosing to do something that wastes their time and sucks the life out of them.''
 Many male students say with something resembling pride that they get by without much studying.
 ''If I take a class and never study, I can still get a B,'' said Scott Daniels, a 22-year-old at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. ''I know that if I'd applied myself more, I would have had better grades.''
 On each campus, many young men concluded that the easy B was good enough. But on each campus, some had seen that attitude backfire. 
 Michael Comes arrived at Dickinson two years ago from a private school in New Jersey where he had done well, but floundered his freshman year. 
 ''I came here with the attitudes I'd had in high school, that the big thing, for guys, is to give the appearance of not doing much work, trying to excel at sports and shine socially,'' Mr. Comes said. ''It's like some cultural A.D.D. for boys, I think -- like Bart Simpson. For men, it's just not cool to study.''
 So when he no longer had parents and teachers keeping after him, or a 10:30 p.m. lights-out rule, he did not do much work.
 ''I stayed in my room a lot, I slept a lot, and I messed up so much that I had to go to summer school,'' Mr. Comes said. ''But I'm back on track now.''

'A Male Entitlement Thing'
 On each campus, the young women interviewed talked mostly about their drive to do well. 
 ''Most college women want a high-powered career that they are passionate about,'' Ms. Smyers said. ''But they also want a family, and that probably means taking time off, and making dinner. I'm rushing through here, taking the most credits you can take without paying extra, because I want to do some amazing things, and establish myself as a career woman, before I settle down.''
 Her male classmates, she said, feel less pressure.
 ''The men don't seem to hustle as much,'' Ms. Smyers said. ''I think it's a male entitlement thing. They think they can sit back and relax and when they graduate, they'll still get a good job. They seem to think that if they have a firm handshake and speak properly, they'll be fine.''
 Such differences were apparent in the 2005 National Survey of Student Engagement. While the survey of 90,000 students at 530 institutions relies on self-reporting, it is used by many colleges to measure themselves against other institutions. 
 Men were significantly more likely than women to say they spent at least 11 hours a week relaxing or socializing, while women were more likely to say they spent at least that much time preparing for class. More men also said they frequently came to class unprepared.
 Linda Sax, an associate professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles, has found similar gender differences in her study of 17,000 men and women at 204 co-ed colleges and universities.
 Using data from U.C.L.A.'s Higher Education Research Institute annual studies, she found that men were more likely than women to skip classes, not complete their homework and not turn it in on time.
 ''Women do spend more time studying and their grades are better,'' Professor Sax said, ''but their grades are better even more than the extra studying time would account for.''
 Researchers say such differences make sense, given boys' experience in their earlier school years. And some experts argue that what is being seen as a boy problem is actually maleness itself, with the noisy, energetic antsiness and high jinks of young boys now redefined as a behavior problem by teachers who do not know how to handle them.
 There is also an economic rationale for men to take education less seriously. In the early years of a career, Laura Perna of the University of Pennsylvania has found, college increases women's earnings far more than men's.
 ''That's the trap,'' Dr. Kleinfeld said. ''In the early years, young men don't see the wage benefit. They can sell their strength and make money.''

Lingering Money Worries
 At Greensboro, where more than two-thirds of the students are female, and about one in five is black, many young men say they are torn between wanting quick money and seeking the long-term rewards of education.
 ''A lot of my friends made good money working in high school, in construction or as electricians, and they didn't go to college, but they're doing very well now,'' said Mr. Daniels, the Greensboro student, who works 25 to 30 hours a week. ''One of my best friends, he's making $70,000, he's got his own truck and health benefits. The honest truth is, I feel weird being a college student and having no money.''
 Mr. Kohn said it was, literally, an accident that he landed at Greensboro.
 ''In high school, I had a G.P.A. of 1.9 and I never took the SAT's because I knew I wasn't going to college,'' he said. ''If you don't have goals, you don't set yourself up to be disappointed.''
 But soon after high school, Mr. Kohn was in a serious car crash, and discovered in rehabilitation that the state would pay for community college. To his surprise he did well enough to transfer to Greensboro, where he now plans to pursue a master's degree. But when Mr. Kohn overheard a freshman woman describing her plans, including four summer school courses to help her get a master's in education a bit earlier, he was bemused.
 ''For a freshman to be in such a hurry, it seems a little obsessive,'' he said. 
 Many of the young women studying at Greensboro have older brothers without college degrees, or younger brothers with little interest in college.
 The seven children of the Thompson family of Oxford, N.C., embody the gender differences regarding education.
 There are three men and four women in the family, ranging in age from 36 to 23. Christina and Lynette, the two youngest, are both at Greensboro. The two oldest daughters went to college, too. But none of the sons got college degrees: one is a truck driver, one is autistic and living at home and one is a floor manager at a Research Triangle company.
 ''I think women feel more pressure to achieve,'' said Christina Thompson, a political science major who plans to go to law school.
 Right, said her youngest sister.
 ''In the past, black women in the South couldn't do much except clean, pick cotton or take care of someone's children,'' Lynette Thompson said. ''I think from our mother we got the feeling we should try to use the opportunities that are available to us now.''
 They and many other women at Greensboro say it is not bad to be on a campus with twice as many women as men because it encourages them to stick to their studies without the distraction of dating.
 Maybe, said Ashleigh Pelick, a freshman who is dating a marine she met before college -- but she teased a friend, Madison Barringer: ''You know you'll go crazy if you never have another boyfriend before you graduate.''
 Ms. Barringer, a 19-year-old whose parents did not go to college, laughed. But she did acknowledge the gender imbalance as a possible problem.
 ''I know it sounds picky, but I don't think I'd marry someone without a college degree,'' she said. ''I want to be able to have that intellectual conversation.''
 Creating a balance of men and women is now an issue for all but the most elite colleges, whose huge applicant pools let them fill their classes with any desired mix of highly-qualified men and women But for others, it is a delicate issue. Colleges want balance, both for social reasons and to ensure that they can attract a broad mix of applicants. But they do not want an atmosphere in which talented, hard-working women share classes with less qualified, less engaged men.
 The calculus is different at different institutions. By administrators' accounts, American University has been relatively unconcerned to see its student body tipping female, faster than most others.
 The admissions office said that its decisions were gender blind, and that it accepted a larger share of female applicants. In an interview, Ivy Broder, the interim provost, seemed surprised, but not bothered, that American had a higher proportion of women than Vassar College, which formerly admitted only women.
 American has no engineering school and no football team; it is a campus where the Democrats' organization is Democratic Women and Friends; ''The Vagina Monologues'' sells out at annual performances; and almost 1,000 people turned out for the Breastival, a women's health fair.
 The faculty is attracting more and more women: a majority of the professors now on the tenure track are female.
 Women on campus say there is great female solidarity. What there is not much of, said Gail Short Hanson, the director of campus life, is a dating scene.
 Said Ms. Hanson: ''If there's a dance, like the Founder's Day dance in February, do the women get their hair done? Yes. Do they get their nails done? Yes. But do they have a date? Probably not. So who do they dance with? Whoever wants to dance.''
 If American University is comfortable being largely female, that is not the case on Dickinson College's charming but isolated campus in central Pennsylvania. At a time when most colleges are becoming increasingly female, Dickinson has raised its proportion of men. Even rarer is that Dickinson has publicly discussed its quest for gender balance.

The Goal: More Male Students
 Robert Massa, vice president for enrollment, began campaigning for more male students shortly after he arrived at Dickinson in 1999 and discovered that only 36 percent of the incoming freshmen were male and that the college had accepted 73 percent of the women who applied, but only 53 percent of the men.
 Dickinson adapted to the growing female majority by starting a women's center, adding a women's studies major and offering courses on Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf.
 In his effort to attract men, Mr. Massa made sure that the admissions materials included plenty of pictures of young men and athletics. Dickinson began highlighting its new physics, computer science and math building, and started a program in international business. Most fundamental, Dickinson began accepting a larger proportion of its male applicants.
 ''The secret of getting some gender balance is that once men apply, you've got to admit them,'' Mr. Massa said. ''So did we bend a little bit? Yeah, at the margin, we did, but not to the point that we would admit guys who couldn't do the work.''
 Longtime Dickinson administrators say that at isolated campuses with their own social worlds, gender balance is especially important.
 ''When there were fewer men, the environment was not as safe for women,'' said Joyce Bylander, associate provost. ''When men were so highly prized that they could get away with things, some of them become sexual predators. It was an unhealthy atmosphere for women.''
 In education circles, Mr. Massa is sometimes accused of practicing unfair affirmative action for boys. He has a presentation called ''What's Wrong With You Guys?'' in which he says that Dickinson does not accept a greater proportion of male than female applicants, and that women still get more financial aid.
 ''Is this affirmative action?'' Mr. Massa said. ''Not in the legal sense.'' He says that admissions to a liberal arts college is more art than science, a matter of crafting a class with diverse strengths. 
 Mr. Massa reshaped Dickinson in one year. Of the freshmen admitted in 2000, 43 percent were male, and in recent years Dickinson's student body has been about 44 percent male. This year, Dickinson admitted an equal share of the male and the female applicants. 
 In the Dickinson cafeteria on a spring afternoon, the byplay between two men and two women could provide a text on gender differences. The men, Dennis Nelson and Victor Johnson, African-American football players nearing the end of their junior year, teased each other about never wanting to be seen in the library. They talked about playing ''Madden,'' a football video game, six hours a day, about how they did not spend much time on homework.
 ''A lot of women want a 4.0 average, and they'll work for it,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''I never wanted it because it's too much work to be worth it. And a lot of women, they have everything planned out for the next three years.''
 Mr. Johnson jumped in: ''Yeah, and it boggles my mind because I don't have my life planned for the next 10 minutes. Women see the long-term benefits, they take their classes seriously, and they're actively learning. We learn for tests. With us, if someone calls the night before and says there's going to be a test, we study enough for a C.''
 His female friends offered their assessment. ''They're really, really smart, and they think they don't have to work,'' Glenda Cabral said.
 But they do. After two years of good grades, Mr. Johnson this year failed Spanish and Arab-Israeli relations.
 ''He called me the night before the test and asked who Nasser was,'' Julie Younes said, rolling her eyes.
 At Dickinson, as elsewhere, men are overrepresented among the problem students. Of 33 students on probation this year, all but six were male. They account for most disciplinary actions, too.
 ''If it's outside-the-line behavior, boys are pretty much the ones doing it,'' Ms. Bylander said. ''This generation, and especially the boys, is technology-savvy but interpersonally challenged. They've been highly structured, highly programmed, with organized play groups and organized sports, and they don't know much about how to run their own lives.''

Disengagement Is Noticed
 Men are underrepresented when it comes to graduation and honors. Eighty-three percent of women who were Dickinson freshmen in 2001 graduated four years later, compared with 75 percent of the men. Dickinson women, who made up just over half of last year's graduates, got slightly more than two-thirds of the cum laude, magna and summa degrees.
 Since the process of human development crosses all borders, it makes sense that Europe, too, now has more women than men heading to college. The disengagement of young men, though, takes different forms in different cultures. Japan, over the last decade, has seen the emergence of ''hikikomori'' -- young men withdrawing to their rooms, eschewing social life for months or years on end.
 At Dickinson, some professors and administrators have begun to notice a similar withdrawal among men who arrive on campus with deficient social skills. Each year, there are several who mostly stay in their rooms, talk to no one, play video games into the wee hours and miss classes until they withdraw or flunk out.
 This spring, Rebecca Hammell, dean of freshman and sophomores, counseled one such young man to withdraw.
 ''He was in academic trouble from the start,'' Ms. Hammell said. ''He was playing games till 3, 4, 5 in the morning, in an almost compulsive way. From early in the year, his teachers reported that he was either not coming to class or falling asleep once he was there. I checked with the Residential Life office, and they said he was in his room all the time.''
 Of course, female behavior has its own extremes. In freshman women, educators worry about eating disorders and perfectionism.
 But among the freshman men, the problems stem mostly from immaturity.
 ''There was so much freedom when I got here, compared to my very structured high school life, that I kept putting things off,'' said Greg Williams, who just finished his freshman year. ''I wouldn't do much work and I played a lot of Halo. I didn't know how to wake up on time without a mom. I had laundry problems. I shrank all my clothes and had to buy new ones.''
 Still, men in the work force have always done better in pay and promotions, in part because they tend to work longer hours, and have fewer career interruptions than women, who bear the children and most of the responsibility for raising them.
 Whether the male advantage will persist even as women's academic achievement soars is an open question. But many young men believe that, once in the work world, they will prevail. 
 ''I think men do better out in the world because they care more about the power, the status, the C.E.O. job,'' Mr. Kohn said. ''And maybe society holds men a little higher.''

HEADLINE: Texas Lawsuit Includes a Mix of Race and Water

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: DeBERRY, Tex. 

 BODY:
Frank and Earnestene Roberson no longer need to drive the 23 miles to a Wal-Mart near Shreveport for a safe drink of water. 
 Instead, it is delivered to them in five-gallon jugs, courtesy of the Environmental Protection Agency.
But they and neighbors in this historically black enclave in the East Texas oilfields seem no closer to being able to drink, cook or bathe safely from their own wells since the E.P.A. found the groundwater contaminated with pollutants that included arsenic, benzene, lead and mercury. 
 Calling themselves victims of ''environmental racism,'' community members in June filed suit in federal court, accusing the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, of failing to enforce safety regulations and of ''intentionally giving citizens false information based on their race and economic status.'' 
 The commission said it had yet to receive formal notice of the lawsuit and had no comment on it. 
 But almost two decades after Mrs. Roberson first began complaining, setting off years of inconclusive state inquiries, the agency says it is now moving against a large oilfield services company that deposited wastes at a nearby disposal site that has since been closed. 
 The inspector general of the E.P.A. is also concluding a separate investigation into the handling of the problem. 
 With 30,000 oilfield waste disposal sites throughout Texas, there is no clear evidence that the community here was singled out for dumping, although residents said it followed a pattern, documented by the E.P.A., of pollution hazards that disproportionately affect minorities. 
 They said that pleas for help, including letters to President Bush, were bounced from one agency to another, and that their treatment stood in sharp contrast to a $1.7 million cleanup last summer by the railroad commission in Manvel, a largely white suburb of Houston. 
 ''They worked very fast and were very diligent,'' said Mayor Delores M. Martin of Manvel. 
 Resentment is dying hard among the Robersons and their relatives on County Road 329. They are the descendants of a black settler, George Adams, who paid $279 and a mule for 40 acres here in 1911. 
 ''This is America? It looks worse than the third world,'' said the Rev. David Hudson, the Robersons' nephew. Mr. Hudson, a retired California radio and television station manager, pointed out where wells had been plugged and where an elderly relative died last year in a home cut off from running water. 
 ''I look at this as poisoning the only source of groundwater,'' he said, ''as tantamount to lynching.'' 
 The tangled history of the disposal site, which began around 1980 as a deep injection well for saltwater wastes from drilling operations, makes apportioning blame difficult. Since then, according to records of the railroad commission, the disposal site has been under the control of six different operators. It was last operated by Basic Energy Services of Midland, which describes itself on its Web site as the nation's third largest contractor servicing oil and gas wells and used open holding tanks to store waste for pumping to a second injection well nearby. 
 The railroad commission said that Basic Energy had operated the tanks for more than two years without a permit, resulting in a demand by Panola County in 2003 that the disposal line under the county road be shut down. The commission has been asking the company to track any migration of pollution. 
 ''Basic has been slow to respond to our requests,'' said John Tintera, the commission's assistant director for site remediation.
 Ken Huseman, the president and chief executive of Basic Energy, would not respond to specific questions but said in a statement that the company's goal was to have no adverse impact on the environment, and that it would be responsive to the railroad commission. 
 But Mr. Hudson, who runs a local family ministry and teaches at the Church of the Living God, said the commission had close ties to the industry and had denied that DeBerry had a problem. 
 Mr. Hudson said he had directed his appeals, in vain, to the sole black member of the commission, Michael L. Williams, a former assistant secretary of education for civil rights at the federal Department of Education. A spokeswoman said Mr. Williams could not comment on the DeBerry case because it was ''still in enforcement.'' 
 Mr. Hudson recently settled a state civil lawsuit against Basic Energy under terms that remain confidential. ''We didn't get enough to get shoelaces,'' he said. 
 The lawsuit was settled, he said, after his lawyer found that the railroad commission had fined one of the site's operators, Falco S & D Inc. of Shreveport, La., $27,747 in 2000 for having illegally dumped about 3,000 barrels of chemical waste there. That made it difficult to determine Basic Energy's liability, Mr. Hudson said. 
 The E.P.A. has acknowledged a potential danger in the groundwater. ''We found that the groundwater in the Panola County community is indeed contaminated with several substances,'' wrote Johnny D. Ross, project manager in the Inspector General's office in a January memo. Those substances, Mr. Ross wrote, ''pose a threat to human health and the environment.''
 In 2003, the railroad commission found in residents' wells benzene, barium, arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury ''at concentrations exceeding primary drinking water standards,'' said Peter Pope, a specialist with the commission. 
 But the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, in tests taken last August, found no excessive contamination there, said Andrea Morrow, a spokeswoman. She said she could not explain the discrepancy.
 The problems go back at least to 1987 when, railroad commission records show, Mrs. Roberson began complaining of spillovers from the injection well. Her well water was discoloring her bathtub, she reported, ''and it causes bad stomach problems when consumed.'' 
 The railroad commission took samples in October 1996, finding ''no contamination in the Robersons' household supply water that can be attributed to oilfield sources.'' 
 By April 2003, however, commission tests found barium and chloride above maximum contaminant levels in Mr. Hudson's well, along with traces of two oilfield chemicals. The source was unclear. He plugged his well and moved to another house connected to the Bethany-Panola Public Water System.
 Last year, Mr. Hudson said he obtained a $375,000 federal loan to connect the community to the same municipal supply, but the water company, concerned that the residents would be unable to repay the money, rejected the application. 
 The E.P.A. arranged last August for the delivery of bottled water to the Robersons and others with tainted wells. Some residents, however, have been less fortunate. Maggie Golden, a 73-year-old cousin of Mr. Hudson's mother, had been getting water piped in by Basic Energy to replace her hand-pumped spring-fed system which had been contaminated, said her sister, Mary Lee Kellum, a Houston teacher. 
 ''Then all of a sudden they cut it off,'' Ms. Kellum said. 
 Mr. Hudson said he appealed to Basic Energy, which restored the water for about a month but then shut it off after the disposal site was closed down. They drank bottled water, but to bathe, Ms. Kellum said, ''we'd go to the church and borrow water in big barrels and heat it up: the pioneer days were back again.'' 
 Her sister died in the house on June 17, 2005, Ms. Kellum said. ''She just went to sleep during the night,'' she said. ''It was stressful stuff. She said, 'I'm tired of struggling.' ''

HEADLINE: What Does Bioinformatics Mean? To an Ailing Industrial Region, the Answer Is Jobs

BYLINE: By DAVID STABA

DATELINE: BUFFALO, July 8 

 BODY:
In the bright sterility of a laboratory, a robotic arm moves almost imperceptibly over a rack of minuscule vials, each holding one-billionth of a liter of genetic material.
 Researchers at the New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences are looking for clues to who may be most susceptible to diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer, as well as for ways to treat or prevent such illnesses.
For a region struggling to rebound from decades of decline, those microscopic specks -- and the technology that allows scientists to analyze in an hour what used to take a year -- symbolize the hope for an economy built on science rather than steel. 
 ''Maybe what we can do is take a little rust off the Rust Belt,'' said L. Wayne Schultz, a research scientist at the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, across the street from the Center of Excellence. Mr. Schultz also founded Buckler Biodefense, a spinoff company that is developing treatments for anthrax and other bioterrorism threats.
 Hauptman-Woodward, whose president is Herbert A. Hauptman, a Nobel laureate, opened its headquarters in 2005. The Center of Excellence, a venture of the University at Buffalo, opened in 2001 and moved into its new home in June. The center shares space in the new building with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, which was founded in 1898 and also occupies several other buildings nearby. The three centers, along with Buffalo General Hospital, make up the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, a gleaming collection of aluminum, glass and brick just north of the city's downtown. 
 A six-story building that covers a full city block just south of the campus once housed Trico Products, a homegrown company that started making windshield wipers in 1917 and once had three plants in the area. But Trico steadily transferred thousands of jobs to Mexico and Texas and closed its last Buffalo factory in 2004.
 Many companies, especially steel makers and other manufacturers, plied a similar route, with people following jobs out of Buffalo. The city's population plummeted to 282,864 in 2004 from 580,132 in 1950. According to the State Department of Labor, the region lost 21,300 manufacturing jobs from 2001 to 2005.
 While no one expects the new biotechnology sector to fill the gaping job void left by heavy industry, the Center of Excellence has already yielded dividends. By the end of last year, 2,386 jobs had been created at the center or with new spinoff companies, according to the center. 
 Marnie LaVigne, the center's director of business development, said 1,667 jobs had been retained because the center helped keep some companies in Buffalo or recruited new companies to replace those that left.
 The center's growth has often been obscured by the continued decline of the industrial sector. Last month, a bankruptcy judge approved a plan by the region's largest private employer, Delphi Corporation, the auto-parts maker, to reduce the work force at its plant in nearby Lockport, which employs about 3,800.
 The complexity of the science itself, which involves collecting and analyzing genetic and molecular data using supercomputers, also makes the venture somewhat abstract to many in a traditionally blue-collar city.
 ''Bioinformatics seems to be a word people remember because they don't know what it means,'' said Bruce A. Holm, the executive director of the Center of Excellence and a senior vice provost at the University at Buffalo, part of the State University of New York.
 The center, proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki in his 2001 State of the State address, has received $89.4 million from the state and $27.7 million from the federal government, along with $60 million in private investment.
 Conceived as a research facility, it has expanded into what Dr. Holm called a ''lab-bench-to-bedside approach.'' 
 That includes pairing research scientists with physicians.
 ''You approach the questions from a different viewpoint: you see what impact the research has on actual patients,'' said Steven R. Gill, an associate professor at the university who studies bacteria that cause diseases, as well as those occurring naturally in the human body. ''And that's what the research is really for: to help. Geneticists and researchers get trapped in looking at a very small question; they can have blinders on. Working with a clinician, you see the big picture.''
 The center also strives to combine science and business. Differences over its philosophy contributed to the departure of its first executive director, Jeffrey Skolnick, whom Mr. Pataki called a ''superstar'' in announcing his appointment in 2002. Late last year, Mr. Skolnick left for a post at Georgia Tech, taking 20 top researchers with him. As a result, a new recruiting campaign opened to attract 20 top scientists and their research teams.
 Dr. Holm said combining research and business had always been a goal of the center. ''If you just focus in that one area,'' Dr. Holm said of research, ''you're not going to get economic development.''
 The center's staff helps scientists and doctors to seek financing for their research and to set up their own companies to market the resulting products.
 ''Scientists tend not to be very good at running a business, and a lot of times, not very interested in it,'' Dr. Holm said. ''Once they discover something, they think the whole world will just adopt it.'' 
 So far, 15 new companies have grown out of the center, including Empire Genomics, founded by the center's director of science and technology, Norma J. Nowak, to create tests for genetic abnormalities; Buffalo BioBlower, which received a $3 million appropriation from the Defense Department to develop a system to clean contaminated air by heating and compressing it as it is blown through a rotary pump; and Pneuma Partners, a company founded by Dr. Holm that is developing an inhalant to combat respiratory failure.
 Several more companies are in the works.
 Officials said that by stressing commercialization of scientific advances, the Buffalo region could realize the benefits of discoveries. Before the center's creation, the leading medication for the treatment of multiple sclerosis was developed and tested at the University at Buffalo, but licensed to an outside company.
 ''We're not trying to be all things to everyone,'' said Ms. LaVigne, the center's business development director. ''What we're attempting to do is not only bring these technologies to market sooner, but try to retain as much economic impact as possible.''

HEADLINE: Guggenheim Foundation and Abu Dhabi Plan Museum There

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The government of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, announced yesterday that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Guggenheim Foundation to build a 300,000-square-foot museum in Abu Dhabi to be designed by Frank Gehry. 
 The museum, to be called the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, would house Modern and contemporary art and serve as the linchpin of a sprawling development in a new cultural district of Saadiyat (Arabic for ''isle of happiness''), a 10-square-mile natural island just off Abu Dhabi. 
Government officials hope that the island will become a center of vibrant activity, with residential housing, hotels, restaurants and a golf course, as well as a national museum, a classical art museum, a maritime museum, a performing arts center and a park. They predict that the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi will be completed by 2011. 
 As outlined, the museum would be the largest of the Guggenheim's outposts, 25 percent larger than the titanium-clad Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain, which Mr. Gehry also designed. ''This is an extraordinary opportunity for the Guggenheim to become involved in the Middle East,'' said Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim Foundation. ''Our challenge now is to define the next generation of Guggenheim Museums.'' 
 Since he joined the Guggenheim in 1988, Mr. Krens has been praised, criticized and imitated for his vision of creating a worldwide network of Guggenheims. Not all of his plans to open satellites by world-class architects have borne fruit. 
 A planned Guggenheim in Taiwan by the architect Zaha Hadid never materialized because the local government of Taichung could not raise the money; a proposed Guggenheim in Rio de Janeiro to be designed by Jean Nouvel was abandoned last year. The city of Guadalajara, Mexico, is struggling to raise funds for a Guggenheim created by the Mexican architect Enrique Norten. The Guggenheim and the Pompidou Center in Paris are discussing building a museum in Hong Kong. 
 Mr. Krens still seems sanguine about the economic prospects in Abu Dhabi, which has been investing considerable capital in luxury tourism to raise its international profile. ''Clearly the resources and the enthusiasm is there,'' he said.
 The development arm of Abu Dhabi's tourism authority will assume the costs of building and operating the new museum, though officials declined to put a figure on how much it would cost. Similarly, the expense and operations of Guggenheim's successful museum in Bilbao was covered by the Basque regional government there. 
 And just as the Guggenheim in New York oversees the running of Bilbao, its officials would manage the Abu Dhabi museum's programs and education initiatives. They would also oversee an acquisitions program financed by Abu Dhabi.
 Since the Guggenheim Bilbao opened in 1997, it has been a significant boost to that formerly depressed city, attracting nearly one million visitors a year. In its first five years, studies show, the museum generated more than $1 billion for the Basque region, more than 10 times the cost of the museum's construction, and some $183.4 million in local tax revenue. 
 ''For a few years now,'' Oussama al Rifahi, development director for Abu Dhabi's tourism arm, said in an interview, ''we have been working on positioning Abu Dhabi as a cultural destination.'' 
 In searching for ''the ideal partner,'' he said, he and other development officials visited the Guggenheim in New York last September to discuss the museum's philosophy and international mission. ''We found the synergy very good,'' he said. He added that the Abu Dhabi government was in talks with other cultural institutions about the development on Saadiyat but declined to give specifics.
 Like the other Guggenheim outposts, Mr. Rifahi said, the Abu Dhabi museum will focus on Modern and contemporary art, both international and regional. He said that while the institution would be ''prudent'' in pursuing acquisitions, ''we are interested in artists from all over the world -- Asia, Europe, America, as well as some of our local artists.'' 
 He said he hoped that the Gehry building would be one of a series of landmarks on the island that ''the local people can identify with.'' 
 Currently the Guggenheim owns three museums: the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue in New York; the Peggy Guggenheim Collection on the Grand Canal in Venice; and the Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in Las Vegas. 
 In addition, it provides programming and management for the Bilbao branch and for the Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin. And it shares its collections and collaborates on programming with the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. 
 The chairman of the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority, Sheik Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, said he visited Mr. Gehry at his Los Angeles office a few months ago and toured the architect's Walt Disney Concert Hall there.
 On Friday, Mr. Gehry arrived in Abu Dhabi and viewed the site of the future museum for the first time. ''It's a vast desert on the edge of the water,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It gives new meaning to the phrase 'starting from scratch.' '' 
 While Mr. Gehry said it was far too early to describe a possible design, he predicted that it would not resemble his sinuous stone, glass and titanium Bilbao. ''I don't think I repeat myself,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Immigration Equation

BYLINE: By Roger Lowenstein. 
Roger Lowenstein is a contributing writer. He has written cover articles for the magazine about Social Security and pensions.

 BODY:
The day I met George Borjas,cloistered in his office at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard while graduate students from Russia, India, China and maybe Mexico mingled in the school cafe, sipping coffee and chattering away in all their tongues, the United States Senate was hotly debating what to do about the country's immigration policy. Borjas professed to be unfazed by the goings-on in Washington. A soft-spoken man, he stressed repeatedly that his concern was not to make policy but to derive the truth. To Borjas, a Cuban immigrant and the pre-eminent scholar in his field, the truth is pretty obvious: immigrants hurt the economic prospects of the Americans they compete with. And now that the biggest contingent of immigrants are poorly educated Mexicans, they hurt poorer Americans, especially African-Americans, the most.
Borjas has been making this case -- which is based on the familiar concept of supply and demand -- for more than a decade. But the more elegantly he has made it, it seems, the less his colleagues concur. ''I think I have proved it,'' he eventually told me, admitting his frustration. ''What I don't understand is why people don't agree with me.'' 
 It turns out that Borjas's seemingly self-evident premise -- that more job seekers from abroad mean fewer opportunities, or lower wages, for native workers -- is one of the most controversial ideas in labor economics. It lies at the heart of a national debate, which has been encapsulated (if not articulated) by two very different immigration bills: one, passed by the House of Representatives, which would toughen laws against undocumented workers and probably force many of them to leave the country; and one in the Senate, a measure that would let most of them stay. 
 You can find economists to substantiate the position of either chamber, but the consensus of most is that, on balance, immigration is good for the country. Immigrants provide scarce labor, which lowers prices in much the same way global trade does. And overall, the newcomers modestly raise Americans' per capita income. But the impact is unevenly distributed; people with means pay less for taxi rides and household help while the less-affluent command lower wages and probably pay more for rent.
 The debate among economists is whether low-income workers are hurt a lot or just a little -- and over what the answer implies for U.S. policy. If you believe Borjas, the answer is troubling. A policy designed with only Americans' economic well-being in mind would admit far fewer Mexicans, who now account for about 3 in 10 immigrants. Borjas, who emigrated from Cuba in 1962, when he was 12 (and not long after soldiers burst into his family's home and ordered them at gunpoint to stand against a wall), has asserted that the issue, indeed, is ''Whom should the United States let in?'' 
 Such a bald approach carries an overtone of the ethnic selectivity that was a staple of the immigration debates a century ago. It makes many of Borjas's colleagues uncomfortable, and it is one reason that the debate is so charged. Another reason is that many of the scholars who disagree with Borjas also hail from someplace else -- like gardeners and seamstresses, a surprising number of Ph.D. economists in the U.S. are foreign-born. 
 Easily the most influential of Borjas's critics is David Card, a Canadian who teaches at Berkeley. He has said repeatedly that, from an economic standpoint, immigration is no big deal and that a lot of the opposition to it is most likely social or cultural. ''If Mexicans were taller and whiter, it would probably be a lot easier to deal with,'' he says pointedly.
 Economists in Card's camp tend to frame the issue as a puzzle -- a great economic mystery because of its very success. The puzzle is this: how is the U.S. able to absorb its immigrants so easily? 
 After all, 21 million immigrants, about 15 percent of the labor force, hold jobs in the U.S., but the country has nothing close to that many unemployed. (The actual number is only seven million.) So the majority of immigrants can't literally have ''taken'' jobs; they must be doing jobs that wouldn't have existed had the immigrants not been here. 
 The economists who agree with Card also make an intuitive point, inevitably colored by their own experience. To the Israeli-born economist whose father lived through the Holocaust or the Italian who marvels at America's ability to integrate workers from around the world, America's diversity -- its knack for synthesizing newly arrived parts into a more vibrant whole -- is a secret of its strength. To which Borjas, who sees a different synthesis at work, replies that, unlike his colleagues, the people arriving from Oaxaca, Mexico, are unlikely to ascend to a university faculty. Most of them did not finish high school. ''The trouble with the stories that American journalists write about immigration,'' he told me, ''is they all start with a story about a poor mother whose son grows up to become.. . .'' and his voice trailed off as if to suggest that whatever the particular story -- that of a C.E.O., a ballplayer or even a story like his own -- it would not prove anything about immigration. What economists aim for is to get beneath the anecdotes. Is immigration still the engine of prosperity that the history textbooks describe? Or is it a boon to business that is destroying the livelihoods of the poorest workers -- people already disadvantaged by such postmodern trends as globalization, the decline of unions and the computer? 

$( The Lopsided-Skill-Mix Problem $)
 This spring, while militias on the prowl for illegal immigrants were converging on the Arizona border and, on the other side of the political fence, immigrant protesters were taking to the streets, I sampled the academic literature and spent some time with Borjas and Card and various of their colleagues. I did not expect concurrence, but I hoped to isolate what we know about the economic effects of immigration from what is mere conjecture. The first gleaning from the Ivory Tower came as a surprise. All things being equal, more foreigners and indeed more people of any stripe do not mean either lower wages or higher unemployment. If they did, every time a baby was born, every time a newly minted graduate entered the work force, it would be bad news for the labor market. But it isn't. Those babies eat baby food; those graduates drive automobiles. 
 As Card likes to say, ''The demand curve also shifts out.'' It's jargon, but it's profound. New workers add to the supply of labor, but since they consume products and services, they add to the demand for it as well. ''Just because Los Angeles is bigger than Bakersfield doesn't mean L.A. has more unemployed than Bakersfield,'' Card observes. 
 In theory, if you added 10 percent to the population -- or even doubled it -- nothing about the labor market would change. Of course, it would take a little while for the economy to adjust. People would have to invest money and start some new businesses to hire all those newcomers. The point is, they would do it. Somebody would realize that the immigrants needed to eat and would open a restaurant; someone else would think to build them housing. Pretty soon there would be new jobs available in kitchens and on construction sites. And that has been going on since the first boat docked at Ellis Island.
 But there's a catch. Individual native workers are less likely to be affected if the immigrants resemble the society they are joining -- not physically but in the same mix of skills and educational backgrounds. For instance, if every immigrant were a doctor, the theory is, it would be bad for doctors already here. Or as Borjas asked pointedly of me, what if the U.S. created a special visa just for magazine writers? All those foreign-born writers would eat more meals, sure, but (once they mastered English, anyway), they would be supplying only one type of service -- my type. Bye-bye fancy assignments.
 During the previous immigrant wave, roughly from 1880 to 1921 (it ended when the U.S. established restrictive quotas based on country of origin), the immigrants looked pretty much like the America into which they were assimilating. At the beginning of the 20th century, 9 of 10 American adults did not have high-school diplomas, nor did the vast majority of immigrants. Those Poles and Greeks and Italians made the country more populous, but they did not much change the makeup of the labor market.
 This time it's different. The proportion of foreign-born, at 12 percent, remains below the peak of 15 percent recorded in 1890. But compared with the work force of today, however, the skill mix of immigrants is lopsided. About the same proportion have college degrees (though a higher proportion of immigrants are post-graduates). But many more -- including most of the those who have furtively slipped across the Mexican border -- don't have high-school diplomas. 
 The latest estimate is that the United States has 11.5 million undocumented foreigners, and it's those immigrants -- the illegal ones -- who have galvanized Congress. The sponsor of the House legislation, Representative James Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin, says bluntly that illegals are bad for the U.S. economy. His bill would require employers to verify the status of their workers from a national database and levy significant penalties on violators. But H.R. 4437 isn't primarily an economics bill -- it's an expression of outrage over the porousness of America's borders. Among many other enforcement measures, the bill forces the U.S. to build hundreds of miles of fencing on its Southern border. 
 The Senate bill is irreducibly complex (more than 800 pages), but basically, it seeks to cure the problem of illegals by bringing them in from the shadows. Those already here would be able to continue working and get on track toward a more normalized status. In the future, employers could bring in guest workers -- what Senate draftsmen refer to hopefully as temporary workers -- as long as they paid them the going wage. 
 This latter bill, the product of an alliance between John McCain and Edward Kennedy, isn't really an economics bill, either, at least not the way economists see it. Its premise is that if you legalize undocumented people and reinforce the borders, then whatever negative impact immigrants have on the labor market will go away. The theory is that newly minted green-card holders, no longer having deportation to fear, will stick up for their rights and for higher wages too. Interestingly, some big labor unions, like the Service Employees International Union, are supporters. But economists are skeptical. For one thing, after the U.S. gave amnesty to the nearly three million undocumented workers who were in the country in 1986, their wages didn't budge. Second, economists, as you might expect, say market forces like supply and demand, not legal status, are what determine wages. 
 It baffles some economists that Congress pays so little heed to their research, but then immigration policy has never been based on economics. Economic fears played a part in the passage of the exclusionary acts against Chinese in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and in the 1920's of quotas (aimed in particular at people from southern and eastern Europe), but they were mostly fueled by xenophobia. They were supplanted in the Civil Rights era by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended quotas and established a new priority based on family reunification. That law, also sponsored by Kennedy, had nothing to do with economics, either. It made the chief criterion for getting in having a relative who was already here. 
 If economists ran the country, they would certainly take in more immigrants who, like them, have advanced degrees. (The U.S., which is hugely dependent on foreigners to fill certain skilled occupations like scientific research and nursing, does admit a relative handful of immigrants each year on work visas.) Canada and Australia admit immigrants primarily on the basis of skills, and one thing the economists agree on is that high earners raise the national income by more than low earners. They are also less of a burden on the tax rolls. 
 With the exception of a few border states, however, the effect of immigration on public-sector budgets is small, and the notion that undocumented workers in particular abuse the system is a canard. Since many illegals pay into Social Security (using false ID numbers), they are actually subsidizing the U.S. Treasury. And fewer than 3 percent of immigrants of any stripe receive food stamps. Also, and contrary to popular wisdom, undocumented people do support local school districts, since, indirectly as renters or directly as homeowners, they pay property taxes. Since they tend to be poor, however, they contribute less than the average. One estimate is that immigrants raise state and local taxes for everyone else in the U.S. by a trivial amount in most states, but by as much as $1,100 per household per year in California. They are certainly a burden on hospitals and jails but, it should be noted, poor legal workers, including those who are native born, are also a burden on the health care system. 

$( Parsing the Wage Gap $)
 Economists focus on Mexicans not because many are undocumented but because, relative to the rest of the labor force, Mexicans have far fewer skills. And Mexicans and other Central Americans (who tend to have a similar economic background) are arriving and staying in this country at a rate of more than 500,000 a year. Their average incomes are vastly lower than those both of native-born men and of other immigrants. 
 Native-born workers: $45,400
 All immigrants: $37,000
 Mexican immigrants: $22,300 
 The reason Mexicans earn much less than most Americans is their daunting educational deficit. More than 60 percent of Mexican immigrants are dropouts; fewer than 10 percent of today's native workers are. 
 That stark contrast conveys, to economists, two important facts. One is that Mexicans are supplying a skill level that is much in demand. It doesn't just seem that Americans don't want to be hotel chambermaids, pick lettuce or repair roofs; it's true. Most gringos are too educated for that kind of work. The added diversity, the complementariness of skills, that Mexicans bring is good for the economy as a whole. They perform services that would otherwise be more expensive and in some cases simply unavailable.
 The Americans who are unskilled, however, must compete with a disproportionate number of immigrants. One of every four high-school dropouts in the U.S. was born in Mexico, an astonishing ratio given that the proportion of Mexicans in the overall labor force is only 1 in 25. So it's not magazine writers who see their numbers expanding; it's Americans who are, or would be, working in construction, restaurants, household jobs, unskilled manufacturing and so forth. 
 That's the theory. But economists have had a hard time finding evidence of actual harm. For starters, they noticed that societies with lots of immigrants tend, if anything, to be more prosperous, not less. In the U.S., wages in cities where immigrants have clustered, like New York, have tended to be higher, not lower. Mississippi, on the other hand, which has the lowest per-capita income of any state, has had very few immigrants. 
 That doesn't necessarily mean that immigrants caused or even contributed to high wages; it could be they simply go where the demand is greatest -- that their presence is an effect of high wages. As statisticians are wont to remind us, ''Correlation does not imply causation.'' (The fact that hospitals are filled with sick people doesn't mean hospitals make you sick.) Maybe without immigrants, wages in New York would be even higher. 
 And certainly, wages of the unskilled have been a source of worry for years. From 1970 to 1995, wages for high-school dropouts, the group that has been the most affected by immigrants, plummeted by more than 30 percent, after adjusting for inflation. Look at the following averages (all for male workers):
 College graduates: $73,000
 People with some college: $41,000
 High-school grads: $32,000 
 Dropouts: $24,800
 These figures demonstrate a serious problem, at least if you care about wage inequality, and a quick glance at this list and the previous one shows that native-born dropouts are earning only a shade more than Mexicans working in this country. But that hardly proves that cheap Mexican labor is to blame. For one thing, economists believe that other factors, like the failure of Congress to raise the minimum wage, globalization (cheap Chinese labor, that is) and the decline of unions are equally or even more responsible. Another popular theory is that computer technology has made skilled labor more valuable and unskilled labor less so. 
 Also, when economists look closely at wage dispersion, the picture isn't wholly consistent with the immigrants-as-culprits thesis. Look again at the numbers: people at the top (college grads) make a lot more than average but from the middle on down incomes are pretty compressed. Since only dropouts are being crowded by illegal immigrants, you would expect them to be falling further behind every other group. But they aren't; since the mid-90's, dropouts have been keeping pace with the middle; it's the corporate executives and their ilk at the top who are pulling away from the pack, a story that would seem to have little to do with immigration. 
 This isn't conclusive either, Borjas notes. After all, maybe without immigrants, dropouts would have done much better than high-school grads. Economists look for the ''counterfactual,'' or what would have happened had immigrants not come. It's difficult to tell, because in the real world, there is always a lot more going on -- an oil shock, say, or a budget deficit -- than the thing whose effect you are studying. To isolate the effect of immigrants alone would require a sort of lab experiment. The trouble with macroeconomics is you can't squeeze your subjects into a test tube. 

$( Marielitos in Miami, Doctors in Israel and Other Natural Experiments $)
 The academic study of immigration's economic effects earned little attention before the subject started to get political traction in the 1980's. Then, in 1990, Borjas, who was on the faculty at the University of California at Santa Barbara, published a book, ''Friends or Strangers,'' which was mildly critical of immigration's effects.
 That same year, David Card realized that a test tube did exist. Card decided to study the 1980 Mariel boat lift, in which 125,000 Cubans were suddenly permitted to emigrate. They arrived in South Florida with virtually no advance notice, and approximately half remained in the Miami area, joining an already-sizable Cuban community and swelling the city's labor force by 7 percent.
 To Card, this produced a ''natural experiment,'' one in which cause and effect were clearly delineated. Nothing about conditions in the Miami labor market had induced the Marielitos to emigrate; the Cubans simply left when they could and settled in the city that was closest and most familiar. So Card compared the aftershocks in Miami with the labor markets in four cities -- Tampa, Atlanta, Houston and Los Angeles -- that hadn't suddenly been injected with immigrants. 
 That the Marielitos, a small fraction of whom were career criminals, caused an upsurge in crime, as well as a more generalized anxiety among natives, is indisputable. It was also commonly assumed that the Marielitos were taking jobs from blacks. 
 But Card documented that blacks, and also other workers, in Miami actually did better than in the control cities. In 1981, the year after the boat lift, wages for Miami blacks were fractionally higher than in 1979; in the control cities, wages for blacks were down. The only negative was that unemployment rose among Cubans (a group that now included the Marielitos).
 Unemployment in all of the cities rose the following year, as the country entered a recession. But by 1985, the last year of Card's study, black unemployment in Miami had retreated to below its level of 1979, while in the control cities it remained much higher. Even among Miami's Cubans, unemployment returned to pre-Mariel levels, confirming what seemed visible to the naked eye: the Marielitos were working. Card concluded, ''The Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers.'' 
 Although Card offered some hypotheses, he couldn't fully explain his results. The city's absorption of a 7 percent influx, he wrote, was ''remarkably rapid'' and -- even if he did not quite say it -- an utter surprise. Card's Mariel study hit the cloistered world of labor economists like a thunderbolt. All of 13 pages, it was an aesthetic as well as an academic masterpiece that prompted Card's peers to look for other ''natural'' immigration experiments. Soon after, Jennifer Hunt, an Australian-born Ph.D. candidate at Harvard, published a study on the effects of the return migration of ethnic French from Algeria to France in 1962, the year of Algerian independence. Similar in spirit though slightly more negative than the Mariel study, Hunt found that the French retour had a very mild upward effect on unemployment and no significant effect on wages. 
 Rachel Friedberg, an economist at Brown, added an interesting twist to the approach. Rather than compare the effect of immigration across cities, she compared it across various occupations. Friedberg's curiosity had been piqued in childhood; born in Israel, she moved to the U.S. as an infant and grew up amid refugee grandparents who were a constant reminder of the immigrant experience. 
 She focused on an another natural experiment -- the exodus of 600,000 Russian Jews to Israel, which increased the population by 14 percent in the early 1990's. She wanted to see if Israelis who worked in occupations in which the Russians were heavily represented had lost ground relative to other Israelis. And in fact, they had. But that didn't settle the issue. What if, Friedberg wondered, the Russians had entered less-attractive fields precisely because, as immigrants, they were at the bottom of the pecking order and hadn't been able to find better work? And in fact, she concluded that the Russians hadn't caused wage growth to slacken; they had merely gravitated to positions that were less attractive. Indeed, Friedberg's conclusion was counterintuitive: the Russians had, if anything, improved wages of native Israelis. She hypothesized that the immigrants competed more with one another than with natives. The Russians became garage mechanics; Israelis ran the garages.

$( Measuring the Hit to Wages $)
 By the mid-90's, illegal immigration was heating up as an issue in the United States, prompting a reaction in California, where schools and other public services were beginning to feel a strain. But academics were coalescing around the view that immigration was essentially benign -- that it depressed unskilled native wages by a little and raised the average native income by a little. In 1997, a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, which reviewed all of the literature, estimated that immigration during the previous decade had, at most, lowered unskilled-native wages by 1 percent to 2 percent. 
 Borjas didn't buy it. In 1999 he published a second, more strident book, ''Heaven's Door.'' It espoused a ''revisionist'' view -- that immigration caused real harm to lower-income Americans. Borjas argued that localized studies like Mariel were flawed, for the simple reason that labor markets in the U.S. are linked together. Therefore, the effects of immigration could not be gauged by comparing one city with another. 
 Borjas pointed out, as did others, that more native-born Americans started migrating out of California in the 1970's, just as Mexicans began arriving in big numbers. Previously California was a destination for Americans. Borjas reckoned that immigrants were pushing out native-born Americans, and that the effect of all the new foreigners was dispersed around the country. 
 The evidence of a labor surplus seemed everywhere. ''If you wanted a maid,'' he recalled of California during the 90's, ''all you had to do was tell your gardener, and you had one tomorrow.'' He felt certain that Mexicans were depressing unskilled wages but didn't know how to prove it. 
 After Borjas moved East, he had an inspiration. It was easy to show that high-school dropouts had experienced both lower wage growth and more competition from immigrants, but that didn't settle the point, because so many other factors could have explained why dropouts did poorly. The inspiration was that people compete not only against those with a like education, but also against workers of roughly the same experience. Someone looking for a first job at a McDonald's competes against other unskilled entry-level job seekers. A reporter with 15 years' experience who is vying for a promotion will compete against other veterans but not against candidates fresh out of journalism school.
 This insight enabled Borjas to break down the Census data in a way that put his thesis to a more rigorous test. He could represent skill groups within each age as a point on a graph. There was one point for dropouts who were 10 years out of school, another for those who were 20 years and 30 years out. Each of these points was repeated for each decade from 1960 to 2000. And there was a similar set of points for high-school graduates, college graduates and so forth. The points were situated on the graph according to two variables: the horizontal axis measured the change in the share of immigrants within each ''point,'' the vertical axis measured wage growth. 
 A result was a smattering of dots that on casual inspection might have resembled a work of abstract art. But looking closer, the dots had a direction: they pointed downward. Using a computer, Borjas measured the slope: it suggested that wages fell by 3 to 4 percent for each 10 percent increase in the share of immigrants.
 With this graph, Borjas could calculate that, during the 80's and 90's, for instance, immigrants caused dropouts to suffer a 5 percent decline relative to college graduates. In a paper published in 2003, ''The Labor Demand Curve Is Downward Sloping,'' Borjas termed the results ''negative and significant.''
 But what about the absolute effect? Assuming businesses did not hire any of the new immigrants, Borjas's finding would translate to a hefty 9 percent wage loss for the unskilled over those two decades, and lesser declines for other groups (which also received some immigrants). As we know, however, as the population grows, demand rises and business do hire more workers. When Borjas adjusted for this hiring, high-school dropouts were still left with a wage loss of 5 percent over those two decades, some $1,200 a year. Other groups, however, showed a very slight gain. To many economists as well as lay folk, Borjas's findings confirmed what seemed intuitive all along: add to the supply of labor, and the price goes down. 
 To Card, however, what seems ''intuitive'' is often suspect. He became a labor economist because the field is full of anomalies. ''The simple-minded theories that they teach you in economics don't work'' for the labor market, he told me. In the 90's, Card won the prestigious Clark Medal for several studies, including Mariel and another showing that, contrary to theory, raising the minimum wage in New Jersey (another natural experiment) did not cause fast-food outlets to cut back on employment. 
 In a recent paper, ''Is the New Immigration Really So Bad?'' Card took indirect aim at Borjas and, once again, plumbed a labor-market surprise. Despite the recent onslaught of immigrants, he pointed out, U.S. cities still have fewer unskilled workers than they had in 1980. Immigrants may be depriving native dropouts of the scarcity value they might have enjoyed, but at least in a historical sense, unskilled labor is not in surplus. America has become so educated that immigrants merely mitigate some of the decline in the homegrown unskilled population. Thus, in 1980, 24 percent of the work force in metropolitan areas were dropouts; in 2000, only 18 percent were. 
 Card also observed that cities with more immigrants, like those in the Sun Belt close to the Mexican border, have a far higher proportion of dropouts. This has led to a weird unbalancing of local labor markets. For example, 10 percent of the work force in Pittsburgh and 15 percent in Cleveland are high-school dropouts; in Houston the figure is 25 percent, in Los Angeles, 30 percent. The immigrants aren't dispersing, or not very quickly. 
 So where do all the dropouts work? Los Angeles does have a lot of apparel manufacturers but not enough of such immigrant-intensive businesses to account for all of its unskilled workers. Studies also suggest that immigration is correlated with a slight increase in unemployment. But again, the effect is small. So the mystery is how cities absorb so many unskilled. Card's theory is that the same businesses operate differently when immigrants are present; they spend less on machines and more on labor. Still, he admitted, ''We are left with the puzzle of explaining the remarkable flexibility of employment demand.'' 
 Card started thinking about this when he moved from Princeton in the mid-90's. He noticed that everyone in Berkeley seemed to have a gardener, ''even though professors are not rich.'' In the U.S., which has more unskilled labor than Europe, more people employ housecleaners. The African-American women who held those jobs before the war, like the Salvadorans and Guatemalans of today, weren't taking jobs; they were creating them. 

$( The Personal Is Economic $)
 Though Card works on immigration only some of the time, he and Borjas clearly have become rivals. In a recent paper, Card made a point of referring to the ''revisionist'' view as ''overly pessimistic.'' Borjas told Business Week that Card's ideas were ''insane.'' (''Obviously I didn't mean he is insane; he is a very bright guy,'' Borjas clarified when we talked. ''The idea that you can add 15 or 20 million people and not have any effect seems crazy.'') Alan B. Krueger, an economist who is friendly with each, says, ''I fear it might become acrimonious.'' Card told me twice that Borjas's calculations were ''disingenuous.'' ''Borjas has a strong view on this topic,'' Card said, ''almost an emotional position.'' 
 Card is more comfortable with anecdote than many scholars, and he tells a story about his wife, who teaches English to Mexicans. In one class, she tapped on a wall, asking a student to identify it, and the guy said, ''That's drywall.'' To Card, it signifies that construction is one of those fields that soak up a disproportionate number of Mexicans; it's a little piece of the puzzle. ''Even when I was a kid in Ontario 45 years ago,'' he notes, ''the tobacco pickers were Jamaicans. They were terrible jobs -- backbreaking.'' Card is a political liberal with thinning auburn air and a controlled, smirky smile. His prejudices, if not his emotions, favor immigrants. Raised by dairy farmers in Guelph, Ontario, he remembers that Canadian cities were mostly boring while he was growing up. The ones that attracted immigrants, like Toronto and Vancouver, boomed and became more cosmopolitan.
 ''Everyone knows in trade there are winners and losers,'' Card says. ''For some reason it doesn't stop people from advocating free trade.'' He could have said the same of Wal-Mart, which has put plenty of Mom-and-Pop retailers out of business. In fact, any time a firm offers better or more efficient service, somebody will suffer. But the economy grows as a result. 
 ''I honestly think the economic arguments are second order,'' Card told me when we discussed immigration. ''They are almost irrelevant.''
 Card's implication is that darker forces -- ethnic prejudice, maybe, or fear of social disruption -- is what's really motivating a lot of anti-immigrant sentiment. Borjas, a Hispanic who has written in blunt terms about the skill deficits of Mexicans, in particular arouses resentment. ''Mexicans aren't as good as Cubans like him,'' Douglas S. Massey, a demographer at Princeton, said in a pointed swipe. 
 Borjas lives an assimilated life. He has a wife who speaks no Spanish, three kids, two of whom study his mother tongue as a foreign language, and a home in Lexington, a tony Boston suburb. Yet his mind-set often struck me as that of an outsider -- an immigrant, if you will, to his own profession. 
 When I asked the inevitable question -- did his exile experience influence his choice of career? -- he said, ''Clearly it predisposed me.'' The seeds of the maverick scholar were planted the year before he left Cuba, a searing time when the revolution was swinging decisively toward Soviet-style communism. His family had owned a small factory that manufactured men's pants. The factory was shut down, and the family made ready to leave the island, but their departure was delayed by the death of Borjas's father. The son had to attend a revolutionary school, where the precepts of Marxism-Leninism were drilled into the future economist with notable lack of success. One day he marched in the band and drummed the ''Internationale'' in front of Fidel Castro and the visiting Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut. ''Since that year I have been incredibly resistant to any kind of indoctrination,'' he told me -- an attitude that surfaces in wry references to the liberal Harvard environs as the ''People's Republic of Cambridge'' and to American political correctness in general.
 Borjas's family arrived with virtually no money; they got some clothing from Catholic Charities and a one-time stipend of, as he recollects, $100. His mother got a factory job in Miami, where they stayed several years. Then the family moved to New Jersey. He attended Saint Peter's College in Jersey City and got his Ph.D. at Columbia. 
 I asked him whether the fact that he was Cuban, the most successful Latin subgroup, had affected his views of other Hispanics. ''Look, I've never been psychoanalyzed,'' he said with an air of resignation, as if he were accustomed to hearing such loaded questions. One thing Borjas shares with Card is a view that others treat immigration emotionally. But Borjas takes comfort not in anecdote but in empiricism. As he said to me often, ''The data is the data.''

$( Immigrants Can Be Complementary $)
 Economists on Card's side of the debate recognize that they at least have to deal with Borjas's data -- to reconcile why the local studies and national studies produce different results. Card shrugs it off; even 5 percent for a dropout, he observes, is only 50 to 60 cents an hour. Giovanni Peri, an Italian working at the University of California, Davis, had a more intriguing response. Peri replicated Borjas's scatter diagram, and also his finding that unskilled natives suffer a loss relative to, say, graduates. He made different assumptions, however, about how businesses adjust to the influx of new workers, and as a result, he found that the absolute harm was less, or the gain was greater, for all native-born groups. By his reckoning, native dropouts lost only 1 percent of their income during the 1990's.
 Peri's theory is that most of the wage losses are sustained by previous immigrants, because immigrants compete most directly with one another. It's a principle of economics that a surplus in one part of the production scheme raises the demand for every other one. For instance, if you have a big influx of chefs, you can use more waiters, pushing up their wages; if you have a lot of chefs and waiters, you need more Sub-Zeros, so investment will also rise. The only ones hurt, in this example, are the homegrown chefs -- the people who are ''like'' the immigrants. 
 Indeed, workers who are unlike immigrants see a net gain; more foreign doctors increases the demand for native hospital administrators. Borjas assumes that a native dropout (or a native anything) is interchangeable with an immigrant of the same skill level. Peri doesn't. If enough Mexicans go into construction, some native workers may be hurt, but a few will get promotions, because with more crews working there will be a greater demand for foremen, who most likely will be natives. 
 Natives have a different mix of skills -- English, for instance, or knowledge of the landscape. In economists' lingo, foreigners are not ''perfect substitutes.'' (Friedberg also observed this in Israel.) In some cases, they will complement rather than compete with native workers. Vietnamese manicurists in California cater to a lower-price, less-exclusive market than native-run salons. The particular skills of an Italian designer -- or even an economist -- are distinct from an American's. ''My work is autobiographical to a large extent,'' notes Peri, who got into the field when the Italian government commissioned him to study why Italy was losing so many professionals. The foreigners he sees in California are a boon to the U.S. It astonishes him how people like Sensenbrenner want to restrict immigration and apply the letter of the law against those working here. 
 This is a very romantic view. The issue is not so much Italian designers as Mexican dropouts. But many Mexicans work jobs that are unappealing to most Americans; in this sense, they are not exactly like natives of their skill level either. Mexicans have replenished some occupations that would have become underpopulated; for instance, 40,000 people who became meat processors immigrated to the U.S. during the 1990's, shoring up the industry. Without them, some plants would have raised wages, but others would have closed or, indeed, relocated to Mexico. 

$( Are All Dropouts the Same? $)
 I talked to half a dozen vintners and a like number of roofing-company owners, both fields that rely on Mexican labor, and frequently heard that Americans do not, in sufficient numbers, want the work. In the case of the vineyards, if Mexicans weren't available, some of the grapes would be harvested by machine. This is what economists mean by ''capital adjusting.'' If the human skills are there, capital will find a way to employ them. Over the short term, people chase jobs, but over the long term jobs chase people. (That is why software firms locate in Silicon Valley.)
 If you talk to enough employers, you start to gather that they prefer immigrant labor over unskilled Americans. The former have fewer problems with tardiness, a better work ethic. Some of this may be prejudice. But it's possible that Mexican dropouts may be better workers than our dropouts. In Mexico, not finishing high school is the norm; it's not associated with an unsuitability for work or even especially with failure. In the U.S., where the great majority do graduate, those who don't graduate have high rates of drug use and problems with the law. 
 The issue is charged because the group with by far the highest rate of incarceration is African-American dropouts. Approximately 20 percent of black males without high-school diplomas are in jail. Indeed, according to Steven Raphael, a colleague of Card's at Berkeley, the correlation between wages and immigration is a lot weaker if you control for the fact that so many black men are in prison. But should you control for it? Borjas says he thinks not. It's pretty well established that as the reward for legal work diminishes, some people turn to crime. This is why people sold crack; the payoff was tremendous. Borjas has developed one of his graphs to show that the presence of immigrants is correlated with doing time, especially among African-Americans. Incarceration rates, he notes, rose sharply in the 70's, just as immigration did. He doesn't pretend that this is the whole explanation -- only that there is a link. Card retorts: ''The idea that the way to help the lot of African-Americans is to restrict Mexicans is ridiculous.'' Black leaders have themselves mostly switched sides. In the 20's, A. Philip Randolph, who led the Pullman Porters, spoke in favor of immigration quotas, but the civil rights establishment no longer treats immigration as a big issue; instead it tends to look at immigrants as potential constituents. (One person who takes issue with the prevailing view is Anthony W. Williams, an African-American pastor in Chicago who is running for Congress against Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. Black leaders have forsaken their mission, he told me. ''Immigration will destroy the economic base of the African-American community.'')
 In the spring, as the Senate Judiciary Committee was trying to parse these issues into a piece of legislation, Borjas and Card were invited to air their views. Each declined, in part because they don't think politicians really listen. As if to prove the point, the effort to write a joint bill has stalled, following Sensenbrenner's announcement that the House intends to stage a series of public hearings on immigration around the country over the summer. There will be a lot said about border control, many heartfelt stories and probably very little about natural experiments. 
 The economists do have political opinions, of course. Borjas leans to a system like Canada's, which would admit immigrants on the basis of skills. He also says that, to make sure the problem of illegals does not recur, the U.S. should secure its borders before it adjusts the status of its present illegals. 
 Advocates of a more open policy often cite the country's history. They argue that the racists of bygone eras were not only discriminatory but also wrong. Card, for instance, mentioned an article penned by a future U.S. senator, Paul Douglas, titled ''Is the New Immigration More Unskilled Than the Old?'' It was written in 1919, when many people (though not Douglas) held that Jews, Slavs and Italians were incompatible with the country's Anglo and Teutonic stock. Nativism has always been part of the American scene, and it has tended to turn ugly in periods when the country was tired of or suspicious of foreigners. In 1952, quotas were maintained in a law sponsored by Senator Pat McCarran, a prominent McCarthyite. There remains today a palpable strain of xenophobia in the anti-immigrant movement. Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, remarked to me, rather meanly, ''If someone comes here from China and they go swimming in a dangerous river, a sign in English is enough, but the Mexicans want it in Spanish.'' Ninety years ago, some signs were in German, as were 500 newspapers on American soil.
 But U.S. history, as Borjas observes, can be read in two ways. For sure, earlier waves of immigrants assimilated, but America essentially closed the gate for 40 years. Antipathy toward Germans during World War I forced German-Americans to hide all traces of their origins. The quotas of the 1920's were reinforced by the Depression and then by World War II. The country had time to let assimilation occur. 
 A reverse process seems to be occurring with Mexican-Americans. Very few Mexicans came north in the decades after 1920, even though they were relatively free to do so. As recently as 1970, the U.S. had fewer than one million Mexicans, almost all of them in Texas and California. The U.S. did bring Mexican braceros to work on farms during the 1940's, 50's and 60's. The program was terminated in 1964, and immigration officials immediately noticed a sharp rise in illicit border crossings. The collapse of the Mexican economy in the 70's gave migrants a further push. Finally, Mexicans who obtained legal status were (thanks to the 1965 reform) able to bring in family members. 
 The important point is that, ultimately, there was a catalytic effect -- so many Mexicans settled here that it became easier for more Mexicans to follow. One story has it that in a village in central Mexico people knew the price of mushrooms in Pennsylvania sooner than people in the next county over. Even if apocryphal, it illustrates what economists call a network effect: with 12 million people born in Mexico now dispersed around the U.S., information about job-market conditions filters back to Mexico with remarkable speed.
 Now that the network is established, the exodus feels rather permanent; it is not a wave but a continuous flow. This has led to understandable anxiety, even among economists, about whether Mexicans will assimilate as rapidly as previous groups. Although second-generation Mexicans do (overwhelmingly) speak English, and also graduate from high school at far higher rates than their parents, Borjas has documented what he calls an ethnic ''half-life'' of immigrant groups: with each generation, members of the group retain half of the income and educational deficit (or advantage) of their parents. In other words, each group tends toward the mean, but the process is slow. Last year he wrote that Mexicans in America are burdened if not doomed by their ''ethnic capital,'' and will be for several generations. In ''Heaven's Door,'' Borjas even wrote forgivingly of the quota system enacted in the 20's, observing that it ''was not born out of thin air; it was the political consensus. . .reached after 30 years of debate.'' These are distasteful words to many people. But Borjas does not advocate a return to quotas. His point is that Americans shouldn't kid themselves: ''National origin and immigrant skills are so intimately related, any attempt to change one will inevitably change the other.'' 

$( The Limits of Economics $)
 Economists more in the mainstream generally agree that the U.S. should take in more skilled immigrants; it's the issue of the unskilled that is tricky. Many say that unskilled labor is needed and that the U.S. could better help its native unskilled by other means (like raising the minimum wage or expanding job training) than by building a wall. None believe, however, that the U.S. can get by with no limits. Richard B. Freeman of Harvard floated the idea that the U.S. simply sell visas at a reasonable price. The fee could be adjusted according to indicators like the unemployment rate. It is unlikely that Congress will go for anything so cute, and the economists' specific prescriptions may be beside the point. As they acknowledge, immigration policy responds to a host of factors -- cultural, political and social as well as economic. Migrant workers, sometimes just by crowding an uncustomary allotment of people into a single dwelling, bring a bit of disorder to our civic life; such concerns, though beyond the economists' range, are properly part of the debate. 
 What the economists can do is frame a subset of the important issues. They remind us, first, that the legislated goal of U.S. policy is curiously disconnected from economics. Indeed, the flow of illegals is the market's signal that the current legal limits are too low. Immigrants do help the economy; they are fuel for growth cities like Las Vegas and a salve to older cities that have suffered native flight. Borjas's research strongly suggests that native unskilled workers pay a price: in wages, in their ability to find inviting areas to migrate to and perhaps in employment. But the price is probably a small one. 
 The disconnect between Borjas's results and Card's hints that there is an alchemy that occurs when immigrants land ashore; the economy's potential for absorbing and also adapting is mysterious but powerful. Like any form of economic change, immigration causes distress and disruption to some. But America has always thrived on dynamic transformations that produce winners as well as losers. Such transformations stimulate growth. Other societies (like those in Europe) have opted for more controls, on immigration and on labor markets generally. They have more stability and more equality, but less growth and fewer jobs. Economists have highlighted these issues, but they cannot decide them. Their resolution depends on a question that Card posed but that the public has not yet come to terms with: ''What is it that immigration policy is supposed to achieve?''

HEADLINE: A Time To Play Some Defense

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
A LIGHT week for economic data and corporate earnings announcements leaves time for investors to plot their moves for the summer and beyond. Strategists at a couple of big investment banks recommend tinkering with portfolios to make them more defensive. 
 Richard Bernstein at Merrill Lynch says he expects slower global economic growth as other central banks join the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates. That prompted him to suggest in a note to Merrill clients that ''longer-term investors should continue to build positions in higher-quality equity and fixed-income issues.''
Tobias Levkovich at Citigroup says he is not turning more defensive per se. He just prefers to buy stocks in sectors regarded as defensive for stable earnings streams that could come in handy if economic growth becomes harder to see on the horizon.
 Mr. Levkovich favors purchases in health care, telecommunications services and retailing of consumer basics, three types of companies that have an easier time separating individuals from their money when conditions are less buoyant.
 Referring to retailers of food and personal items, he said, ''Some of our concerns about a slowdown in second-half consumer spending tied to Fed influences, higher energy prices and a weaker equity market are likely to have less impact on this group's stock prices.''
 To make room for these investments, he suggested lightening up on shares of capital goods manufacturers and insurers.
 Mr. Levkovich's ideas overlap with those of Mr. Bernstein, who advised a short-term, tactical shift into drug makers, diversified telecoms and media companies. Two sectors that worry him, because of valuations he considers excessive, are utilities and energy, although energy appears more promising in the long term, he said.
 In keeping with his longer-term focus on defensive stocks, Mr. Bernstein encouraged investors to emphasize larger companies with high dividend yields. He suspects that the dollar will continue to weaken, so he recommended buying foreign stocks, too.
 While he expects Wall Street to turn more defensive, Mr. Bernstein stressed that he did not expect it to run scared.
 ''Over all, the earnings upturn that has been in force for the past few years is likely to remain intact,'' he wrote. ''That ought to help buttress the market if volatility picks up in the months ahead, as we think it will.''

DATA WATCH -- A highlight of the economic calendar may be the May trade deficit report, on Wednesday. A Bloomberg News poll looks for a deficit of $64.9 billion, up from $63.4 billion in April. A University of Michigan report Friday is expected to show a bit more consumer confidence this month than last: a reading of 85.4, up from 84.9.

HEADLINE: Dominoes Can Fall On Emerging Markets 

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
SHARP drops occur often in emerging stock markets, although they seem to come as a shock every time. Rather than arising like a bolt from the blue, however, they often result from self-inflicted injuries after missteps in political or economic policy.
 Many investment advisers have found the recent plunge surprising, however, because its origins were imported. There is no Asia, Russia or peso crisis, and not even a new variation like a bird-flu or Venezuelan-populism crisis.
Emerging markets, many of which declined 25 percent or more in the course of a few weeks, are widely seen as innocent victims of deteriorating conditions in more mature economies. The potential for slower growth from rising interest rates and inflation -- in Europe and especially in the United States, where the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have been raising rates for many months -- hurts emerging markets, global fund managers say; it stirs fears that demand for their exports will fall and reduces investor appetite for risk.
 Those twin concerns are enough for some fund managers to give developing stock markets a wide berth. But others are embracing them, pointing to suddenly cheaper valuations and to greater economic diversification, which they say will inoculate these markets from any but the worst international slowdown. 
 ''This is not an emerging-markets event, it's a U.S., Bernanke, oil-price event,'' said Arjun Divecha, a fund manager at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company. 
 Those factors ''have caused risk aversion to go up,'' Mr. Divecha said. ''People are pulling money from what they consider to be risky places. But that's a misevaluation. Emerging markets are where you've got domestic growth.''
 Still, he said, a decline was not out of order after a three-year climb of more than 200 percent, especially when a wide array of markets around the world were falling.
 In the second quarter, diversified emerging-market funds lost 5.1 percent. The decline erased some of their return over the last year, but investors in just about anything else would be happy to take what is left: the average emerging-market fund rose 34.3 percent in the 12 months through June.
 Mr. Divecha said he and his colleagues had lightened their holdings as the advance matured and valuations became too high. But after the steep, swift decline, some buying opportunities may arise soon, he said. ''We still think fundamentals are very, very good,'' he said, ''so if prices go down, it makes them more attractive.''
 Mr. Divecha is a top-down value investor: ''Our philosophy first is to pick countries, and we look for cheapness more than anything else,'' he explained. He said his favorite places now were Brazil and Taiwan.
 The appeal of Brazil is its very high interest rates, relative to inflation. (Its equivalent of the federal funds rate is 16 percent, he said, while inflation is 5 percent.) He expects rates to decline, which would benefit banks in particular.
 His preferred sector in Taiwan is technology, which he finds a bargain, trading at 12 times earnings and offering an average dividend yield of 4 percent. Investors are shunning Taiwan technology companies out of fear that China will usurp their business, but he noted that many mainland Chinese manufacturers were owned by Taiwanese companies.
 With so much Taiwanese production outsourced, valuations should be higher, not lower, in Mr. Divecha's opinion. ''The market has got that fundamentally wrong,'' he said.
 George Greig, manager of the William Blair International Growth fund, said that emerging markets had reached ''really precarious valuations all over the world,'' but that the decline had corrected much of the imbalance. ''Certainly the markets where we were most concerned about valuations three months ago -- India, Brazil, Eastern Europe -- are all much more attractive now,'' he said.
 Mr. Greig's biggest emerging-market exposure is to Asia, especially China and India. He is also heavily invested in Brazil and South Africa.
 His favorite holdings in India include the industrial company Bharat Forge and the Housing Development Finance Corporation. In South Africa, he likes Sasol, which he described as ''a very inexpensive energy stock at a time when these stocks are still doing pretty well.''
 His Brazilian positions include the energy company Petrobras and a play on domestic consumption, Natura Cosmetics.
 Hugh Young, head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, has been a fan of emerging markets for many years. Unlike Mr. Divecha and Mr. Greig, he does not think that the decline, as severe as it has been, has sufficiently worked off the extremes.
 ''This is the correction we've been looking for all year,'' Mr. Young said. ''Emerging markets simply have been too strong, and with interest-rate, energy, inflation and growth fears, a fall was to be expected. Now it's up to earnings to catch up -- maybe in a year -- before markets rise again.''
 In the meantime, he finds some emerging-market stocks worth keeping. Among his favorites are Siam Cement in Thailand; the phone service provider China Mobile; Housing Development Finance (one of the Indian companies Mr. Greig mentioned); Samsung Electronics in South Korea; and Ayala Land, a developer in the Philippines.
 Earnings growth in emerging markets will depend to some extent on economic conditions in the developed world, where many customers for their exports live. Asian economies in particular rely on foreign trade, and they have borne the brunt of the decline in share prices.
 ''The fundamental concern is that Asia is still predominantly export-led and that a slowdown in export demand represents a risk to the markets,'' said Edmund Harriss, manager of the Guinness Atkinson Asia Focus fund. But that fear may be unwarranted, he said, for countries that have developed thriving domestic economies and whose stock markets have declined sharply nevertheless.
 ''There's a consumer story that can stand up on its own in China and India and probably in Korea,'' Mr. Harriss said. He conceded, though, that ''for the rest, exports are still an important part of Asia's prospects.''
 His favorite stocks come from consumer, technology and heavy industrial companies. He expressed enthusiasm for the Hong Kong clothing retailer Esprit Holdings. ''I just love that company,'' he said.
 Two Taiwan technology holdings are Hon Hai Precision Industry and High Tech Computer. They may be vulnerable to a slowdown in American spending, but Mr. Harriss said their bosses had the ability to navigate through such a problem.
 ''Even if they hit the skids,'' he said, ''they've got the management depth and skills to say: 'This is where the problem is. We're going to do this and this.' ''
 Other stocks he highlighted are Pohang Iron and Steel of Korea; Denway Motors, a Chinese maker of Honda cars; and the Chinese energy producers PetroChina and Cnooc.
 Another Asia specialist, Mark W. Headley, president of Matthews International Capital Management, is betting heavily on growth in the region's domestic economy. His portfolios include Cipla, an Indian maker of generic drugs, and Agile Property Holdings, a developer in China.
 THE growth of domestic economies has made emerging markets less dependent on the developed world, but not independent, Mr. Headley cautioned.
 ''Domestic consumption is sustainable, even in the face of a U.S. slowdown,'' he said. If the economy in the United States collapses, however, all bets are off, he said. 
 Mr. Divecha warned ofa small chance that the decline in emerging markets was the financial equivalent of ''a canary in a coal mine'' and that economies ''are on the cusp of something really big globally.'' If so, he said, ''I don't think we'll know for a year or two.''
 Mr. Greig takes a more benign view of the decline, saying it may not seem so scary to investors of the future when they peer back. He recalled several sharp drops in American stocks in the 1980's.
 ''If you looked backward from the late 1990's at the charts, you couldn't even see those pullbacks,'' he said. ''I see this as the same sort of episode in the evolution of emerging markets. There is a lot of growth still to go for.''

HEADLINE: U.S. TO NEGOTIATE RUSSIAN STORAGE OF ATOMIC WASTE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and JIM RUTENBERG; C. J. Chivers contributed reporting from Moscow for this article, and Matthew L. Wald from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said Saturday that it would open formal negotiations with Russia on a long-discussed civilian nuclear agreement that would pave the way for Russia to become one of the world's largest repositories of spent nuclear fuel. 
 President Vladimir V. Putin has been looking to expand the country's role in the multibillion nuclear power business. The United States has traditionally opposed any such arrangement, in part because of concerns about the safety of Russian nuclear facilities, and because the country has helped Iran build its first major nuclear reactor.
But administration officials said that once Mr. Bush endorsed Mr. Putin's proposal last year for Iran to conduct uranium enrichment inside Russia -- rather than in Iran, where the administration fears it would be diverted to weapons -- it made little sense to bar ordinary civilian nuclear exchanges with Russia. 
 In announcing the change of course, the White House made it clear that in return, it expected Mr. Putin's cooperation in what promises to be a tense confrontation with Iran on forcing it to give up the enrichment of uranium. Mr. Bush has charged that the enrichment is intended to feed a secret nuclear weapons program. ''We have made clear to Russia that for an agreement on peaceful nuke cooperation to go forward, we will need active cooperation in blocking Iran's attempts to obtain nuclear weapons,'' said Peter Watkins, a White House spokesman.
 So far, Russia has backed the United States in its fundamental demands but balked at the imposition of sanctions or the passage of any United Nations Security Council resolution that Mr. Bush could later use as a justification for military action.
 The Washington Post first reported the shift on Saturday.
 A spokesman for Mr. Putin declined to comment. But Sergei G. Novikov, a spokesman for Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, said in a telephone interview that Russia and the United States had been talking about the subject in recent months.
 He added that he did not expect that an agreement would be signed during the Group of 8 summit meeting in St. Petersburg next weekend, but rather that Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin might issue a vaguely worded statement on increased nuclear cooperation, and then instruct their governments to work on an agreement that might lift the current restrictions. The United States has similar deals with a variety of nations, including China.
 If such a statement is issued, Mr. Novikov said, negotiations on the details would probably take at least several months. ''I would rather not talk about any expectations, so as not to experience any frustration should they not come true,'' he said. 
 For Mr. Bush, an accord could help solve two problems: where to send a growing stockpile of waste from nuclear fuel that originated in the United States, and how to keep Russia on board in pressuring Iran to give up its uranium enrichment programs.
 Under American law, the United States retains control over nuclear fuel, and nuclear waste, made from uranium that originated in the United States. As a result it has barred South Korea, Taiwan and other states that bought American fuel from transferring it to Russia, which changed its laws several years ago to enter the multibillion dollar business of storing nuclear waste. The proposed agreement does not appear to be intended to allow storage in Russia of waste from reactors in the United States.
 But a negotiation would also help provide Mr. Putin with an economic incentive for giving up nuclear aid to Iran, which has long been one of the Bush administration's objectives. On Friday, in Chicago, Mr. Bush alluded to the difficulty in getting Russia and China to join in sanctions against Iran or North Korea.
 ''You know, some nations are more comfortable with sanctions than other nations, and part of the issue we face in some of these countries is that they've got economic interests,'' Mr. Bush told reporters. 
 In two previous trips to St. Petersburg as president, Mr. Bush tried to persuade Mr. Putin to give up a lucrative contract to supply the reactors to Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant. But Russia resisted, and eventually Mr. Bush accepted a deal in which any nuclear fuel Russia sells to Iran would have to be returned to Russia after use, so that plutonium could not be removed from the waste for military use. 
 Congress would have the right to review any agreement. But since the administration just concluded an accord with India, which requires a more intensive nuclear review, administration officials said they thought Russia would win approval. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a regular administration critic, offered tentative approval of the idea. ''While the devil is certainly in the details, given that our greatest danger right now is a nuclear Iran and North Korea, we very much need Russia's help,'' he said in an e-mail message. 
 Congressman Edward R. Royce, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, said that he was supportive of the idea but that he expected to hold hearings. 
 Rep. Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is the co-chairman of the Bipartisan Task Force on Nonproliferation, harshly criticized Mr. Bush over the move. 
 ''President Bush's foreign policy has become so hollow that his favorite bargaining position is to give everything away. He is repeatedly rewarding bad behavior,'' he said in a statement. 
 Outside experts with whom the administration had been consulting on the deal said they had sensed a recent cooling off on the idea as Russia continued to hold out on bringing sanctions against Iran. The idea seemed to pick up again several weeks ago when Russia's top atomic energy official, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, lobbied hard for it during meetings with counterparts in Washington. 
 At the same time, the administration seemed to come around to thinking that the negotiations for the deal -- which could take place over months or even years -- could help bring Russia more fully on board with the administration's efforts to rein in Iran, said Robert J. Einhorn, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation in the Clinton administration and briefly in Mr. Bush's.
 ''They had reached the conclusion that entering the negotiations would provide continuing leverage,'' Mr. Einhorn said. 
 The idea is not new, and some outside experts have been calling for just such an arrangement for months. The Council of Foreign Relations did so in a report on United States-Russian relations in March that was highly critical of Mr. Putin's policies.
 ''The idea was to create a greater foundation for nuclear cooperation with the Russians to support staying on the same track with Iran,'' said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the council and an adviser on Russia for former President Bill Clinton. 
 But the report also cited such an agreement as a way to foster cooperation on securing spent fuel and providing nuclear energy to nonnuclear nations seeking to develop their own enrichment facilities.

HEADLINE: Leftist Predicts Unrest Without Complete Recount of Mexican Election

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 8 

 BODY:
While the announced winner of last Sunday's presidential election, Felipe Calderon, kept a low profile on Saturday, his leftist rival led a rally of at least 150,000 people, charged the polling had been marred by fraud and suggested there would be civil unrest without a vote-by-vote recount. 
 ''If there is not democracy, there will be instability,'' said the rival, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, at a news conference just hours before he addressed his angry and defiant supporters in Mexico City's central plaza.
At 5:50 p.m., he took the stage in the Zocalo, the historic central square in front of the National Palace, to fire a broadside at what he described as an oligarchy of top-level politicians and businessmen. 
 ''We are aware we are confronting a powerful group, economically and politically, that are accustomed to winning at all costs, without moral scruples,'' he told the crowd. He maintained that this group had ''conspired against democracy'' and that ''they are the ones who now want to put a servant in the presidency.'' 
 Mr. Lopez Obrador called on his supporters to march Wednesday from every electoral district in the country to the capital, an echo of his 1994 march from Tabasco to the capital to protest his defeat in the governor's race. 
 ''Let it be clear, '' he said. ''This is a peaceful movement, and we will never fall for the provocations of our adversaries.''
 Mr. Calderon, of the conservative National Action Party, effectively ceded the day's spotlight to Mr. Lopez Obrador. After he was announced the victor on Thursday by a narrow margin of 243,000 votes, he had begun to give hints about how he would approach issues like trade, globalization and dealings with the United States on immigration. And on Friday he kept a whirlwind schedule of meetings and appearances. 
 But on Saturday, Mr. Calderon, the former energy minister, stayed out of the public eye. 
 Mr. Lopez Obrador, the former Mexico City mayor and firebrand leader of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, spent the day laying out his arguments for a recount and revving up his followers. 
 He said his opponent's supporters had resorted to fraud and vote-buying in northern states where the conservative party is dominant, like Jalisco and Guanajuato. He also said he had been the victim of a smear campaign on television and radio that far exceeded campaign spending limits.
 He said that the Federal Electoral Institute should have recounted Sunday's ballots during the official tally. He pointed out that mistakes favoring Mr. Calderon were found in about 2,600 cases where officials did recount votes, when tally sheets were missing or contained errors.
 He said he would present a case for recounting the votes to the Federal Electoral Tribunal on Sunday, and that he would also challenge the validity of the election before the Supreme Court, arguing that President Vicente Fox had interfered with it. 
 Later, he took his case to the people. Tens of thousands of angry and defiant people wearing his party's yellow colors and carrying banners and flags gathered in the Zocalo throughout the afternoon. They were young and old, unemployed and professional, dark-skinned and light-skinned, and they had traveled from places as far as the states of Michoacan and Tabasco. 
 Mr. Lopez Obrador spoke for about 40 minutes, calling his adversaries traitors to democracy. The crowd chanted, ''You are not alone.'' 
 Gloria Aceves, 63, had been waiting next to the stage since 9 a.m. Her husband died trying to cross the Rio Grande into the United States, she said, and she depends on a monthly grant from the city established by Mr. Lopez Obrador, who championed the poor in his campaign. ''If I have to die here,'' she said, ''here I will die supporting him.''
 At his Saturday news conference, Mr. Lopez Obrador declined to answer several times when asked what he would do if the courts refused a recount, saying he had faith the judges would order one. ''Peace is the fruit of justice,'' he said.
 ''What are they afraid of?'' he asked. ''What is it they don't want to open the packets and count them again?'' He added: ''Why the hurry if we are talking about such a fundamental issue?''
 On Friday afternoon, Mr. Calderon seemed confident that no legal challenge would stand up in court.
 ''My triumph is clear and definitive,'' he told a meeting of foreign reporters. ''There are no legal elements that sustain the possibility of a complaint. In this election, the votes have already been counted, vote by vote, at the time they should have been counted, at the closing of the polls, as happens in all the world.''
 Mr. Calderon's campaign cited the volatile protests Mr. Lopez Obrador led after his 1994 loss in arguing that he could be a danger to Mexico. And several political analysts have said that Mr. Lopez Obrador's behavior since Thursday has proven Mr. Calderon right.
 ''What marks Lopez Obrador's attitude is not the construction of democracy, nor the consolidation of his own political force, but an evident ambition for personal power,'' wrote Jorge Fernandez Menendez, an investigative journalist and political commentator. ''If it was said that Lopez Obrador was messianic, he is confirming it with each one of his acts since Sunday.''
 At the same time, in the daily newspaper Excelsior, Jose Antonio Crespo wrote in favor of a recount.
 ''If I were Felipe Calderon, I would try to legitimize my electoral victory,'' he wrote, to rob Mr. Lopez Obrador's party of ''its arguments for questioning my victory, narrow, but genuine.'' 
 After the results were announced on Thursday, Mr. Calderon and some of his aides began publicly addressing some policy issues. Arturo Sarukhan, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Calderon, said Mr. Calderon intended to put Mexico at the center of the region's debate over globalization. 
 ''We will lead the debate on how Latin America will keep competitive in the world, how to keep it from losing ground to Asia,'' Mr. Sarukhan said. ''We have to figure out how to demonstrate to our societies that free markets, transparency and democracy really can deliver the goods for all.''
 Mr. Calderon would seem a certain ally for the United States, and political analysts have suggested that a Calderon presidency could signal an end to the advance of left-wing politics across Latin America, as neoliberal economic policies from Washington have fallen from favor. 
 On Friday, he said he would not seek to renegotiate agricultural clauses of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and that he would urge the United States and Canada to join with Mexico to create a fund for the construction of infrastructure and other development projects to generate jobs in high-migration states in Mexico.
 ''The solution to migration is not walls,'' Mr. Calderon said. ''The only real solution to stop or slow the migration phenomenon is the generation of good-paying jobs.''
 Mr. Lopez Obrador said that Mr. Calderon was wrong to begin assuming the role of president-elect before the results of last Sunday's contests had been upheld in court. And he objected to the congratulatory messages that had been sent to Mr. Calderon from the United States, Spain and Canada. 
 He said it was all part of a strategy by Mr. Calderon to end a process that was not yet over.
 ''They want to turn the page, but things are not that way,'' Mr. Lopez Obrador said. ''This is just started.''

Ex-President Wins Genocide Ruling
 MEXICO CITY, July 8 (AP) -- Genocide charges were dropped against former President Luis Echeverria on Saturday when a judge ruled that the statute of limitations had expired, his lawyer said.
 The lawyer, Juan Velazquez, said that the federal judge had overturned a June 30 house arrest order on the charges, which stemmed from a 1968 student massacre.
 The decision was the latest blow to prosecutors' efforts to charge the Mr. Echeverria, 84,with the deaths and disappearances of dozens of students and leftist dissidents in the late 1960's and early 1970's, a period known here as the dirty war.

HEADLINE: Cashing In Its Chips

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
IT is not easy to beat Intel. 
 It is not easy to beat Intel if you are running a company that many analysts and investors have written off as moribund and out of touch.
It is not easy to beat Intel if you are running a moribund company that loses its chief executive to a heart attack just as he embarks on a risky strategy.
 But Texas Instruments beat Intel. Twice.
 And Texas Instruments, an early darling of the technology industry that later lost its way, accomplished this feat in bravura fashion, not by eking out a few extra percentage points of market share from Intel, the legendary silicon-chip giant. Instead, Texas Instruments scored throw-in-the-towel, pack-up-the-lab and sell-the-division kinds of victories. 
 That, in turn, has emboldened it. 
 ''Rarely has a leader of a previous era succeeded in the next period,'' said Richard K. Templeton, a former salesman and engineer who rose through Texas Instruments' ranks to become its chief executive in 2004. ''I think there will be a leadership change. If not Texas Instruments, why not?''
 Why not, indeed. More to the point, how did Texas Instruments, which posted revenue of $13.4 billion last year, arrive at the enviable position of considering itself primed and ready to assume Intel's mantle as standard-bearer for the entire chip industry?
 In short, it pulled off its own resuscitation -- a decade-long effort -- by abandoning ill-fitting product lines, focusing more closely on its core integrated circuits business and linking up with large but underestimated companies eager to champion new uses for its chips. It dusted off a chip called a digital signal processor and convinced Nokia, which had yet to become the leader in cellphones, to make it the core of its products. It dusted off a second underutilized chip called a digital light processor and wooed Samsung Electronics, then a scrappy South Korean electronics company trying to conquer the American market, to use it in big-screen, high-definition televisions.
 ''Their efforts to get back to their I.C. roots by shedding so many other business lines could be characterized as 'focused diversity,' '' said David Carey, chief executive of Portelligent, a firm in Austin, Tex., that analyzes consumer electronics components. ''Pretty much one basket, but a lot of different eggs.''
 FOR his part, Mr. Templeton says he believes that the path Texas Instruments is following is not only logical but also unavoidable. He views the entire technology industry as beholden to 20-year product cycles that introduce seismic changes. The mainframe computer business gave way to the minicomputer and then to the personal computer. Now, he says, the industry has entered the era of the hand-held entertainment and communication device.
 ''It's unforgiving,'' he advised. ''You can argue that the PC era isn't ending, but it is.''
 It has been a long road back for Texas Instruments, a company that at the dawn of the electronics era a half-century ago created the first commercial silicon transistor and invented the integrated circuit. But Intel and other aggressive tech companies began running circles around it by the mid-1980's because Texas Instruments' corporate attic was cluttered with underperforming businesses that had nothing to do with chips, like oil and gas exploration services and radar and missile guidance systems.
 By the early 1990's, Intel was forcing Texas Instruments out of the PC microprocessor business, and analysts considered the company roadkill in Intel's relentless drive to dominate computer chip manufacturing. That crushing defeat forced Texas Instruments to reorganize and eventually go for what became the next big thing: cellphones.
 Jerry R. Junkins, Texas Instruments' chief executive at the time, began an effort to slim down the bloated company: he started selling off nearly everything except the chip business. 
 But in 1996, Mr. Junkins died of a heart attack on an overseas business trip. His successor, Thomas J. Engibous, finished the garage sale. Out went radar and missile-guidance systems, mold manufacturing, inspection equipment, software and chemicals. He forced the company to stick to its knitting by nurturing a chip that was the brains in the Speak & Spell educational toy, the one E.T. used to phone home in Steven Spielberg's blockbuster film. It turns out that Mr. Engibous and the movie alien were both on to something. 
 That chip, a digital signal processor, is now the core technology in cellphones. And the Texas Instruments manager who made it a cash cow by forging a tight relationship with Nokia was a tall, square-jawed engineer -- Mr. Templeton.
 His deal with Nokia became a template for the company's future successes. He aligned Nokia's and Texas Instruments' interests by having his engineers customize the D.S.P. chip for Nokia's phone software. It wedded the Finnish company to Texas Instruments and the successful partnership attracted other phone makers to the Dallas chipmaker.
 Today, Texas Instruments controls 58 percent of the $8 billion market for wireless phone chips, the fastest-growing category in the semiconductor business, according to Forward Concepts, a market research firm. Texas Instruments' chips also allow a new generation of cellphones to display video images and capture network television broadcasts. The success of wireless phone chips secured Mr. Templeton the top job at Texas Instruments in 2004. (Mr. Engibous is now chairman.)
 MR. TEMPLETON wasted little time pushing the company to duplicate his success with cellphones by moving Texas Instruments chips into the next generation of consumer electronics. That set up the company for a confrontation with an old nemesis: Intel. This time around, Texas Instruments scored its twin victories.
 Its dominance of the market for large-screen television processors -- chips that use millions of tiny mirrors -- forced Intel to halt development of a rival chip two years ago. Then, last month, Intel announced that it was giving up its efforts to make processing chips for cellphones and that it planned to sell that operation to Marvell Technology.
 Mr. Templeton said Texas Instruments had outflanked Intel by acting as a design lab that could help realize any customer's ambitions. ''When they invent, they grow faster, and that is good for us,'' he said. ''We can build a relationship with every company that needs a chip.''
 Will Strauss, president of Forward Concepts, said that Intel never gave cellphone processors the attention it should have. ''At Intel, they're focused on selling more Pentiums.''
 An Intel spokeswoman said that the company is selling its cellphone processor business because it is not a strategic fit with its core chip business. While she also said that the company has made significant progress and landed major customers over the last year, she declined to comment on competition from Texas Instruments. ''Intel does not comment on its competitors,'' she said.
 Chips from Texas Instruments are now in digital cameras, like the Kodak EasyShare with a wireless connection; MP3 players; the new Apple Hi-Fi boom box; and Sling Media's Slingbox, which sends television programs from your TV to a PC no matter where in the world the PC is. Texas Instruments chips also make Internet phone calls work and are inside new digital cinema projectors. In fact, its chips are the guts of a new generation of electronic devices, either hand-held or used in a car, that are stealing communication and entertainment functions from PC's.
 All of this is evidence of what Mr. Templeton sees as another technology cycle: the ratio of devices to people. About 1,000 people used each mainframe in the heyday of those machines, he says. About a hundred people used a mini. A single person commanded a PC. But in the next era, the relationship flips, he said. Instead of counting people per device, what becomes paramount is the number of devices per person. 
 Owning three or more hand-held entertainment devices is now commonplace, as any teenager (Mr. Templeton has three of them) who carries a cellphone, an iPod, a camera and a game machine can tell you. Mr. Templeton asserts that the shift to hand-held and mobile devices means that Texas Instruments, at long last, is in the right place at the right time. Net income grew to $2.3 billion last year from a loss of $201 million in 2001. Wall Street analysts, though, have been cooler to the company's stock lately. 
 When Texas Instruments announced last month that it was projecting higher revenue and earnings, the stock dropped 3.4 percent, to $29.68. It is now at $29.17. Though more than half the analysts who watch the company give it a buy rating, many say they are wary because they see growth for wireless handsets cooling -- if you call projected 13 percent year-over-year sales growth ''cooling.'' 
 ''The company's positioning in higher-growth communications markets bodes well,'' said Glen Yeung, an analyst at Citigroup, but ''small cracks in the handset supply chain are becoming more apparent.'' 
 Even though more than 900 million cellphone handsets were sold worldwide last year and 950 million are expected to be sold this year, Texas Instruments knows it is facing a mature market in most developed economies. But Mr. Templeton says cellphone use will ramp up in emerging economies, where the first electronic device a person owns is typically a cellphone. India added five million subscribers in a single month last year, raising its number of cellphone users to about 600 million. ''I don't know what the number will be, but it will be big and it will grow,'' Mr. Templeton said of India's market. 
 Texas Instruments has developed a new phone chip, appropriately named LoCosto, for developing economies. The company's engineers condensed the functions of four cellphone chips onto that single chip in order to bring down the price of a cellphone to about $20. Motorola and Nokia are already using them in phones sold in countries including China, India, Bangladesh and Russia.
 Texas Instruments' key strategy for growth remains getting its chips into new consumer electronics products, no matter how unusual or small the company is that makes them. ''We get very early access to what people are working on,'' said R. Gregory Delagi, who has Mr. Templeton's former job as vice president for digital signal processing systems. 
 The company's early alliance with the inventor of the Slingbox is an example of this strategy. Three years ago, Blake Krikorian, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, was working on a device to transfer television programs to his PC. He needed a chip that would stream data fast enough to avoid jerky video and long transmission delays. But a large semiconductor maker, which he declined to identify, was giving him agita. ''The claims being made by this company were far more grandiose than what they could deliver,'' he said.
 In early 2004, a friend put him in touch with Alex Gorjanc, director of Silicon Valley sales for Texas Instruments. Mr. Krikorian was skeptical because Texas Instruments was big and he was not. ''I thought they were one of those big lumbering giants,'' he said.
 To his surprise, Mr. Gorjanc met him the next day to see the Slingbox. Mr. Gorjanc tracked down Mr. Delagi that evening in Europe. ''We got excited very quickly,'' said Mr. Gorjanc, who has sold Texas Instruments chips in Silicon Valley since 1985.
 THE Slingbox effort fit with what Texas Instruments calls its ''catalog'' strategy -- a willingness to court any customer, even if it means selling just one chip at a time. The company sees the philosophy as giving it a head start as consumers warm up to new technologies, and it embraces a widespread and diverse clientele. ''We aren't smart enough to know which of these small guys is going to be big,'' Mr. Delagi said.
 Texas Instruments developed a digital signal processing chip with special software in time to put the Slingbox on store shelves in mid-2005, right on schedule. Sling Media has sold 100,000 of the devices over the last year, making the Slingbox one of the fastest-selling new electronic products in recent years.
 ''They realized big wins don't just come from big companies; they can come from a couple of guys in a garage,'' Mr. Krikorian said. ''There are not a lot of semiconductor makers that understand the new era.'' 
 Mr. Templeton said every victory -- whether it involves new companies like Sling Media or old rivals like Intel -- makes his company bigger and richer. But becoming bigger and richer also means that its scrappy, underdog mojo could be lost to complacency. All of which Mr. Templeton also recognizes. He says his current challenge ''is to keep this place humble and hungry, especially when we are winning.''
