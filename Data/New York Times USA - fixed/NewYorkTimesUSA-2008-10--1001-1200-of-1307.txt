HEADLINE: Volatile Till The Close, Markets End On Upswing

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
It was another choppy ride for stocks on Wall Street.
 The Dow Jones industrial average swung throughout the day on Thursday, peaking in midmorning trading, collapsing in the early afternoon and returning to positive territory in the final hour. 
 The Dow ended the day up 172.04 points, or 2 percent, at 8,691.25. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 11.33 points, or 1.2 percent, to 908.11, overcoming earlier losses, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 11.84 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,603.91. 
 The Dow industrials ranged more than 550 points, underscoring the market's continued volatility amid concerns that the global economy was heading into a deep recession. The gains came after a plunge on Wednesday that sent the S.& P. 500-stock index to its lowest level since early 2003. 
 ''Today just really sums up how on edge this market is,'' said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''This is the new market we are living in.''
 Stocks were buffeted by mostly disappointing news throughout the day, with lower-than-expected earnings and outlooks from a range of companies. In addition, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims was higher than expected.
 ''I think what we have here is a very nervous bear market with very little liquidity,'' said Michael Holland, chairman of Holland & Company, an investment firm.
 But energy stocks gained, helped by a rise in oil prices on expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would cut production levels Friday at a meeting in Vienna. Chevron ended the day 8 percent higher, and Exxon Mobil soared 9 percent. 
 Telecommunications stocks gained ground, led by a 6 percent gain in AT&T. 
 Despite the late gains, continuing signs of a global economic slowdown tempered any uplifting news. Signs of improvement in the credit markets slowed on a day when Alan Greenspan, testifying before a House committee, told lawmakers, ''We are in the midst of a once-in-a-century credit tsunami.'' 
 Mr. Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, expressed optimism in the long-term outlook for the economy, saying investors would emerge from the current crisis with a ''far sounder financial system.'' But his short-term outlook was bleak.
 ''Given the financial damage to date, I cannot see how we can avoid a significant rise in layoffs and unemployment,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
 Over all, lending remained relatively turgid. The interest rate at which banks lend to one another, as measured by the Libor rate, fell only slightly, hovering at levels reached before the worst of the credit freeze hit in late September. Demand for short-term Treasury bills, regarded as the safest assets around, rose slightly, indicating a small downturn in investor confidence.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 21/23, to 102 21/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.67 percent, up from 3.59 percent late Wednesday. 
 The dollar was mixed against rival currencies after jumping to multiyear highs Wednesday, while gold prices fell.
 Crude oil futures were trading above their 16-month low. Light crude oil settled at $67.84, up $1.09.
 Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's, warned that the economic outlook for the immediate future was recessionary. ''The crisis of the moment is the economy,'' he said. ''Unemployment, the earnings coming in, and the forecasts going forward. Most of the numbers are not that good.''
 Indeed, there were new reports of deepening job losses on Wall Street. Shares of Goldman Sachs fell more than 5 percent after the company said that it was preparing to cut about 10 percent of its 32,500 employees.
 Another analyst noted the continued wild market swings. 
 ''We are getting to a point where stocks moving by 5 or 10 percent on a daily basis is becoming par for the course,'' said Ed Yardeni, an investment strategist. ''As long as investors can't tell whether we're coming or going, I guess we're going to do both.''
 Third-quarter earnings reports continued to arrive, bringing largely gloomy news. Dow Chemical was an exception: the chemical maker was up 10 percent after it reported third-quarter net income that beat analysts' expectations. Shares closed at $24.43. But the Xerox Corporation reported worse-than-expected profit as the weak economy dampened spending by its largest customers. Shares fell more than 3 percent, to $7.71. 
 In European trading on Thursday, markets recovered from earlier losses. The FTSE 100 index in London gained 1.2 percent. The CAC-40 in Paris was up 0.4 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt closed down 1.1 percent. 
 The S.& P./ASX 200 index in Sydney fell 1.17 percent on Friday morning. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index was down 4.45 percent early Friday, while the Kospi in Seoul fell 3.37 percent. 
 For 2008 as a whole, world equity markets have given up 48 percent of their value.

HEADLINE: Corzine Urges U.S. to Stem Foreclosures In New Jersey

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Without a large infusion of federal aid to struggling homeowners, New Jersey could see its rapidly growing foreclosure problem spread from its cities to its more affluent suburban areas, Gov. Jon S. Corzine warned on Thursday. 
 Mr. Corzine, a Democrat, was pushing a set of proposals he unveiled last week, which he said could help the state ''lean against the wind of declining employment and weakness in the economy.'' But beyond his ideas for accelerating spending on infrastructure and providing assistance to the poor and the elderly, he said the state needed federal help to combat the effects of the financial crisis before the recession becomes a long and deep one.
 The $700 billion federal rescue plan for the nation's big banks does not provide enough money to help homeowners who are trying to avert foreclosure, Mr. Corzine said. A proposal to use $40 billion of the rescue money for that purpose should be expanded, possibly tenfold, he said in a meeting with members of the editorial board of The New York Times.
 ''The real economy's got a major-league problem with housing and with regard to mortgage restructuring,'' Mr. Corzine said. Until that problem is addressed, he said, consumers will continue to lose confidence, spending and investing less and compounding the state's already considerable financial troubles. 
 At the rate the crisis is spreading, he said, the state's unemployment rate, now 5.8 percent, could shoot up as high as 9 percent. Its housing market, he added, could deteriorate, as have the markets in California and Florida, though on a smaller scale than those states. ''I don't think we've seen the wave of foreclosures that we're going to see in 'suburbia' and 'exurbia,' '' Mr. Corzine said. ''We will just not have it as bad, but we will have serious issues there.'' 
 The latest statistics on foreclosures show that the problem has been growing in New Jersey. The state ranked eighth last month, with one of every 453 housing units in the foreclosure process, according to data from RealtyTrac, an online database of foreclosures. That was slightly higher than the national rate of one of every 475 homes. (New York ranked 39th, with one of every 2,380 homes in foreclosure.)
 Among the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas, three in New Jersey -- Newark, Camden and Edison -- ranked in the top half in the rate of foreclosures, according to RealtyTrac. The broad area that encompasses New York City and its suburbs was 93rd.
 Mr. Corzine said he favored having government help buy homes in foreclosure, then rent them back to their owners. He has also proposed mandatory mediation in all foreclosures to help struggling residents negotiate terms they can afford.
 Mr. Corzine said that with so many homeowners unable to afford their mortgages, towns and counties around the state were headed toward serious budget deficits and would require federal aid. ''Newark's budget and Camden's budget, as well as the State of New Jersey's budget, are going to be a complete mess,'' he said, adding that the state faced a budget shortfall of $400 million this fiscal year and at least $3 billion in the next.

HEADLINE: Senators Press for Action to Stem Foreclosures

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT and BRIAN KNOWLTON; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senators prodded government officials involved in the bank-rescue plan to do more to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and expressed impatience on Thursday over the pace of the unfolding program.
 The lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee urged the officials, in effect, to make the banks do something for the homeowners in return for the billions that the banks are getting from Washington in infusions of capital meant to thaw the credit spigots and get the economy moving again.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, told the officials that they seemed to be giving the banks ''a little too much dessert and not making them eat their vegetables.'' 
 The lawmakers seemed not entirely satisfied with the testimony of Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Neel T. Kashkari, the assistant secretary of the Treasury who heads the Office of Financial Stability, which was set up to purchase troubled financial assets from financial firms under the $700 billion rescue plan.
 Ms. Bair said that the government needed to do more to help thousands of people avoid foreclosure, and that the F.D.I.C. was working ''closely and creatively'' with the Treasury Department on details of a home-loan assistance plan, while Mr. Kashkari said he and his aides were ''passionate about doing everything we can to avoid preventable foreclosures.''
 ''Specifically,'' Ms. Bair said, ''the government could establish standards for loan modifications and provide guarantees for loans meeting those standards. By doing so, unaffordable loans could be converted into loans that are sustainable over the long term.'' Ms. Bair said her agency and the Treasury were developing a proposal to use government loan guarantees and financial incentives to encourage mortgage lenders to modify home loans now in danger of foreclosure.
 But Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the panel, said it was neither fair nor realistic to expect hard-pressed homeowners to take the initiative in every case. ''Why can't the lender pick up the phone?'' he asked Mr. Kashkari, who replied that banks were indeed reaching out more.
 Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, made a similar observation, saying that while some homeowners are seeking help, too many others may be ''hiding and afraid.''
 Mr. Dodd cited a letter from a lawyer on Staten Island who complained that banks sometimes changed the lineups of negotiators who were dealing with individual homeowners, forcing the owners in effect to start over and make it ''virtually impossible'' to have productive talks.
 ''The system is designed to fail,'' Mr. Dodd said, apparently quoting from the letter.
 Several senators pressed the officials on how the $700 billion would be allocated, and when the initial $250 billion in capital infusions would take full effect.
 Mr. Kashkari said he hoped the $250 billion would be ''out the door by the end of the year.''
 ''Give me a better answer than that,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska.
 ''A few weeks,'' Mr. Kashkari said.
 President Bush's spokeswoman, Dana Perino, said that ''all of this is going to take a little bit of time,'' and that the White House House and Treasury Department were determined that the money be used wisely as well as quickly.The senators alluded to distressing foreclosure statistics.
 New foreclosure filings reached 765,000 in the third quarter, an increase of only 3 percent from the second quarter but 71 percent higher than the period a year earlier, according to a report by RealtyTrac, a company that tracks defaults. Foreclosures are rising fastest in Nevada, Florida, California and Arizona -- states where home prices soared the most during the recent housing boom.
 New default filings decreased in September as some states like California enacted laws that require lenders to wait at least 30 days before foreclosing on homes. In Massachusetts, however, new filings surged in September because the state had passed a 90-day foreclosure moratorium three months earlier.
 RealtyTrac tracks foreclosures based on court filings in 2,200 counties. Critics have said that multiple court filings on each home inflate the company's statistics. RealtyTrac says it adjusts its data to account for multiple filings.
 Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama, the major-party presidential candidates, are both pushing for stepped-up efforts to prevent more widespread foreclosures, which could have a cascading effect on the economy.
 Senator Dodd had words of cautious praise for the administration's emergency steps so far. ''Few have any doubt that those actions have forestalled the worst-case scenario: complete seizure of the financial markets,'' he said.
 But Mr. Dodd said that it was time now to focus on the underlying crisis. ''It's time to stop the hemorrhaging of our housing markets that has bled out into the wider economy,'' he said.
 In her opening remarks, Ms. Bair said that there was a pressing need to ''restore rationality'' to the credit markets, and that foreclosures were not just personal calamities. ''Foreclosures may result in vacant homes that may invite crime and create an appearance of market distress, diminishing the market value of other nearby properties,'' she said.
 ''We need to hit bottom,'' Ms. Bair said of the housing market, adding that she was concerned that the housing market would ''overshoot'' on its way down.
 Mr. Kashkari and Ms. Bair were asked if they thought Congress should pass a new economic-stimulus plan to get more money into Americans' wallets.
 ''I think I'll defer on that,'' Ms. Bair said. So did Mr. Kashkari.

HEADLINE: G.M. and Chrysler Specify More Cutbacks and Layoffs

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
General Motors and Chrysler announced plans for more cutbacks Thursday as they continued to shrink their operations ahead of a possible merger.
 Chrysler said it would lay off about 1,825 workers at the end of this year by eliminating one of two shifts at an Ohio plant that builds Jeeps and by closing a sport utility vehicle plant in Delaware nearly a year sooner than planned. The announcement came as Chrysler revealed that it lost about $660 million in the second quarter, including $570 million from its automotive business. 
 The privately held Chrysler, citing differences in international accounting standards, disputed a report from its minority owner, Daimler, that put the quarterly loss at about $772.5 million.
 G.M. told its division heads in an e-mail message that the company would lay off an unspecified number of salaried workers, even though more people than expected had agreed to take buyouts. A G.M. official with direct knowledge of the plan confirmed the accuracy of the message, which also said the company would stop matching contributions to 401(k) accounts and eliminate other benefits for salaried workers, such as tuition reimbursement. 
 The official said the message, from G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, and its president, Frederick A. Henderson, was intended to prod workers who were still weighing the company's buyout offer to leave, by indicating how difficult the coming year would be. Friday is the deadline for workers to decide on a buyout.
 ''The global economic outlook remains very concerning,'' Mr. Wagoner and Mr. Henderson said in the message. ''As a result, actions are being taken throughout G.M.'s global operations to address our increasing need to conserve cash.''
 G.M. previously said it wanted to cut 15 percent of its salaried work force, or roughly 5,100 jobs, by Nov. 1. ''We will continue to evaluate our staffing needs and any decisions we make will be shared with employees first,'' a company spokesman, Tom Wilkinson, said.

HEADLINE: Booming India Is Suddenly Caught In the Credit Vise

BYLINE: By JEREMY KAHN

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
Customers come in a tiny trickle to the showroom of Uppal Motors, a Honda motorcycle dealership near here in an upscale satellite of India's capital.
 This time of year, the showroom is usually packed, for it is the week before the Hindu festival of Diwali, when many Indians buy gifts and more costly items. But not this year.
 The call center workers and software programmers who normally shop here could afford a new motorcycle -- if only the banks would lend to them, said Virender Uppal, the dealership's owner, who added that sales were down 10 percent. 
 ''They cannot meet the terms and conditions of the bankers,'' he said. ''Money is not being extended to them.''
 Like so many countries, India is experiencing a credit crisis. The country, unlike many emerging markets, had little exposure to subprime home lending or to Western financial institutions. Still, the government is pulling out all its tools to combat the global financial turmoil, whose effects have been compounded by earlier decisions to tighten the money supply. And local businesses are grappling with a rapidly slowing economy.
 The Indian economy expanded at a rate of more than 8 percent for the last three years, making India the fastest-growing country in the world after China. But growth is expected to slow this year, perhaps significantly.
 Five finance companies once had sales representatives right inside Mr. Uppal's dealership, ready to help customers arrange instant credit.
 But three of them -- including the Indian arms of Citigroup and GE Capital -- recently closed their counters.
 Those still offering credit have imposed new qualifications: they want buyers to own a residence; have at least one year in their current jobs; and keep plenty of money in the bank. And they now require down payments of as much as 40 percent, up from 20 percent.
 India's financial sector breathed a sigh of relief last week after the country's central bank took a series of steps to ease the financial crisis, which had pushed overnight lending rates among banks to more than 20 percent. The overnight rate has since fallen to 7 percent. But the trouble may be just beginning.
 Foreign institutions, many desperate for cash to cover margin calls and redemptions at home, have been pulling money out of India. Since January, foreign investors have taken $11 billion out of the Indian market, which has lost nearly 50 percent of its value in that time. This wave of selling accelerated during the last month as stock markets in the United States and Europe plunged.
 The withdrawals, combined with fears that slowing Western economies will crimp Indian growth, have led to some of the biggest one-day declines in India's benchmark Sensex index since the country's financial crisis in 1990.
 The rapid exit of foreign capital has also set off a precipitous decline in the rupee, which slid to its lowest level ever against the dollar, breaching the 50-rupee barrier Friday.
 The Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, revealed that it has spent at least $8 billion to buy rupees in the market to soften the currency's fall. Analysts said they suspected that the bank had an informal goal of trying to keep the rupee from trading at more than 50 to the dollar.
 So far, India's foreign currency reserves have been adequate to weather this storm. The country's total reserve assets declined about 7 percent from August, to $274 billion in the second week of October, according to the most recent figures available. While that pales in comparison with the $1.9 trillion amassed by China, the other emerging giant in Asia, economists said it was more than adequate to cover India's obligations.
 ''India, from a macro point of view, is not that exposed to foreign debt,'' Seema Desai, an analyst with the Eurasia Group in London, said.
 Ms. Desai said that India's reserves were greater than those of Brazil and far exceeded those of some emerging economies in Eastern Europe, which were in deep trouble because of the crisis.
 Still, bond rating agencies downgraded India's sovereign debt this summer to near junk status as the country faced a yawning fiscal deficit and spiraling inflation. India's bonds traded lower at the start of October, but have recovered in recent days.
 The central bank now must walk a fine line between defending the rupee and making sure there is enough cash in a system already suffering from a severe credit crisis.
 This year, the central bank tightened the money supply, raising interest rates and reserve requirements for banks, in an attempt to curb inflation. Then came the rapid exodus of foreign capital and the bank's rupee purchases, which further constrained money available for lending.
 ''Liquidity had disappeared,'' Chanda Kochhar, joint managing director of Icici Bank, India's largest private lender, said. ''It was not as if that brought the system to a standstill. But one should not have a system where this would continue.''
 In the last two weeks, the central bank has pumped an estimated $21 billion into the banking system. The central bank also offered some $4.1 billion to the country's mutual fund industry through a special auction, while regulators gave mutual funds greater leeway to borrow. 
 To stem a possible panic at Icici, the Indian bank most affected by the worldwide crisis, the central bank took the unusual step of announcing that it had examined the bank's balance sheet and had found it well capitalized, and that it stood ready to provide additional funds as a backstop if necessary. The immediate threat to India's banking system seems to have passed.
 Now, the country is bracing for a worldwide economic slowdown. India has the cushion of a huge domestic market, 1.2 billion people strong, but its once white-hot growth was cooling even before the crisis.
 India's airlines are already suffering. Several carriers have defaulted on their fuel bills, and the largest airlines are struggling to shed workers in a country where laws and labor unrest make layoffs difficult.
 India's export sector is also anxious. Infosys and Satyam, two prominent outsourcing firms, have told investors that they expect weaker earnings as American and European companies pull back. Meanwhile, imports will be hurt by the rupee's fall, which makes the cost of goods from overseas more expensive.
 The biggest effect may be on India's infrastructure projects. The government had been planning to pour billions into new roads, ports, airports and power plants -- much of it with foreign financing.
 ''How much can be achieved,'' Roopa Kudva, chief executive of Crisil, an Indian ratings agency, said, ''because of government budget pressure and the drying up of foreign funding?'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 25, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about a growing credit crisis in India referred incorrectly to the exposure of emerging markets to the subprime home lending that has weakened many Western financial institutions. Like India, many emerging markets have little such exposure -- not the opposite.

HEADLINE: In China, Steps to Ease Mortgages as Real Estate Loses Its Sizzle

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER. 
Keith Bradsher reported from Shenzhen late last month and later added reporting from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: SHENZHEN, China 

 BODY:
China's real estate bubble has lost its fizz in many cities, complicating the government's effort to manage an economic slowdown here. 
 The pain is obvious in Liu Shirong's apartment development. Mr. Liu, a shy electrical engineer, doesn't mind living in a complex where only 50 of 780 apartments are occupied and the swimming pool is eternally empty. ''I have peace and quiet at night,'' he said.
 But the vacant apartments are a nightmare for the mainly speculative investors who bought them a year ago. And nearby, only one of the two dozen towering cranes was still in operation on a recent afternoon.
 Banking experts and economists expect this to produce a surge in loan defaults for Chinese banks by next spring or summer that will erode the high profits banks have been earning in the last three years although few banks seem likely to fail. But the effects of the bust could extend far beyond banking, complicating economic policy-making. 
 For that reason, the Chinese government announced a series of measures late Wednesday night to support real estate prices. The central bank told commercial banks to reduce mortgage rates and down payments for borrowers seeking their first mortgage. The finance ministry also reduced the stamp tax on real estate purchases, effective Nov. 1, but only for first-time home buyers acquiring an apartment of less than 90 square meters, or 969 square feet.
 Real estate professionals and economists said the measures were too narrow to reverse growing gloom in China's housing market. Prices have already fallen by up to a third in some neighborhoods here in Shenzhen in southeastern China, the city most affected by the real estate bust.
 A national index of real estate prices released by Beijing on Wednesday showed a decline of 0.1 percent in September compared with August, the first such drop the government has acknowledged. But experts inside and outside China say that actual declines have been much greater.
 The new rules leave in place China's many punitive policies on people who buy real estate as an investment. 
 ''Things are still getting worse,'' said a top executive at a real estate developer with a variety of projects. The executive insisted on anonymity, citing the government's sensitivity about the housing market.
 China's central bank had come under intense pressure to lower interest rates and ease restrictions on bank lending to developers. But a quick or broad relaxation of monetary policy could reignite inflation, which surged to 8.7 percent at the consumer level in February but has since receded to 4.6 percent last month.
 ''Real estate developers are threatening the People's Bank of China, saying, 'If we die, the banks die first,' '' said Yu Yongding, a former member of the central bank's monetary policy committee and now an adviser to China's cabinet. ''If the government bows to this kind of pressure, we lose all the benefits of what we did before'' to reign in inflation. 
 Paradoxically, the relative lack of sophistication of China's mortgage system could keep its real estate bubble from expanding into a credit and financial crisis like the one that engulfed the West -- though Western bankers had been trying for years to get the Chinese to bundle them and sell them as securities, one of the roots of the financial crisis.
 ''The chances of a systemic financial crisis in China in this cycle are extremely, extremely low,'' said Arthur Kroeber, the managing director of Dragonomics Research, a consulting firm in Beijing.
 Though China's banking system has many problems, including rampant political influence and fraud in corporate lending decisions, mortgage lending is still more tightly regulated than in the West. The mortgage market remains closer to something out of the 1946 Frank Capra movie ''It's a Wonderful Life'' than to the home loans with no down payments and practically no credit checks that proliferated in the United States. 
 Roughly half of Chinese home buyers still pay cash for their homes and do not take a mortgage at all. For those who do need mortgages, the down payment is 30 percent for first-time buyers and 40 percent or more for buyers who have a mortgage on another home; under the measures announced Wednesday, the down payment will fall to 20 percent for buyers obtaining their first mortgage. But some cities like Shenzhen have already done this on their own with limited effect.
 One Chinese regulation would never be allowed in the United States but is widely accepted here as simple prudence: the term of a mortgage must end when the borrower turns 55, for a woman, or 60 for a man. So a 52-year-old man can take only an eight-year mortgage, and 52-year-old woman a three-year mortgage.
 Short durations for mortgages mean that homeowners quickly build up equity in their homes with their monthly payments. That makes them reluctant to mail the keys to the bank and walk away if the market weakens, although a few speculators have done so.
 It is also nearly impossible for Chinese banks to foreclose on homes. So banks tend to renegotiate monthly payments for borrowers who can clearly demonstrate financial strain.
 Chinese banks hold the mortgages they issue instead of following the American practice of bundling them as securities and selling off pieces to various investors. That process, known as securitization, is now making it hard for American homeowners to renegotiate their mortgages.
 American bankers and lawyers unsuccessfully urged China for years to allow securitization, but have curbed these pleas in recent months after seeing the global financial crisis unfold.
 ''That's one area where I've always been very critical of Chinese government policy, but now it's not looking so bad,'' said Joel Rothstein, real estate specialist in the Beijing office of the Paul Hastings law firm. Tao Wang, an economist for UBS in Beijing, calculates that for the typical mortgage at publicly traded banks in China, the principal still owed to the bank is about half the original purchase price of the house. Most big banks in China are publicly traded, but the government owns a large majority of the shares.
 With the real estate bust, analysts say some small and medium-size banks with greater exposure to the sector could face difficulties, but large banks, which have been forced by regulators to limit real estate loans since 2004, are expected to be somewhat profitable over all. 
 Leo Wah, the China banking analyst at Moody's, has not yet downgraded banks in China but is watching the weakness in real estate and related industries. 
 ''We do not believe that it would cause a serious problem, but if property prices fall some more, it won't be the only sector that has problems,'' he said.
 Already, construction is slowing. That is starting to hurt other industries -- domestic steel consumption has suddenly dropped, and steel makers are rapidly stepping up exports to the United States despite the risk of fanning trade tensions.
 For their part, Western banks and real estate funds have made only limited loans and other investments in Chinese real estate because of the government's restrictions on flows of money into the country. But these Western investors have begun hiring lawyers in some cases to serve notices of default to Chinese partners who have fallen behind on payments, said Mr. Rothstein.
 ''Until six or eight months ago, we really didn't have this for the China deals,'' he said. 
 Chinese banks themselves are flush with cash, with capital equal to 12 to 14 percent of assets, compared with the international regulatory standard of 8 percent. 
 More important, China has a heavily regulated market that guarantees banks some of the world's widest margins. Banks raise most of their money through short-term household deposits on which they pay an interest rate of just 0.7 percent. They lend at rates of 6 percent or more.
 American regulators were reluctant to prick the real estate bubble that developed in the United States until last year. But starting in 2004, Beijing officials tried to limit real estate speculation through administrative measures like setting quotas for how much real estate lending could be done by each bank.
 In August 2007, bank regulators began requiring larger down payments for second and third homes, and banks began charging interest rates up to 3 percentage points higher for those home loans than for first-time home buyers.

HEADLINE: In a Father's Tough Life, Principles and Examples For Biden to Live By

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del. 

 BODY:
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. has worked with titans of the Senate and met countless heads of state. None of them have left as deep an impression on him as his father, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr., a prideful man.
 Though life had dealt Joe Sr. a tough hand early in life in drunken, faithless bosses and a thieving partner, he never bemoaned his fate.
 Joe Sr. had it all in his 20s, sailing yachts off the New England coast, riding to the hounds, driving fast cars, flying airplanes. A decade later, he found himself with a wife and four children living in a two-bedroom apartment in a dreary, treeless suburb of Wilmington, selling used cars.
 His children saw hints of his former life in his wardrobe -- he was always impeccably dressed with a perfect pocket square -- and in the back of his closet, where he kept his riding pinks, his polished boots and his polo mallet. 
 His son the senator said the old man preached one lesson that had been the guiding principle in his own life, which has seen its share of defeats, some dealt by cruel fate, some self-inflicted. It is what has kept him going when he has faced tragedy and humiliation, the leitmotifs of the Biden story.
 ''My dad always said, 'Champ, the measure of a man is not how often he is knocked down, but how quickly he gets up,' '' Senator Biden said of his father, who died in 2002 at age 86.
 This is the recurring theme of his speeches as running mate to Senator Barack Obama and the coda to many of Mr. Biden's appearances on the stump.
 ''I've never seen a time in my career when so many Americans have been knocked down,'' Mr. Biden said last week at a campaign appearance in Rochester, N.H., his voice rising, his face reddening beneath a thin crown of white hair. ''As my father used to say, when you get knocked down, GET UP!'' 
 He is almost screaming now, and the crowd is on its feet. ''So GET UP! Get up and win in New Hampshire! Bring back the promise of this country!''
 In his autobiography, interviews and speeches, Joe Biden paints an idyllic boyhood in postwar Scranton, Pa., a mythic place called Middle America where the children -- three boys and a girl -- went to school scrubbed for the nuns, dropped in for a matinee double feature at the Roosevelt Theater on Saturday and faithfully attended Mass on Sunday.
 But life in Scranton was not always so easy for Joe Jr., who was born there on Nov. 20, 1942, the first child to Joe Sr. and Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, known to all as Jean. 
 Joey was a popular kid, if a bit quick with a punch, especially if someone teased him about his stutter, which he struggled mightily to conquer. 
 While Mr. Biden has described his early youth as stable and relatively carefree, his father suffered a number of business reversals, and for several years when Joe Jr. was young the Bidens were forced to move in with his mother's parents, the Finnegans, in their modest home on North Washington Avenue in Scranton.
 Though Scranton was sharing in the postwar economic boom, Joe Sr. had trouble finding steady work, and nothing that measured up to his previous success. For a time, he commuted to Wilmington to clean boilers for a heating and cooling company. In 1953, he moved the family there.
 Though Joe Sr. was not a heavy drinker, alcohol flowed freely in the Finnegan house and in the neighborhood. Joe Jr. saw the toll it took on his family, his neighbors and, later, on his little brother Frankie. ''Every family had it,'' said Tom Bell, one of Senator Biden's childhood friends from Scranton who remains close to him. ''But the Finnegans had more than their share.''
 Senator Biden does not drink at all, and he is frank about the reason. ''There are enough alcoholics in my family,'' he said last month as he sipped cranberry juice on a train ride from Washington to Wilmington.
 Joe Jr. learned a number of lessons during his father's lean years that he regularly cites in speeches and interviews. In his autobiography, he tells the story of his father quitting a job as sales manager for an auto dealership because the owner, who liked to reward his employees and customers with silver dollars, decided to amuse himself at the dealership's Christmas party by spilling out a bucket of silver dollars on the dance floor to watch his workers scramble to scoop up the coins. Joe Sr. gathered up his wife and walked out, never to return. 
 He would stoop if he had to, to support his family, but not that low.
 ''That's how you come to believe, to the very core of your being, that work is more than a paycheck,'' Senator Biden said in his speech accepting the Democratic vice-presidential nomination. ''It's dignity. It's respect.'' 
 These are bywords he returns to in virtually every political speech and part of his pitch to the working-class voters that are his target as Mr. Obama's running mate.
 After a few years in a drab apartment in Claymont, Del., the Bidens moved to a nondescript split-level home on Wilson Road in Wilmington, where they stayed until the children were grown. The Bidens scraped together the tuition for Joe Jr. and his brothers to attend the prestigious Archmere Academy. Joe Jr. called the school ''the object of my deepest desire, my Oz.'' 
 There, through an effort of will, he managed to conquer his stutter by reciting memorized passages over and over before a mirror. 
 He was an undistinguished student, but a standout athlete, particularly after a growth spurt in his midteens.
 ''He was a skinny kid,'' said E. John Walsh, his football coach at Archmere, ''but he was one of the best pass receivers I had in 16 years as a coach.'' 
 In those years the Bidens were neither rich nor poor. Mr. Biden's younger sister, Valerie Biden Owens, said she always had as fine a dress for school dances as her wealthier classmates at Ursuline Academy, the Catholic girls' school she attended. The difference, she said, was that her parents bought them on layaway.
 At the University of Delaware, Mr. Biden was more interested in football, girls and late-night gab sessions than in his studies. During his junior year, he took a spring break trip to the Bahamas, where he encountered Neilia Hunter, a Syracuse University student from a well-to-do family in Skaneateles, N.Y., lounging on the beach. ''I fell ass over tin cup in love -- at first sight,'' he said, and set about pursuing her with a single-mindedness he has shown in his political pursuits.
 To be closer to Neilia and her family, he set off after graduation for Syracuse Law School, where he flunked a class in his first year for failing to properly cite a reference to a law review article. He claimed the borrowing was inadvertent, and the school let him retake the course and put a letter attesting to his honesty in his file. Still, he finished near the bottom of his class. (The misstep came back to haunt him when a plagiarism charge ended his 1987 presidential campaign.)
 He returned to Wilmington after law school with his bride, Neilia, whom he married in 1966, determined to burnish the Biden name. Corporate practice did not appeal to him, and he found that criminal defense work was not terribly lucrative. But politics offered him a ticket to fame, if not fortune.
 In 1970, he won a seat on the New Castle County Council. 
 Two years later, local Democratic politicians asked him to serve as the sacrificial lamb in the United States Senate race against the popular two-term incumbent, J. Caleb Boggs. Mr. Biden was virtually unknown, had no money and, at 29, shy of the constitutional age to take the seat (his 30th birthday fell between the election and the beginning of the new Congress in January).
 His friend, and later longtime chief of staff, Ted Kaufman, who worked at the DuPont Company and was active in Democratic politics, told him he did not have a chance of beating Mr. Boggs. But Mr. Biden, with Ms. Owens serving as his campaign manager and his entire family playing key parts, dived in.
 Mr. Biden's father appeared onstage at rallies with his son and went door-to-door for him. With his senatorial bearing and his creased suits, many voters mistook him for the candidate, who looked barely old enough to vote.
 Joe Jr. won that 1972 race and was preparing to be sworn in when, just before Christmas, Neilia and their 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash that left his boys, Beau and Hunter, severely injured.
 Mr. Biden was inconsolable, but he decided to hold on to his Senate seat. His sister Valerie moved in to look after the boys, and his brother Jimmy helped with the driving back and forth to Washington.
 Joe Sr. took a step that year to lift his son's spirits and bring an added measure of dignity and respect to the high office his son now held.
 ''After 1972, he gave up car sales and went into real estate,'' Ms. Owens said in a recent interview. ''He didn't want a United States senator to have a used-car salesman for a dad.''

HEADLINE: Deal in Place to Build a Casino Complex at Aqueduct

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS; Jonathan Starkey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After seven years of political wrangling and delay, a deal to build a casino at the Aqueduct racetrack is now in place.
Under a contract announced by the Paterson administration on Thursday, a Buffalo company will construct a complex featuring a 184,000-square-foot gambling floor and 4,500 video gambling terminals, multiple restaurants including one with a 600-seat buffet, at least 300 hotel rooms and a 60,000-square-foot conference center.
The Buffalo company, Delaware North, said it planned to start construction in early 2009 and finish the casino, its adjoining restaurants and the parking structure in about a year. The project will be completed in phases within five years, it said. 
In its promotional material, Delaware North has boasted that the complex will be ''all right in the heart of Queens,'' a subway ride away on the A train. The track is in South Ozone Park just northwest of Kennedy Airport.
For the casino itself, gamblers should think more arcade than Atlantic City. There will be no blackjack tables with dealers, or roulette wheels. Instead the casino will have video-screen terminals that will accept money for virtual hands of poker and other games.
Delaware North operates a similar hybrid racetrack-casino -- known as a racino -- in Saratoga Springs. The company beat out two other bidders -- the commercial real estate firm S L Green Realty, in partnership with Hard Rock Entertainment, and Capital Play, which had joined with Mohegan Sun.
State officials said Delaware North prevailed because it was offering more money in advance: $370 million for its license to operate the casino and entertainment complex.
''They offered the most money up front,'' said John D. Sabini, chairman of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board. ''And I think that's important to the state because of the financial situation we're in.''
In addition to the up-front payment, the state expects to reap more than $10.3 billion in revenue from the gambling terminals over the next 30 years.
Though the State Legislature has already trimmed more than $420 million in state spending this year, Gov. David A. Paterson said this month that the faltering economy had opened a new $1.2 billion hole in the budget.
After the Aqueduct negotiations hit a snag two weeks ago when Senate Republicans said they wanted more time to review the plan, Mr. Paterson and fellow Democrats accused Republicans of dragging their heels and delaying the start of a project that would create about 1,000 construction jobs at a time when employers in New York are shedding workers.
''This deal will provide a critical revenue stream -- especially given the financial crisis that is battering our state and nation,'' Mr. Paterson said in a statement,
The push to build a casino at Aqueduct began in 2001, when in the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks the Legislature began passing laws that would allow for a major expansion of the state's gambling industry.
In approving the deal, the state once again finds itself turning to gambling to strengthen its weakened cash flow. But with New Yorkers expected to spend less as the financial crisis expands, Delaware North's president was asked on Thursday whether a casino could remain a steady source of state revenue during an economic downturn.
''Clearly the gaming business is not a recession-proof business,'' the president, William J. Bissett, told reporters in a room overlooking the neatly groomed racetrack at Aqueduct.
''There is a large population that will have an easy means to get to this location to entertain themselves,'' he said. ''We take comfort that, even in a recession period, the fact that Aqueduct sits where it does in a huge metropolitan community buoys our confidence that we will be successful here.''
The project is expected to create about 2,000 jobs in Queens. About half those jobs would be permanent jobs at the casino complex once it is fully operating, and the rest would be construction jobs.
''The ultimate goal, of course, is not only to create revenue for the state but to create jobs,'' said State Senator Serphin R. Maltese, a Republican from Queens. ''So as far as economic development, I think you can put it in big letters: J-O-B-S.''
Mr. Maltese, who is locked in a competitive re-election battle that may decide which party controls the Senate next year, objected to the Delaware North proposal two weeks ago after Mr. Paterson and the Democratic-led Assembly signed off on it.
At the time, Mr. Maltese and other Senate Republicans said they were not convinced the plan included enough economic benefit for the Queens community. So the developers agreed to put more of their plans in writing, including the proposal for building the hotel and convention center and a community advisory board to inform Delaware North on their satisfaction with the development. In addition, the company agreed to open an office in the community that will make it more convenient for people to apply for a job.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Concedes Flaws In Deregulatory Approach

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For years, a Congressional hearing with Alan Greenspan was a marquee event. Lawmakers doted on him as an economic sage. Markets jumped up or down depending on what he said. Politicians in both parties wanted the maestro on their side.
 But on Thursday, almost three years after stepping down as chairman of the Federal Reserve, a humbled Mr. Greenspan admitted that he had put too much faith in the self-correcting power of free markets and had failed to anticipate the self-destructive power of wanton mortgage lending. 
 ''Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders' equity, myself included, are in a state of shocked disbelief,'' he told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
 Now 82, Mr. Greenspan came in for one of the harshest grillings of his life, as Democratic lawmakers asked him time and again whether he had been wrong, why he had been wrong and whether he was sorry.
 Critics, including many economists, now blame the former Fed chairman for the financial crisis that is tipping the economy into a potentially deep recession. Mr. Greenspan's critics say that he encouraged the bubble in housing prices by keeping interest rates too low for too long and that he failed to rein in the explosive growth of risky and often fraudulent mortgage lending.
 ''You had the authority to prevent irresponsible lending practices that led to the subprime mortgage crisis. You were advised to do so by many others,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, chairman of the committee. ''Do you feel that your ideology pushed you to make decisions that you wish you had not made?''
 Mr. Greenspan conceded: ''Yes, I've found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I've been very distressed by that fact.''
 On a day that brought more bad news about rising home foreclosures and slumping employment, Mr. Greenspan refused to accept blame for the crisis but acknowledged that his belief in deregulation had been shaken.
 He noted that the immense and largely unregulated business of spreading financial risk widely, through the use of exotic financial instruments called derivatives, had gotten out of control and had added to the havoc of today's crisis. As far back as 1994, Mr. Greenspan staunchly and successfully opposed tougher regulation on derivatives. 
 But on Thursday, he agreed that the multitrillion-dollar market for credit default swaps, instruments originally created to insure bond investors against the risk of default, needed to be restrained.
 ''This modern risk-management paradigm held sway for decades,'' he said. ''The whole intellectual edifice, however, collapsed in the summer of last year.''
 Mr. Waxman noted that the Fed chairman had been one of the nation's leading voices for deregulation, displaying past statements in which Mr. Greenspan had argued that government regulators were no better than markets at imposing discipline.
 ''Were you wrong?'' Mr. Waxman asked.
 ''Partially,'' the former Fed chairman reluctantly answered, before trying to parse his concession as thinly as possible.
 Mr. Greenspan, celebrated as the ''Maestro'' in a book about him by Bob Woodward, presided over the Fed for 18 years before he stepped down in January 2006. He steered the economy through one of the longest booms in history, while also presiding over a period of declining inflation. 
 But as the Fed slashed interest rates to nearly record lows from 2001 until mid-2004, housing prices climbed far faster than inflation or household income year after year. By 2004, a growing number of economists were warning that a speculative bubble in home prices and home construction was under way, which posed the risk of a housing bust.
 Mr. Greenspan brushed aside worries about a potential bubble, arguing that housing prices had never endured a nationwide decline and that a bust was highly unlikely.
 Mr. Greenspan, along with most other banking regulators in Washington, also resisted calls for tighter regulation of subprime mortgages and other high-risk exotic mortgages that allowed people to borrow far more than they could afford.
 The Federal Reserve had broad authority to prohibit deceptive lending practices under a 1994 law called the Home Owner Equity Protection Act . But it took little action during the long housing boom, and fewer than 1 percent of all mortgages were subjected to restrictions under that law. 
 This year, the Fed greatly tightened its restrictions. But by that time, the subprime market as well as the market for other kinds of exotic mortgages had already been wiped out.
 Mr. Greenspan said that he had publicly warned about the ''underpricing of risk'' in 2005 but that he had never expected the crisis that began to sweep the entire financial system in 2007.
 ''This crisis,'' he told lawmakers, ''has turned out to be much broader than anything I could have imagined. It has morphed from one gripped by liquidity restraints to one in which fears of insolvency are now paramount.''
 Many Republican lawmakers on the oversight committee tried to blame the mortgage meltdown on the unchecked growth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant government-sponsored mortgage-finance companies that were placed in a government conservatorship last month. Republicans have argued that Democratic lawmakers blocked measures to reform the companies.
 But Mr. Greenspan, who was first appointed by President Ronald Reagan, placed far more blame on the Wall Street companies that bundled subprime mortgages into pools and sold them as mortgage-backed securities. Global demand for the securities was so high, he said, that Wall Street companies pressured lenders to lower their standards and produce more ''paper.''
 ''The evidence strongly suggests that without the excess demand from securitizers, subprime mortgage originations (undeniably the original source of the crisis) would have been far smaller and defaults accordingly far lower,'' he said.
 Despite his chagrin over the mortgage mess, the former Fed chairman proposed only one specific regulation: that companies selling mortgage-backed securities be required to hold a significant number themselves. 
 ''Whatever regulatory changes are made, they will pale in comparison to the change already evident in today's markets,'' he said. ''Those markets for an indefinite future will be far more restrained than would any currently contemplated new regulatory regime.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Turns His Back on Voters. Might They Do the Same?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Having legislatively muscled his way into a possible third term as mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg now faces what may be a more onerous challenge: How to convince New Yorkers that they can believe a single thing he says.
It isn't just that Mr. Bloomberg inched away from a position that he once cast as an inviolable principle. He did a complete 180. We're talking, of course, about term limits for the mayor and other senior elected officials, including the 51 members of the City Council.
As you know, New York voters twice passed referendums limiting those officials to two consecutive terms. No one benefited more from the plebiscites than Mr. Bloomberg. Without them, we might well still be talking about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. So supposedly sacred was the people's voice to Mr. Bloomberg that he used to proclaim, ''We cannot ignore their will,'' and certainly not by legislative fiat. 
But on Thursday, at Mr. Bloomberg's bidding, a majority of the Council thumbed its nose at the voters and stretched the limit to a third term. The majority was unusually narrow for a Council vote, 29 to 22, reflecting the emotional, intellectual and political ferment over the issue.
Still, in the end, the Council did exactly what the mayor and some of his fellow billionaires wanted it to do. It didn't do badly by itself, either. Three dozen members are due to be forced out of office next year. They just bought themselves an incumbency insurance plan. In this town, it's easier to hail a cab in the rain at 5 p.m. than it is to kick a local lawmaker out of office.
But the real issue for many New Yorkers will be Mr. Bloomberg and his credibility, now that he has turned his back so thoroughly on the expressed will of the people and on his own past statements.
His argument is that times are hard, that continuity is extra important and that voters deserve a chance to keep him.
As on other occasions, he seems to believe that because his overall approval ratings are high, New Yorkers will smile on whatever he does.
That isn't the case. The trouncing that he took on big issues like nonpartisan elections, the West Side stadium and congestion pricing makes that clear.
What the mayor plays down in his emphasis on the financial crisis is that he was exploring ways to cling to office long before the stock market went into a kamikaze-like dive. But he hemmed and hawed for months. Had he not done that, another referendum on term limits could have easily been put on the Nov. 4 ballot to see if New Yorkers had changed their minds.
The Council has rewarded him for his dithering.
There can be no doubt how New Yorkers feel. In a survey issued this week by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, 89 percent said that a new referendum -- not a City Council deal -- was the way to go. A mere 7 percent preferred to go through the Council.
Till now, had you ever known 89 percent of New Yorkers to agree on anything? ''You just don't get numbers like this,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the polling institute.
On Thursday, some council members warned that their vote would inevitably increase public cynicism about politicians at the worse possible time -- just when the Council will be forced to make hard fiscal choices and will need every ounce of citizen support it can muster.
That turns the spotlight on the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who has been the mayor's handmaiden on altering term limits and whose own credibility took severe hits. She, too, used to preach about the sanctity of the people's voice.
Ms. Quinn said on Thursday that her sole interest was the common weal. New Yorkers, she said, now have a chance to vote for ''consistent leadership'' during this crisis. When reminded at a news conference that she used to hold a diametrically opposite position on how to change term limits, she said that elected officials go off course if they ''do not evolve'' when circumstances change.
In other words, she had to be inconsistent to provide consistency. We'll let you parse that one.
No doubt, both she and Mr. Bloomberg are betting that by the next municipal elections in 2009, people will have either forgotten about this controversy or will weigh it as but one factor among many in deciding who they want in charge. (Can't you already hear the mayor saying, O.K., you may not like what I did, but c'mon, who do you want now, me or Anthony Weiner or Bill Thompson?)
The mayor's hope is that voters will eventually see Thursday's action as not a betrayal of democracy, but as a blessing in disguise.
Those were the words used by Winston Churchill's wife, Clementine, after British voters ousted him as prime minister in July 1945. ''It may well be a blessing in disguise,'' she told him.
To which Churchill replied, as many New Yorkers may be saying today, ''At the moment it seems quite effectively disguised.''

HEADLINE: New York Times Co. Reports An Earnings Decline of 51%

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported a 51.4 percent decline in third-quarter profit on Thursday and swung to a loss on continuing operations as deeper-than-expected expense cuts could not keep pace with falling revenue.
 The company said it might cut its dividend and planned to write down the value of assets in its New England Media Group, which includes The Boston Globe, by as much as $150 million. 
 ''Our board of directors plans to review our dividend policy before the end of this year to determine what is most prudent in light of the overall market conditions,'' the company's chief executive, Janet L. Robinson, said in a statement.
 The company raised its quarterly dividend last year to 23 cents a share from 17.5 cents. Analysts have criticized that move in light of the company's dwindling profits and said that the dividend was a chief source of personal income for members of the Sulzberger family, who control the company.
 After the release of the earnings report, Standard & Poor's lowered the Times Company's credit rating below investment grade, a move that would increase borrowing costs. Moody's Investors Service said it was considering doing the same. Several newspaper companies have been lowered to junk status.
 Standard & Poor's had the company rated BBB- and Moody's gave it an equivalent Baa3 grade -- the lowest investment-grade ratings in their respective systems. S.& P. downgraded the company three notches on Thursday, to BB-. 
 Print newspaper advertising revenue -- the bulk of the company's revenue -- fell 18.3 percent in the quarter as the weak economy and the long-term shift away from print created the worst period for the industry since the Depression.
 ''Half of the decline in ad revenues at the News Media Group was attributable to classified,'' Ms. Robinson said in a conference call with analysts. Among national display advertisers, she said, the biggest declines came from movie studios, hotels and technology companies.
 Advertising from banks and financial services companies actually increased as they sought to reassure jittery investors.
 Online revenue rose just 2.5 percent for the company's newspapers, which include The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The International Herald Tribune and 17 smaller papers. But the company's other online businesses, including About.com, increased revenue by 16.1 percent, despite the economic downturn.
 In the conference call, executives warned that the near future could bring weak performance in Internet display ads, one of the few bright spots in recent years.
 The company reported a loss on continuing operations of $2.1 million, or 1 cent a share, in contrast to a profit of $14.1 million, or 10 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
 Excluding after-tax severance costs, the company had earnings of 6 cents a share last quarter, slightly ahead of 4 cents that analysts had projected.
 An unusually large $12.8 million tax expense, up from $9 million in the year-earlier quarter, contributed to the loss. Including one-time income from the sale of discontinued operations, the company posted net income of $6.5 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with $13.4 million, or 9 cents, in the period a year earlier.
 The Times Company reported operating profit of $10 million for the quarter, down 64.5 percent from $28.1 million in the quarter a year earlier.
 It cut operating costs 6.8 percent from the year-earlier quarter, to $677 million. But overall revenue fell faster, 8.9 percent, to $687 million.
 The company said its annual expense reductions would be significantly more than the $130 million this year and $230 million for 2008 and 2009 that it had predicted earlier, but it declined to say by how much. One indication of those cuts was severance costs, earlier estimated at $40 million to $50 million for the full year, which reached $57 million for the first nine months.
 In addition, the earlier savings estimates did not include the company's recent decision to shut down its City and Suburban unit, a major wholesale deliverer of newspapers and magazines in the New York metropolitan area. The company has declined to say how much it will save from that move, which is scheduled for completion in January, or from the consolidation of sections in its flagship newspaper, which occurred this month.
 Shares of The New York Times rose 2 cents Thursday, to $10.70.

HEADLINE: House Democrat Seeks a 2006 Repeat, His Own Way

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
Congressional leadership posts are the Holy Grail for ambitious politicians, but Representative Chris Van Hollen could be excused for being a little anxious when he took the helm of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2007.
 First, the reserved Maryland Democrat was succeeding Representative Rahm Emanuel, the hard-charging Illinoisan who ran the House Democratic campaign arm in the last election cycle, bludgeoning Republicans on the way to a 30-seat Democratic gain.
 Second, the fact that Democrats recorded those major gains appeared to leave Mr. Van Hollen with the not-so-glamorous role of playing defense and protecting the freshman Democrats; past voting patterns made the idea of achieving any further gains seem far-fetched. 
 ''A lot of people thought I was crazy for taking on this responsibility for a variety of reasons,'' said Mr. Van Hollen, whose day job is representing the heavily Democratic and affluent Montgomery County suburbs northwest of the nation's capital.
 Those appearances may have been deceiving. Ever cautious, Mr. Van Hollen is still not ready to put a number on his expectations, but he is willing to predict that the Democrats will once again increase their ranks in Congress. 
 ''I am confident that we will beat this historical curse, and pick up a good number of seats this cycle,'' he said.
 Of course, Mr. Van Hollen has not done this entirely on his own. He received substantial help from the economic collapse that put Republicans on the defensive. And Republican lawmakers are retiring in record numbers this time around, vacating more than two dozen seats and giving Democrats that many more opportunities to compete without having to unseat an incumbent. 
 On top of those factors, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, have joined Mr. Emanuel and other party leaders in raising millions of dollars and persuading strong candidates to take a chance on a House race.
 Still, Mr. Van Hollen has been the man responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations. His colleagues -- and even his Republican opponents -- credit him with running a smart and sophisticated operation that has taken the advantages he was handed and made full use of them.
 ''He has been steady in the eye of the storm, and he has sound judgment,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''I think he has done a fantastic job.''
 Mr. Van Hollen has labored a bit in the shadow of Mr. Emanuel, a former senior aide to President Bill Clinton who knows how to command the media's attention. Mr. Emanuel remains a top strategist for the party and an influential presence as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. He and Mr. Van Hollen consult almost daily on political operations.
 The two men differ starkly in style, with Mr. Emanuel generally taking no prisoners while Mr. Van Hollen's approach is more tempered. But Mr. Van Hollen is no pushover. He was effective in the Maryland legislature and punched his ticket to Congress in 2002 by winning a primary against a member of the Kennedy family (no small feat) and then defeating a popular Republican incumbent.
 Mr. Van Hollen has also managed the congressional campaign committee, known universally as the D-triple-C, a bit differently from Mr. Emanuel's way, which focused heavily on party message. Mr. Van Hollen and his staff -- some handpicked by Speaker Pelosi -- made an early decision to invest heavily in field operations, putting paid workers on the ground in key districts to begin identifying and persuading potential voters.
 The heavy emphasis on the ground game, as it is called, quickly paid off in stunning Democratic special-election victories in Illinois, Louisiana and Mississippi, setting the tone for the year and throwing Republicans off balance.
 Mr. Van Hollen said the focus on field operations was a calculated way to break through the clutter of a crowded election year, when much of the public's attention would be on the presidential battle and on statewide races like Senate contests. 
 The congressman also set up a formidable in-house research operation of about 15 people to study the candidates, the districts and the issues and be ready to strike at Republicans when the moment arose.
 ''It has allowed a very rapid response effort,'' Mr. Van Hollen said.
 Republicans who spoke positively about Mr. Van Hollen did so only on condition that they not be identified. They credited Mr. Van Hollen with being particularly astute at identifying potential opportunities for Democrats that were overlooked by others. And, they said, he made the competition hot enough that some Republicans incumbents chose to retire rather than fight it out. In some respects, one Republican said, Mr. Van Hollen often outmaneuvered them, though he also had far greater resources and a much more favorable political climate on his side than they did.
 Democrats say Mr. Van Hollen has not been so assertive when it comes to the legislative agenda in the House. But he remains a junior member of the party leadership team, and given the forcefulness and experience of the personalities above him -- Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Hoyer, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina and Mr. Emanuel -- it is easy to see how he might have a hard time breaking through.
 The continued presence of those lawmakers in the still-new Democratic majority also leaves little room for Mr. Van Hollen to rise quickly in the leadership and reap his reward for any success achieved on Nov. 4. But his future may lie across the Rotunda, since he is seen as a potential candidate for the Senate should one of Maryland's seats open up.
 At the moment, Mr. Van Hollen said, he is not looking past Election Day. ''I am just focused on finishing the job right now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: SOME CURRENCIES PLUNGE AS STOCKS SINK WORLDWIDE

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and VIKAS BAJAJ; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting in Washington, and Michael M. Grynbaum in New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Fear that the financial crisis is infecting once-healthy economies created another white-knuckle day for investors Friday, causing stocks to tumble from Tokyo to New York.
 Uncertainty also roiled currency markets as investors continued to turn to the security of the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and drove down currencies of developing countries like Brazil, Ukraine and South Korea and even of developed countries like Britain. 
 In the United States, where the crisis began, investors were less alarmed than elsewhere. A rout in Asian and European stock markets sent the Dow Jones industrial average swooning by more than 500 points in early trading in New York, but trading recovered enough ground through the day to leave the Dow down 312.30 points, or 3.6 percent.
 Just a year ago, a drop of that size would have been considered a black day in the markets, but in these days of routine triple-digit declines, it offered a modicum of relief to traumatized investors. 
 Still, there were chilling new developments that attested to the wide scope of the crisis, despite efforts by heads of state, central bankers and corporate leaders to stop the bleeding. Cash flowed into the dollar and the Japanese yen, the two most sought-after safe havens in a storm-tossed world, as it fled from emerging markets. 
 Hedge funds and other investors are pulling money out of these countries on an immense scale, analysts said, and putting it into dollars and yen. There were few safe harbors, as commodities also tumbled. Fears of a spreading global recession caused oil prices to fall 5 percent, to $64.15, even after OPEC, the oil cartel, announced it was cutting output. Government-backed mortgage bonds and debt issued by top-rated corporations were also dragged down in the undertow.
 ''This is a panic in the way of the fine 19th-century panics, where we all run around like headless chickens,'' said R. Jeremy Grantham, chairman of the Boston-based investment firm GMO, who had predicted stocks would tumble. ''I have been in the business for 40 years, and I have never seen anything like this.''
 So great are the concerns among policy makers about the turmoil in currency markets that it has prompted talk of a coordinated intervention by the leading industrial countries in coming days, to quell the soaring dollar and put a floor under emerging-market currencies.
 Such a move -- in which the Federal Reserve and other central banks would sell dollars and yen and buy other currencies -- has been used extremely sparingly by the United States in recent years.
 ''The risk is huge, but it is appropriate at this point, because if the emerging markets go into default, the consequences would be catastrophic,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economist at Harvard.
 When a developing country's currency loses value rapidly, it impedes the ability to pay back loans from Western banks. That could cause a rash of corporate or even government defaults -- a feature of previous financial crises in Asia and Latin America.
 In the United States, the rescue effort may also grow. The Treasury Department, officials said, is weighing whether to expand its program of capital injections to encompass insurance companies, many of which own savings and loans, and is under pressure to include the financing arms of the auto companies. The government injections are currently reserved for banks.
 The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., appears to be drawing the line at investing in hedge funds, which, officials note, do not supply credit to the economy and are in the business of taking on large risks.
 Indeed, hedge funds accounted for some of the turmoil on Friday. They are being forced to sell their stocks, bonds and other instruments to pay off their investors and lenders. Beyond that, investors are increasingly convinced that the global economy is headed for a long, painful recession. 
 ''There has been tremendous activity in the currency markets, the commodity market and the stock market that reveal the fingerprints of forced selling,'' said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, an investment firm based in New York.
 The flight to safety is hurting once-mighty currencies like Britain's pound. On Friday, worries about how the financial crisis would affect Britain's economy caused the pound to lose 8 cents against the dollar, falling to $1.53.
 While a strong dollar might be a boon for American tourists abroad, it creates a host of problems for economies. 
 And the downdraft of the pound and the euro -- which fell to $1.26 against the dollar on Friday, its lowest level in two years -- is less serious for the economic well-being of Britain and Europe than the deterioration of currencies like the Mexican peso or the Russian ruble.
 Even if the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and other central banks intervened in the foreign-exchange markets, it was not clear that it would reverse the pressure on these currencies.
 ''I don't see this as a crisis breaker,'' said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. ''But it would help emerging-market companies, and give everyone a chance to catch their breath.''
 The last time the Federal Reserve intervened in currency markets was in September 2000, when it teamed up with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to shore up the faltering euro. Before that, the United States and Japan teamed up to buy yen during the Asian crisis in June 1998.
 With President Bush convening a meeting of the Group of 20 nations in Washington on Nov. 15, analysts said there would be pressure on the United States and other Western countries to show they were trying to cushion the blow of the crisis on developing countries.
 The International Monetary Fund is trying to arrange a large credit line to help developing countries desperate for dollars. On Friday, Iceland announced it had reached a tentative deal for a $2 billion emergency loan from the fund -- making it the first country to seek aid from the fund during this crisis, and the first Western country to do so since 1976.
 The bad news started early Friday in Tokyo and Seoul, where big companies like Toyota, Sony and Samsung disappointed investors with their earnings. It continued as trading opened in Europe, with Britain reporting that its economy shrank in the third quarter.
 By the time investors awoke in New York, stock futures had fallen so far that trading in them had been halted. Investors were on notice that the market could fall at least 6 percent, perhaps much more.
 As trading started, the Dow dropped 450 points, or about 5 percent, and the floor appeared calm. Some traders said they took solace in the fact that the decline had not been greater -- and far from the 1,100-point drop that would force a trading halt on the Big Board.
 ''It was frightening, absolutely frightening,'' Warren Meyers, a floor trader for Walter J. Dowd Inc., said early on Friday. ''Every day we are walking on shaking ground.''
 Stocks seesawed for much of the rest of the day. A report that existing home sales jumped 5.5 percent in September as banks unloaded foreclosed homes did little to help the market.
 But at about 2 p.m., stocks started rallying, and by 3 p.m., the Dow was down by just 100 points for the day. It was unclear what was fueling the rally, though investors seemed cheered by reports that the Treasury was weighing investments in insurance companies.
 The Dow, however, was not able to build on those gains and fell sharply at the end of trading, dropping 183 points in 10 minutes.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to 102 18/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.69 percent, up from 3.67 percent late Thursday.
 As is often the case when stocks fall steeply, the market is starting to entice some investors, many of whom say they have never seen prices so low, to buy. Among them is Mr. Grantham, the GMO chairman.
 After years of warning that stocks were unreasonably overpriced, he said he now believed they were below their fair value and had been slowly acquiring holdings in blue-chip companies.
 ''It's a very nerve-racking time to be a value investor,'' Mr. Grantham said. ''You put a little bit into the market, and the next day you think, 'What an idiot, what an idiot.' ''

HEADLINE: Housing Resales Rose 5.5% in September

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Monthly home resales rose the most in five years in September, according to figures released Friday, with the sales driven largely by bargain-basement prices on foreclosed homes. But the numbers probably do not reflect a permanent turn in the markets, because the credit crisis has intensified since these transactions took place. 
 Existing home sales -- that is, homes that were owned by someone else, as opposed to newly built homes -- rose 5.5 percent in September over the previous month and 1.4 percent over the last 12 months. The national numbers were buoyed mostly by foreclosure sales in the West. 
 The National Association of Realtors, the group that released the numbers on Friday, estimated that 35 to 40 percent of resold homes nationwide were distressed assets.
 ''It's pretty clear that these are sales of foreclosed properties at bargain prices, so given that, it doesn't look like this is the turning point,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. 
 The median price of existing homes in September was down 9 percent over the previous 12 months. The decline was particularly acute in the West, where prices were down 18.5 percent from a year earlier.
 In August, prices nationwide were down 9.5 percent on a year-on-year basis. 
 The Realtors' report is based on transactions that closed in September but that were probably agreed upon one to two months earlier. Because of this, the upturn in sales most likely does not indicate that a bottom has been reached because the report does not reflect the credit market turmoil that escalated in late September. 
 ''What this means is that in some areas affordability is coming into the market, and that's the good news,'' said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at Merk Mutual Funds. ''The bad news is that the September data was collected before the credit market really seized up.'' 
 A sclerotic credit market has made it harder for people to buy homes unless they have pristine credit. Other recessionary forces -- like the declining job market and major stock market losses -- also spell bad news for home sales in the future. 
 ''All indications are that we have a long way to go before the housing market stabilizes,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. He noted that the tough credit market, as well as Americans' reluctance to buy a home when they expect prices to keep falling, forecast poor housing sales in the coming months. ''It's about as bad a market as you can get.''
 There were many more homes on the market than people willing to buy them in September; it would take 9.9 months to sell off the existing inventory of used homes based on the September monthly sales rate. While this figure has been declining over recent months, it is still historically high.
 ''Inventories are very high relative to sales rates, and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist of MFR Inc., wrote in a client note.

HEADLINE: So When Will Banks Give Loans?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
''Chase recently received $25 billion in federal funding. What effect will that have on the business side and will it change our strategic lending policy?''
 It was Oct. 17, just four days after JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, agreed to take a $25 billion capital injection courtesy of the United States government, when a JPMorgan employee asked that question. It came toward the end of an employee-only conference call that had been largely devoted to meshing certain divisions of JPMorgan with its new acquisition, Washington Mutual. 
 Which, of course, it also got thanks to the federal government. Christmas came early at JPMorgan Chase.
 The JPMorgan executive who was moderating the employee conference call didn't hesitate to answer a question that was pretty politically sensitive given the events of the previous few weeks. 
 Given the way, that is, that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had decided to use the first installment of the $700 billion bailout money to recapitalize banks instead of buying up their toxic securities, which he had then sold to Congress and the American people as the best and fastest way to get the banks to start making loans again, and help prevent this recession from getting much, much worse. 
 In point of fact, the dirty little secret of the banking industry is that it has no intention of using the money to make new loans. But this executive was the first insider who's been indiscreet enough to say it within earshot of a journalist. 
 (He didn't mean to, of course, but I obtained the call-in number and listened to a recording.) 
 ''Twenty-five billion dollars is obviously going to help the folks who are struggling more than Chase,'' he began. ''What we do think it will help us do is perhaps be a little bit more active on the acquisition side or opportunistic side for some banks who are still struggling. And I would not assume that we are done on the acquisition side just because of the Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns mergers. I think there are going to be some great opportunities for us to grow in this environment, and I think we have an opportunity to use that $25 billion in that way and obviously depending on whether recession turns into depression or what happens in the future, you know, we have that as a backstop.'' 
 Read that answer as many times as you want -- you are not going to find a single word in there about making loans to help the American economy. On the contrary: at another point in the conference call, the same executive (who I'm not naming because he didn't know I would be listening in) explained that ''loan dollars are down significantly.'' He added, ''We would think that loan volume will continue to go down as we continue to tighten credit to fully reflect the high cost of pricing on the loan side.'' In other words JPMorgan has no intention of turning on the lending spigot.
 It is starting to appear as if one of Treasury's key rationales for the recapitalization program -- namely, that it will cause banks to start lending again -- is a fig leaf, Treasury's version of the weapons of mass destruction. 
 In fact, Treasury wants banks to acquire each other and is using its power to inject capital to force a new and wrenching round of bank consolidation. As Mark Landler reported in The New York Times earlier this week, ''the government wants not only to stabilize the industry, but also to reshape it.'' Now they tell us.
 Indeed, Mr. Landler's story noted that Treasury would even funnel some of the bailout money to help banks buy other banks. And, in an almost unnoticed move, it recently put in place a new tax break, worth billions to the banking industry, that has only one purpose: to encourage bank mergers. As a tax expert, Robert Willens, put it: ''It couldn't be clearer if they had taken out an ad.''
 Friday delivered the first piece of evidence that this is, indeed, the plan. PNC announced that it was purchasing National City, an acquisition that will be greatly aided by the new tax break, which will allow it to immediately deduct any losses on National City's books. 
 As part of the deal, it is also tapping the bailout fund for $7.7 billion, giving the government preferred stock in return. At least some of that $7.7 billion would have gone to NatCity if the government had deemed it worth saving. In other words, the government is giving PNC money that might otherwise have gone to NatCity as a reward for taking over NatCity.
 I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel as if we've been sold a bill of goods.
 The markets had another brutal day Friday. The Asian markets got crushed. Germany and England were down more than 5 percent. In the hours before the United States markets opened, all the signals suggested it was going to be the worst day yet in the crisis. The Dow dropped more than 400 points at the opening, but thankfully it never got any worse.
 There are lots of reasons the markets remain unstable -- fears of a global recession, companies offering poor profit projections for the rest of the year, and the continuing uncertainties brought on by the credit crisis. But another reason, I now believe, is that investors no longer trust Treasury. First it says it has to have $700 billion to buy back toxic mortgage-backed securities. Then, as Mr. Paulson divulged to The Times this week, it turns out that even before the bill passed the House, he told his staff to start drawing up a plan for capital injections. Fearing Congress's reaction, he didn't tell the Hill about his change of heart. 
 Now, he's shifted gears again, and is directing Treasury to use the money to force bank acquisitions. Sneaking in the tax break isn't exactly confidence-inspiring, either. (And let's not even get into the less-than-credible, after-the-fact rationalizations for letting Lehman default, which stands as the single worst mistake the government has made in the crisis.)
 On Thursday, at a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee, the chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, pushed Neel Kashkari, the young Treasury official who is Mr. Paulson's point man on the bailout plan, on the subject of banks' continuing reluctance to make loans. How, Senator Dodd asked, was Treasury going to ensure that banks used their new government capital to make loans -- ''besides rhetorically begging them?''
 ''We share your view,'' Mr. Kashkari replied. ''We want our banks to be lending in our communities.''
 Senator Dodd: ''Are you insisting upon it?''
 Mr. Kashkari: ''We are insisting upon it in all our actions.''
 But they are doing no such thing. Unlike the British government, which is mandating lending requirements in return for capital injections, our government seems afraid to do anything except plead. And those pleas, in this environment, are falling on deaf ears.
 Yes, there are times when a troubled bank needs to be acquired by a stronger bank. Given that the federal government insures deposits, it has an abiding interest in seeing that such mergers take place as smoothly as possible. Nobody is saying those kinds of deals shouldn't take place. 
 But Citigroup, at this point, probably falls into the category of troubled bank, and nobody seems to be arguing that it should be taken over. It is in the ''too big to fail'' category, and the government will ensure that it gets back on its feet, no matter how much money it takes. One reason Mr. Paulson forced all of the nine biggest banks to take government money was to mask the fact that some of them are much weaker than others.
 We have long been a country that has treasured its diversity of banks; up until the 1980s, in fact, there were no national banks at all. If Treasury is using the bailout bill to turn the banking system into the oligopoly of giant national institutions, it is hard to see how that will help anybody. Except, of course, the giant banks that are declared the winners by Treasury.
 JPMorgan is going to be one of the winners -- and deservedly so. 
 Mr. Dimon managed the company so well during the housing bubble that it is saddled with very few of the problems that have crippled competitors like Citi. The government handed it Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual because it was strong enough to swallow both institutions without so much as a burp. 
 Of all the banking executives in that room with Mr. Paulson a few weeks ago, none needed the government's money less than Mr. Dimon. A company spokesman told me, ''We accepted the money for the good of the entire financial system.'' He added that JP Morgan would use the money ''to do good for customers and shareholders. We are disciplined to try to make loans that people can repay.''
 Nobody is saying it should make loans that people can't repay. What I am saying is that Mr. Dimon took the $25 billion on the condition that his institution would start making loans. There are plenty of small and medium-size businesses that are choking because they have no access to capital -- and are perfectly capable of repaying the money. How about a loan program for them, Mr. Dimon?
 Late Thursday afternoon, I caught up with Senator Dodd, and asked him what he was going to do if the loan situation didn't improve. ''All I can tell you is that we are going to have the bankers up here, probably in another couple of weeks and we are going to have a very blunt conversation,'' he replied.
 He continued: ''If it turns out that they are hoarding, you'll have a revolution on your hands. People will be so livid and furious that their tax money is going to line their pockets instead of doing the right thing. There will be hell to pay.''
 Let's hope so.

HEADLINE: A Neighborhood Y.M.C.A. Evolves With the Neighborhood

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Richard Wright slept there. So did Claude McKay, Matthew Henson, George Washington Carver and Malcolm X. 
 Ralph Ellison waited tables there, Paul Robeson was discovered on its stage and Jackie Robinson coached basketball in the gym.
 This bastion of black history is the Harlem Y.M.C.A., sometimes called the ''living room of the Harlem Renaissance.'' The 11-story brick building, on 135th Street off Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, also played a critical role throughout segregation, when blacks were barred from other Y.M.C.A.'s and were similarly unwelcome at many hotels, theaters, restaurants and other public places in the city -- including Harlem itself. 
 But even in a neighborhood where history carries a premium, the Y.M.C.A. is now largely an afterthought among the neighborhood's cultural sites. 
 And as Harlem has shifted into a place with fewer poor, working-class and black residents and a growing number of Latinos and whites, the Y.M.C.A. has changed as well. 
 Its offerings now include a New American Welcome Center, where immigrants can learn English and become familiar with the mores of their adopted country; guitar lessons (guitar provided) for children; mambo, salsa, belly dancing, yoga and pilates classes for adults; and Saturday morning tumbling for 3- to 5-year olds.
 The result is that since its heyday in the 1930s and '40s, the Harlem Y.M.C.A. -- whose building, a city landmark, is celebrating its 75th year -- is known less for its history than for its effort to re-establish itself at the center of the neighborhood.
 Jack Lund, president and chief executive of the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York, said that as part of its $300 million plan to refurbish, replace and build new Y.M.C.A.'s in the city, the proposed $39 million investment in the Harlem branch would be the centerpiece of the organization's fund-raising campaign.
 ''It's famous all over the country,'' said Mr. Lund, who arrived in New York from Milwaukee four years ago. ''Almost no philanthropist in the country isn't going to understand what we're doing.''
 So, at some point after the current international financial crisis wanes, the Harlem Y.M.C.A. will most likely either move to a larger space or give its interior an extensive overhaul. 
 The plans include establishing a charter school, building an aquatic center where every second grader in the neighborhood would be offered swimming lessons, and setting aside space for a large kitchen, where people would learn how to cook healthful meals to help curb the area's high rates of diabetes and obesity.
 On a recent weekday, the Y.M.C.A.'s Little Theater -- where Paul Robeson is said to have been offered the lead role in Eugene O'Neill's ''The Emperor Jones'' after a performance in the 1920s -- was empty.
 The Little Theater, apparently so named because it can accommodate no more than about 200 people sitting in metal folding chairs, is now used mainly for neighborhood church gatherings, baby showers and political club meetings. 
 It still has its original black and red checkerboard floor, where dancers from the Cotton Club, Savoy Ballroom and Apollo Theater once rehearsed, and which Sidney Poitier, Cicely Tyson, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee crossed on the way to the small stage.
 Near the front of the building, in a small room used for English classes, is a 1935 mural by Aaron Douglas called ''Evolution of Negro Dance.''
 The mural's figures, which appear in silhouette under rays of dappled sunlight, have faded badly. In some sections, the green and black paint has chipped away, leaving Mr. Douglas's pencil tracings on the white wall peeking through. 
 Upstairs are spartan rooms, and while who slept where has long since been forgotten, the modest room of a more recent guest, former President Jimmy Carter, bears his name.
 The accommodations have changed little since luminaries like Joe Louis and Jesse Owens bunked there more than half a century ago. European tourists writing on travel Web sites caution that the rooms are quite small. They are -- even by New York standards. And the bathroom is still down the hall.
 Inside the men's locker room on the third floor, two half-dressed septuagenarians, William Still, 70, and Edward Joseph, 74, held court as a group of similarly attired gentlemen looked on.
 The men talked about how Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright had been coming to play pickup basketball every Saturday for years. They spoke of the friends they once saw regularly, but who have either grown too old to get out or have taken ill and died.
 Mr. Still, the more energetic of the two, has been coming five days a week for the past 20 years. Mr. Joseph's first day was 50 years ago.
 ''I come here to get exercise,'' said Mr. Still, who had just finished a water aerobics class. ''You need to work out at least three times a week.'' He paused and glanced around at his scantily dressed colleagues. ''I certainly don't believe in coming to see these dudes!''

HEADLINE: As Yard Sales Boom in Hard Times, Sentiment Is First Thing to Go

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: MANTECA, Calif. 

 BODY:
As the classified ads put it, everything must go. Socks. Christmas ornaments. Microwave ovens. Three-year-old Marita Duarte's tricycle was sold by her mother, Beatriz, to a stranger for $3 even as her daughter was riding it.
 On Mission Ridge Drive and other avenues, lanes and ways in this formerly booming community, even birthday celebrations must go. ''It was no money, no birthday,'' said Ms. Duarte, who lost her job as a floral designer two months ago. The family commemorated Marita's third birthday without presents last week, the occasion marked by a small cake with Cinderella on the vanilla frosting. They will move into a rental apartment next month.
 An eternity ago, people in this city in northern San Joaquin County braved four-hour round-trip commutes to the San Francisco Bay Area for a toehold on the dream. Today, Manteca's lawns and driveways are storefronts of the new garage-sale economy -- the telltale yellow signs plastered in the rear windows of parked cars Friday through Sunday directing traffic to yet another sale, yet another family. 
 ''You can get great deals,'' said Sharrell Johnson, 32, who was scouting for toys in the Indian summer heat last Friday amid boxes of tools and DVDs and forests of little skirts and shirts dangling from plastic hangers on suspended rope. ''Sad to say, you're finding really good things. Because everybody's losing their homes.'' 
 The garage-sale economy is flourishing here and in many other regions of the country, so much so that some cities have begun cracking down. With more residents trying to increase their income, the city of Weymouth, Mass., limited yard sales to just three a year per address. Detective Sgt. Richard Fuller said it was now common to see 15 cars parked in front of a house. 
 Richmond, Ind., has had such an onslaught of garage sale signs posted in the right of way that the city has placed stickers on prominent light poles warning of violations and fines.
 But it is a Sisyphean task: Manteca's ordinance, restricting residents to two sales a year, is widely ignored.
 The sales are part of the once-underground ''thrift economy,'' as a team of Brigham Young University sociologists have called it, which includes thrift stores, pawn shops and so-called recessionistas name-brand shopping at Goodwill. 
 ''This is the perfect storm for garage sales,'' said Gregg Kettles, a visiting professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who studies outdoor commerce. ''We're coming off a 20-year boom in which consumers filled ever-bigger houses. Now people need cash because of the bust.''
 And so the garages and yards of Manteca, some tinder-dry from neglect, offer a crash course in kitchen-table economics each weekend. On Klondike Way: ''Tools, various household items, & much more!'' On Virginia Street: ''Moving Sale! Fridge, washer & dryer, men's clothing, bike, BBQ, dinette, dresser, fans, microwaves, recliner, DVD player. Everything must go!''
 When life's daily trappings and keepsakes are laid out for sale on a collapsible table, sentiment is the first thing to go. ''The cash helps a lot,'' Constantino Gonzalez, Ms. Duarte's neighbor, said of the family's second sale in two weeks, in which he and his wife, Julia, were reluctantly selling their children's inflatable bounce house for $650, with pump.
 Since losing his construction job, Mr. Gonzalez, 43, has been economizing, disconnecting the family's Internet and long-distance telephone service, and barely using his truck and the Jeep, strewn with leaves in the driveway. He has taken to picking up his children from school on his bicycle, with 6-year-old Daniel on the handlebars, cushioned by a terry-cloth towel.
 The inflatable bounce house is the children's favorite toy, but the family's $1,800 mortgage payment is coming. So it sits propped up in its bright blue case, awaiting customers, many of them desperate themselves. Customers are searching for bargains on necessities so they might chip away at the rent, the truck payment, the remodeling bill on the credit card.
 ''We need to eat,'' Mr. Gonzalez tells his children about selling off their toys. ''I can't cover the sun with my finger. So why lie?''
 As he spoke, he watched his neighbor across the street pull out of her driveway with her family for the last time, their pickup truck piled high with chairs, firewood and other belongings, like modern Joads from Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath.'' ''Bad loan,'' explained the neighbor, Alex Martinez, who works nights at an automobile assembly plant in faraway Fremont. The garage sale she had held the week earlier barely made a dent. 
 As the family drove off, a woman with frosted hair wearing high heels got out of a parked car and placed a sign in the window of the former Martinez place: ''Coming Soon: Innovative Realty.'' 
 This is McCain-Palin placard country, where signs for the anti-gay-marriage state ballot measure, ''Yes on 8,'' pepper the landscape and billboards advertising ''Buy Now/Low Rates'' seem like grim fossils of a bygone age. Manteca lies at an epicenter of the foreclosure crisis, with median home values having fallen by nearly half since 2006, from $440,000 to the current $225,000. In San Joaquin County, Moody's has estimated that more than 1 in 10 houses with mortgages have a payment that is more than 30 days late. Unemployment rates have increased by a third, from 7.6 percent in September 2007 to 10.2 percent this fall, said Hans Johnson, a demographer at the Public Policy Institute of California.
 Before the downturn, Manteca, population 67,700, and other towns in the northern San Joaquin Valley were on the leading edge of growth, with stucco subdivisions carved out of almond orchards. Today some 1,500 to 2,000 homes in Manteca, which is 32.7 percent Hispanic, are in various stages of foreclosure. 
 Paul Farnsworth's garage on Widgeon Way was a latter-day five and dime, his driveway an eclectic assortment of artificial flowers, cookie jars, decanters, spotlights, radar detectors, Hot Wheels miniature cars, a Dirt Devil. Mr. Farnsworth's recent garage sales supplement his income as a manager for a beverage distributor, which pays about half of what he made as an apricot and cherry farmer in nearby Tracy. (He was laid off when the farm was sold.) Neither he nor his wife Ann, a beautician, can afford to retire. 
 ''People want things for half, and I don't blame them,'' observed Mr. Farnsworth, 65, adding that only one couple that morning had not dickered on the price. His own house, appraised at $375,000 three years ago, is worth $200,000 today. He has resorted to holding garage sales ''to help make payments on a house that's worth less than what I owe,'' he said, the irony not lost on him. 
 Ebi Yeri's yard held big-ticket items: beds, a smoked-glass and black lacquer dinette set and -- the piece de resistance -- a 51-inch Hitachi projection television that he had replaced with a plasma flat screen. Still, it pained Mr. Yeri to sell. He had it set thematically to the HGTV channel, figuring that ''a judge show might offend somebody.''
 Mr. Yeri, 35, was decluttering to offset losses in his 401(k), which he described as ''in the tank.'' He said he also cut costs by being ''lighter on the foot,'' driving 10 miles an hour slower than the speed limit on his 156-mile commute to and from his software job in San Jose. 
 On Chenin Blanc Drive, Robert Dadey, a car salesman, was holding his 20th garage sale. ''I need money,'' he said simply about selling the Oakland Raiders memorabilia, teddy bears and $40 brown ultrasuede recliner in his midst on the lawn. ''It's bad times.''

HEADLINE: OPEC Says It Will Cut Oil Output

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and JAD MOUAWAD; Nelson D. Schwartz reported from Vienna and Jad Mouawad from New York. Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: VIENNA 

 BODY:
Stung by what it called ''a dramatic collapse'' in crude prices, the OPEC cartel said on Friday that it would reduce output by a steeper-than-expected 1.5 million barrels a day. But that action failed to brake the price decline, and oil dropped 5 percent more by the end of the day.
 The oil cartel swiftly agreed to the cut in an emergency meeting at its headquarters here, and its president suggested afterward that still more production cuts were coming as OPEC struggled to get ahead of an economic slowdown so severe it could leave the world awash in oil.
 The stunning decline of oil prices in recent weeks has left oil-exporting countries fearful that they will have to cut government budgets, including the popular social programs that cement many leaders' hold on power. 
 Oil dropped to $64.15 a barrel on Friday, from a high close of $145.29 on July 3, a 56 percent decline in 16 weeks and one of the steepest in the oil markets. 
 If prices keep falling, OPEC's president, Chakib Khelil, said the cartel would ''definitely'' reduce its production again in coming months, either when it meets in Algeria in December, or sooner. 
 ''The fundamentals are not good,'' Mr. Khelil, who is also Algeria's oil minister, said in an interview after the meeting. ''This is a crisis situation.'' 
 In a rare appeal that highlights the urgency of the situation for producers, the cartel is also starting to look beyond its ranks for help in stabilizing the market. OPEC called on other oil-producing countries to ''contribute to efforts to restore prices to reasonable levels, and eliminate harmful and unnecessary fluctuations.'' OPEC's members control 40 percent of the world's oil exports.
 Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries face their toughest test in years. The slowing global economy has depressed the consumption of oil in the United States, Europe and Japan, and the global economic turmoil risks spreading to emerging economies like China, long the main engine of growth in oil demand. OPEC members said they had little choice but to reduce production to avert a glut.
 ''OPEC has been slow to grasp the full impact of the financial crisis on the real economy, and it dawned on them all of a sudden,'' said Vera de Ladoucette, an energy analyst based in Paris at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, of Cambridge, Mass. ''There is definitely a new sense of urgency.'' 
 Despite OPEC's ability to forge a rapid consensus on Friday, members of the cartel know they are navigating perilous seas. For consumers, falling commodity prices have been one of the only positive developments in a profoundly depressed economic landscape. If OPEC's cut eventually sends oil prices higher, that would be another blow to the global economy. 
 ''They are walking a very, very fine line,'' said Jan Stuart, an energy economist at UBS in New York.
 The cut was criticized by the White House, which called it ''anticompetitive,'' and by the British prime minister, Gordon Brown. 
 Many analysts expect global oil consumption to fall this year, for the first time since 1983. Oil consumption in developed countries has dropped for the last three years, and there are signs that the growth in energy demand from developing nations is beginning to slow.
 OPEC's action comes just as domestic gasoline prices, for the first time this year, are lower than they were last year. They now average $2.78 a gallon, down from their peak of $4.11 on July 17. In some states with low taxes, gasoline has dropped below $2.50 a gallon. 
 Despite the lower prices, gasoline consumption is still down. Retail sales fell 6.4 percent last week compared with the same week a year earlier, according to a national survey by MasterCard Advisors. 
 OPEC meetings have often been contentious, daylong affairs with fierce divisions between rivals like Saudi Arabia and Iran. Before the session on Friday, experts predicted the cartel would cut 1 million barrels a day. Venezuela and Iran were pushing for a bigger daily reduction, of 2 million barrels.
 But Mr. Khelil said this time, members agreed on the 1.5-million-barrel reduction with little argument. That cut, to take effect Nov. 1, amounts to about 5 percent of OPEC's output and nearly 2 percent of global consumption.
 Mr. Khelil said exporters were having trouble locating buyers for their crude, with some countries finding that normally reliable customers could not obtain letters of credit to finance their purchases because of the financial crisis.
 ''This slowdown in oil demand is serving to exacerbate the situation in a market which has been oversupplied with crude for some time,'' OPEC said in its statement. ''Moreover, forecasts indicate that the fall in demand will deepen.''
 The drop in prices is affecting exporters and importers in unexpected ways. With fewer petrodollars now flowing to the Gulf, Russia and other regions, a major source of global liquidity and investment in places like the United States and Europe is beginning to shrink.
 Even the Saudis, who argued for keeping the markets well supplied at the last OPEC meeting, seemed to have been struck by the speed of the price drop. 
 When prices spiked this summer, the cartel's leaders attributed the jump to speculation, and Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and OPEC's most powerful member, opened the taps and increased production to a record of 10 million barrels a day. The Saudis have since pared their output to around 9.5 million barrels a day, according to analysts. 
 As the lowest-cost producer, Saudi Arabia can afford to let prices fall for a while without hurting its budget. Most analysts estimate that the Saudis could live with oil at $55 to $65 a barrel. But other producers need higher prices. Nigeria's oil minister said his country would be more comfortable with $80, Qatar has set a range of $70 to $90, and Iran's representative said that prices below $90 a barrel would hurt. 
 For Iran and Venezuela, the drop in prices is particularly painful, because both have been spending freely on the assumption that prices would stay high. A continued drop in oil prices, and a tough domestic economy, could jeopardize the position of Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was elected on a populist platform and who faces re-election next year. 
 Venezuela's leftist president, Hugo Chavez, has forced out several foreign oil companies, and the state-owned oil company is struggling to keep production from falling. Some analysts believe Mr. Chavez needs $100 a barrel to finance his expensive social programs and continue his international activism. 
 ''Venezuela doesn't have many options if prices fall,'' said William H. Brown III, an independent oil analyst who has consulted for Saudi Arabia's national oil company, Saudi Aramco. ''That's why they're so desperate to keep prices up.'' 
 OPEC's secretary general, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, sought to portray the cut as an effort to avoid repeating what happened a decade ago, when prices plunged and investments in oil exploration slowed significantly. This echoes the view of some petroleum executives, who have warned that declining prices would lead to lower spending and delays in new projects.
 ''If prices are too high, it will damage the market,'' Mr. Badri said. ''If prices are too low, we will not be able to invest.'' In particular, he said the group was concerned that inventories would build sharply in the first half of 2009 if cuts were not made now.
 Mr. Badri did not cite aspecific price target, a signal that producers were aware that their decision was politically delicate, especially with a protracted global recession looking more likely, and stock markets nose-diving on Friday. But privately, cartel members say they would be happy within a band of $80 to $90 a barrel.
 So far, no sign has emerged that independent producers like Norway and Mexico, which have cooperated with OPEC when prices have collapsed, are ready to step in with production cuts.
 But this week, Mr. Badri visited Russia, the world's second-biggest oil producer, to discuss ways of cooperating. A deputy prime minister for Russia, Igor I. Sechin, who oversees the country's energy sector, said the government wanted a bigger influence on oil markets.
 OPEC's members have frequently ignored the group's quotas. But Mr. Khelil, OPEC's president, said this time would be different. 
 ''Unless they meet their commitments, they will be worse off than they are now,'' he said. ''The market is going to test whether we are committed.''

HEADLINE: A Puzzle Over Prisoners as Iraqis Take Control

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN

DATELINE: CAMP BUCCA, Iraq 

 BODY:
America's largest detention facility is here in Iraq's southern desert, and it sits at the center of one of the most complex debates in the transition from American military rule to full Iraqi sovereignty: what to do with the 5,000 Iraqi prisoners whom the United States military considers a threat to the hard-fought and still fragile calm in Iraq? 
 The latest draft of the security agreement between the nations, if passed, would make one change clear at least: in a drastic reduction of the United States military's power to control security in Iraq, American soldiers, acting on their own, would no longer be able to arrest insurgent suspects after Dec. 31. Under the proposed new rules, the United States military would need Iraqi permission to make arrests and then would have to turn suspects over to the Iraqi authorities within 24 hours. 
 Less clear, however, is what will happen to those already in detention -- about 17,000 people in all. 
 In theory, the United States would no longer have the right to continue to hold them. And with the United States seeking to slowly phase out its mission in Iraq, American commanders say they are eager to close down a system that has proved to be a drain on cash and, after the revelations of torture at Abu Ghraib, American credibility. 
 ''We're getting out of the detention business,'' said Brig. Gen. David Perkins, the spokesman for the American-led forces in Iraq.
 But, in a prime example of the broader complications in the United States transfer of responsibility to Iraqis, even that is not so simple: the Iraqi authorities acknowledge that they are not yet ready to take responsibility for all detainees. Prisons are not built. Guards have not been trained. The courts are jammed with cases. 
 And so quiet negotiations alongside the framework of the larger security deal seem set to allow the United States military to continue confining some dangerous detainees at the Iraqis' request, while letting others walk free, an imperfect compromise that could also undercut some of the recent gains in security in Iraq. 
 Among the detainees still in American custody, about 5,000 are considered ''dangerous radicals,'' said Brig. Gen. David E. Quantock, commanding general for Task Force 134, which oversees the detention system in Iraq. The United States will probably have to release about 4,000 of them when the military's right to detain people expires at year's end, he said. 
 Most of the remaining 12,000 detainees are people who the Americans believe either were mistakenly swept up or played minor roles in the insurgency and are unlikely to return to it as long as they can find work.
 Under the proposed rules, the United States would be permitted to hold a detainee under only two circumstances: if there is enough evidence for an Iraqi judge to issue an arrest warrant, or if a suspect is already charged and awaiting trial. And the Iraqis would have to request that the United States continue to hold the person.
 At the moment, American officials say, they believe they will be able to meet that standard for only about a fifth of those they consider dangerous.
 ''On around 1,000, we'll get the evidence to charge them in the Iraqi court system,'' General Quantock said. ''On 4,000, we'll have to work a hard guarantor program.''
 A guarantor program is one in which a member of the community, like a tribal leader, agrees to sponsor the detainee, pledging that if he commits an offense, the tribal leader or another person in the community will go to jail for him. Military officials say it is not clear if they will be able to find sponsors for those who were truly bad actors. 
 With the year-end deadline looming, the United States military has already been working hard to reduce the numbers in the detention centers, at times with unforeseen consequences that underscore both the violence still common here and the question marks hovering over the transfer of full authority to Iraqis. Several of those released have been killed, and the American military suspects that local leaders worried about instability in their areas carried out the killings. 
 The number of American-held detainees countrywide reached a high of about 26,000 in the fall of 2007. It has since dropped to about 17,000 detainees, who are being held at Camp Bucca and at Camp Cropper, the other American detention facility, which is on the vast military base attached to the Baghdad International Airport. 
 An additional 2,000 detainees are to be released next month.
 The pace of release has caused alarm in some of the communities in which detainees have been returned, notably in Anbar Province, to the west of Baghdad. Gen. John F. Kelly of the Marines said that when he first began to allow detainees to be released into the province, local sheiks came to him deeply uneasy. 
 ''We went to the sheiks and said, 'We got to release them,' and they were universally against it,'' General Kelly said. ''They said, 'There's no way to absorb them. The province has 40 percent unemployment and more underemployed.' 
 ''So we worked out a reasonable number to release, which was 450 a month, and pretty soon they came to us and said, 'My God, you don't know who you're releasing, You think you're releasing John Kelly, but really it's Abdul Kareem. He's an A.Q.I. murderous guy, but don't worry we took care of it.' '' 
 He was referring to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, or Al Qaeda in Iraq, the Sunni insurgent group led, to some degree, by foreign extremists. 
 ''They either told him to leave or, well, we've had, that we know of, 10 or 12 extrajudicial killings,'' General Kelly said.
 In recent days, confronted with the more immediate prospect of taking over responsibility for the American detention system, Iraqi politicians have voiced fears about the number of dangerous detainees and are demanding changes to the strategic agreement. 
 ''The draft security pact says that the Americans will release all the detainees from their bases as soon as the pact is signed, which means they'll release criminals from Qaeda and militants,'' said Haider al-Abbadi, a senior Parliament member in the Dawa Party of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. 
 Mr. Abbadi and other officials say the Iraqis would like access to American intelligence in cases of potentially dangerous detainees so that they could issue arrest warrants and then either hold the detainees themselves or ask the Americans to continue to hold them. 
 American officials say it is unlikely they would agree to requests for delicate intelligence, especially if it could reveal sources. 
 Since the war began in 2003, the American military has sought to quell violence through what it calls ''security detention'' -- holding without charge people believed to pose a potential risk to security. Under Iraqi law, like American law, there is no such thing as security detention. In most cases, people cannot be held unless there is a warrant for their arrest. As the system is transferred to Iraqi control, suspects will continue to be held only if the Americans have gathered enough evidence to charge them in Iraqi court. The others will be released -- not immediately, but gradually so that large numbers of detainees are not dumped all at once into areas that may still be unstable, and, in theory, with guarantees from local tribal leaders. 
 Camp Bucca is scheduled to be closed down by the middle of next year. By January, General Quantock said, he hoped to start moving detainees to a new facility being built in Taji, a few miles north of Baghdad. When the Taji detention facility is finished, it will hold 5,600 detainees, and will be turned over to the Iraqis. 
 It is not clear what will happen to Camp Cropper.
 In the meantime, the Americans are scrambling to gather enough evidence to ensure that as many of the potentially dangerous detainees as possible can be either held on warrants or charged under Iraqi law. 
 But military lawyers say the task will be difficult. Many detainees were picked up during the height of the insurgency, two or three years ago, and while the military collected some evidence at the scene of their capture, witnesses have often fled or been killed and the capturing military unit is long gone. 
 In the Iraqi courts, conviction often requires two witnesses to testify that they saw either a crime or a suspect's confession. Fewer than 10 percent of the cases tried in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq result in convictions, said a military lawyer with the Law and Order Task Force, which works with the courts. While there are other ways of satisfying evidentiary requirements, witnesses and confessions remain the most common. 
 Forensic evidence, one of the strongest forms of proof in the American trial system, remains arcane for many Iraqi judges, who view it as less reliable than a confession. That estimation is beginning to change, but acceptance will take time. 
 ''Forensics could show the guy is covered in TNT, and it would not be considered conclusive,'' General Quantock said. ''Forensics is voodoo, so that's why we're going back through the cases, and back to get eyewitnesses.'' 
 To prevent more extrajudicial killings of those released, the American military now provides the police, local sheiks and imams with pictures of the detainees before they are released. If the Iraqi authorities believe they can build their own case, the police go to court and ask for a warrant to immediately rearrest the suspect. 
 ''Now as we're releasing an increasing number of bad guys, they go to the court and get a warrant and then when he's released, he's taken in,'' General Kelly said. 
 That is the pattern that General Kelly expects to see increase. There are still 3,000 men in Bucca who came from Anbar, and many are likely to be released into the community in the coming months. After the first 800 of them are let go, General Kelly said, ''we're down to the bottom of the barrel, to guys that we shouldn't release.''

HEADLINE: PNC Gets National City in Latest Bank Acquisition

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
PNC Financial scooped up National City on Friday in an all-stock deal valued at $5.2 billion, the latest in what is widely expected to be a series of consolidations among the nation's regional banks. 
 The deal will make PNC the fifth-largest bank in the United States, giving it more than $180 billion and 2,700 branches spread across the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. But it will also inherit nearly $20 billion of losses on bad mortgages and other troubled loans, and it will bolster its presence in the Rust Belt just as the economy is worsening. 
 Automakers and other heavy manufacturers are bracing for thousands of layoffs, which could cause more consumers and corporations to default and will most likely slow new lending. 
 PNC said the deal represented an offer of $2.23 for each share of National City, or nearly 19 percent below the stock's closing price on Thursday. That makes the acquisition a ''take-under,'' meaning the purchase price is below the market value of the target company. 
 A recent change to the tax code will provide PNC with what analysts estimate as $6 billion worth of benefits, an amount roughly equal to the value of the transaction. To help pay for the deal, PNC said it had received approval for a $7.7 billion government investment as part of the Treasury Department's capital injection program. That amount is roughly equivalent to about 3 percent of the combined value of PNC and National City's risk-weighted assets.
 PNC, based in Pittsburgh, has long said it intended to grow by expanding into faster-growing markets and fee-based businesses. But the acquisition of National City seems to reverse that course. National City, based in Cleveland, has long been a traditional lender in slow-growing states like Ohio, Michigan and undertook a disastrous adventure into Florida near the height of the housing market. 
 ''We know how to make money in mature markets,'' said James E. Rohr, PNC's chairman and chief executive. ''We are certainly not afraid of Michigan.''
 Mr. Rohr said lending profit margins were improving amid the turmoil, making it a better business. And he said National City gave it a broader platform for PNC to market services like cash and investment management to consumers and small businesses. PNC also plans to embark on an aggressive cost-cutting campaign, resulting in about $1.2 billion in annual savings. 
 National City announced 4,000 layoffs on Wednesday, and analysts say the strong overlap between National City and PNC could mean the elimination of thousands more jobs. 
 National City was the first Cleveland bank to reopen after a citywide panic in the Great Depression. But today it has come to symbolize the crisis that is hobbling regional lenders across the nation. Its merger deal may set the stage for a second round of consolidation in the industry after a recent wave of blockbuster deals that occurred as the nation's biggest banks swallowed troubled competitors. 
 Bankers say they believe that the government is using its investment program as an inducement to spur healthier banks to do a deal, or withholding investment to urge weaker institutions to consider selling. That could fuel another round of intense deal-making as it becomes clear who is getting financing and who is not.

HEADLINE: More Evidence That the Recession Has Already Arrived

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS; Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
FORECASTING the economy is hard. Figuring out what has already happened should be easier. But even that seems to have eluded many economists this year.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago maintains an index, called the National Activity Index, which in the past has nearly always signaled the beginning of a recession when it fell to a certain level, shown as negative 0.7 in the accompanying chart. It hit that level last December, and has stayed there since.
 This week, the Fed released the reading for September, which was the worst for a single month since 1982 and a sign that the recession is deepening. 
 The actual reading for September was a negative 2.6, although the three-month average was negative 1.8. The lowest three-month reading in 2001 was negative 1.4, indicating that this downturn is worse than that one. 
 ''It's the first aggregate index to clearly break through the mild recession of 2001, and it looks like the reading will break through the recession before that when the October data comes in,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG.
 And yet it was not until last month that many economists began to think a recession was likely, and many believe it began in the third quarter of this year, rather than many months earlier.
 A major reason for that delayed acceptance of the downturn was that the government initially reported the economy grew at an annual rate of more than 3 percent in the second quarter. That has been revised down to 2.8 percent, and may yet be revised lower some months from now. In any case, other factors are considered by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which makes the final decision. In the last two recessions, the downturn was over, or almost over, when the bureau finally decided it had begun.
 The first estimate for third-quarter growth will be released on Thursday and is likely to show a decline. The White House warned this week that the figure would probably be disappointing.
 The accompanying chart shows the Chicago Fed's index in a three-month moving average, which the Fed says is the best way to evaluate the data.
 The index measures the change in the economy each month as shown by 85 indicators of economic activity. A value of zero indicates the economy is growing in line with long-term trends, while values above that indicate above-trend growth. The Fed says that a level of negative 0.7 indicates a recession may well have begun.
 For those who care what the numbers actually signify, a number of plus or minus one indicates the month's results were one standard deviation above normal economic growth. 
 The Fed said the biggest cause of the sharp falloff in September was a decline in income and production, particularly industrial production.
 The Fed has index figures going back to 1967, and in one way the current downturn is the longest ever. The three-month average has been negative -- meaning that the economy is not growing as fast as normal -- for 29 consecutive months beginning in May 2006. The longest previous streak was 25 months, ending in February 1983.
 As can be seen from the chart, only once has the index gone below 0.7 when a recession did not occur. That was in July 1989, and the figure moved back above that level the following month.
 Otherwise, every time it has gone below the recession level a recession has occurred, with the starting date almost always being within two months of the indicator reaching that level. The exception was in the 1973-75 recession, when the indicator did not fall to recession levels until the recession had been under way for nine months.
 Since the indicator hit recession territory last December, that would indicate a recession that started sometime from October to February.
 The Fed says this indicator will also provide evidence that the downturn has ended, when the three-month average rises to a positive 0.2. That does not seem likely to happen soon.

HEADLINE: Advising, and Calming, The Worried Super-Rich

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG

 BODY:
Charles A. Lowenhaupt spoke first on the conference call, informing 15 members of the very rich family that employs him that he could not in good faith promise that their fortune would remain intact through the economic crisis, then gently reminding them to be grateful for their health, loved ones -- and the hundreds of millions of dollars they still had.
 Then five of Mr. Lowenhaupt's employees, each of them intimately familiar with the family's investment portfolio, real estate holdings, trust funds and charitable foundation -- as well as the psychological particulars of the people on the call --took turns describing the ramifications of the market turmoil. Throughout the 30-minute telephone conversation on one of the many recent days of triple-digit declines in the Dow, there was silence from the wealthy family members. Mr. Lowenhaupt had put their lines on mute.
 ''I didn't want family dynamics to get in the way,'' he explained. ''The way the patriarch feels the obligation to act like the patriarch. Nobody had to play out, 'I'm the smartest.' '' 
 Mr. Lowenhaupt, 61, is chief executive of Lowenhaupt Global Advisors, an 18-employee firm that serves as the ''family office'' for four multigenerational clans whose ultrawealthy members are spread throughout the United States and Europe -- a rarefied perch from which to observe the financial fallout. He is a lawyer, investment manager, estate planner, philanthropy expert, intergenerational mediator and a hopeless proselytizer on the near impossibility of simultaneously being rich and happy, who makes sure his clients' bills are paid, homes are staffed, and annual family meetings planned.
 Family offices were once, like ancestral country manors and inherited middle names, considered the province of old money (the Rockefeller family office is probably the best-known model). But the rise -- and growing concentration -- of astronomical wealth over the last couple of decades has expanded the demand for dynasty-like service operations. Wealth management experts estimate that there are now as many as 4,000 family offices nationwide handling a mix of financial planning and high-end concierge services, with the minimum net worth of clients in the nine-figure range. Which means, at least in terms of numbers, the people who have the most to lose.
 ''For the office executives, it's been an exhausting time in terms of hand-holding,'' said Thomas R. Livergood of the Family Wealth Alliance, a consulting firm in Wheaton, Ill., that works with family offices. ''The family members are pointing fingers; they can't believe how it sneaked up on them.''
 Mr. Lowenhaupt, the third-generation of his own family to work for these family-clients, said he was seeing ''anxiety, panic and resignation.''
 His grandfather, Abraham Lowenhaupt, was an income tax lawyer who began counseling wealthy families in St. Louis in the early 1900s. His father inherited many of these clients, and so, after obtaining degrees from Harvard and the University of Michigan law school, did Mr. Lowenhaupt. Besides the four main families, he does legal and financial work for a couple of dozen others.
 Mr. Lowenhaupt declined to identify his clients, citing ethics rules. He said that his firm, which has offices in New York and St. Louis, is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and handles about $840 million of his clients' assets, which do not include some of the families' large real estate holdings. Some clients pay a flat fee, others pay based on the value of their assets -- 50 to 150 basis points, depending on the services used ($1 million to $3 million per year, for example, for a family worth $200 million).
 The mission of family offices is to preserve wealth -- and peace. Recently, when a family member reported that a nanny was having trouble with her mortgage, Mr. Lowenhaupt flew an employee to the family's hometown to negotiate a new loan, guaranteed by the family -- all without the nanny's knowledge.
 Mr. Lowenhaupt is especially interested in the emotional and psychological dynamics among rich relatives, and he considers himself unusual for espousing the view that for heirs, money is more often than not a burden (he once helped a client invest his grandson's trust in sluggish bonds so that it would, against inflation, lose value over time).
 ''All these kids grow up in families where money is important,'' he said. ''But for the inheritors, money is not very interesting. It's like collecting art: the chase is exciting, but being a curator may not be.'' 
 Mr. Lowenhaupt said he once asked a 70-year-old man seeking advice on how to invest a $700 million investment windfall, 'What is the wealth for?' and the fellow struggled with an answer. 
 ''He actually said, 'What are my choices?' '' Mr. Lowenhaupt recalled. For clients who can't readily answer that question, Mr. Lowenhaupt sees philanthropy as ''a great tool to teach people that their wealth has a purpose beyond themselves.''
 Easier said before the downturn. A survey of 186 family offices completed this month by Russ Alan Prince, whose market research firm tracks the habits of the ultrawealthy, found that roughly three-quarters of the offices that offer formal programs in philanthropy, family cohesiveness or financial education (a majority of them do) were planning to discontinue them.
 ''The family offices are zeroing in on investment and tax issues now and basically dropping the touchy-feely stuff altogether,'' Mr. Prince said. 
 A recent Lowenhaupt staff meeting at the firm's office on 52nd Street near Fifth Avenue included discussions of one family's efforts to anonymously donate a large collection of American Indian artifacts and another's need to set up a trust for a needy and persistent in-law ''but eliminate the personal contact,'' as Mr. Lowenhaupt put it. 
 Christopher S. Thompson, the executive who oversees the four individual family executives, updated colleagues on a ''training-wheels philanthropy'' project in which a group of siblings in their 20s are given a six-figure sum annually to give away.
 ''We've talked about the lack of satisfaction they got out of last year's gifts,'' he said. ''We talked about how to choose their areas in such a way that their dollars have a greater impact.''
 But the most pressing matter of the morning was how to handle the reactions to market volatility.
 ''I'm making 10 personal calls a day to family members,'' said Pamela Lent, the firm's senior investment adviser. ''The message we've got to keep putting in is, 'We care, and we want to talk to you individually.''
 Ms. Lent also thanked Mr. Lowenhaupt for reassuring the firm's employees about their own job security, noting that ''if they're worried about employment, about their 401(k)s, that's not something we want them exhibiting to our families.''
 Mr. Lowenhaupt recounted several situations in which family members had contacted the office, wondering if their plans to buy a house or go on vacation were sound in light of the financial situation. One client, a professional investor, had called two days earlier, wanting to sell everything.
 ''I said, 'I don't know what to tell you, but can I ask where you'd put it?' '' Mr. Lowenhaupt said. ''He basically concluded that there was no safe place for it.'' He added: ''And worrying about it wasn't going to get him anywhere. That was what other people might have called an epiphany.''

HEADLINE: Rising Ambitions, Sinking Population

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS EBERSTADT. 
Nicholas Eberstadt is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior adviser to the National Bureau of Asian Research.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 RUSSIA is a rising power today, and will be doing a lot more rising in the decades ahead. At least this is what we hear nowadays from pundits, Western intelligence services, presidential candidates and, of course, Russian officials themselves. The Kremlin's own supreme confidence in this vision of the Russian future was captured nicely by its announcement last year that it expects to be the world's fifth largest economy in 2020, along with China, India, Japan and the United States. Despite the current global economic crisis, Russian officials are still predicting continuing rapid growth for their nation; Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is even talking of a robust 5.5 percent growth rate for Russia for the coming year. 
 To international audiences transfixed by Moscow's military swaggering in Georgia or dazzled by the newfound oil wealth of the Russian petro-state and its billionaires, this notion of an unstoppable Russian ascent may seem plausible, even compelling. To anyone who pays attention to population trends, however, it is absurd. 
 Russia is in the midst of a genuine demographic disaster from which its rulers have no obvious exit strategy. Although the Russia's fortunes (and the Kremlin's ambitions) have waxed on a decade of windfall profits from oil and gas, the human foundations of the Russian nation -- the ultimate sources of the country's wealth and power -- are in increasingly parlous straits.
 Despite net immigration since the end of Communism, the Russian Federation's population is nearly seven million people smaller today than at the start of 1992. In the post-Soviet era, Russia has seen three deaths for every two births. Despite a ''baby bonus'' scheme unveiled by the Kremlin two years ago and a small rise in the birth rate, deaths outnumbered births in Russia by over 250,000 in the first half of 2008. 
 Russia's health situation today is a disaster -- substantially worse than during the Mikhail Gorbachev years or even the Leonid Brezhnev era. In 2006, overall life expectancy in Russia, at fewer than 67 years, was actually lower than it had been at the end of the 1950s, nearly half a century earlier. For a literate, urbanized society during peacetime, such a monumental public health failure is an extraordinary historical anomaly. Russian life expectancy nowadays is about the same as India's, and life expectancy for Russian men, today barely over 60 years, is lower than for their counterparts in Pakistan. 
 Russia's great leap backwards in health is most severe for the country's working-age population. From 1965 to 2005, the death rate (that is, the number dying per 1,000 of population) for Russian men between the ages of 15 and 64 jumped by an average of more than 50 percent. Perhaps even more shocking, rates for working-age women in Russia rose by more than 30 percent during those same years.
 Meanwhile, of course, workers in the rest of Europe (and for that matter in virtually all the rest of the modern world) were becoming progressively healthier and more robust. Nowadays, according to the independent Human Mortality Database, a man from the Netherlands does not face the same risk of death as a 30-year-old man in Russia until that Dutchman is almost 60. 
 In and of themselves, these crippling health trends augur ill for Russia's productivity prospects or economic outlook: it is unrealistic to expect Irish standards of living or rates of economic growth from a population facing Indian mortality schedules. But the economic implications of these trends may be even worse than they appear at first glance. Under current patterns, a 20-year-old man in Russia today stands less than even odds of making it to a notional retirement at age 65. (By contrast, five out of six similar American men can expect to reach their 65th birthday, and the chances are even better in Japan and most of Western Europe.)
 With such a brutally high burden of premature mortality and such a radical foreshortening of working life, the cost-benefit calculus for higher education or additional training tilts against investments in knowledge and skills for the work force. Yet in the modern world economy, investments in ''human capital'' are one of the main engines for stimulating sustained economic growth and eliciting the general spread of national prosperity.
 Because Russia's health crisis looks so utterly abnormal for an industrialized society, one might assume the problem could be quickly remedied through the usual methods: better living standards and more sensible medical policies from the Kremlin. But resolving the Russian health crisis will not be that easy. Russia's per capita income level has already risen by about 80 percent over the past decade (thanks largely to the oil and gas boom), yet this has hardly budged high mortality rates. The trouble is that in the pathological tangle that frames health conditions in modern Russia, the abnormal has become the new norm. 
 Russia's great killers today are not infectious diseases that might be cured with a pill or prevented through an injection. Instead, they are chronic and non-communicable afflictions. According to the World Health Organization, Russia's death rates from cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart attacks and strokes) are roughly four times as high as in the European Union. Mortality from ''external causes'' (homicide, suicide, injury) is more than five times as high. 
 Even a highly effective medical policy cannot hope to control those sorts of epidemics swiftly. After all, heart disease reflects a lifetime's accumulation of insults on the victim's system. And those appalling human losses through injury stem from behavioral habits, including the country's long and deadly romance with the vodka bottle.
 Given the ''negative momentum'' in Russian health trends today, gains over the coming generation may be grudging at best. Simply re-attaining their parents' survival prospects would count as a significant health advance for today's middle-aged Russians. But if Russian men ''succeeded'' in that quest, their life expectancy would still be barely 62 years -- lower than the current estimated level in impoverished Bangladesh. 
 If projections by the United Nations Population Division come to pass, Russia's population will fall by 10 million more from now to 2020. Those same projections envision Russian life expectancy lagging ever further behind global averages by 2020 to 2025, in this view, overall life expectancy in Russia would actually be a year lower than average for the world's less-developed countries -- with the men's expectancy nearly five years below the third world mean. 
 Demography may not be destiny, of course. But this is not a portrait of a successfully and rapidly developing economy -- much less an emerging economic superpower.

HEADLINE: Europe Is Forcing Airlines to Buy Emissions Permits

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
European Union governments gave formal approval Friday to a potentially costly system of capping greenhouse gases from any airline flying into or out of the trade bloc -- just as the airline industry reported new evidence of the impact of a worsening economy.
 Airline chiefs immediately criticized the decision, saying it would cost the industry at least 3.5 billion euros ($4.4 billion) each year to comply. The Europeans are ''acting in a bubble -- even in the middle of a global economic crisis,'' said Giovanni Bisignani, the director general of the International Air Transport Association. 
 European justice ministers meeting in Luxembourg approved the greenhouse gas measures, which oblige airlines, regardless of nationality, that land or take off from an airport in the European Union to join the emissions trading system starting on Jan. 1, 2012.
 The system, created in 2005, already includes heavy industries like cement makers and electricity generators in Europe.
 Industries have complained bitterly about the costs of complying with the system, especially as the global economic situation has worsened. Many airlines also have fought hard to avoid inclusion in the system, saying they can ill afford the extra costs after a period of record high fuel costs.
 The United States has also harshly criticized efforts to apply the rules to American-based carriers, maintaining the rules may violate international aviation agreements. 
 Friday's decision was expected, however, after European governments reached a political agreement with the European Parliament in June.
 The International Air Transport Association has reported that global airline passenger traffic fell 2.9 percent in September, compared with a year earlier. It was the first monthly drop since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. 
 A drop in air freight of 7.7 percent was the first since the market for technology stocks crashed in 2001, the transport association said.
 In another sign of gloom in the industry, Europe's largest airline, Air France-KLM, warned that its earnings would suffer as a result of the financial crisis, sending its shares down sharply.
 The airline said it was struggling to reach a full-year goal of 1 billion euros in operating profit for the 12 months through March 2009. Air France-KLM vowed to curb capacity and freeze costs, but said that it would ''remain comfortably in profit as long as market conditions do not deteriorate any further.''
 The inclusion of aviation in the carbon trading system will raise costs for airlines, which pay for a portion of their emissions permits to comply. The system also will raise costs for passengers if airlines, as expected, pass on the costs by raising ticket prices. 
 European Union climate officials say it is vital to regulate greenhouse gases from aviation because the sector is growing so quickly.
 Low-cost carriers like Ryanair, based in Ireland, have made short hops by air accessible for many more Europeans. Even so, the measures approved on Friday include special provisions that could ease the rules on start-up airlines in faster-growing economies within the union, like those in Eastern Europe.
 New airlines or airlines growing at more than 18 percent annually would be eligible for a one-time limited supply of additional free permits. That measure would ensure that countries ''with initially very low but increasing mobility rates are not penalized by the scheme,'' European Union governments said in a statement.
 The airline industry says its gases represent a small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions and that the European measures will be ineffective without a global agreement. Environmentalists say the effect of vapor and emissions from jet engines at altitude could magnify their effect on the climate.

HEADLINE: Ailing, Iceland Invites Tourists And Dollars

BYLINE: By GREGORY ROTH

 BODY:
Its economy went into a tailspin three weeks ago, and it is now seeking billions of dollars in rescue funds. Its stock market has fallen about 90 percent, and its currency has lost nearly half its value this year. 
 With a long list of financial troubles, Iceland may not immediately come to mind as a travel destination. But that has not stopped the country's tourist board, along with the airline Icelandair, from trying. They are pitching the country as an island of bargains, especially to Americans who hold a suddenly valuable commodity: dollars.
 ''With the dramatic increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Icelandic krona, Iceland is now a top bargain destination, giving consumers nearly twice the spending power compared to last year,'' their advertisement says. 
 The campaign seems to have worked. Thorsteinn Egilsson, managing director of Icelandair U.S.A., said tourists had responded strongly to a $559 package that covers the cost of a round-trip flight from New York or Boston and three nights at the Hilton hotel in Reykjavik. Bookings are up by 72 percent over the period a year earlier, Mr. Egilsson said. 
 ''We wanted to inform the market that Iceland is cheaper,'' he said. ''And it's really taken off.''
 Einar Gustavsson, director of the Icelandic Tourist Board in the United States, said the campaign was directly related to the country's financial crisis. ''We desperately need foreign currency,'' he said. ''Foreign travel by Iceland's citizens has dropped 40 percent since the crash, so that leaves a lot of empty seats on Icelandair.''
 In a typical year, according to the tourist board, 60,000 Americans visit Iceland, and the country has marketed itself to young urban professionals in search of an exotic weekend excursion. The message to young professionals has changed: now it is that the trip you were thinking about is much cheaper. 
 Mr. Gustavsson hastened to add that the tourist board wanted to make sure that Iceland kept its status as an offbeat, exotic destination. It's still a windswept island of cool cafes and geothermal geysers, he said. It's just that for an American visitor, ''a $100 meal now costs $50.''

HEADLINE: Yankees Say They Would Have Left Bronx if Pushed

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Randy Levine, the president of the Yankees, told a Congressional hearing Friday that if the city had not issued tax-exempt financing for the team's new stadium, it would have left town.
 ''It's been no secret for many years'' that the team would move if it could not save tens of millions of dollars on financing with tax-free bonds, Levine told the House subcommittee on domestic policy. He added: ''There was no shortage of suitors. We see ourselves as a paradigm in professional sports.''
 Levine refused to be specific about the other suitors, but when asked after the hearing if New Jersey has wooed the Yankees in recent years he said, ''Absolutely!'' 
 He did not say if the interest had emanated from the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the landlord of the Meadowlands complex. But Carl Goldberg, a board member since 2002 and chairman since 2003, said by telephone, ''I've never had conversations with any representatives of the New York Yankees about them relocating to the Meadowlands.''
 George Zoffinger, the former president, confirmed the history.
 Since the 1980s, the Yankees had sought a replacement for Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and Manhattan. And in 1987, New Jersey voters rejected by a 2-to-1 margin a $185 million bond proposal to build a baseball stadium, presumably for the Yankees.
 That did not end speculation that George M. Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, was looking to New Jersey at least as leverage to get what he wanted in New York.
 The allure of New Jersey endured into 2006 -- years after the team's annual attendance reached three million and then four million. In June 2005, at a gala unveiling for designs of the new ballpark, Steinbrenner declared the team would stay in the Bronx. But at that time, the financing deal with the city had not been reached.
 In early 2006, the city's Economic Development Corporation recommended how to make the stadium project eligible for more than $900 million in tax-exempt financing.
 In a memo to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Andrew Alper, then the E.D.C. president, said the likely result of not providing the tax-free bonds ''was the loss of the New York Yankees.'' Alper said the Meadowlands ''could easily be reconfigured to accommodate a stadium for the relocation of a major league baseball franchise'' and that the Yankees' appeal would let them relocate ''within the tri-state area, the country and even internationally.''
 Alper said earlier this week that he did not recall the details of the memo or whether the Yankees had made specific threats to move.
 After the hearing Friday, Seth W. Pinsky, the E.D.C. president, said he was not in his position when the Yankees were approved for the bonds. ''The Yankees clearly were interested in staying in the Bronx in a stadium that accommodated their needs,'' Pinsky said.
 Levine said he made the team's position clear during the negotiations that led to the 2006 financing deal. He said in a telephone interview that the team would have acted on options if the Bronx talks had died. ''Since the stadium in the Bronx did happen,'' he said, ''nothing was pursued.''
 The often-testy hearing came four days after the Internal Revenue Service agreed to let the Yankees and the Mets issue more tax-exempt bonds to complete their stadium financing and for the Nets to issue them for their new arena near downtown Brooklyn. 
 Much of the testimony Friday focused on how the city's Department of Finance assessed the value of the land underneath the new Yankee Stadium. 
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat from Westchester, said assessments of $26.8 million and $204 million, reached on consecutive days in 2006, were evidence that the city had ''cooked'' the valuations to help the Yankees maximize the tax-exempt financing they wanted. He testified that an ''illegal'' methodology was used to reach the bigger figure, which was based on far higher land sales for sites in Manhattan, while the smaller one used far lower land sales for properties in the Bronx and Staten Island.
 Martha E. Stark, the city's finance commissioner, testified that the lower figure did not reflect the land's value with a $1 billion ballpark on it. Her agency, she said, ''realized that the $26.8 million value was wrong and that they used vacant land rather than land that had benefited from government infrastructure improvement and investments.''
 Dennis J. Kucinich, the chairman of the subcommittee, said the city cited attorney-client privilege in its refusal to provide documents about the changing land values.
 Kucinich did not make eye contact with Levine when Levine reminded Kucinich that ''the City of Cleveland, while you were mayor and on your watch, became the first American city to default on its bonds since the Great Depression.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senses Opportunities In Statehouses

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Dan Frosch contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Unlike their counterparts in Congress, who are expecting a wave of Democratic Party victories on Election Day, lawmakers in statehouses across the country are finding there are as many opportunities for Republicans as Democrats. 
 The bad news for Republicans in 2006, when Democrats surged to power and majority control in many legislative chambers, is now their good fortune as Democrats struggle to retain those gains. 
 ''There are vulnerable Democrats in traditionally Republican seats, and the natural dynamic is that Republicans would win back at least some of these,'' said Lawrence R. Jacobs, the director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. ''But the name brand for the Republican Party has taken a hit, and these lower-party races could be one of the places that that shows up. It's a mixed-up year.''
 Of the top 12 battleground chambers as identified by the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan research group, six are considered opportunities for a flip from a Republican to Democratic majority, and six are the reverse, with possible flips from Democratic to Republican control. 
 Certainly, many Democrats are getting a boost from an energized party and the growth of newly registered voters, candidates and party leaders say. But Republicans also see chances for gains. 
 State lawmakers touch American daily life in myriad ways, including economic development and road repair. And many of the victors of 2008 will be in office in 2010, when statehouses get to flex some muscle. That is when Congressional boundaries will be redrawn under the next census; in almost every state, the party in power in the legislature gets a big voice in making the map that can have a profound impact on future elections.
 Altogether, 79 percent of the nearly 7,400 state legislative seats are up for grabs. And of the 84 chambers in 44 states that are having legislative elections, at least 28 are being seriously fought over for majority control, according to the Conference of State Legislatures. 
 ''This is the table-setting election for 2010,'' said Tim Storey, who tracks elections at the Conference of State Legislatures.
 Races like Nancy Riley's in Oklahoma, which could determine whether a tie in the Senate between Republicans and Democrats is broken, epitomize the fractured terrain that voters and candidates are facing. Ms. Riley was a Republican, first elected to the Senate in 2000, but then became a Democrat in 2006. This is her first run since the switch, and she is counting on voters not getting too worked up about it.
 ''The people know where I stand, and what I stand for,'' said Ms. Riley, a first-grade teacher by training. ''They've seen me for eight years at bake sales, football games and chamber of commerce events.''
 In other races, voters might be confused about which banner a candidate is even sailing under.
 Ryan Zinke, for example, a Navy special forces veteran who describes himself as a ''Teddy Roosevelt Republican'' in running for the Senate from Whitefish, Mont., advocates tough regulation of big business, environmental protection and a government that watches out for the little guy. Many of the positions are not so different from those espoused by his opponent, Brittany MacLean, a Democrat who has worked for conservation groups.
 In almost every race, candidates and party officials around the country say, economic anxiety is a common thread. The concerns are filtered through a prism of local issues, like schools and sales taxes, and altered as well by access -- many Americans can personally lobby their local state representative over coffee or on back-to-school night. But that is always how it is on the political front lines, candidates and officeholders say. 
 In Maine, Mary Black Andrews, a Republican with a colorful resume (nursing, followed by a stint as a jam-and-jelly business entrepreneur), is facing Peter B. Bowman, a Democrat and retired Navy officer and first-term senator. The race is a linchpin to whether Democrats -- currently the majority by one seat in Augusta -- can retain control.
 Both candidates are grappling with an abrupt shift this year in the tourism economy, the lifeblood of the district with its fine dining, overnight stays, day trips and fried clams, as visitors have cut back their spending. 
 In Indiana, where Democrats control the House 51 to 49, Republicans are hoping to swing to the majority by picking up seats that Democrats narrowly won in 2006. Democrats have the same idea -- they are looking at three districts barely won by Republicans. The House is particularly vulnerable to majority-minority flips, having switched party control 15 times in the last 80 years.
 One of those races pits a Democratic challenger, Mary Ann Sullivan, an educational consultant, against an incumbent, Jon Elrod, in a working-class district in Marion County, which includes Indianapolis. Jobs and property taxes shape their discussion.
 ''The economy. The economy. The economy,'' Ms. Sullivan said. ''It's just dominating everything.''
 But with narrow margins in many states, the ''what ifs'' are also everywhere.
 If Democrats gain control of the New York State Senate -- a distinct possibility, people in both parties say, with only a one-seat Republican majority -- it will be the first time since 1935 that all of New York's government will be in control of one party. 
 If Democrats in Minnesota can pick up five seats in the House -- a long shot, but possible -- they will have veto-proof majorities in both chambers in facing Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Mr. Pawlenty, whose term expires in 2011, has been campaigning fiercely around his state to support Republicans in the Legislature and to stave off an outcome that would sharply diminish his power in St. Paul.
 But in keeping with their out-of-the-spotlight nature, local races also do not always move with national tide. Since 1940, the party winning the White House has added seats in state legislatures about two-thirds of the time.
 Voter registration surges -- a keystone effort of Senator Barack Obama's campaign in particular as the Democratic nominee for president -- might also strike a glancing blow in only some races because the numbers are in many cases concentrated in areas where Democratic state legislators are not endangered.
 Ms. Riley, the switched-party Democratic senator in Tulsa, said the voter-register numbers run up by the Obama campaign will mean nothing to her chances one way or another. She said ''he doesn't poll well in the district.'' 
 The opposite is the case in the suburbs of Las Vegas, where the Republicans' 11-to-10 majority in the State Senate is being tested by surging numbers of Democratic voters and widespread pain from the housing meltdown that has hit Nevada hard.
 Democrats there have taken aim at two incumbent senators, including a former candidate for governor, Bob Beers, trying to portray him and other Republicans as out of step with the new emerging mainstream.
 ''We're playing a lot of defense,'' said Zac Moyle, executive director of the Nevada Republican Party.

HEADLINE: Sothebys Suffers Losses On Guaranteed Prices

BYLINE: Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Disappointing art auctions in London and Hong Kong this month cost Sotheby's $15 million in losses on guarantees to sellers, Bloomberg News reported. The losses resulted when an artwork either sold for less than the minimum price the auction house had guaranteed or did not sell at all, Sotheby's said in a filing late Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. An auction house agrees to pay some consignors a guarantee regardless of whether an item sells to encourage collectors to offer a work through it rather than a rival. A year ago Sotheby's disclosed a loss of $14.6 million on guarantees from its Impressionist and modern-art sale in New York. Sotheby's chief executive, Bill Ruprecht, said in May that he would reduce risk by cutting guarantees. On Thursday the company (which recently auctioned Damien Hirst's ''Beautiful Inside My Head,'' above) said that guarantees had fallen 50 percent from a year ago and that it planned to ''continue to substantially reduce its use of auction guarantees until stability is restored in the global economy and financial markets.''

HEADLINE: On the Stump, Plumbers and Taxes

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER, JEFF ZELENY and FARHANA HOSSAIN

 BODY:
Day after day, and sometimes several times a day, the candidates have pounded out their stump speeches. Now, as Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama head into the final week before the election, the speeches have become a back-and-forth on taxes, the economy and a man in the plumbing business named Joe. Both of the speeches analyzed here were given on Tuesday; Mr. Obama's was in Miami and Mr. McCain's in Bensalem, Pa.
 Mr. Obama's remarks were crafted by Jon Favreau, his chief speechwriter, and a team of other writers. Like Mr. McCain's recent addresses, Mr. Obama's are now delivered with the aid of a teleprompter -- largely so his message of the day, typically a fresh criticism of Mr. McCain, is delivered intact.
 But Mr. Obama also improvises a good deal throughout the speech, reprising some lines from speeches that he has delivered through the course of the long campaign, before he ends with a crescendo that tries to captures the hopes of America. 
 Mr. McCain's speech was written by Mark Salter, a close adviser and the co-author of his books. The speech, which is much more grounded and combative than Mr. Obama's, was inaugurated on Oct. 13 and harks back to the old Mr. McCain, the happy warrior of the primaries and his presidential run in 2000. Throughout most of it, Mr. McCain criticizes Mr. Obama on taxes, energy policy, health care and his readiness to be president.
 Mr. McCain thanks his wife, Cindy, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who introduced Mr. McCain here. Says he is proud to introduce his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, to America.
 Mr. McCain suggests Mr. Obama flip-flopped on World Series teams, drawing loud boos. ''It's kind of like the way he campaigns on tax cuts, but then votes for tax increases after he's elected,'' he says. The Obama campaign says Mr. Obama, a die-hard Chicago White Sox fan, had switched to the Philadelphia Phillies for the Series and had simply said nice things about the Tampa Bay Rays when some Rays players endorsed him at a rally in Tampa, Fla.
 Mr. McCain mentions Joe Wurzelbacher more often than he does Ms. Palin, and his crowds love Joe. Mr. Obama, in an exchange about taxes with Mr. Wurzelbacher in Ohio, had said: ''Everybody's so pinched that business is bad for everybody, and I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.'' The refrain has become a McCain stump staple. While Mr. McCain does not call Mr. Obama a socialist directly, he says Mr. Obama ''believes in redistributing wealth.''
 Mr. McCain also says that ''the small businesses Senator Obama would tax provide 16 million jobs in America.'' But that assertion has been disputed, with Mr. Obama saying most small business owners would not see increases in their taxes.
 ''We can't spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight,'' Mr. McCain says without mentioning President Bush.
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. told supporters at a fund-raiser last Sunday that if Mr. Obama was elected, the world's leaders would test his mettle as a young president, just as they did with President John F. Kennedy. Mr. McCain uses the remark to cast doubt on Mr. Obama's readiness.
 Mr. McCain's plan for the Treasury to buy troubled mortgages has moved down to the middle of his stump speech from its previous top billing during the most acute days of the financial crisis. Opposition to pork-barrel spending has long been a centerpiece of Mr. McCain's campaign, but it has moved lower down the speech recently.
 He takes out a marker when he promises to veto earmarks. Mr. McCain veers from the prepared text to talk about his favorite Obama earmark -- the overhead projector in a Chicago planetarium. Mr. McCain begins his next thought with ''if I am elected president.'' But the crowd objects to the ''if'' and shouts ''when.'' The crowd chants: ''John McCain! John McCain!'' From here on, Mr. McCain says ''when I am elected.''
 Most of what Mr. McCain says about energy was not in the prepared text released by the campaign. He riffs from memories of last summer, when ''drill, baby, drill'' was the takeaway phrase from his speeches. The issue has been bumped down to make way for Joe the Plumber. ''I'm sick and tired of sending our money to Hugo Chavez,'' he says, drawing a huge cheer.
 Mention of the ''national media'' elicits a chorus of boos. Mr. McCain says Mr. Obama is ''measuring the drapes'' for the White House and ''planning'' with Democratic leaders in Congress ''to raise taxes, increase spending and concede defeat in Iraq.''
 In his closing, Mr. McCain offers fighting words for the tough times. ''I know you're worried,'' he says, adding, ''We are at a moment of national crisis that will determine our future.'' But he urges Americans to fight: ''Fight for a new direction for our country. Fight for what's right for America. Fight to clean up the mess of corruption, infighting and selfishness in Washington. Fight to get our economy out of the ditch and back in the lead.'' The crowd goes wild.
 Mr. Obama thanks the crowd, local politicians and members of Congress, his wife, Michelle, and Colin L. Powell, who endorsed him last Sunday. Mrs. Obama seldom appears with her husband. She usually keeps her own itinerary.
 Mr. Obama says that the McCain campaign's tactics are ''getting so bad'' that even Ms. Palin denounced its tactics. Ms. Palin said last week that ''conventional ways of campaigning that includes those robocalls'' may be irritating to voters, but she has not denounced her campaign's negative robocalls against Mr. Obama. Mr. Obama also chides his opponent's campaign for ''misleading ads,'' but the Obama campaign has also run recent advertisements that distort Mr. McCain's position on immigration and stem cells.
 Joe the Plumber has become a central part of Mr. Obama's speech as well. The campaign has steadily ratcheted up the intensity of the argument. Mr. Wurzelbacher has conceded that he would probably get a tax break under Mr. Obama's plan because he does not yet make $250,000 a year. ''I've got nothing but love for Joe the Plumber, '' Mr. Obama says.
 On the stump, Mr. Obama often repeats that he will give tax cuts to 95 percent of working families. (An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that Mr. Obama's plan would benefit 81 percent of all households when retirees and those without children were figured in.) In his stump speech, Mr. McCain counters Mr. Obama's claim: ''How do you cut income taxes for 95 percent of Americans, when more than 40 percent pay no income taxes right now?'' Mr. Obama's response: ''Only some people may pay income tax, but everybody pays payroll tax and sales tax and property taxes, and they need relief, too.''
 After laying out the bad economic news, he tries to lighten the mood with a message of hope: ''We have risen to meet these challenges -- not as Democrats, not as Republicans, not as independents, but as Americans.''
 Mr. Obama continues to criticize Mr. McCain on the economy and repeatedly ties him to Mr. Bush's policies, in one instance using Mr. McCain's own words. On the stump, Mr. McCain accuses Mr. Obama of being ''more interested in controlling who gets your piece of pie than he is in growing the pie.'' Mr. Obama counters: ''After eight years of Bush-McCain economics, the pie is shrinking. And what's left of the pie has been eaten by millionaires and billionaires. Everybody here wants some pie.'' The crowd chants, ''We want pie! We want pie! We want pie!''
 For most of the first year of his candidacy, Mr. Obama was reluctant to infuse his speech with the personal anecdote of his mother. Now, he almost always mentions her battle with cancer when speaking of health care.
 City by city, the crowds almost always begin stirring with applause at this moment of the stump speech, as Mr. Obama asks people to sacrifice and to believe.
 ''We all love this country, no matter where we live, no matter where we come from,'' he says. The crowd begins chanting, ''U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' For Mr. Obama, this riff offers a return to the basic tenets of the 2004 Democratic convention speech that brought him to the forefront of national politics: there is no red America or blue America, but one America.
 ''Everybody here has a story,'' Mr. Obama says in his closing, reminding the crowd that his success is one such American story. He adds: ''Even though your parents and grandparents were born here, maybe they didn't have the right to vote, but they said to themselves, you know what? If I work hard, if I'm willing to march and struggle, then maybe someday my child might be able to run for Congress, might be able to run for the United States Senate, might be able to run for president of the United States of America.'' Aides say the senator developed the riff himself, at an appearance before the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation three weeks ago. On most nights, the crowd slowly rises to its feet as Mr. Obama addresses -- without mentioning directly -- this moment in American history.

HEADLINE: Federal Aid Seen as Vital To a Merger In Detroit

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
A possible merger of General Motors and Chrysler increasingly appears to hinge on federal aid, according to people with knowledge of the merger talks.
 G.M. and Chrysler's majority owner, Cerberus Capital Management, are said to be committed to a merger of the two troubled automakers but have yet to line up financing to inject more cash into the companies.
 But investors are hesitant to put money into the deal without federal assistance in some form, possibly a direct loan or an equity stake, said people close to the talks who spoke on the condition that they not be named. 
 One person said Friday that G.M. was pursuing government assistance. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, however, said the rescue package was more focused on financial institutions. 
 G.M. and Chrysler, two of Detroit's Bit Three automakers, have been in merger talks for several weeks.
 Sales at both companies have fallen drastically this year, and they are furiously cutting costs to preserve cash, which they are burning through rapidly. Speculation is growing about possible bankruptcy. 
 On Friday, Chrysler's chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, told employees that more white-collar job cuts would be made beginning next month. 
 ''As we resize the company to reflect declines in volumes, we know we must find new and more efficient ways to conduct our business operations,'' Mr. Nardelli said in an e-mail message to workers.
 The company said it planned to reduce its white-collar staff of 18,500 by 25 percent by the end of the year. 
 Salaried workers will be offered buyouts and early retirement packages in the next two weeks. If not enough employees take the offers, Chrysler will start involuntary layoffs beginning in December.
 On Thursday, Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman, sent a letter to executives saying that the company would lay off an unspecified number of salaried workers later this year and would cut benefits and cancel bonuses.
 In the letter, Mr. Wagoner said the ''dramatic impact'' on industry sales from the global credit crisis was forcing the cutbacks.
 ''In this regard, we expect to initiate involuntary separations in some areas of the business, late this year and early in 2009,'' the letter said.
 G.M. already announced this summer a series of moves to cut its costs by $10 billion.
 But the automaker, which lost $18.8 billion in the first six months of the year, is still burning through more than $1 billion in cash a month.
 Mr. Wagoner and other G.M. executives are said to be convinced that a merger with Chrysler would provide broad synergies and cost savings.
 A merger with Chrysler would also bring G.M. much-needed cash. Chrysler, which has lost more than $1 billion this year, said in June that it had $11.7 billion in cash.
 The merger would require new capital from outside investors to cover revamping costs. 
 Banks and other financial institutions, however, have balked at investing in the deal without some guarantees of government aid.
 Washington has already committed to lending automakers $25 billion for new technology to improve the fuel efficiency of their vehicles. 
 Michigan legislators have also appealed to the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to help consumers regain greater access to car loans as part of the $700 billion economic rescue package for Wall Street. Tighter lending standards have made it difficult for many shoppers to obtain financing. 
 Skepticism about the merger contributed to another tough day for G.M. shares. They fell 2.4 percent, to $5.95. 
 Cerberus, which acquired Chrysler last year for $7.4 billion, wants an equity stake in a combined G.M.-Chrysler but is not seeking an active role in management, according to two people close to the talks.
 The private equity firm also has no interest in forcing out Mr. Wagoner as chief executive in a merger, these people said.
 Cerberus may also not seek board seats in the merged company. 
 Board representation would make the firm a so-called insider under federal securities rules, and limit its ability to sell or increase its stock position.
 The merger talks have taken on an increased urgency as the United States vehicle market continues to deteriorate.
 Industry sales are down 12.8 percent this year, but they fell 26.6 percent in September.
 The slowdown is hurting all carmakers, including Toyota, which said Friday that its global sales fell 4 percent in the quarter that ended in September, its first quarterly drop in seven years. 
 The United States sales market, according to one forecasting firm, has been even worse in October.
 Sales for the month are expected to decline nearly 29 percent from October 2007, and 9 percent from September's level, according to an analysis by the auto Web site Edmunds.com.
 Edmunds projects that G.M.'s sales will fall 40 percent in October compared with last year, and Chrysler will drop by 38 percent. An Edmunds analyst said the merger talks and dire financial positions of the automakers were having some impact on the deepening slide in sales. 
 ''All of the frenzied speculation about the future of Detroit's automakers, ranging from mergers to bankruptcies, surely adds to the consumers' retreat from buying a car,'' said Michelle Krebs, senior editor of the Edmunds site, AutoObserver.com.

HEADLINE: Building a White House Team Before the Election Is Decided

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the economy in tatters at home and two wars still raging abroad, Senator Barack Obama's team is preparing for a fast start, should he win the election, to what could be the most challenging and volatile transition between presidents in 75 years.
 Mr. Obama's advisers are sifting resumes, compiling policy options and discussing where to hold his first news conference as president-elect. Democrats say Mr. Obama hopes to name key members of his White House, economic and security teams soon after the election. His transition chief has even drafted a sample Inaugural Address.
 Presidential nominees typically start preparing for transitions before the election, but Mr. Obama's plans appear more extensive than in the past and more advanced than those of Senator John McCain, his Republican opponent. Mr. McCain has also assigned confidants to prepare for a transition but instructed them to limit their activities as he tries to rescue his foundering campaign, Republicans said.
 Already the capital is buzzing with discussion about who would fill top positions. Obama advisers mention Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader, as a possible White House chief of staff, and Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as Treasury secretary. To demonstrate bipartisanship, advisers said Mr. Obama might ask two members of President Bush's cabinet to stay, including Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. 
 Mr. McCain might also want Mr. Gates to stay, according to Republicans close to the campaign, or he might reach beyond the party by tapping Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat turned independent, to head the Pentagon or the State Department. Republicans said possible Treasury secretaries include John A. Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, and Robert B. Zoellick, the president of the World Bank. And some see former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman as chief of staff.
 No Time to Wait
 Neither campaign would publicly discuss its transition planning for fear of appearing presumptuous with little more than a week to go before voters render their judgment. But as the nation braces to change leaders for the first time since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, White House officials and independent analysts said it was especially imperative for both campaigns to be prepared because of the acute economic and national security threats confronting the country.
 ''The stakes are higher than ever,'' said Joseph W. Hagin, who helped steer Mr. Bush's transition eight years ago and then served as deputy White House chief of staff until last summer. ''You don't have a lot of time, especially today. There's not much time for a shallow learning curve. It's very steep.''
 The handover from Mr. Bush to his successor was already shaping up as the first wartime transition in 40 years, and the White House has instituted new policies to smooth the process. The collapse of Wall Street only heightened the urgency, making this potentially the most tumultuous change of power since Franklin D. Roosevelt took over from Herbert Hoover in the throes of the Great Depression in 1933.
 Both campaigns have been forced to recalibrate their post-election thinking and consider how involved the president-elect should be in asserting leadership in the 77 days between the election and the Jan. 20 inauguration. In setting economic policy, Mr. Bush would presumably be willing to defer to some degree to Mr. McCain should he win; the Democratic Congress would presumably follow Mr. Obama's lead.
 Mr. Obama has already signaled support for a lame-duck Congressional package of public works spending, aid to cities and states and tax rebates for workers. Democrats close to his campaign anticipate that he would not wait for the inauguration to weigh in on economic policy in other ways as well.
 ''His inclination is very much going to be to try to help shape the direction of policy'' with the Bush administration, rather than ''just let them stew in it until Jan. 20,'' said a senior adviser, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 
 Still, if he does win, Mr. Obama has to be careful about going too far before he actually takes office, as he seemed to acknowledge the other day.
 ''We are going to have one president at a time until Jan. 20, when the new president is sworn in,'' he said after meeting with advisers in Richmond, Va. ''So, you know, there is always a transition period. I don't want to get too much ahead of ourselves.''
 And Mr. McCain has been quick to accuse Mr. Obama of overconfidence. ''Senator Obama is measuring the drapes,'' he said on the campaign trail the other day, as he often has. 
 Reflection of Campaigns
 Interviews with dozens of Republicans and Democrats over the past two weeks suggest that the transition efforts mirror the campaigns -- where Mr. Obama's is methodical and highly regimented, Mr. McCain's is more tightly held and seat of the pants. 
 Mr. Obama's transition team is led by a former White House chief of staff, John D. Podesta, who has been preparing for the task at the research organization he runs, the Center for American Progress, since long before it was clear who would win his party's nomination. Two longtime advisers to Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the vice-presidential nominee -- Edward Kaufman and Mark H. Gitenstein -- are serving as his representatives to the team, although Mr. Biden is said to be so superstitious that he refuses to discuss the transition.
 Mr. Podesta has been mapping out the transition so systematically that he has already written a draft Inaugural Address for Mr. Obama, which he published this summer in a book called ''The Power of Progress.'' The speech calls for rebuilding a ''grand alliance'' with the rest of the world, bringing troops home from Iraq, recommitting to the war in Afghanistan, cutting poverty in half in 10 years and reducing greenhouse gases 80 percent by 2050.
 The Obama team has four groups, which in turn are divided into roughly a dozen subgroups, according to Democrats informed about the effort. At first, they said, there were three main groups -- for personnel, executive actions and legislative strategy -- but the team recently added a fourth reflecting the imperatives of the economic crisis and known as lame duck.
 As he sets about trying to build a team, Mr. Obama has several possibilities for White House chief of staff, most notably Mr. Daschle, his close adviser, although that could be complicated because Mr. Daschle's wife is a lobbyist. Other possibilities mentioned by Democrats include Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, former Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and Mr. Obama's Senate chief of staff, Pete Rouse. Mr. Podesta, who held the job under President Bill Clinton, could also be recruited for another tour of duty.
 Besides Mr. Gates, some Obama advisers favor keeping Dr. James B. Peake, the veterans affairs secretary. But Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has made clear to colleagues that he has no desire to stay on no matter who wins, and neither nominee is inclined to ask him, associates say. Instead, Obama advisers are weighing a short-term appointment of an elder statesman to get through the current crisis and help instill confidence in global markets. The names being mentioned include the former Federal Reserve chief Paul A. Volcker and former Treasury Secretaries Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers.
 But one senior adviser said it would be important to send a message of change at a time of economic crisis. ''You can expect a fresh face instead of a recycled face'' at the Treasury, the adviser said. He said that would include the boyish-looking Mr. Geithner, 47, who worked at the Treasury under Mr. Clinton and his Republican predecessors and has generally gotten high marks for his role in shaping the government response to the current crisis. 
 To run his transition effort, Mr. McCain tapped Mr. Lehman, the former Navy secretary who served on the commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks. Two other advisers, William E. Timmons, a Washington lobbyist, and William Ball, another former Navy secretary, are assisting.
 Like other 9/11 commissioners, Mr. Lehman has expressed strong concern over slow transitions that leave a new administration short-handed to deal with an early crisis. But Mr. McCain has been leery about being too forward-leaning. Many Republicans who would normally be consulted about plans and personnel said they had detected little preparation -- perhaps, they said, out of a sense that it would only be an exercise in ''going through the motions,'' as one put it.
 Many Republicans believe Mr. McCain would bring his top campaign staff with him to the White House, including Rick Davis, the campaign manager, whose history as a lobbyist has come up repeatedly during the election. Others who would most likely accompany Mr. McCain to the White House include Mark Salter, his adviser and alter ego; Douglas Holtz-Eakin, his economics adviser; and Randy Scheunemann, his national security adviser. 
 For the Treasury, some Republicans said McCain might turn to his primary rival, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, or even Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. Mr. Zoellick, a former deputy secretary of state, is a possibility for either the State Department or the Treasury Department, Republicans said.
 A Helping Hand
 The Bush administration has extended more help to its would-be successors than any past White House, relying on an intelligence law Mr. Bush signed after the 2004 election authorizing the government to conduct pre-election background checks on transition officials designated by the campaigns. 
 For the first time, the president-elect's advisers will be given interim security clearances and access to classified information the day after the election.
 The White House also formed a 14-member transition council that met last week for the first time to coordinate everything from passing over domestic security duties to helping the new team find parking. Mr. Bush's aides are preparing a series of briefings and a proposed schedule that they will offer the incoming team.
 Joshua B. Bolten, the White House chief of staff, has made a seamless transition a priority, mindful of the rocky, recount-shortened period in 2000-1 and a slow confirmation process that left many national security officials still unconfirmed when Al Qaeda attacked eight months into the administration. 
 Several Republicans said Mr. Bolten was planning to recruit his predecessor, Andrew H. Card Jr., to help guide this year's transition.
 White House aides said their interest was strictly nonpartisan and noted that they would offer each campaign the exact same help. 
 ''This is not about politics,'' said Blake Gottesman, Mr. Bolten's deputy. ''It's about good governance. Everything will be done with full parity.''

HEADLINE: While McCain Looked Away, Florida Shifted

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
For Senator John McCain, it was not supposed to be this way. From a commanding lead last spring, in a state where Senator Barack Obama did not campaign in the primaries and only hired a state director in June, Mr. McCain is now locked in a neck-and-neck race for a trove of electoral votes that is vital to his hopes of victory. 
 His once-close relationship with Gov. Charlie Crist is reportedly strained. And Mr. Obama has blanketed the state with advertising and built a huge get-out-the-vote operation -- on vivid display this week in the long lines for early voting. The sight dispirited Republican leaders here.
 Even as state Republicans sent up flares over the summer, warning that the Florida of 2008 is not what it was in 2004, Mr. McCain yielded the airwaves to Mr. Obama, focusing his attention, money and energy on other states. Mr. McCain's campaign waited until Sept. 1 to begin a serious round of advertising. 
 Mr. McCain clearly could still win the state's 27 electoral votes. But the battle in Florida is offering -- on the widest stage of any of the contested primary states -- an object lesson in the disparities in the resources, aggressiveness and political cunning that Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama are taking to contests across the country. 
 It is a case study of the troubles of the McCain campaign, the problems of its own making as well as those caused by forces beyond the campaign's control, including a deeply troubled economy that is sharply driving up home foreclosures in many areas of the state. And it provides vivid evidence of the Obama campaign's success in using its money and organizational skills to put Republicans on the defensive in once-safe states.
 ''He has the best political organization for a presidential campaign that I have ever seen here,'' Tom Slade, a former state Republican chairman, said of Mr. Obama. ''Bar none. He has run a phenomenally good campaign.''
 Mr. Obama's huge financial advantage has turned out to be more lopsided here than in any of the other contested states, displaying, in an outsized way, what Mr. McCain is facing in states like Colorado and Indiana. 
 For the week that ended Thursday, Mr. Obama spent $4.2 million on advertisements, compared with $1 million by Mr. McCain, according to Campaign Media Analysis Group, an independent group that monitors campaign advertising. It was almost impossible to turn on a television this week without seeing an Obama advertisement showing Mr. McCain saying he had voted with President Bush ''90 percent of the time.''
 Mr. Obama's campaign moved to exploit this state's increasingly popular, and relatively new, early voting program in a way Mr. McCain did not. He came here for two days this week -- as did Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton -- using high-profile appearances to hand out literature and urge supporters who turned out to vote, often right up the street from the rally. The result could be seen in long lines of people at early voting sites.
 Mr. McCain's advisers said they had put far less effort into the early voting program, instead sticking with what has worked for Florida Republicans for a decade: building up their margin with absentee ballots. But several Republicans said they were afraid that emphasis was missing the way voting behavior is changing here.
 Mr. Obama has used sophisticated measures here to find and register new supporters. And Florida statistics this week, which sent a shiver of fear through Republicans, attest to his success: Democrats now have a 660,000 edge in voter registration over Republicans in the state, compared with a Democratic advantage of 280,000 voters in 2006. 
 Buzz Jacobs, the southeast regional manager of Mr. McCain's campaign, suggested that Democrats would have trouble getting all those new voters to the polls. ''They traditionally have a better voter registration system, and we have a better turnout operation,'' he said.
 But even several state Republicans said they saw evidence that Mr. Obama was bringing new and highly effective methods to the state to find voters and turn them out. 
 ''I've gotten seven calls from live Obama volunteers -- and the reason I'm getting calls is because I signed up on their Web site to get notifications from their campaign,'' said Sally Bradshaw, a Republican who was a senior political adviser to Jeb Bush, the former governor. 
 Ms. Bradshaw, who supported Mitt Romney in the primary, had signed up for the list to keep informed about a rival. ''I haven't received any McCain calls,'' she said.
 Mr. McCain is in this spot today in part because of the conclusion by his campaign this summer that Florida, if competitive, was not as tough as it once was, and that there were more pressing states. Mr. Bush won here by five percentage points in 2004. The Democratic Party had earned months of bad publicity by pressuring its presidential candidates not to campaign in the state before its primary because Florida scheduled its vote earlier than party rules allowed. 
 Political history suggested that Mr. Obama, as an African-American, would have trouble winning support from two of the state's key constituencies: Hispanics and Jews. And this is the state of one of Mr. McCain's great primary triumphs: His decisive victory here in January effectively handed him his party's nomination.
 Mr. McCain's advisers decided to focus on other states, limiting spending in a very expensive state. His chief strategist, Steve Schmidt, said he was not surprised to see things get tight, particularly as the housing market collapsed here, putting the economy front and center. ''We always suspected that would happen,'' he said.
 The developments have forced Mr. McCain's campaign to devote precious candidate time and dwindling resources here in the final days of the campaign, at a time when Mr. McCain is facing pressure to shore up his position in other states Mr. Bush won in 2004. He spent a day here on Thursday traveling the state, and will be back next week; Gov. Sarah Palin, his running mate, will be here Sunday.
 ''It was a strategic error on their part,'' said Mr. Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe.
 Here as in much of the country, there have been strains between the local Republican organization and the McCain campaign about how to run in the state. Until Thursday, Mr. Crist, a Republican whom Mr. McCain said he had considered for the vice-presidential slot on the ticket, kept what appeared to be a definite distance from the McCain campaign, and made remarks -- including one disputing Mr. McCain's contention that the voting process here was subject to fraud -- that were clearly unhelpful to Mr. McCain.
 In an interview, Mr. Crist disputed the notion that he was anything but whole-hearted in his support for Mr. McCain, and noted that he was accompanying him on a trip he was doing across Florida this week. 
 ''I really don't know what that's derived from,'' Mr. Crist said. ''I'm doing everything I possibly can. I'm excited about his candidacy. I love the guy.''
 Still, Mr. Crist's associates said he had been irked that after everything he had done for Mr. McCain -- many Republicans think he would not have won Florida, and thus the nomination, without the last-minute endorsement of Mr. Crist -- the McCain campaign, at the last minute, had refused to broadcast a seven-minute video introduction he had prepared for the convention. 
 From a more pragmatic point of view, Mr. Crist's associates said he was concerned about becoming too closely identified with Mr. McCain's campaign, worried that he would hurt his own standing with what one aide described as ''Crist-Obama voters.''
 Someleaders said they had been stymied in their efforts to get help from the McCain campaign, though they said that was now beginning to change.
 ''I did have and do have a frustration about getting people here to keep South Florida in the thick of things,'' said Chip LaMarca, the Republican chairman from Broward County. ''We had numerous telephone conversations and conference calls. We look forward to having more support here.''

HEADLINE: Crises On Many Fronts

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The closer you look at the current economic crisis, the more harrowing it becomes.
 The focus in the presidential campaign has been almost entirely on the struggles faced by the middle class -- on families worried about their jobs, their mortgages, their retirement accounts and how to pay for college for their kids. 
 Each nauseating plunge in the Dow heightens their anxiety. Each company that goes under and each government report showing joblessness on the rise intensifies their fear. 
 No one knows how to quell the uncertainty. And no one is even talking about the poor.
 Alan Greenspan, uncharacteristically befuddled, went up to Capitol Hill on Thursday and lamented that some sort of fissure had erupted in his previously impregnable worldview. For Mr. Greenspan (''I still do not understand exactly how it happened''), this is a moment of intellectual anxiety.
 But if we are indeed caught up in the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression, the ones who will fare the worst are those who already are poor or near-poor. There are millions of them, and yet they remain essentially invisible. A step down for them is a step into destitution.
 Listen to Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund, which he founded with the singer-songwriter Paul Simon to bring health services to poor and homeless children:
 ''First of all, at least in the short term, we can expect more families will become homeless as foreclosures continue to mount and jobs become harder to hold and more difficult to find. As jobs disappear and employers begin trimming expenses, we can foresee people losing health insurance, swelling the ranks of the medically uninsured.
 ''I don't think the health care system can bear another five million or more people uninsured and economically fragile. More people without insurance will crowd into the nation's hospital emergency rooms when medical problems become too severe to ignore or there is no other access to basic health services. Such a trend will have a seismic impact on our health care system.''
 Few Americans have noticed, but a tremendous number of hospitals, from Boston to Los Angeles, are in serious, even dire, financial trouble. A survey of 4,500 hospitals by the New York consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal found that more than half were technically insolvent or at risk of insolvency. 
 The current economic downturn, combined with an anticipated surge in patients without health insurance, will only worsen what is already a crisis.
 The nation's financial system was all-but-overwhelmed by the mortgage crisis because none of the nation's leaders paid serious enough attention to the widespread symptoms of what turned out to be a metastasizing disease.
 A similar situation exists on a number of important fronts right now: the deteriorating national infrastructure, the woefully inadequate public school system, our self-defeating energy policies, health care. Symptoms of serious trouble are staring us in the face, but no one is mounting an adequate response.
 When a new president takes office in January, the temptation will be to delay bold action on these fronts until the overall economic situation improves. That is the kind of mistake (like ignoring the housing and credit bubbles until it was too late or refusing to heed the pre-Katrina warnings in New Orleans) that opens the door to additional crises. 
 The Alvarez & Marsal study noted that at many community hospitals the physical plant itself is in bad shape because capital funding had to be curtailed because of budget shortfalls. ''There are scores of hospitals that are slowly asphyxiating and slipping into insolvency,'' the report said, ''as they divert capital dollars to fund operations.
 ''For most of these hospitals, it is only a matter of time before they hit a 'sudden' liquidity crisis and cannot make payroll without entering insolvency and being forced into restructuring their finances and operations.''
 Dr. Redlener, who is also a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, said: ''The federal government currently strains to pay hospitals more than $35 billion each year to cover the costs of the uninsured. That money comes from general tax revenue, and it is a budget line that will need to be increased if we don't want to see an epidemic of hospital closures.''
 Most important, of course, is a revamping (in a sane way) of the health insurance system.
 There are no good scenarios in the offing. The markets are in turmoil. Banks are being nationalized. The U.S. auto industry has the look of a jalopy with four flat tires.
 The evidence of decline and decay is everywhere around us. There has never been a time since World War II when the nation was more in need of a presidential administration with a comprehensive vision and the ability to lead on several fronts at once.

 IN ISRAEL, MINISTER STRUGGLES 
 To Assemble a Government
 The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party said that it would not join a government that Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni of Israel is trying to assemble. But Ms. Livni has reached an agreement in principle with the left-wing Meretz Party to join her government and was negotiating with another ultra-Orthodox party, Yahadut Hatorah, that together would make up for the loss of Shas and give her a majority in the 120-seat Parliament. PAGE A6
 MUGABE TAKING HARDER LINE
 Two of Zimbabwe's most prominent civic leaders, arrested more than a week ago in Bulawayo for leading a peaceful protest to demand food for the hungry, will spend at least another weekend in jail because their bail hearing was delayed yet again. Their arrest and continued detention was among the signs that the government led by President Robert Mugabe is taking a harder line against its critics in civic groups and the political opposition. PAGE A6 
 ILLEGAL NUCLEAR SALES CHARGED
 The United States has issued punitive sanctions to a handful of foreign companies for sales of technologies that it says could help Iran, Syria and North Korea to develop nuclear weapons. The State Department said 13 ''foreign persons'' -- including companies in Russia, China and Venezuela -- violated prohibitions. Russia's foreign minister accused the Bush administration of breaking international law. The State Department then said that it was explaining the sanctions to the affected parties. PAGE A6
 GREEK GOVERNMENT IN SCANDAL
 A scandal in which a wealthy Orthodox monastery traded cheap tracts of lakeside property for prime public real estate is threatening to bring down the Greek government and tarnishing the monastic society, Vatopedion. Two government officials have already resigned over the dealings, and an initial judicial inquiry put the loss to the state at $136 million. PAGE A6
 SANITATION LYRICS
 Feliciano dos Santos sings of the usual things -- love and longing and sorrow -- for his usual fans. But for the residents in the highland villages of his native Niassa, among the poorest of Mozambique's 11 provinces, his music has a different message: ''Sanitation can change your life.'' PAGE A7
 TELLING ISTANBUL'S STORIES
 When Murat Belge, one of Turkey's most important intellectuals, boards a boat on Sunday mornings for a trip up the Bosporus to talk about his beloved city, Istanbul, several hundred people line up to listen. His interest is history, and in straightening it out. ''We have a very unhealthy relation with our history,'' he said. ''It's basically a collection of lies.'' PAGE A5

 SNAIL-PACED PROGRESS 
 In Backlog of DNA Evidence
 Local and state law enforcement agencies have made little progress in reducing a nationwide backlog of DNA evidence samples over the past four years, according to reports filed with the National Institute of Justice. About 95 percent of state and local criminal cases are resolved by plea agreements, even though DNA remains the most reliable physical evidence. PAGE A9
 INMATE'S EXECUTION HALTED AGAIN
 A federal appeals court halted the execution of an inmate in Georgia convicted in the 1989 killing of a police officer. It was the third time in 16 months that a stay of execution was ordered in the case. Since the man's conviction in 1991, seven witnesses have recanted their testimony, and prosecutors presented no DNA evidence or murder weapon at the trial. PAGE A9
 ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH PALIN
 In her first policy speech of the presidential campaign, Gov. Sarah Palin vowed that a McCain administration would allow all special-needs students the choice of attending private schools at public expense. After her speech, she met with an investigator from Alaska to give depositions as part of a second inquiry into whether she abused the powers of her office by firing the state's public safety commissioner. PAGE A13
 PALIN QUESTIONED ON HER FAITH
 Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential nominee, was asked in an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network to ''clear up exactly what you believe in'' about her religious faith, including her involvement with Pentecostalism. She responded by speaking generally, but extensively, about how she counts on God for strength, guidance and wisdom. ''My faith has always been pretty personal,'' she said. Ms. Palin's faith has come under scrutiny after two videos taken in her former church surfaced on YouTube and became immediate sensations. PAGE A13
 SAD GOODBYE TO A GRANDMOTHER
 It was an unusual departure from the tug of war of the presidential campaign, particularly with 11 days remaining in the race, but Senator Barack Obama made what he believed was likely to be a final visit to his gravely ill grandmother in Hawaii. PAGE A9

 CONFLICTING REPORTS IN CLAIM
 Of Sexual Abuse by Officers
 Witnesses dispute the account of a 24-year-old Brooklyn man who said he was sodomized by police officers at a subway station last week, according to a law enforcement official who had been briefed on the investigation. But lawyers for the man said that he was left with a tear in his rectum that kept him in the hospital for five days, and that hospital records attributed his condition to ''anal assault.'' PAGE A17 
 MARATHON AS RECOVERY
 Matthew Long, a New York City firefighter, once ran the New York City Marathon in 3:13:59. But that was before he was critically injured when he was hit by a chartered bus in December 2005. He had to learn to walk again, and he still uses a cane. But he plans to take his salvaged body, rebuilt with pins and screws and rods, and compete in the New York City Marathon on Nov. 2. PAGE A17

 STRENGTH OF RAYS' PITCHING
 Does Not Include Hitting
 With the World Series moving to the home of the Phillies, the Tampa Bay Rays will have to adjust their muscular hitting attack to include a pitcher -- not exactly their strength. The three starters and seven relievers most likely to appear in the next three games are a combined 13 for 74 lifetime. And only one of them has an extra-base hit, a double back in 1998. PAGE D3 
 MCALLISTER NAMED IN POSITIVE TEST
 As many as eight N.F.L. players, including Saints running back Deuce McAllister, have tested positive for performance-enhancing substances and face suspensions, according to people briefed on the matter. McAllister, Saints defensive end Will Smith and at least one other player tested positive for a diuretic that can also be used as a masking agent, they said. PAGE D1
 AN INFECTIOUS ENVIRONMENT
 News this week of infections affecting Kellen Winslow, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady may have made the issue seem suddenly more relevant. But several experts in sports medicine and epidemiology said that the news only serves to highlight how prevalent infections -- especially staph infections -- are among professional athletes and in the community at large.

 BUSINESS
 FACED WITH EXPLAINING BIG FIRMS,
 Some Brokers Leave Instead
 Some brokers with Wall Street firms, finding themselves having to explain the write-downs, losses, layoffs and capital infusions that they had nothing to do with, are walking out the door and going independent. But others, knowing that brokers have become more important to the bottom lines of their employers, are simply going to competitors that are dangling better pay packages. PAGE B1
 MORE MATCHMAKING FOR BANKS
 The government is moving quickly to expand the $700 billion bailout to include insurance companies -- a move some questioned the need for -- as it paved the way for the takeover by PNC Financial of National City, a troubled regional bank swamped by losses. The approach puts the government in the uncomfortable position of playing matchmaker as it confronts a second wave of consolidation. ''You are putting together a strong bank with a very weak one, and you wind up with a weak bank,'' one analyst said. PAGE B1
 FORECLOSURES DRIVE HOME SALES
 Sales of existing homes rose the most in five years in September, which would sound better if not for the fact that the sales were driven largely by bargain-basement prices on foreclosed homes. And the numbers probably do not reflect a permanent turn in the markets, because the credit crisis has intensified since the transactions took place. The good news is that '' in some areas affordability is coming into the market,'' one economist said. PAGE B7
 AUTO MERGER HINGES ON U.S. AID
 A possible merger of General Motors and Chrysler increasingly appears to hinge on the government providing aid to support the deal. While the merger talks are said to be progressing, investors are hesitant to put money into the deal unless federal assistance is forthcoming, people with knowledge of the talks said. One person said that G.M. was actively pursuing government assistance. A G.M. spokesman declined to confirm that the company's chairman was in Washington to solicit support for the deal. PAGE B1
 EUROPE'S AIRLINE EMISSION RULES
 European Union governments gave formal approval to a potentially costly system of capping greenhouse gases from any airline flying into or out of the trade bloc. Airline chiefs criticized the decision, saying it would cost the industry at least 3.5 billion euros ($4.4 billion) each year to comply. The United States has also harshly criticized efforts to apply the rules to American-based carriers, saying the rules may violate international aviation agreements. PAGE B2
 MORE MAY NOT BE BETTER
 Multitasking may seem to be a time saver, if not a necessity: both work and home serve up more jobs than can fit into a day. But psychologists, neuroscientists and others are finding that it can create a great deal of stress and actually make us less efficient. No wonder the Zen approach is to focus on one thing at a time.

 A group of female playwrights, frustrated by the difficulty of getting their work produced, plan to attend a town-hall-style meeting on Monday night to air their grievances with representatives of New York's leading Off Broadway and nonprofit theaters. The gathering was organized by Sarah Schulman and Julia Jordan, who say plays by their male counterparts for the 2008-9 season are being produced at four times the rate that women's plays are.

 CW NETWORK FINDING A FOOTHOLD
 Last year CW, the part-time television network that arose from the demise of the WB and UPN networks, looked like less than the sum of its parents.

 The Colombian port of Cartagena has a history with the cocaine trade and its accompanying violence.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Book Is Postponed

 BODY:
The bruising battle over term limits has claimed a victim: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's highly anticipated book, which was scheduled for release in February. 
 The book, entitled ''Do the Hard Things First (And Other Bloomberg Rules for Business and Politics)'' and conceived as a valedictory look at his success in the public and private sectors, has been put on hold indefinitely, its publisher, Perseus Books Group, told bookstores on Friday. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's co-author, Margaret Carlson, said that the book was practically finished, but that with the mayor gearing up to run for a third term, the release of a been-there-done-that retrospective seemed ill-timed. 
 ''It was looking back, not looking forward,'' Ms. Carlson said. ''It did not make sense to put it out now when the story is not over.''
 Mr. Bloomberg also did not relish the prospect of a self-congratulatory book tour in the middle of an economic crisis when he is expected to raise taxes and cut city services.
 Mr. Bloomberg recently phoned Ms. Carlson and told her, ''It doesn't mean we will never have the book; it just means we won't have it now,'' she recalled.
 Perseus had planned an initial run of 300,000 copies, according to Publishers Weekly. Several publishing executives said the delay could help sales, since Mr. Bloomberg will remain in the spotlight.
 ''You've got a much stronger book watching Michael Bloomberg take us over the falls,'' said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, a literary agent in New York. ''Hopefully,'' he added, ''the barrel will hold up.''

HEADLINE: European and Asian Leaders Call for Unity in Facing Economic Crisis

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
On a day when European and Japanese markets suffered heavy losses, Asian and European leaders convened on Friday in Beijing and sought to present a unified front, promising mutual cooperation at next month's emergency financial meeting called by President Bush. 
 Speaking at the opening of the two-day Asia-Europe Meeting, or ASEM, President Hu Jintao of China called for a cooperative global response to a financial crisis that he said had sent shockwaves through international financial markets.
 ''At this crucial moment, confidence is more important than anything else,'' Mr. Hu said, according to Xinhua, the country's official news agency. ''Only with strong confidence and concerted efforts can we weather the crisis.''
 Mr. Hu said his government had already taken measures in response to the crisis and said one of its primary contributions would be maintaining China's economy to help sustain global financial stability. ''We have adopted a range of important measures, including those on maintaining the stability of the domestic financial system, increasing liquidity in the financial markets and institutions, enhancing coordination and cooperation with other countries on macroeconomic policies and so on,'' Mr. Hu said.
 The ASEM conference, which includes leaders from the 27 member nations in the European Union as well as 16 Asian countries, will conclude on Saturday. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France expressed hope that Europe and Asia could provide mutual support when world leaders converged on Washington next month.
 ''Europe would like Asia to support our efforts, and we would like to make sure that on Nov. 15 we can face the world together and say that the causes of this unprecedented crisis will never be allowed to happen again,'' Mr. Sarkozy, the current European Union president, said, according to Reuters.
 Meanwhile, leaders issued a joint statement that called for improved supervision and regulation of the global financial system while calling on the International Monetary Fund to assist countries severely affected by the economic slowdown.
 ''Leaders pledged to undertake effective and comprehensive reform of the international monetary and financial systems,'' the statement said. ''Leaders supported the convening of an international summit on 15 November in Washington, D.C., to address the current crisis and principles of reform of the international financial system as well as long-term stability and development of the world economy.''

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Loan To Iceland Moves Ahead

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Iceland reached a tentative agreement on Friday with the International Monetary Fund for a $2 billion loan over two years after the country's banking system collapsed in the global credit crisis. 
 The government said the deal, which is still subject to approval by the fund's board in Washington, would also give Iceland immediate access to $830 million to head off a financial threat to its entire economy.
 The country's currency, the krona, has lost half its value since January, and banking transactions to and from Iceland have seized up, leaving its population of 320,000 virtually stranded.
 ''This program will enable us to secure funding and gain access to the necessary technical expertise required to stabilize the Icelandic krona and to provide support for the development of a healthier financial system,'' Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde said in a statement. ''As a result, Iceland will commit to a sustainable long-term economic policy, and a plan for the recovery of the Icelandic economy.''
 The loan is the first by the fund to a Western nation since 1976. The agency is talking to close to a dozen countries about financial help.
 The fund's managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said that Iceland had put together ''an ambitious economic program'' to restore confidence in its banking system and stabilize the krona.
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn said those strong policies justified the large loan and deserved the support of the international community.
 Iceland said it would use the money to reintroduce a flexible interest rate regime and revise its financial regulation.

HEADLINE: Insurers Are Getting in Line For Piece of Federal Bailout

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ERIC DASH; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington and Eric Dash from New York. Mary Williams Walsh contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chase for a piece of the Treasury Department's $700 billion bailout program intensified Friday as the government considered extending it to include insurance companies as well as banks, and the auto industry stepped up efforts to secure a share of the money. 
 Even as the Treasury began approving capital injections for about 20 regional banks on Friday, including $7.7 billion for a merger between PNC Financial and National City, carmakers pressed for their financing subsidiaries to be eligible for a part of the bailout fund because they provide a major channel of credit to consumers through car and other types of loans. 
 Bush administration officials said they were not inclined to take equity stakes in auto companies, since Congress recently financed a $25 billion loan program to help the automakers develop fuel-efficient vehicles to meet new federal mileage standards.
 ''We are trying to focus on financial institutions,'' said Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department. 
 But the negotiations are unlikely to stop there. On Friday, a top economic adviser to Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic presidential nominee, said Mr. Obama supported the auto industry's request to be included in the bailout package.
 Congress approved the $700 billion rescue program this month primarily to clean up a severely troubled banking industry saddled with debt. The administration originally envisioned it as a program to buy up distressed mortgage-backed securities and other hard-to-sell assets. 
 But the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., rapidly shifted the focus of the Treasury's efforts to inject money directly into banks instead, after it became painfully apparent the asset-purchase plan would move too slowly to erase the fear that is keeping paralyzed banks around the world from making loans to one another and in the broader economy. 
 And because the bailout law gave wide latitude to Mr. Paulson, Washington's interest groups mobilized to take advantage. Administration officials say the law instructs them to invest in financial institutions that are supervised by a federal banking regulator. 
 The Financial Services Roundtable, a lobbying group for financial services companies, asked the Treasury Department on Friday to open its program to broker-dealers, insurance companies, car companies and financial institutions owned by foreign corporations.
 ''The institutions that are excluded play a vital role in the U.S. economy by providing liquidity to the market,'' wrote Steve Bartlett, president of the Financial Services Roundtable.
 That definition can be read to include insurance companies that own saving-and-loan companies and are therefore regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Administration officials said those companies would automatically be eligible to request capital infusions, though they would not be automatically entitled to money.
 Insurance companies with affiliated thrift institutions regulated by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision include State Farm Mutual, Principal Financial Group, Prudential, Nationwide, Allstate and the American International Group. Insurers with financial holding companies under Federal Reserve supervision include Allianz, Hancock and MetLife.
 Although the insurance industry is under pressure because of investment losses, some analysts said they did not understand why insurers needed immediate government help.
 ''Who in the insurance business is asking the Treasury for money?'' Andrew J. Barile, an industry consultant, said. ''Allstate certainly doesn't need it. State Farm doesn't need it. And these are the biggest companies in our country.''
 A.I.G., a huge insurer, nearly collapsed in September because its dealings in credit-default swaps suddenly required billions of dollars in cash that it did not have. 
 But no other insurance company is thought to have anywhere near the exposure to credit-default swaps that A.I.G. had. 
 Virtually all insurers have suffered investment losses, which in turn have driven down their stock prices, sometimes sharply, as investors dumped shares to avoid dilution while companies raise new money. And the credit rating agencies have been reviewing and downgrading many insurers' debt this month. 
 But neither of those trends implies an urgent liquidity crisis that would leave insurers unable to pay claims, analysts said. Insurers are generally considered immune to run-on-the-bank panics because they do not take deposits. Policyholders cannot usually pull out their money without incurring losses. 
 Mr. Barile, the consultant, thought insurance companies might have liquidity problems to the extent they had expanded into nontraditional areas like private wealth management, leasing and guaranteed investment products, where the obligations turn over more quickly. 
 As the Treasury embarks on its unprecedented program to recapitalize banks, it is also becoming increasingly clear that it wants not only to stabilize the industry, but to reshape it. As part of its $700 billion bailout plan, the government approved a capital investment of $7.7 billion for PNC Financial, paving the way Friday for it to take over National City, a troubled regional bank swamped by losses, in a $5.2 billion deal. 
 The measures, similar to those used in the Wells Fargo-Wachovia deal this month, illustrate the extraordinary lengths that the government is going to facilitate mergers. 
 Bankers say the government appears to be using the investment program both to spur healthier banks to do deals and to encourage weaker institutions to consider selling themselves. The program avoids the political costs and possibly systemic risks of putting another bank into government receivership. But it also puts the government in the uncomfortable position of playing matchmaker as it confronts a second wave of consolidation. 
 ''They are playing yenta,'' said Christopher Whalen, a managing partner of Institutional Risk Analytics. 
 The government used both carrots and sticks to push National City toward a merger with PNC. 
 By taking advantage of the Treasury's capital injection program to help pay for its acquisition of National City, PNC averted the risk of securing financing from fickle private investors. PNC exploited a recent change to the tax code, made at the behest of Treasury this month, that will give it an estimated $6 billion tax benefit -- possibly enough to cover the entire transaction, according to analysts. 
 Late Thursday evening, regulators agreed to give PNC an additional injection roughly equal to the government money allocated for National City as a sweetener to complete the deal. Bankers said it was doubtful that National City would have qualified for the government's investment as a standalone institution. 
 National City sealed its deal Friday after learning it was not included on a list of 22 banks slated to receive capital injections from the government. The Treasury Department quickly shelved plans to publish the list so as to avoid giving the kiss of death to banks who are not on it, and will let banks make such announcements themselves. 
 Bankers say the deal is a model for future transactions. More banks are expected to find out whether they qualify for government investments in coming weeks. And those that do not receive injections could come under pressure to find partners, since it will become painfully obvious to investors they did not receive the government's seal of approval.
 PNC said it was purchasing National City for $2.23 a share, or nearly 19 percent below the stock's closing price on Thursday. 
 That makes the acquisition a ''take-under,'' meaning the purchase price is below the market value of the target company. 
 PNC will inherit nearly $20 billion of losses on bad mortgage and other troubled loans, lifting its presence in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan just as the economy starts worsening.

HEADLINE: Reaction to the Obama Endorsement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Barack Obama for President'' (editorial, Oct. 24):
 Thank you for putting into such meaningful and definitive words all the reasons for voting for Barack Obama. As a senior citizen, I read your editorial through the eyes of my children and grandchildren. 
 The mistakes of the last eight years will most likely fade from their memory, but the opportunities for their future are ever so vivid when in print. We owe it to them -- to their dreams, their hopes, their goals, their tomorrrows -- to elect Barack Obama. He is their best hope for world peace and domestic tranquillity. 
 Doris Fenig Floral Park, Queens, Oct. 24, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Barack Obama's election will bring hope and promise to the United States and the world, which yearn for both. 
 Christopher May Deale, Md., Oct. 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The New York Times endorses Senator Barack Obama for president. Shocking! Of course, the utter predictability and lack of suspense regarding your presidential choice has completely negated the value of your advocacy. 
 Paul Marasciullo Laurel Hollow, N.Y., Oct. 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In 2000, The New York Times, in its presidential endorsement of Al Gore, said of him, ''We today firmly endorse Al Gore as the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government, his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision-making.''
 In that same endorsement, in contrast, The Times wrote of George W. Bush: ''But his resume is too thin for the nation to bet on his growing into the kind of leader he claims already to be. He does have great personal charm.''
 In its 2008 general-election presidential endorsement, The Times could have aptly recycled these aforementioned quotes nearly verbatim, this time substituting John McCain's name for Al Gore's and Barack Obama's for George W. Bush's. 
 One can only conclude that the only difference this time around is that the eminently more qualified but less charismatic candidate happens to be a Republican.
 Nicole Samura Chelsea, Mass., Oct. 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The call for change from both the Barack Obama and John McCain camps might be examined through the difference in the kind of campaigns they've run. 
 In days past, a national campaign could be seen as a kind of aggregation of dozens of localized mini-campaigns. An organization could run localized smears and dirty tricks, comfortable in the knowledge that they could by and large prevent awareness of such deeds bleeding out into the general consciousness. No more.
 The McCain campaign sends Sarah Palin into what she calls ''pro-America'' states, carrying her unique brand of cutesy vitriol meant to whip up crowds of frightened xenophobes, and it ends up on YouTube within hours, broadcast not only nationwide but also worldwide and stripping the campaign of any veneer of dignity.
 The Obama campaign long ago realized the fundamental changes in the way people communicate and educate themselves today and has embraced and taken full advantage of these changes. 
 In other words, the Obama campaign has been walking the walk of change for a couple of years now while the McCain organization (if one can call it that) clings with fury and clamor to a model that has faded into the dark past of politics.
 David Dumitru St. Louis, Oct. 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your endorsement of Barack Obama for president was thoughtful and particularly appropriate given the juxtaposition of Senator John McCain's advocacy of continued deregulation of the financial sector and the former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's admission that ''those of us who have looked to the self- interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders' equity, myself included, are in a state of shocked disbelief'' (Business Day, Oct. 24).
 The deregulation mania was broadcast from a platform of that now-discredited assumption. Its having been proved false, the stage has collapsed, and the theory, shattered, must be consigned to the trash heap. With it, its advocates must be swept away as well.
 Barack Obama offers a fresh start and healing to a wounded nation and its fractured alliances in the world. Let's move forward to this better tomorrow.
 Sharon Morrison Whitefish, Mont., Oct. 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I applaud your endorsement of Senator Barack Obama for president and share your confidence that he will serve the nation well. 
 I would, however, offer caution on one aspect of your endorsement, and that is with respect to your comment that by pulling troops out of Iraq we will be able to defeat the Taliban and Al Qaeda by increasing the number of troops in Afghanistan. 
 I am not convinced that a military solution will be any more effective in Afghanistan than it has been in Iraq or Vietnam, for that matter. The Russians tried that and it didn't work.
 Trading one quagmire, Iraq, for another, Afghanistan, is not an encouraging prospect. We could find ourselves trying to fight three wars -- Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan -- with limited economic and military resources. 
 I am hopeful that a President Obama will use his vast skills to find another solution.
 John A. Viteritti Southold, N.Y., Oct. 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thank you for your elegant, articulate and powerful editorial in support of Barack Obama. For many of us, this election has come to symbolize not only a vote for Mr. Obama versus John McCain, but also a vote for reason versus ignorance. 
 The blogs supporting Mr. McCain are filled with a rage and hatred so intense as to sear the page in front of me. The hatred whipped up at rallies and by some representatives has been truly appalling. 
 A vote for Mr. Obama is a vote for hope; a vote for Mr. McCain seems to have become a vote representing the worst of our extremists.
 And I wonder why this should really be. They have been in power for 20 of the last 28 years. 
 Does anyone else wonder what the extreme right is so angry about?

HEADLINE: THE DAY

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama jumped off the campaign trail to spend Friday in Hawaii visiting his grandmother, who is dying. But with 10 days left in the race for president, this is no time for courtesy, and Senator John McCain did not offer it. Mr. McCain again strongly attacked Mr. Obama's economic policy, making the argument that an Obama presidency would mean higher taxes. 
 Mr. Obama might have been off the campaign grid, but his surrogates were not. Michelle Obama; his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.; and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton carried the Obama banner in battlefield states across the country.
 The Takeaway: Even if Mr. McCain had the stage somewhat to himself, the map was not looking good for him. Case in point: He spent the day in Colorado, a state that President Bush won in 2004 but that is not shaping up as hopeful for Mr. McCain. Mr. Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, declared Mr. McCain's goal of grabbing Pennsylvania from Democrats a ''daunting task.'' ADAM NAGOURNEY

HEADLINE: Rescuing Capitalism

 BODY:
It would be fairly easy to dismiss the gleeful boast by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France that American-style capitalism is over, to file it with French critiques of fast food and American pop culture. 
 Except that the United States government now owns stakes in the nation's biggest banks. It controls one of the biggest insurance companies in the world. It guarantees more than half the mortgages in the country. Finance -- the lifeblood of capitalism -- has to a substantial degree been taken over by the state.
 Even Alan Greenspan, the high priest of unfettered capitalism and a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, conceded this week that he had ''found a flaw'' in his bedrock belief of ''40 years or more'' that markets would regulate themselves. ''I made a mistake,'' he said.
 The question is what new direction capitalism should take. In a globally interconnected world, the United States cannot simply march back to the gray flannel capitalism of the 1950s and 1960s when regulations were tough and coddled monopolies dominated the corporate world. Still, the next president will have a chance, not to be missed, to re-evaluate some tenets of the freewheeling, deregulated version of a market economy that has dominated America since the Reagan administration.
 Financial deregulation enabled our boom-and-bust dynamic -- removing barriers to capital flows, allowing unrestricted trading of abstruse financial products and letting financial institutions take on more and more debt. Cheap money, from China or the Federal Reserve, fueled the fire. But America's virtually unregulated shadow financial institutions -- brokerages, hedge funds and other nonbank banks -- played a particularly important role at the center of this process. 
 The solution will require rethinking the rules of finance. The amount of capital that banks must keep in reserve will have to rise; deregulated financial institutions will have to be regulated. Yet much more will be needed than just putting the bridle back on American banks. 
 The next government must re-establish some notion of equity of opportunity. Investment is desperately needed in health care, education, infrastructure. The social contract and the government's role in it should be examined anew. Addressing these challenges will be an enormous task -- especially amid the bitter recession that most economists expect over the next year or so. But they must be faced. Fixing finance is merely the start.

HEADLINE: Chrysler to Cut 25% of Salaried and Contract Jobs

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Chrysler, which is in merger talks with its crosstown rival General Motors, told its employees on Friday that it would cut about 25 percent of its salaried and contract work force beginning next month. 
 The automaker said that it would offer buyouts and early retirement packages in the next two weeks and that layoffs would follow in December. As many as 5,000 people will lose their jobs, a Chrysler official with direct knowledge of the plans said.
 ''These are truly unimaginable times for our industry,'' Chrysler's chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, wrote in a letter to workers. ''We continue to be in the most difficult economic period most of us can remember. The combination of troubled financial markets, difficult credit, volatile commodity prices, the housing crisis and declining consumer confidence continues to weigh on the economy. Never before have auto industry sales contracted at such a fast rate.''
 Chrysler will also reduce discretionary and overhead spending, as well as unrelated capital expenses, ''but I assure you that we are protecting all major product programs,'' Mr. Nardelli wrote. He added that the company would announce more organizational plans soon.
 In the last two years, Chrysler has drastically slashed its work force through buyouts, most of which were aimed at specific plants or departments. Mr. Nardelli said the new buyouts would ''be available to a broader group than before and will feature enhanced benefits, including both cash and new-vehicle vouchers.''
 Friday's announcement does not affect hourly workers, but it comes a day after Chrysler said it would eliminate 1,825 jobs by year's end at sport utility vehicle assembly plants in Ohio and Delaware.
 Chrysler's sales were down 25 percent from January through September, which is nearly double the industry average. Its sales plunged 32.8 percent last month as the tightened credit markets hindered consumers' ability to obtain financing, a factor that has further dragged down the auto industry in October. Chrysler Financial, the automaker's lending arm, stopped leasing vehicles on Aug. 1.
 Chrysler has been hurt more than the other two Detroit automakers by the credit crisis, weak economy and high gas prices because a larger proportion of its vehicles are trucks and S.U.V.'s.
 Earlier this week, Daimler A.G. cut the value of its 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler to zero from $268 million in June. Daimler valued its share of Chrysler at $2.2 billion last year, when it sold the rest to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management.

HEADLINE: Farmer in Chief

 BODY:
I definitely agree with Michael Pollan's premise (Oct. 12) that we need a robust national dialogue on how we produce food and fiber in America. The Clinton administration was in the forefront of many of these ideas, including the implementation of the Organic Standards Act and facilitation of a rapidly growing organic-food movement; creation of a national farmers'-market initiative with thousands of farmers' markets all over America; expanding the federal nutrition programs, including WIC (Women, Infants and Children), to include fresh fruits and vegetables; a dramatic increase in the land-conservation programs; and the first serious review in many years of federal statutes dealing with the structure of the livestock industry. 
 Obviously more needs to be done, but we created a serious record to build on. 
 DAN GLICKMAN
 Secretary of Agriculture 
 (1995-2001)
 Washington
 Even though 35.5 million Americans live in households that can't afford enough food and 25 million are forced to use food pantries and soup kitchens, Michael Pollan insists that food scarcity is no longer a problem in America and that rising food prices can be a positive development. He glosses over the reality that the nation's rising obesity is directly tied to the inability of low-income Americans to physically obtain and economically afford less fattening, more nutritious foods.
 Pollan's suggestion that the federal government start preventing low-income families from using food-stamp benefits to purchase what he deems to be junk food is as class-biased as it is unworkable. In his book ''The Omnivore's Dilemma,'' he admits that he and his son occasionally enjoy junk food and supersize Cokes. Who is he to decide that low-income American families could never again enjoy that same guilty pleasure? 
 I, too, would like to live in a nation in which everyone is able to buy nourishing food year-round at ''four-season farmers' markets.'' But just as the reality is that most Americans don't live in regions with year-round growing seasons, tens of millions of people on limited incomes simply can't afford to buy the healthiest foods. 
 The answer is not, as Pollan suggests, to reduce their already meager choices but rather to ensure that they have wages high enough and a government safety net robust enough to give them the real-life ability to eat more nutritious foods.

 I think Michael Pollan would make an excellent secretary of agriculture for an Obama administration. It would be a food-healthy choice for the country and its citizens.
 NORMAN SASOWSKY
 Newark, Del.
 Before redesigning the global food system, Michael Pollan needs to quantify his vision. For example, grass-fed beef doesn't just produce similar amounts of methane as feedlot beef; it produces at least three times more per animal. In addition, the animals are smaller: Australian grass-fed animals produce a 250-kilogram carcass compared with a 350-kilogram carcass in the United States. 
 The inefficiencies of animal production are not just a function of industrialized methods. The production of meat, dairy, eggs and seafood absorbs the output of a third of all farmed land, plus 3,400 million hectares of grazing land, plus the entire and declining output of global fisheries. In return, these foods produce just 17 percent of global food calories. Less than half of this meat is produced industrially. Sure, the industrial nature of meat production in the United States is a problem, but it isn't the problem. The problem is the meat itself.
 GEOFF RUSSELL

 While this historic presidential election may lead us one step closer to living in a nonracist society, we cannot overlook the fact that the horrific food-related-illness statistics cited by Pollan are far greater for Americans of African and Hispanic descent. Whether our next president is Republican or Democrat, black or white, he will have to address the fact that food is one of the greatest social-justice issues facing our nation today.

HEADLINE: Fuel-Efficient Black Cars: A Taximoron?

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
ROWS of Lincoln Town Cars idling at the curbside, a scene as socially suspect as the old X-rated Times Square, will soon begin disappearing from New York City streets. 
 Ambitious city fuel economy rules, written to curb the thirst of black cars, will steadily sideline the big V-8 powered sedans that corporate New York has relied on for decades. The rules particularly threaten the future of the Lincoln Town Car, workhorse of a fleet that the Taxi and Limousine Commission numbers at roughly 10,000 vehicles. 
 Black cars are essentially small-scale limousines that serve mainly business customers who pay with vouchers or credit cards rather than cash. Under a plan introduced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg last winter, new black cars that enter service beginning Jan. 1 must carry a fuel economy rating of at least 25 miles a gallon in the Environmental Protection Agency's city test cycle; the requirement steps up to 30 m.p.g. a year later. A 25-m.p.g. rule took effect for New York's 13,000 yellow taxis in October. 
 According to the city, the black cars, taxis and an additional 25,000 local car service vehicles produce 1 percent of the city's total carbon dioxide emissions, and 4 percent of its transportation emissions. Doubling the mileage of that entire fleet, the goal by 2017, would cut the emissions by half. 
 There's only one problem: no new full-size sedan comes close to 25 m.p.g., let alone 30 m.p.g., in city driving. The Lexus LS 600h L, the only large hybrid luxury sedan, is rated at just 20 m.p.g. in the city. It costs more than $100,000, a price that makes it a non-starter for independent drivers who are used to paying $15,000 to $25,000 for a used Town Car or $40,000 for a new one. 
 Still, with fleet operators and drivers being hammered by wild swings in fuel prices, the mileage rules provide a powerful incentive for switching to smaller hybrid sedans and crossovers that comply with the new regulations. 
 The possibilities include Ford's Escape and Mercury Mariner Hybrids, crossovers that are rated at an exceptional 34 m.p.g. in town. Ford is promoting the Mariner as a greener alternative to the Town Car; it costs about $31,000 with a livery package that includes black-leather upholstery and a GPS navigation system. The Toyota Highlander Hybrid utility wagon and its luxury sibling, the Lexus RX 400h, can achieve 27 m.p.g. in the city -- enough to sneak past the first-year 25-m.p.g. requirement -- and would cost drivers $40,000 to $50,000.
 Among midsize sedans, the Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima hybrids ace the standards at a respective 33- and 35-m.p.g. in city driving, and each costs about $30,000 with options. The Toyota Prius sips the least fuel, at 45 m.p.g. in the city, though some black-car drivers say the Prius is too small and bare-bones to step in for a Town Car. 
 With a basic design that dates to the '70s, the Lincoln Town Car is built on a heavy steel frame, akin to old-school S.U.V.'s -- one reason for its city fuel economy rating of 16 m.p.g. But the things that make Lincoln a dinosaur also make it a favorite of drivers and fleet operators: the Town Car is a simple, spacious and durable tank that's inexpensive to buy and repair. Drivers say they routinely put 250,000 miles or more on a Town Car in brutal city driving before having to rebuild its V-8 engine or its transmission. 
 ''You can buy a Town Car even with 100,000 miles on it and it will run forever if you do the maintenance,'' said Salah Eldamarany, a driver with Legends Limo and Car Service in Brooklyn.
 Black-car drivers say that while some customers are supportive of hybrids and would sacrifice some room or amenities to ride in one, others would not be satisfied if a Town Car stand-in was not as luxurious and roomy. 
 ''Customers might not complain about gas prices, but they will complain if three people and their luggage can't fit,'' said Nassim Salaymeh, who also drives for the Legends service. 
 John Acierno, president of the city's largest black-car company, Executive Transportation Group, has already switched about 10 percent of his 1,750-car fleet to hybrids. With Town Cars achieving a dispiriting 12 m.p.g. in real-world use, hybrid adopters are saving from $125 to $175 a week in fuel, Mr. Acierno said -- enough to offset the higher purchase price of the hybrids. 
 Part of those savings is a result of hybrids' shutting down their gas engines when stopped, making them ideal for the lurching and crawling pace of New York streets. He has calculated that when his fleet is fully converted, the company will save 2.8 million gallons of gas each year -- more than $8 million at current pump prices -- and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 32,000 tons a year. 
 Some drivers have expressed reservations over the hybrids' durability and safety. Mr. Acierno acknowledges that while drivers can be wary of switching, those who do become the best advertisements for hybrids. 
 Mr. Acierno is hopeful that the industry will develop more models that meet both economy rules and the needs of customers. Currently, his dispatchers avoid sending smaller hybrid models on airport runs to pick up multiple passengers and luggage.
 Matthew W. Daus, chairman of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, called hybrids the latest example of natural selection in the evolution of black cars. 
 ''Both drivers and corporate passengers appreciate the hybrid effect of less fuel costs and an enhanced corporate image for environmentally responsible clients,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. 
 For operators who are not ready to get rid of their Lincolns, the city plan includes a phase-in retirement period. Essentially, six-year-old Town Cars will be steadily removed from service, with virtually the entire fleet converted to the 30-m.p.g. standard after 2013. Operators who license a new 2009 Town Car before Jan. 1 will be able to operate it the longest, for five years, before it is forced to retire. Several drivers said that they and colleagues are rushing to buy Town Cars before the January deadline to delay the switch as long as possible. 
 Doug Walczak, a limousine and livery manager for the Ford Motor Company, said that some loyal Town Car owners are leery of new technology. ''It's a challenge, because hybrids don't have that long, proven history of durability in commercial applications,'' Mr. Walczak said. 
 As the Town Car fades, Mr. Walczak said that Ford remains committed to its profitable black-car business. The company has pledged to continue building Town Cars through 2011 at its plant in St. Thomas, Ontario. Yet Mr. Walczak acknowledged that the clock is ticking on the venerable Lincoln. 
 ''The writing is on the wall, and the world is changing,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Season's Greetings

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
WITH the economy reeling, Amy Birnbaum, a Broadway production assistant who lives in New York, wasn't planning to take a winter vacation until after the holidays, when prices are typically lower. But when researching vacation options online recently, she came across a deal too good to pass up: a five-day trip to Bermuda, including nonstop airfare from New York, with a large suite (complete with kitchen) right on the beach for about $800 a person over the week of Christmas. 
 It was a trip that in years past would normally have cost $1,500 or more, Ms. Birnbaum said, adding that she was looking forward to balmy weather in December. ''Going from the harsh New York winter to a 70-degree day in Bermuda is wonderful,'' she said.
 Pack your stockings and mistletoe. Sure Christmas is only two months away and holiday hot spots are normally booked solid by now. But the recent Wall Street meltdown (and continued global financial turmoil) is turning into something of a last-minute gift to bargain-seeking vacationers who have yet to make holiday travel plans. 
 Faced with sluggish bookings as more travelers consider whether they can actually afford a holiday trip this year, resorts from the Caribbean to the Colorado Rockies are loosening minimum-stay restrictions, beefing up packages and even rolling out off-season-like discounts to attract cost-conscious travelers.
 Spring Creek Ranch in popular Jackson Hole, Wyo., is offering a Ski Free package over the holidays that includes breakfast, lift tickets and a savings of 30 percent off normal rates. Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort and Spa is offering five nights for the price of four, between Dec. 25 and Jan. 3, and at a lowered nightly rate; this year's package works out to just under $3,800, and would have cost nearly $5,500 last year. And Vail Resorts, which operates several major ski areas and the luxury hotel brand RockResorts, is running a Holidays on Us promotion across all its properties including the popular Hotel Jerome in Aspen, Snake River Lodge & Spa in Jackson Hole and the Landings in St. Lucia. Guests who book five consecutive nights over one of the major holidays by Nov. 1 get the holiday itself, be it Thanksgiving Day, Christmas or Easter, free. 
 Such promotions are normally unheard of over the winter holidays, typically the busiest time for resorts. But this year, the market crash has made some travelers skittish about spending all that money on a vacation. Bjorn Hanson, an associate professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, says that holiday bookings are down around 10 to 15 percent so far versus this time last year. And 66 percent of respondents to a recent poll by Travelocity.com said concerns about the economy would affect their holiday travel plans. Of those who planned to take a holiday trip, 65 percent had not yet booked. 
 Walter S. Ciciora, an engineering consultant from Southport, Conn., is one of those still holding off. He plans to use accrued miles to fly himself and his wife out to Chicago to spend Christmas with her mother. But he hasn't booked the four hotel rooms he needs for the family just yet. ''We will be waiting until the last minute,'' he said, ''hoping for a reasonable deal.'' 
 Some coveted resorts that would usually be fully reserved for the holidays by financial executives and other well-heeled guests actually have space available, as clients postpone vacations or cancel them altogether. ''I'm seeing a lot of e-mails from hotels that space is opening up during Christmas and New Year's,'' said June Sloane, a luxury travel specialist at Sue Brown Travel in Boca Raton, Fla. 
 Some of the best bargains are to be found in places that have already been struggling with the sagging economy amid flight cutbacks and rising airfare and thus are offering what are particularly tempting deals for the holidays. (Always dreamed of celebrating New Year's on a Hawaiian beach? You may finally get the chance.) Even the dollar suddenly looks stronger amid the growing global economic crisis, with the greenback buying more in places like Mexico, South Africa and, especially, Iceland than it did a year ago. Below, a holiday guide for the last-minute traveler:
 Room at the Top
 If your ideal Christmas morning involves waking up in an oceanfront suite with butler service or sipping hot cocoa before heading out of your slopeside hotel room -- and you've never been able to score that kind of trip in the past because you weren't willing to book a year in advance -- you may be in luck this December. 
 A recent call to the reservations line of the Little Nell in Aspen, where a ski concierge is assigned to warm guests' boots, found at least two room categories to choose from (a $1,100-a-night standard mountainside or $1,145-a-night premium townside) for travelers willing to check in on Dec. 18 and check out on Christmas Day. Las Ventanas al Paraiso in Los Cabos, Mexico, where $1,675-a-night one-bedroom suites come with butler service, was sold out from Dec. 26 to Jan 2, but had several suites available Dec. 19 to 26. Cap Juluca, the popular Moorish-style luxury resort on Anguilla, said Thanksgiving bookings have been coming in slower than last year and a three-bedroom villa (at $134,001 for a minimum 14-night package) was still up for grabs from Dec. 20 to Jan. 3. Curtain Bluff Resort in Antigua had an executive one-bedroom suite ($1,845 a night) open for Christmas, but not New Year's. Even the 15-villa Hotel Le Toiny in St. Barts, ever popular among the jet set, had a one-bedroom villa with private pool for the equivalent of $2,650 a night available from Dec. 20 to Dec. 29. 
 Such favorite haunts of the rich aren't offering major deals over the holidays, but some hotels have loosened minimum-stay requirements. Just this month, the Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman changed its original 10-night minimum for arrivals on Dec. 20 to 24 to just seven nights. Similarly, the Regent Palms, whose charges over the holidays are from $990 for a room to $6,900 for a three-bedroom penthouse, shortened its minimum stay from 10 to seven nights. 
 Want to spend New Year's in Miami? As of mid-October, the Ritz-Carlton, South Beach had rooms starting at just under $450 a night, if you stayed for at least four nights, a relative bargain for that sun-splashed playground. (One sign the economy isn't totally ruining some people's vacation plans: some other South Beach hot spots, like the Delano, the Shore Club and the new Gansevoort South are totally booked up that week, based on a recent online search.)
 A well-connected travel agent is often the first to know about last-minute holiday openings, as resorts will often reach out to them to help fill spots when there is a cancellation. Earlier this month, Island Destinations (www.islanddestinations.com), a luxury tour operator that specializes in access to some of the most desirable accommodations, said several hotels in its collection had some availability for the holidays, including Grace Bay Club in the Turks and Caicos; Caneel Bay, a Rosewood Resort in Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands; and Raffles Canouan, the Grenadines. Tablethotels.com was showing availability over Christmas at Bitter End Yacht Club in Virgin Gorda and Strawberry Hill resort in Jamaica earlier this month. 
 And Fourseasons.com has a nifty chart that shows up as an option if your first choice is full up, and maps out availability for the ''festive season'' from Dec. 20 to Jan. 5. An X means the hotel is sold out, WL means you can still get on the wait list, and R means there is limited space available. In a recent check, the Four Seasons Costa Rica was sold out but the Four Seasons Great Exuma in the Bahamas still had space, for rooms starting at $735 a night.
 If you can't get into your dream resort this holiday season, there's always Spring Break. Valerie Wilson, chief executive of Valerie Wilson Travel in Manhattan, which specializes in high-end destinations, said her well-heeled clients haven't curbed their holiday travel plans so far, but she expects that to change after the New Year. ''I think they're going to be more cautions, and it will be slower,'' she said. ''February, March and April spring breaks -- there is more space for those times.''
 The Holidays at Half-Off
 The words ''discounts'' and ''holidays'' aren't typically found in the same sentence. But this year, many resorts are feeling the need to slash prices to get travelers to fill rooms. 
 Travelocity.com is offering what it says is the biggest sale in the company's history with 5,000 hotels offering anywhere from 25 to 50 percent off for travel through Jan. 15. ''Higher gas prices over the summer led to lower occupancy rates,'' said Noreen Henry, vice president for hotels at Travelocity. ''Hotels are doing all that they can to make up for it during the fall and holiday travel season, and they're turning to online travel agencies to help them push inventory.''
 Earlier this month, Starwood Hotels and Resorts began offering 50 percent off a second night at nearly 500 hotels in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean for bookings through March. Among the hotels honoring the deal over Christmas: the W Hotel San Diego, the Westin Embassy Row in Washington, and the Hotel Ivy, a Luxury Collection property in downtown Minneapolis.
 Some of the best bargains are in popular winter resort destinations like Las Vegas, Florida and the Caribbean, which have already been struggling to lure visitors amid flight cutbacks and rising airfare. Average daily room rates have dropped below the $100 mark over Thanksgiving and Christmas in Las Vegas ($98), Orlando ($84) and Fort Lauderdale ($87), according to Cheaptickets.com. For example, starting rates at Treasure Island in Las Vegas are $79 to $89 a night for Christmas week. 
 In the Caribbean, where flight cuts and an active hurricane season had curbed demand even before the financial crisis came into play, Elite Island Resorts is offering a bevy of holiday specials, including free meals, lodging and activities for kids staying at the Verandah Resort & Spa on Antigua and summer rates at Christmas at Long Bay Resort and Villas on Tortola, British Virgin Islands, starting at $173 a person based on double occupancy. 
 ''To have anything available in the Caribbean at Christmas is a real anomaly,'' said Diane McDavitt, president of Luxurylink.com, which offers discounts on high-end hotels and villas through online auctions and special deals. But even this late in the booking season, offers are still coming in. One example: an all-inclusive seven-night stay at St. James's Club in Antigua over Christmas and New Year's was going for $3,802 a night, down from the retail price of $5,432. 
 If a white Christmas is more your style, check out Ski.com's ''special deals'' section, which lists holiday sales like a fifth night free at Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Mont., near Glacier National Park, starting at $584 a person from Dec. 15 to Jan. 1, or four-day lift tickets and five nights at Teton Mountain Lodge in Jackson Hole for the price of four at $1,238 a person. 
 While hotel deals are plentiful, finding a flight can be a challenge with airlines continuing to cut flights and raise fares. Airline ticket prices are up about 25 percent for Christmas and New Year's, compared with a year ago, according to Farecast.com, which tracks the price of flights. 
 Avoid the weekend before Christmas, Rick Seaney of Farecompare.com recommends. Instead, fly on the Tuesday before Christmas or on the holiday itself. Consider flying into a major hub airport like Denver or Salt Lake City and then driving to your destination, as such flights are generally less expensive and there are more to choose from. Earlier this month, Ski.com agents were able to find a $328 round-trip flight from Los Angeles to Denver for a trip Dec. 27 to Jan. 1 using this approach. Signing up for fare alerts, which offer a heads-up when airfares drop, will also help when searching for reasonably priced flights. 
 Go Where the Dollar Is Strong
 Despite the flagging confidence in the United States financial system, the dollar has been showing some surprising resilience.
 This month the Mexican peso dropped to its weakest level ever against the dollar. The Brazilian real also slumped to its lowest level against the dollar. The Argentine peso, which was already at a favorable exchange rate, dropped about 7 percent since late August to a new five-and-a-half-year low. Even the euro, which had climbed to historic heights, has declined in recent weeks. 
 For American travelers looking for bargains abroad, the dollar's newfound muscle represents more buying power. In Mexico a 50-minute massage at ME Cancun's sleek Yhi Spa costs 1,432 pesos or about $112 currently, down from about $143 in August when the peso was trading at roughly 10 to the dollar. In Rio de Janeiro, standard rooms at the Arpoador Inn, just east of Ipanema Beach, start at 190 reals or just $91 at 2.12 Brazilian reals to the dollar, down from about $122 in August. 
 The dollar is up more than 40 percent against the South African rand compared with a year ago, making luxury safaris and Cape Town's high-season hotel rates more affordable. Rooms at the St. James, a seaside Cape Town retreat overlooking Kalk Bay start at 2,600 rand a night in the high season, which means guests would pay about $260 at 10.01 rand to the dollar. A year ago, a room at the same price would have been about $380. Look for last-minute safari deals like the one on CC Africa's offers page, www.safariasap.com, a nine-day adventure visiting the Cradle of Humankind area and the Madikwe Private Game Reserve for 17,748 rand or roughly $1,777, down from 19,778 rand.
 Even perennially expensive London is beginning to look more attractive. Two upscale, centrally located hotels in the British capital -- the Metropolitan and the Halkin -- are offering rooms that are almost $:200 off their rack rates when booked online. A City room at the Metropolitan (where you might run into Prince William at the Met Bar) can be reserved for $:169 not including taxes (or about $290 at $1.73 to the pound), compared with the normal rate of $:375, while a double room at the Halkin is going for $:199, down from around $:390. Details at www.metropolitan.como.bz and www.halkin.como.bz.
 Perhaps most dramatically, Iceland, considered among the most expensive countries in Europe, has seen its currency plummet to almost half its value against the dollar in the past year, making Reykjavik look like a pretty good holiday destination for travelers who don't mind the cold. 
 ''Anything you buy in Iceland is pretty much at half price,'' said Einar Gustavsson, a spokesman for the Iceland Tourist Board.
 The devaluation of the krona is making Reykjavik's hotels, once considered prohibitively expensive, more affordable, if not dirt cheap, especially if bought as part of the attractive airline-and-hotel weekend packages now being offered on the Web, some for a total cost of less than $1,000. Check out Special Offers at www.icelandair.com for details. 
 And if Iceland in winter sounds too cold, consider that one of its more unusual attractions, the Blue Lagoon, the popular geothermally warmed pool just outside the capital, is downright cheap. Admission to the Lagoon is just 2,300 krona (a little over $20 at 112.53 krona to the dollar). (Pay just 15,000 more for access to the ''exclusive bath and lounge'' with private changing rooms, a fireplace and private indoor lagoon.) Meanwhile, Mountain Guides (www.mountainguides.is) is offering a three-hour trek on the Solheimajokull Glacier, including a stop on the way back to see the waterfalls of Skogafoss and Seljalandsfoss. The price is 14,900 krona. (Guides instruct trekkers on how to use necessary ice equipment like crampons.)
 Surfing for Bargains
 Despite rising airfares, a Hawaiian holiday may be one of the best bargains around for vacation seekers. 
 The number of airline seats from the mainland to Hawaii is down about 14 percent, largely because of the shutdown of ATA and Aloha Airlines. While the decrease in seats has helped push airfares higher, hotels and tour operators have responded with discounts to help make up the difference. 
 On average, airfare prices to Honolulu are up $304 for two people traveling Christmas week, according to Farecast.com, which tracks hotel and airline prices, but hotel rates are down by $294, helping to even out the total trip cost. 
 Just this month the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau initiated a winter vacation campaign to lure visitors to the islands with prices that are less expensive than last year, officials said. Some of the bargains, which can be found at GoHawaii.com/Value, are good through the first quarter of 2009 and offer a variety of cost-saving air and hotel packages as well as credits for car rentals and airfare. Pleasant Holidays, for example, is offering 50 percent off companion airline tickets from Los Angeles and San Francisco for travel through Feb. 28 with a three-night hotel stay. And Orbitz.com is offering packages for as much as 35 percent off. 
 Hotel-only deals include seven nights at the Aqua Aloha Surf in Waikiki for just $659 for two people checking in on Dec. 24 and out Dec. 31 from Hawaii Connection (www.hawaiiconnection.com). Starting rates at ResortQuest Kauai Beach at Makaiwa, normally $211 a night during the holidays, have been slashed to $155 a night from Dec. 24 to Jan. 1. All About Hawaii (www.allabouthawaii.com/specials) is offering a fourth night free and $75 dining credit at the Hilton Waikiki Prince Kuhio or a fifth night free and breakfast at the Pacific Beach Hotel. 
 Hawaii's tourism industry, which largely serves visitors from mainland United States and Japan, is counting on the deals to help lure travelers back. For the first eight months of 2008, total arrivals by air and cruise decreased 8.2 percent from the same period last year, to 4.77 million visitors. 
 ''We're starting to see the market react, and there is tremendous value out there,'' said John Monahan, president of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau. And for travelers looking for an escape from their financial worries, he added, Hawaii ''always had a reputation of being a place people can get away from it all.''

An article on Oct. 26 about deals and discounts on hotels and resorts around the world misstated the price for an all-inclusive seven-night stay at the St. James's Club in Antigua over Christmas and New Year's. The price of $3,802 is for the package; it is not the price for one night.

HEADLINE: A Torchbearer, Then and Now

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
THE urge, at times, can be almost overwhelming: Ahmad Batebi will be walking down a New York street, engrossed in some serious business, and he will spot a basketball game. In that moment, he wants more than anything to join in. In the next, he feels a pang of regret for seeming childish. Sometimes, he says, he feels that he has left himself behind.
 Nine years ago, when Mr. Batebi was a 21-year-old film student in Tehran, he was swept up in a protest against the government and arrested. A photographer from The Economist had spotted him holding up the bloody shirt of a fellow protester, and the magazine published the picture on its cover, transforming Mr. Batebi into a symbol of the 1999 student protests. 
 Retribution was harsh: He said he was held in solitary confinement, beaten, cut and tortured. At one point, the authorities led him to a gallows and put a noose around his neck. He saw fellow prisoners killed, he said. Last year, he had several seizures and what was probably a stroke, and was released on medical furlough. Ordered last March to return to prison, he instead fled the country and arrived in the United States, where he is seeking asylum.
 Here, Mr. Batebi's life as a symbol continues. He is tall, with a dark goatee and a long ponytail, and he has been recognized on the street and on the bus to Philadelphia. He is scheduled to speak on Thursday to the local Amnesty International chapter, which had worked to free him since 2002. (The event will be held at Advent Lutheran Church on Broadway at 93rd Street.) Mr. Batebi understands the attention, he said a few days ago through an interpreter. But, he added quietly, with a small smile, he wishes it would end. 
 ''I am 30 years old,'' he said. ''I have spent 10 years of it in prison, and my life has not been really normal since the age of 16 or 17. So at some point I would like to have a normal life.''
 That, so far, has meant blogging about Iranian society and politics for international news Web sites and undergoing treatment at the Bellevue/N.Y.U. Program for Survivors of Torture. Though he shuttles among various places on the East Coast, when he is in the city he stays at a friend's apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. And he maintains a sense of responsibility to those he left behind. 
 This manifested itself in a subtle wince at questions about his long ordeal in an interview at the Brooklyn Heights office of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. He leaned forward and then, lowering his voice, spoke in Farsi to Hadi Ghaemi, the group's coordinator, who interpreted.
 ''He wishes to put an end to the story of Ahmad Batebi as an individual,'' Mr. Ghaemi said. ''Within his own eyewitness experience, what happened to him happened also to 98 percent of the other prisoners. You see violations of human rights in Iran that are actually much more extensive than being able to describe in words. He believes that there are things that people here cannot even dream of taking place.'' (When his story came to light in July, Iran's state-controlled news media suggested that Mr. Batebi had long been in league with Israel and the United States, claims that human rights groups dismiss.)
 Mr. Batebi knows he has had experiences that set him apart from Americans his age -- not just his imprisonment but the realities of growing up in Iran. The country leads the world in juvenile executions and has one of the highest rates of traffic deaths, Mr. Ghaemi said. Two million of its people are believed to be heroin addicts.
 Most Americans, Mr. Batebi realizes, are only dimly aware of this. When they do think of Iran, they think in terms of nuclear proliferation or the Arab-Israeli conflict. In truth, Mr. Batebi admitted, since his arrival he has been distracted -- with work, with everyday tasks, even with following the presidential election.
 Americans, he said, should be proud of their ability to doubt their government, and to change it. That is what he wants for Iran, he said, and it is one reason he still speaks up, suppressing urges for privacy and for the youth he fears he has missed. 
 On this point, he spoke slowly and carefully, so every word could be translated.
 ''If people could stand up and have the right to challenge their government, and not be put down by the government, and know that they have the international community behind them,'' he said, ''then they would change their government's policy and behavior.''

HEADLINE: Does the Bailout Need Some Help?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Only Half a Bailout'' (editorial, Oct. 22) is right about the need for loan modifications to stem the foreclosure crisis. But you have told your readers only half the story.
 First, not all loan modifications are equal. Credit Suisse analysts recently reported that writedowns of the principal balance are a more effective way to keep borrowers in their homes than other kinds of modifications, which have higher redefault rates. 
 Second, Congress provided the Treasury Department with $700 billion that it could have used to leverage loan modifications through the purchase of troubled assets. But Treasury has publicly announced only one use for the appropriated funds to date -- the purchase of preferred equity in financial service firms. 
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has also declared that he doesn't want to attach any conditions on purchases, like requirements to write down principal on loans that these firms hold and service.
 We need to quickly use the most effective range of incentives and pressures to realize widespread loan modifications, before Treasury spends all the funds that Congress has appropriated. 
 The bailout legislation had two objectives: unfreezing the credit markets and keeping people in their homes. If Treasury is truly committed to these two objectives, both can be accomplished simultaneously. My subcommittee will soon be holding a hearing with Treasury and top finance and legal experts to determine the most effective course of action. Dennis J. Kucinich Washington, Oct. 23, 2008
 The writer is chairman of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, Oversight and Government Reform Committee, House of Representatives.
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial touches on an important cause of the current crisis -- the so-called bankruptcy reform of 2005.
 After a multimillion-dollar lobbying effort by the credit industry, this measure made it very difficult for middle-class people to file for bankruptcy using Chapter 7, which liquidates debt. And in most cases, bankruptcy judges are prevented from revising mortgages, which means true relief may be effectively impossible. 
 Making Chapter 7 more available and giving judges power to reform mortgages and consumer debt terms would go a long way toward truly bailing out Main Street.
 Randy Henrick Lake Success, N.Y., Oct. 22, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''This Bailout Doesn't Pay Dividends,'' by David S. Scharfstein and Jeremy C. Stein (Op-Ed, Oct. 21):
 Dividends are the reward for investing. Appreciation is what we expect to guard against inflation and provide for our retirement. Failure to pay dividends results in volatility as shareholders buy and sell to capture earnings.
 The no-dividend climate is symptomatic of what is wrong with our economy. Corporations awash in cash not paying dividends has led to overcompensation of and fiscal misadventures by corporate officers who no longer feel responsibility to shareholders. 
 This cavalier view permeated the housing market, leading to a housing bubble with the rapid buying and selling of houses for quick profit.
 Gerald Geltman Westwood, N.J., Oct. 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Swapping Secrecy for Transparency,'' by Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (Op-Ed, Oct. 19):
 Yes, that decision by Congress in 2000 not to regulate credit-default swaps paved the way for the current mess we are in. So did the decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2004 to let big investment banks keep tabs themselves on their capital requirements, a decision recently reversed. 
 In keeping with Mr. Cox's newfound zeal for transparency, how about directing some sunshine on just who was lobbying Congress and the S.E.C. to make those decisions? Transparency has been severely lacking in more than the credit-default swap business. 
 We need a complete overhaul if we are going to get back to governing and doing business with integrity and old-fashioned caution and common sense.
 Olivia Koppell New York, Oct. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 We are going through tough, painful times, and they will not end soon, but there is satisfaction and a tangible gain in decreasing your consumption, and finding a number of easy ways to do it. Even financially stable friends of mine have quickly cut back on lunches, cable packages, distant vacations, car size, coffee, A.T.M. visits and lawn treatments -- and noticed that daily life does not suffer.
 There's something about finding a dozen fast ways to save money that makes a family into a team, united in a cause, and prompts a certain zeal for having another look at your values and intentions. And, the shock has been so severe that this is likely to outlast whatever the length of the recession is, maybe by many years. 
 It's a new austerity or a recalibration that may affect everything about how people decide, buy and save into the next generation, as it did in 1929, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
 Preston Bealle Darien, Conn., Oct. 22, 2008

HEADLINE: Still Shopping, Perhaps, but Now It's for a Tailor to Make Designer Finery Last

BYLINE: By RAVI SOMAIYA

 BODY:
Kim Simmonds, a 26-year-old corporate lawyer, used to shop for clothes twice a week, sometimes spending up to $2,000 a shot. ''Buying Burberry raincoats didn't even cause me to blink,'' said Ms. Simmonds, who favors boutiques on Prince Street, Sigerson Morrison shoes and the clean, contemporary lines of Theory clothes.
 But about a month ago, when the Wall Street mergers-and-acquisitions deals she works on began to slow down, Ms. Simmonds, who lives in Murray Hill, started to skip some shopping sprees in favor of trips to Future Cleaners and Tailors on Third Avenue, where she paid $40 to repair the lining of a long winter coat and $15 each to fix the fallen hems on a skirt and pants. 
 ''As important as clothes are for me,'' Ms. Simmonds wrote in an e-mail message, ''meeting my rent and credit card payments and trying to get some savings for that rainy day now far surpasses any clothing habit.''
 As the economic downturn leaves many small businesses struggling with rising expenses and a frozen credit market, some tailors in Manhattan have found a silk lining: an uptick in business over the past month, as more people like Ms. Simmonds are choosing to make do by mending. In interviews, several tailors reported increases of 20 percent since September, and similar increases compared with last fall.
 ''It's better than before,'' said Pablo Vargas, who has been measuring, pinning and stitching for 18 years at the Stanton Tailor Shop on the Lower East Side, where storefronts with linoleum floors covered with bolts of cloth and whirring sewing machines survive among the hip bars and restaurants. ''We've had all kinds of people over the last couple of months.''
 One of these new customers is Joy Yoon, a media consultant who recently had a shirt repaired at Mr. Vargas's Stanton Street shop and has also been hand-washing her delicate clothes rather than paying to dry-clean them. ''If I were to go broke tomorrow,'' Ms. Yoon, 28, explained in an e-mail message, ''I can't offer my apartment manager a pair of new $300 jeans as a partial rent payment. Nor could I eat them.'' 
 Samantha Freilich, an events planner who recently had a Phillip Lim tunic dress adapted at the New York Tailor Shop on Kenmare Street, northwest of Chinatown, said she had realized that repairs were also a great way of keeping beloved clothes alive, adding, ''I think people become attached to certain items in their wardrobe.'' 
 Denise Kozlowski, who runs a marketing company and took several skirts and dresses to the Stanton Tailor Shop, said the market crisis had presented a chance for people to ''get more creative with what they have.''
 Uncertain economic times tend to make people reconsider disposable fashion, according to Joyce Hittesdorf, president of the Association of Sewing and Design Professionals, a trade group with 550 members nationwide, most of them doing clothing alterations and repairs.
 Ms. Hittesdorf said many tailors saw business slow over the summer, but in the middle of September, around the time Lehman Brothers collapsed, ''then -- pop -- they were busy again.'' 
 ''I think clients were skittish, but realized they still needed clothes when the seasons changed,'' Ms. Hittesdorf said, speaking by telephone from her tailoring business in Indianapolis. ''The economy is making it so people are thinking about how to make things last longer and make the most of what they have.''
 Mustafa Kip, 39, learned the sewing trade at age 11 in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, and came to New York a decade ago. He opened his own shop -- called Laura and Melinda, after two of his daughters -- at the beginning of September. Up a narrow staircase on Rivington Street, he offers repairs and alterations alongside racks of new clothes, all between walls painted hot pink because, as he said, ''girls like it.''
 He has discounted some of the new clothes to almost half price, but lately, for every five people who come in, Mr. Kip said, ''four are coming to have something fixed, and one comes to look at the new clothes but doesn't buy anything.''
 Some customers spend $20 to $40 for significant work on jackets, pants, coats and handbags; others pay $3 or $4 to fix a rip or replace a faulty zipper. They all want to barter, Mr. Kip said. ''I tell them someone else can do it cheaper, but I'll do it well,'' he said.
 Ole Schell, 34, a filmmaker, had never had clothes repaired before he found Mr. Kip ''just as the market was crashing about a month ago.'' In the weeks since, Mr. Schell has had a David Chu suit, a jacket, a Tumi backpack and his favorite jeans -- which he has had since college -- mended at the shop.
 ''I'm lucky not to have been hit as hard as some people, but everything seems so uncertain now, and I was being incredibly frivolous,'' said Mr. Schell, who lives on Stanton Street. ''I was earning a lot and spending it all, but you never know when it's going to end. Plus it's fun going in there and getting measured, and I've become a big fan of the Turkish pop music he plays.''
 Mr. Kip expressed confidence that he can make sale-rack or secondhand purchases that do not quite fit look like a million dollars for less than $100. But that is still too steep for some. 
 ''I fixed a jacket for one customer, made it smaller and the sleeves shorter, and she didn't come back to collect it,'' he said. ''She said she needed to pay her rent, so couldn't afford the $55. She says she'll be back when she gets some money.''

HEADLINE: Saviors of the American Songbook

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
WHEN the 19th annual Cabaret Convention begins with the first of four concerts at Jazz at Lincoln Center on Wednesday evening, a genre that has struggled for years below the mass-media radar will lift its collective voice in an annual appeal for attention and respect. 
 ''Please listen,'' that voice politely implores. ''I am in danger of dying of neglect, and I have valuable knowledge gleaned from the American songbook and from show business history about love, memory, art and time. The magic I can conjure in a romantic cubbyhole where the lights are low, the wine flows and loved ones are at hand is like no other kind.'' 
 The Rose Theater, the modern auditorium inside Jazz at Lincoln Center where the convention -- part entertainment gala, part trade show for nightclub bookers -- takes place, isn't a candlelit nook, but it must suffice. Each evening, starting at 6, roughly a dozen performers (the roster changes nightly) will sing two songs each. Karen Akers, Paula West, Marilyn Maye, Mary Cleere Haran, Julie Wilson, Barbara Carroll, K T Sullivan, Tommy Tune and Barb Jungr are among this year's most eagerly anticipated guests. 
 Most of the genre's important male stars -- Michael Feinstein, Tom Wopat, Jack Jones, Steve Tyrell and Brian Stokes Mitchell, to name five -- are absent from the roster. But one of its most promising young male performers, Tony DeSare, a Sinatra acolyte in his early 30s who sings Prince as well as Johnny Mercer, will appear on Friday. 
 Cabaret venerates maturity more fervently than any other form of entertainment. Ms. Maye, Ms. Wilson and Ms. Carroll are all in their 80s, as are three of the genre's other godmothers, Barbara Cook, Eartha Kitt and Elaine Stritch, and its unofficial godfather, Tony Bennett. All might be described as sages who take the long view. All are old enough to remember and have participated in the golden age of live entertainment that faded with the incursions of rock 'n' roll and television. From the late 1940s through the mid-'60s there were several tiers of live entertainment in New York: glamorous hotel supper clubs like the Persian Room at the Plaza Hotel and the Empire Room at the Waldorf-Astoria, high-end nightclubs like the Blue Angel, smaller hole-in-the-wall Midtown jazz clubs , and smaller boites and piano bars scattered through Manhattan where one could drop in for the price of a drink. 
 As the nightclub world has shrunk, that kind of informality is largely a thing of the past. The question also continually nags as to whether there is a young generation to carry on the tradition. The few younger stars, like Harry Connick Jr., Diana Krall and Michael Buble, who have passed through cabaret and jazz clubs on their way to the national spotlight rarely look back. 
 Besides Mr. DeSare, the genre's other most promising younger performers include the sultry Long Island pop-jazz singer Jane Monheit and Maude Maggart, a protegee of Andrea Marcovicci and Michael Feinstein. Ms. Maggart, who comes from a Hollywood show-business family (she is the older sister of Fiona Apple), sings Judy Collins and Joan Baez as well as Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern.
 The Cabaret Convention is produced by Donald Smith, executive director of the Mabel Mercer Foundation, an organization named after the great British-born chanteuse who died in 1984. It reflects the refined taste of Mr. Smith,a die-hard champion of the urbane nightclub ethos in which the spirits of Porter, Coward, the Gershwin brothers, Ms. Mercer and Bobby Short hover over concerts that summon fantasies of a long-vanished cafe society. 
 For all the obstacles Mr. Smith faces, his attitude toward the tradition he nurtures is philosophical and surprisingly upbeat. He said recently that he was encouraged by an increase in the number of cabarets outside New York, which with its proximity to Broadway remains the genre's unchallenged hub.
 But while cabaret has high-profile champions in the media, the dwindling coverage of cabaret in New York's local newspapers is a bad omen. 
 ''We've never had any corporate sponsorship,'' Mr. Smith lamented. ''And we haven't gotten a nickel from any government arts program.'' 
 Mr. Smith's concept of cabaret is only one of many in a genre that also shades into Broadway, traditional jazz, rock and even world music. Because a cabaret is the best place for a theatrically trained Broadway performer to step out of a role, it is a natural adjunct to the musical theater. Where else but in a nightclub could Betty Buckley put aside her signature theater hits and bring her probing Method-style interpretations to jazz, rock and country material? 
 When the convention vacated its original home at Town Hall for Jazz at Lincoln Center, a new series, the Broadway Cabaret Festival, jumped into the breach. Created by Scott Siegel, who also produces the New York Nightlife Awards (the nightclub world's equivalent of the Tonys), the festival, which completed its fourth season on Oct. 19, has become a primary showcase for ambitious young Broadway stars to test their wings as soloists. 
 The long-running Lyrics and Lyricists series at the 92nd St. Y and Lincoln Center's American Songbook series also dip heavily into the cabaret world.
 Some stars, like Mr. Connick, Ms. Krall, John Pizzarelli and Dianne Reeves, blur the lines between cabaret and jazz until they are virtually the same. But most don't. Performers in Manhattan supper clubs are expected to create conceptually unified shows that follow an arc and include witty patter. Jazz musicians merely have to play sets that can be made up on the spot; talking is not required. The overlap between Manhattan's high-end jazz clubs and its three major hotel-associated supper clubs, the Cafe Carlyle, Feinstein's at Loews Regency and the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, is infrequent. And instrumental jazz has established almost no footing in cabaret, where a charismatic personality matters as much as musical talent.
 Race has something to do with it. Even in multicultural New York, unspoken divisions persist to this day. Ashford and Simpson have triumphed at Feinstein's at Loews Regency for three years running. But other African-American performers, like the great singing actress Lillias White, have fared disappointingly in the same club. At the Oak Room, Ms. West, an African-American pop-jazz singer, is the only performer of color to have established a loyal following. 
 The only truly multicultural venue in New York, Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, has a high turnover of acts from every corner of music. It might more accurately be described as a hip musical clearinghouse than as a cabaret. 
 Many complain about the prices at Manhattan's supper clubs, of which the Cafe Carlyle is the most expensive. There the cost for two tickets plus dinner for two (usually required) can run upwards of $500. Comparatively speaking, however, that is not much more than the price of dinner for two and good seats at a Broadway musical. Although hotel spokesmen, when pressed for details, are vague about the profitability of their cabarets, it is generally acknowledged that their profits are marginal at best.
 The peak cabaret experience is a three-way relationship among singer, song (often a standard) and audience in which performers pour their life experiences in thematic shows using the American songbook as a platform; songs are stations in an autobiographical journey shared with the listener.
 Cabaret connoisseurs know that a great nightclub show delivers a richer artistic experience than that offered by almost any Broadway musical, Stephen Sondheim's excepted. A great example is Jessica Molaskey's version of Billy Joel's ''Summer, Highland Falls.'' Her rendition transforms lyrics that sounded peevish and awkwardly verbose on Mr. Joel's 1976 album, ''Turnstiles,'' into an acute psychoanalytic dissection of a turbulent relationship that has reached an impasse. 
 Reinvented as a wistful bossa nova in which Ms. Molaskey's husband, the scintillating jazz guitarist and crooner John Pizzarelli, inserts quotations from Antonio Carlos Jobim, ''Summer, Highland Falls'' makes you gasp at its truthfulness about the intractability of clashing personalities in a dissolving partnership. The Pizzarelli-Molasky duo, whose extended engagement at the Cafe Carlyle ends this Saturday, are as good as it gets in any entertainment medium.
 Equally compelling is Ms. Jungr, a 54-year-old Briton with a gregarious music-hall personality and formidable acting skills whose interpretations of Jacques Brel, Nina Simone and Bob Dylan songs (her live version of ''Just Like a Woman'' can be seen on YouTube) make you hear them as though for the first time. 
 To coincide with the convention, Ms. Jungr, who is there on Saturday, and Ms. Maye, who appears on Wednesday, are playing return dates (Nov. 3 for Ms. Junger, Nov. 1 and 2 for Ms. Maye) at the Metropolitan Room, a small club in Chelsea where each recently enjoyed a sold-out engagement with cheering audiences. 
 The two-and-a-half-year-old Metropolitan Room -- a former comedy club that seats 110, is reasonably priced and doesn't serve dinner -- has quickly ascended into New York's leading showcase for talent ready to make the leap into uptown supper clubs or the stage. It is at New York's lower-echelon clubs where professionalism gives way to vanity shows in which aspiring stars are expected to bring their friends to justify their booking.
 But even the most acclaimed cabaret performers must wrestle with the hard economic realities of a field in which doing it for love is often the only reason to do it. After expenses, a midlevel performer who is paid $10,000 a week barely breaks even. The typical cabaret contract requires a performer to be exclusive to that club for at least six months. 
 For most performers, the usual avenues of publicity and promotion are closed. Morning television shows routinely turn down cabaret singers. If a performer comes from television there is a built-in audience, but with a caveat. Dixie Carter appeared regularly at the Cafe Carlyle, but when her television show ''Designing Women'' finished its run, her cabaret audience evaporated. 
 Most performers rely on reviews and word of mouth. Radio is of limited help. In New York City the disc jockey and author Jonathan Schwartz is the only influential champion of traditional popular music. Erudite and passionate, he has single-handedly boosted the careers of the Los Angeles pop-jazz singer Tierney Sutton, who appears regularly at Birdland, and kept alive the memory of Nancy LaMott, a gifted balladeer who died in 1995. 
 In the shouting, brawling world of mainstream pop, the essential qualities of a cabaret performance -- intimacy, emotional vulnerability and interpretive subtlety -- have little place. In many ways cabaret embodies artistic values that are the antithesis of those promoted by that monstrous star-making machine, ''American Idol.'' In Simon Cowell's critical lexicon, the words ''too cabaret'' are a damning indictment. 
 ''American Idol'' treats singing as an Olympic-style competitive sport in which songs, edited into fragments, no longer tell stories. Their remains become heavily amplified exhibitions of stamina and ego by performers for whom youth, beauty and novelty matter as much as talent. 
 For the majority of Americans, live music is now an arena-ready event that exalts raw physical energy and the kind of prowess measurable in athletic terms. The typical concert is an orgiastic rite of communion between the public and celebrity. Demolished to make room for coliseums where blood sports rule, the romantic cubbyhole has become as anachronistic as the notion of privacy itself.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island, Leading Pack In Job Losses, Struggles On

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: JOHNSTON, R.I. 

 BODY:
The family resemblance shared by John Hallam, his brother Arthur, and their cousin Dennis goes far beyond their ruddy features these days.
 All three were laid off this year from jobs they had held for more than a decade, with John losing two jobs in just the last nine months. Dennis's 29-year-old daughter, Mary, a single mother of two, is out of work too, having lost her job at a restaurant when summer ended. 
 ''What the hell's going to happen to us?'' asked John, 58, who drove a truck for a lumber company. ''There are no good jobs here anymore.''
 Or enough jobs of any kind. Rhode Island now has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, the first time the state has held that distinction in the three decades since such records have been kept. 
 With unemployment at 8.8 percent, Rhode Island has edged past Michigan, and every month seems to bring fresh reports of companies cutting workers, shutting divisions, closing altogether.
 ''I hate to say it but a distinct improvement for Rhode Island right now would be to have our economy be dead in the water,'' said Leonard Lardaro, an economics professor at the University of Rhode Island, who compiles an index of Rhode Island's economic health. ''Statistically this is the worst year. Clearly we're going down faster than other states.'' 
 Saul Kaplan, executive director of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-state agency, said the situation ''could likely get worse before it gets better,'' adding, ''ironically, we were the home of the Industrial Revolution.'' 
 Rhode Island has often taken economic crises hard, even as Northeast neighbors, especially Massachusetts and Connecticut, showed more resilience. 
 ''Historically, Rhode Island is one of the first states to feel it and one of the last to come out of it,'' said Amy Kempe, a spokeswoman for Gov. Donald L. Carcieri, who has cut about 1,500 jobs from the state payroll in the last year. ''With this economic downturn, Rhode Island definitely started to feel the pinch a year ago.''
 There are several reasons Rhode Island has fared so poorly in the economic crisis gripping the country. 
 For one thing, said Sandra M. Powell, director of the state's Department of Labor and Training, the economy here ''has been traditionally strong in the manufacturing sector,'' which has ''shed jobs quite a bit over the last several years.''
 Rhode Island also has few big companies -- more than 80 percent of businesses employ fewer than 20 employees -- and small employers have less reserves to withstand economic turmoil, Ms. Powell said. 
 Mr. Kaplan said that as the industrial jobs moved out of the state, it had become too dependent on lower wage service jobs like retail and hospitality, which he said were ''very vulnerable to economic downturns.'' 
 The state also has too few knowledge-based jobs in industries like health care, biotechnology, digital media and financial services, he said. ''Only 40 percent of our jobs pay above the national average wage of $42,000,'' he said. ''Massachusetts is 60 percent, Connecticut is 60 percent, which should be our goal.''
 Many economic analysts and state officials say Rhode Island has long had a high tax burden for businesses, discouraging them from moving here.
 And the mortgage crisis is brutal here, largely because the housing boom attracted commuters from Boston and second homeowners from New York to Rhode Island's relatively low-priced homes. This raised home prices so steeply that now the housing market is cratering further and faster than elsewhere, said Mark Higgins, dean of the University of Rhode Island's business school.
 There have been recent bright spots, including the expansion of a biotech company, and the luring of a large natural foods distributor with 150 jobs and of an offshore wind project promising 800 jobs.
 ''There are wins,'' Ms. Kempe said, ''but we need to intensify the effort.''
 The wins, so far, have not eased the number of foreclosures, faltering businesses and struggling families. 
 ''I've worked since I was 14 and I always depended on myself, and now I have to depend on somebody else,'' said Marianela Olivo, 30, who was laid off after six years at Burger King. 
 A mother of two who lives in Newport, better known for sumptuous seaside mansions, Ms. Olivo has been forced to move from a $1,200-a-month rental to $400-a-month subsidized housing, and to get food from a food pantry. Her unemployment compensation, $409 a week, ends next month.
 ''I have my kids in counseling now at school to help them deal with the change in school, the change in neighborhood, the things I can't buy them,'' said Ms. Olivo, as her eyes stung with tears. ''They need to understand that things are not the same.''
 Another Newport food pantry patron is Dianne Ford, 39, who lives in a housing project with her nine children, including two sets of twins. Studying to be a nurse, Ms. Ford is searching without success for a night job, increasingly forced to stretch every penny.
 ''As soon as my kids get home from school it's like 'I want a snack,' and I'm like 'Can you wait until dinner' because I don't have it,'' she said. 
 The food pantry, run by the East Bay Community Action Program, is seeing a spike in demand -- more than 3,700 families have paid more than 10,000 visits this year to the program's three pantries, in Newport, East Providence and Tiverton, up from 3,000 people and 8,800 visits in the same period last year, said Karen Izzo and Lily Ramey, who oversee the food program. 
 Statewide, food programs represented by the Rhode Island Community Food Bank are serving 3,000 more families a month than usual, and distributing 70,000 pounds more food, much of it to newly jobless ''people who have never asked for food assistance before,'' said Andrew Schiff, the food bank's executive director. 
 ''It has such a ripple effect on everything,'' said Dorothy Mattiello, vice president for human resources at Hope Global, a Cumberland company making engineered textiles for car interiors and the military. Ms. Mattiello's company is better off than many, having had only two layoffs, and is reducing all 200 employees to a four-day week under a program that allows them to collect unemployment for the fifth day. 
 ''We're very, very fortunate,'' she said. ''We have tons of people applying to the company for positions.'' 
 Working to remedy the situation, Governor Carcieri has formed a tax policy committee to recommend changes. Mr. Kaplan said state and economic leaders were ''moving full steam ahead to create a new economy here'' to ''come out of this downturn stronger than the way we went in it.''
 That could not come too soon for the Hallam family. Dennis, 59, who lost his job of 22 years with a company that packages cooking oil, said his unemployment check covered his mortgage, but nothing else. He has not seen his doctor for follow-ups on his prostate surgery because his health insurance has run out. 
 He applied for state medical assistance, but was told he needed to be 65. And when he tried to apply for a truck driver's license, he failed a required math test. 
 ''What kind of math do you need to know?'' he asked. ''Just don't take a 15- foot truck under a 13-foot bridge.'' 
 Arthur, 60, who worked with Dennis, now has to pay out of pocket for medicine for anxiety and high blood pressure, and fills empty hours by walking in the park because it is free. 
 ''You don't seethe light at the end of the tunnel,'' Arthur said. 
 ''And,'' added Dennis, ''there's about a million boulders in that tunnel you got to climb over to get through.''

HEADLINE: A Lesson in Finance Also Learned at Home

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com

DATELINE: GREENBURGH 

 BODY:
 FOR the most part, they are shielded, their parents seldom letting on what is really going on. But trouble has an insidious way of making itself known, and 11- and 12-year-olds in the Town of Greenburgh seem to have slowly come to realize that the American economy is dreadfully sick.
 Jasmine Bradwell, 11, whose exuberance is crowned by a ready laugh, knew something was wrong when she visited Costco two weeks before Halloween. ''They had plenty of candy,'' she said. ''Last year they were out.'' 
 Her assessment that people are not buying as much candy may be less than authoritative because she was in Costco before the season's peak, but Jasmine has also seen how many stores are seductively trumpeting sales and she worries that people have become gun-shy about shopping. Christmas and her birthday are coming up, and perhaps she won't get as generous presents as in the past.
 Lordess Turner, 11, was recently selling chocolates to raise money for her school and, she recalled, ''People said they couldn't pay for it.''
 ''The stock market is going down, and they don't get as much pay as they used to,'' she said.
 Jasmine and Lordess were among a dozen children, most of them sixth and seventh graders in Greenburgh's schools, who sat around a table at the Theodore D. Young Community Center chatting about the economy. They are part of an after-school practical-business program that Greenburgh is running under a $335,000 contract with a nonprofit firm, the Xposure Foundation.
 The students will learn the mechanics of applying for jobs and good etiquette and habits at work. They will also receive $12 a week to save or invest as they see fit. Some money may wind up in partial shares in the stock market, so the students could soon learn about the maddening capriciousness of that beast. 
 The students, for the most part, don't watch news programs or read The Wall Street Journal regularly, but the bad news is out there in the ether -- in remarks dropped at the dinner table, in stray comments from relatives, in sudden moves friends make because a house has been foreclosed on. Some end up worrying and wondering, even if their parents try to cheer them up.
 Giovanni Sanchez, 12, learned that an uncle had been fired. Keyonah Bratton, 11, learned the same about a cousin of hers. Awa Nyambi, 11, a slight, bright-eyed young man, has a mother who works at a hard-hit travel company in White Plains. ''Mom was talking about the stock dropping and how they may have to let go of some people, people who work on her team,'' he said. ''They don't have all the money to afford to keep them on the team.'' 
 Adriana Bailey's father works for the New York Stock Exchange, though, like many other 12-year-olds, she doesn't know precisely what her father does.
 ''Lots of people at his job are getting fired, and he's afraid he'll be in the next round,'' she said.
 Her eyes glimmered, and she looked palpably upset and a little confused. ''He used to buy a lot of stuff, jewelry and laptops,'' she said. ''He has to stop buying it.''
 For one thing, these children are clearly sensing the desperate maneuvers of high finance and the United States Treasury.
 ''Popular banks like Chase are taking over little banks,'' Jasmine said. ''People are losing their bank accounts. My mom changed to Chase. Before she had her money in HSBC.''
 In many ways, they know their parents' days of wine and roses are over -- at least for a while. 
 Ciarra Williams, 12, has a friend who had to move back with her father after her mother lost her home.
 ''A lot of people are losing their houses because of the high mortgage, and it's causing poverty,'' she said. 
 ''My mom's friend, their house is about to go into foreclosure because she couldn't pay,'' Jasmine chimed in. ''It was a nice house too.''
 Teara Williams, 12, Ciarra's twin sister, noticed how her school was trying fund-raising gimmicks like talent shows so it could afford to maintain the school and buy supplies.
 And the students are mad at the way grown-ups have frittered away money, even as our new Gilded Age has been turning to dross. Jasmine wondered what was the need of a new Yankee Stadium when the old one did the job perfectly well.
 ''I could see if something was wrong with the building, but who needs a new stadium?'' she said. 
 That sparked an echo of outrage from Ciarra. ''They're going through a depression and they think about a stadium?'' she asked. ''It makes no difference whether it's old or new.''
 Their sense of the nation's financial meltdown is already influencing their plans for what they will do with the money they earn. They're thinking of investing in stocks that rely on what people always do, good times and bad. People have to eat even if a depression hits. So McDonald's was a stock the students touted.
 ''I'm going to invest in Apple,'' Jasmine said. ''They make a lot of money -- iPods, iPhones, computers. People like that stuff.''
 That brought a chuckle from Raymond L. Thomas Jr., Xposure's executive director.
 ''It's always the kids who know when the next big thing is,'' he said.
 But Jasmine quickly confessed to some second thoughts about her money.
 ''I'll put it in savings,'' she decided. ''Because the way the stocks are going. I'm going to lose.''

HEADLINE: General Motors, Driven to the Brink

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY; Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Nick Bunkley from Janesville, Wis.

 BODY:
IN late May, senior executives at General Motors confronted a decision that few thought they would ever face: whether to continue developing the next generation of one of the most successful products in G.M.'s 100-year history -- the full-size sport utility vehicle -- or to punt the program entirely.
 It's rare for an automaker to pull the plug on high-profile initiatives, much less one involving a $2 billion, top-to-bottom overhaul of a high-volume vehicle that once helped it rake in cash.
 This was also G.M.'s flagship platform, code-named CXX, which would underpin popular models like the Escalade, Yukon and Suburban, brawny tanks that had defined the auto giant's image for more than 15 years. 
 The executives killed the CXX project without a single dissenting vote. And with that, the era of the big S.U.V. was as good as dead, done in by soaring gasoline prices and consumers fleeing to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. 
 ''It would have been very difficult in today's environment to spend a couple of billion dollars to do a replacement,'' said Robert A. Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman and head of product development. ''Reality had set in.''
 G.M.'s reality is, indeed, a harsh one.
 After losing $18.8 billion in the first half of this year and facing more red ink for months to come, G.M. is now trying to salvage its future through a possible merger with Chrysler, another deeply troubled American automaker.
 Amid the financial crisis and the chaos on Wall Street, the struggles of G.M., the world's largest automaker, have been just another startling development in a season chock full of startling news. 
 Yet it is an epic moment. Autos have been prized jewels in America's industrial crown for the better part of a century, and Detroit once dominated a truly global industry. Now, possible bankruptcy looms for G.M. and perhaps Chrysler. 
 As of Friday, shares of G.M. were down 76 percent for the year and Ford shares were down 70 percent. While American automakers are certainly the victims of their own missteps, the broader economic downturn is now working against them as well. Even Toyota, the mighty Japanese automaker, announced on Friday its first quarterly drop in sales in seven years.
 Like the nation's banks, Detroit automakers are pushing for the federal government to use taxpayer money to rescue them from their mistakes, but it is uncertain how much Uncle Sam will aid the industry.
 What is clear is that Detroit, among its other miscues in recent years, particularly overindulged its romance with S.U.V.'s, leaving it tethered to a product line that may prove to be the industry's undoing.
 For its part, G.M., once admired as ''the General'' of the global auto industry, has been pushed to the brink of collapse. Besides its mating dance with Chrysler, G.M. has taken other bold steps to try to reverse a slide that analysts say is causing it to burn through an estimated $1 billion in cash each month.
 Within days of its decision to abandon the CXX program, G.M. announced another round of North American plant closures, including the planned shutdown of its sprawling factory in Janesville, Wis., where the big S.U.V. was born in the early 1990s. G.M. has promised to carve an additional $10 billion of its costs in a frantic effort to preserve its dwindling cash. It's a far cry from the glory days of S.U.V.'s, when their sales fueled fat profits for G.M. and its rivals, Chrysler and Ford.
 ''For a long time, gas was cheap and money was easy and Americans wanted these big vehicles,'' said John Casesa, a principal in the Casesa Shapiro Group, the auto consulting firm. ''There was no downside -- until the bottom fell out.''
 GENERAL MOTORS lived off its S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks since they were introduced, and made one last, huge investment in new models that hit the market two years ago.
 In fact, the company accelerated development of those vehicles to offset otherwise shrinking revenue.
 But in retrospect, G.M. made one bet too many on the market for S.U.V.'s., whose sales have tumbled more than 30 percent this year and have been in decline since 2004. All of the Big Three have had to close plants, lay off thousands of workers and take substantial charges to cover the declining value of S.U.V.'s coming back to dealers from expired leases.
 Although even top-tier automakers like Toyota have been stung by the falloff, G.M., the biggest producer of full-size sport utilities, has been hurt the worst. The impact hit home two weeks ago in Janesville, a city of 64,000 about 75 miles southwest of Milwaukee.
 On Oct. 13, G.M. announced that its 90-year-old plant there, the company's oldest factory in the United States, would build its last S.U.V. just before the Christmas holidays.
 Just a year ago, the Janesville plant was churning out 20,000 Suburbans, Yukons and Tahoes each month. As the assembly lines wind down, the plant is now producing less than 100 S.U.V.'s a day. 
 Only 1,200 employees remain from a work force that once numbered 5,000, and the end is drawing near.
 The workers there are stunned by the plant's sudden demise. After building 3.76 million S.U.V.'s over the last 18 years, Janesville is headed for the automotive scrap heap.
 ''They told us it would never end, that it was a recession-proof vehicle and we'd never be able to build enough of them,'' said Daryl Klemp, who was hired in 1995, when sales of S.U.V.'s were booming. He has been laid off since August, and he spends his days on his farm wondering how it all went wrong.
 ''We thought we were the luckiest auto workers in the world,'' he said. ''We had the product that everybody wanted, and all of a sudden, poof.''
 There was a day, of course, when the big S.U.V.'s represented the automaker's salvation.
 G.M. was struggling at the end of the 1980s, losing market share in its core lineup of passenger cars to more nimble and inventive Japanese competitors.
 Then the S.U.V. rolled in.
 Whereas Chrysler appealed to baby boomers with young families who lined up to buy its boxy minivans, Ford and G.M. introduced rugged new vehicles adapted from small pickups -- like the Ford Explorer and the Chevrolet Blazer -- that were catching on as sexier alternatives to humdrum station wagons. 
 The new ''sport utility'' vehicles had rough suspensions and few creature comforts, but younger consumers, mostly men, were drawn to their outdoorsy image.
 Executives in G.M.'s truck division proposed that a bigger version of the vehicle be adapted off the company's full-size pickup platform.
 ''We weren't sure where the market was going at the time, but it wasn't a difficult challenge to do,'' said Clifford J. Vaughn, a senior truck executive at the time. 
 So, in 1990, the company stopped making compact cars and small pickups in Janesville and renovated the plant to build the new Chevrolet and GMC Suburban S.U.V.
 In short order, the seven-passenger, ''full size'' S.U.V. became one of the hottest vehicles G.M. had ever introduced. In the first year of production, Janesville built 33,000 of them. Within two years, the plant was cranking out 200,000 annually.
 Workers in Janesville were amazed at how quickly production increased. ''You could work as much overtime as you wanted,'' said Jim Glass, the third generation of his family to work in the plant.
 A second car plant, in Arlington, Tex., was converted to feed the growing demand for the big S.U.V.'s. Ford introduced its own full-size models -- the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator -- and Detroit quickly became locked in an automotive arms race.
 ''We tried to outdo each other as to who was going to do the biggest, best S.U.V.,'' Mr. Vaughn said. ''Americans just got so tuned into these vehicles, and it seemed people couldn't get enough of them.''
 More important, G.M. was earning an estimated $10,000 to $15,000 on every big S.U.V. it sold. In contrast, G.M. admittedly lost money on most of its passenger cars. But even as its share of the car market continued to decline, the profits from big sport utilities flooded in.
 Union contracts meant that the Big Three had significantly higher labor costs than their Japanese competitors. But the big S.U.V.'s provided such ample profits that Detroit was still able to keep its plants running, its workers paid. and its growing health care and pension obligations covered.
 G.M. began adding variations on the full-sized S.U.V. In 1995, the company introduced the Tahoe, a somewhat smaller version of the Suburban, which swiftly became its biggest seller.
 Three years later, G.M. brought out its first luxury model, the Cadillac Escalade, and followed up by buying the Hummer brand from a small manufacturer of vehicles for the military.
 By 2003, G.M.'s full-size S.U.V. production peaked at 680,000 vehicles. In Janesville, production had been averaging a quarter-million vehicles annually for a decade, and workers there were riding high. ''Everything was great,'' Mr. Glass said. ''Gas was at $2 a gallon, and we built the best vehicles that people loved forever.''
 Life in Janesville seemed to revolve around the plant, its single large smokestack bearing the blue G.M. logo rising high above a bend in the Rock River. ''The identity of the community for decades has been that we're in the automotive business,'' said John Beckord, president of a community development group called Forward Janesville.
 Downtown streets were filled with Tahoes, Yukons and Suburbans bought by workers with their employee discounts. ''If you lived here you would have thought that every other person bought one of those things,'' Mr. Beckord said.
 Every January, the Kiwanis Club would assemble a stripped-down Suburban, using parts donated by the plant, and park it on an ice-covered lagoon in a local park. Then, to raise money for charity, residents bought tickets and tried to guess the exact date and time that the vehicle would plunge through the melting ice during the spring thaw.
 ''It's a bit of a spectacle to drive by and see that sitting out there and wonder when it's going to fall through,'' Mr. Beckord said.
 But like the ice in Traxler Park, the market for big S.U.V.'s would begin to melt.
 WITH fuel-economy ratings averaging 15 miles per gallon or less, big S.U.V.'s were made possible by a steady supply of cheap gasoline.
 G.M. began sensing the vulnerability of the market in the summer of 2005, when gas prices shot up in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Sales of big S.U.V.'s dropped sharply, just as G.M. was in the midst of the first stages of a broad turnaround plan.
 ''The market kind of fell off a cliff, which was very difficult to deal with,'' said Mark R. LaNeve, head of G.M.'s North American sales. ''It was burning down just when we were trying to do our turnaround.''
 But G.M.'s chairman, Rick Wagoner, and his board had already decided to move up the introduction of a redesigned line of big S.U.V.'s and pickups.
 The profits from those vehicles were considered crucial to carry G.M. through the overhaul of its North American operations and to offset its eroding market share. G.M. was also planning to offer buyouts to as many as 35,000 workers, and the last thing it needed was a shortfall in revenue from its S.U.V.'s.
 The automaker invested $175 million to update its Janesville plant so it could churn out refashioned S.U.V.'s. When the vehicles began rolling off the assembly line in 2006, workers were told that the theme of the new product was ''Our future's so bright that we've got to wear sunglasses,'' Mr. Glass said.
 Mr. Wagoner has often been asked whether G.M. miscalculated its need to invest billions of dollars to develop all-new S.U.V.'s.
 ''We, like everybody else, didn't anticipate fuel prices to go up like they did,'' he said recently.
 Mr. Wagoner also pointed out that G.M.'s biggest rival, Toyota, invested heavily in new truck production in the United States just as the pickup and S.U.V. markets were crashing.
 But big trucks were never the underpinning of Toyota's success, and the Japanese juggernaut never lost sight of its goal of becoming a leader in hybrid gas-electric vehicles and small cars. G.M. is just now making an all-out effort to catch up in the small-car arena, and its hybrid sales are still far behind Toyota's. 
 Besides G.M.'s top brass, labor unions also wanted to hang on to S.U.V. production. In the United Automobile Workers' national contract talks last year, the shop chairman for Local 95 in Janesville, John Dohner, was on the bargaining team, spending several months in Detroit.
 ''I only went up there for one reason -- to try to hold onto Janesville,'' Mr. Dohner recalls.
 The contract reached last fall included product guarantees for several of G.M.'s assembly plants, including a new line of S.U.V.'s for Janesville to come out in 2012. But those guarantees evaporated when sales of sport utility vehicles crashed this spring and summer.
 By the time the truck market went into its free fall in April, G.M.'s product developers had already been working for months on the top-secret CXX platform for the next generation of big S.U.V.'s and pickups.
 The CXX project was considered a leap forward for G.M., and would have provided a lighter, more fuel-efficient platform for the next models. Then, in May, the product board scrapped it.
 At G.M.'s annual meeting in June, Mr. Wagoner said ''structural changes'' in the United States vehicle market would force the closing of four assembly plants, including Janesville.
 The company, Mr. Wagoner said, would speed up the development of smaller cars and engines, and it reaffirmed its commitment to bring out the electric-driven Chevrolet Volt by 2010. On top of all this, Mr. Wagoner said G.M. was considering the sale of its Hummer brand.
 To date, G.M. has reduced its annual S.U.V. and pickup production by 800,000 vehicles. And the cost of flooding the market with sport utility vehicles is also coming back to haunt the automaker.
 In the second quarter alone, G.M. took $1.3 billion in write-offs to reflect the drop in the value of trucks and S.U.V.'s coming off lease. Overdependence on big S.U.V.'s has also hit Ford and Chrysler hard, but, as the biggest producer, G.M. had the most to lose.
 ''We made so much money on these vehicles for so long, I guess we just didn't see it coming,'' said Mr. Vaughn, who retired from G.M. in 1996.
 So now G.M. finds itself in a race against time. It's pouring resources into new cars like the Chevrolet Malibu, and is competitive in the crossover market with entries like the Buick Enclave and the GMC Acadia.
 Still, its dealerships are crowded with lines of unsold Tahoes and Suburbans, which increasingly look like dinosaurs in a gas-conscious marketplace.
 Analysts see little point now in second-guessing G.M.'s huge commitment to the S.U.V. market when gas was cheap and Americans bought the vehicles in droves.
 ''In the 1990s, G.M.'s North American operations were very profitable only because of those big vehicles,'' Mr. Casesa, the auto analyst, said. ''That was how they stayed alive.''
 Yet by focusing so heavily on bigger products for so many years, G.M. put off investing in cars that consumers want now. The company is also struggling to dismantle the truck-making infrastructure it had so diligently erected.
 To be sure, G.M. still expects to sell big S.U.V.'s, but not at nearly the volumes it enjoyed in the past. And they will not be built in Janesville. Production will now be concentrated in Arlington.
 Community and political leaders from Janesville have pleaded with G.M. management to consider putting a new, small car into the plant. Workers don't expect that to happen, though, and they see little hope of a reprieve.
 ''We thought they'd stick with us a little bit longer, and that they'd share the hurt between us and Arlington,'' said Andy Richardson, who recently took office as the new president of Local 95. ''And they didn't.''
 Mr. Richardson said many workers hoped to transfer to other G.M. plants, although some will hold on to the slim possibility that Janesville could get another product.
 ''If G.M. wants to build lawn chairs in Janesville, we'll do it,'' he said.
 The closing of the Janesville plant will add 1,200 workers to the more than 40,000 hourly employees that G.M. has cut over the last three years.
 If the merger with Chrysler goes through, more reductions are expected as the two automakers combine operations. One plant that won't have to be considered is Chrysler's own large S.U.V. plant in Newark, Del. Last week, Chrysler said that factory will already be mothballed by the end of this year.

To the Editor:
 ''Rivals' Visions Differ on Unleashing Innovation'' (''If Elected ...'' series, front page, Oct. 17) got it right: for decades, the United States led the technology revolution sweeping the world, thanks to our strong base in science and engineering. We now import more high technology than we export. 
 American students have dropped well below average in international rankings to 19th in math and 14th in science. Our students ranked behind Canada, Japan and Western Europe -- even behind emerging Eastern European countries like Slovenia and Estonia and behind Liechtenstein.
 Yet you did not mention one of the recommendations from the landmark report ''Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which called for a public-private response to the crisis. 
 As a result, the National Math and Science Initiative was created in 2007. The initiative has moved rapidly to provide grants to get more students into more challenging math and science classes and to train more math and science teachers.
 The private sector is responding. Our government leaders need to do their part. Financing the America Competes Act should be part of any economic stimulus package. We are leaving our children a big deficit; we need to at least give them the tools to be competitive so they can pay it.

HEADLINE: Trophies Losing Their Luster

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
THEY say you can't time the market, but in the last few weeks, some very smart people in business and finance have suddenly put some very expensive Manhattan apartments on the market, or cut prices, perhaps betting that prices will fall later if economic conditions worsen. 
 One hedge fund manager, Scott Bessent, recently listed his 11-room duplex at One Sutton Place South, the gracious prewar building overlooking the East River near East 56th Street, for $12.5 million, asking just $500,000 more than what he paid for it 15 months earlier. The apartment was previously owned by Patricia Kennedy Lawford. 
 Last May, Oscar Schafer, a managing partner of O. S. S. Capital Management, a hedge fund, paid $14.67 million for a three-bedroom corner apartment at the Plaza on Fifth Avenue and Central Park South, and promptly put it back on the market for $18 million. Last week, he cut the price for the second time, to $14.5 million -- less than he had paid, according to city records. 
 Over the last 30 days or so, long after the start of the fall selling season, 27 apartments were put on the market for $10 million to $20 million, according to data on Streeteasy.com, a real estate Web site.
 At the Majestic, a 29-story co-op topped by twin towers on Central Park West and West 72nd Street, two three-bedroom units went on the market within hours of each other last week. One on the 17th floor is described by its broker as having ''the ultimate renovation,'' including curved white rift oak doors; the asking price is $12 million. The owner is a former senior managing director of Bear Stearns, which has been taken over by JPMorgan Chase. 
 The other, on the eighth floor and on the market for $13.8 million, is described as ''the most magnificently renovated grand apartment to become available on Central Park West in years.'' It is owned by a managing director of Allied Capital, whose stock price plunged after a subsidiary filed for bankruptcy protection last month. 
 Brokers say that while there is some fear and hesitation in the market, some of these sellers may be looking to shed trophy apartments that suddenly seem overly ostentatious in the current national mood. They may also be selling because they want a bigger or smaller place to live. 
 Lois Nasser, a vice president at Sotheby's International Realty, said Mr. Schafer was selling at the Plaza simply because he had changed his mind. ''Oscar Schafer has the most beautiful duplex penthouse at the Hampshire House and has recently bought the contiguous apartment,'' she said. 
 At the Park Laurel, a 40-story tower at 15 West 63rd Street, between Central Park West and Broadway, asking prices are tumbling. A 2,800-square-foot four-bedroom apartment with a terrace, owned by Charles Michaels of the hedge fund Sierra Global Management, has languished on the market since February with an asking price of $14.9 million.
 But two weeks ago, Steven F. Stuart, who left the Fortress Investment Group last year to become a founder of a new hedge fund, Garrison Investment, listed the apartment directly above (but without a terrace) for $10.8 million, a 28 percent discount. And then on Wednesday a similar unit in the same vertical line of apartments on the 37th floor, owned by Ira Resnick of the Resnick real estate family, went on the market for $10 million. 
 Several hours after being asked about the pricing of the Michaels listing, his broker, Judith A. Furgiuele of Brown Harris Stevens, announced that it had just been taken off the market. 
 At the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue and 59th Street, two apartments were briefly on the market for $15 million. One on the 33rd floor was listed in August by Alexa Lambert of Stribling & Associates on behalf of Eli Broad, the Los Angeles financier. 
 Then about a week and a half ago, Jeffrey Steiner, the former chief executive of the Fairchild Corporation, put his 11th-floor apartment on the market for the same price. But within a few days that price was cut to $13.5 million, after word began to circulate that an Italian fashion figure had agreed to buy the Broad apartment for about $14 million, but had so far held off signing the sales contract. 
 Mr. Bessent, who once worked with the financier George Soros, is now a senior managing director of Protege Partners, another hedge fund. Yet despite his financial acumen, he has not made a killing in Manhattan real estate in recent years. 
 About the time he bought at Sutton Place South, he sold a condominium on the 75th floor of the south tower of the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle for $12.5 million, $485,000 more than he had paid 15 months earlier. With closing costs, he barely broke even.
 Although New Yorkers have been accustomed to ever-rising resale prices, his $12.5 million listing price on Sutton Place South is $250,000 below the listing price when he bought the apartment a few years ago.

HEADLINE: Blue State Blues

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
I think it is about time for our quadrennial rant about the Electoral College.
 Here we are just a little more than a week away from one of the most important elections in modern history, and most of us are beside the point, our states long since written off as hopelessly red or blue. 
 This is the time of year when parents from New York to Alabama ask the experts: How old should my child be before I tell him that his vote doesn't count? Do I wait until she's in high school to break it to her that if she decides to plant her roots in California or Utah, her role in presidential elections will be less significant than her voice in deciding who should be eliminated in the next episode of ''Dancing With the Stars''? 
 As we all know, in America the president is actually chosen by an Electoral College of 538 members. This was a system devised by the founding fathers, who got the idea from ancient Rome, where democratic government worked exceptionally well. 
 The electors are chosen by the states, winner take all. The only exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, which divvy their electors up more or less according to the popular vote. A much more sensible approach, and good work, guys! But although Maine and Nebraska are lovely, first-rate states, neither has been much of a political trendsetter since the Alf Landon era.
 Let's be realistic. There are lots of calls for reform, but we have a country in economic meltdown. The globe is warming, the Middle East is in chaos and ''Mad Men'' keeps teetering on the brink of cancellation. We're not going to get around to repairing the Electoral College any time in the near future. 
 I have given this a lot of thought, and I think our best immediate course of action is to whine a lot.
 I want attention! I want to get Republican robo-calls during the dinner hour, telling me that Barack Obama is a terrorist. I want to have college students from other states coming to my door with helpful leaflets. I want volunteers offering to drive me to the polls. Or sitting at my feet, admiring the way I fill out my absentee ballot. I want to hear political ads every time I turn on the television. I want the love! 
 People in Virginia and Florida, please do not send me letters telling me that being the target of all this interest can be tiring, and that you yearn for quieter times when the ads on television were all about big cars, room fresheners and helpful messages on the best medication to take if you have a mysterious disease that consists only of initials.
 I don't care. I want my ballot to be important, to have a serious career of its own.
 We recently heard a report that 13 people, most from New York and California, are being investigated for renting a three-bedroom house in Columbus, Ohio, and registering to vote there, just so they could count. I do not advise this sort of behavior, but truly, you can see where they were coming from. 
 The biggest mistake of my life as a voter was leaving Ohio for New York. You can imagine circumstances under which the fate of New York's electoral votes might remain uncertain in late October. But if that happened, the Democratic nominee would still not come to try to woo us, because he and all his associates would be hiding out in a fallout shelter beneath the Berkshire Mountains.
 If I still lived in Ohio, I would go all the way and embark on a career as an undecided voter. Nothing could force me to make up my mind. Every day, cable TV shows would call me up to take my political temperature. If I had a cranky, anti-Obama day, it would make the CNN map turn pinker. Wolf Blitzer would have my phone number on auto-dial. 
 The Obama campaign honchos spent the summer bragging that they were the inclusive campaign because they were targeting 18 states. That of course meant that 32 states had already been relegated to the category of chopped liver. But they rightly pointed out that the McCain campaign was targeting only 11.
 Now, it appears that John McCain has decided that it is once again all about Florida. The Democrats, in response, have created the Great Schlep, in which Jewish youths are supposed to go to Florida and talk their grandparents into voting for Obama. 
 While it's not clear that many of these trips have actually taken place, it is probably a bad sign that we have not heard any talk about McCain urging retired WASPs in Arizona to go to Wisconsin and try to talk their grandchildren into voting Republican.
 But there are still nine days left. And whatever you do, don't forget to vote.

HEADLINE: The Price of Optimism

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
On a recent morning in Manhattan, a friend of mine walked into his bank, carrying his briefcase. He went up to the teller's window and asked to withdraw thousands of dollars of his savings, which the teller handed over in $100 bills. He then walked home, holding his briefcase a little more tightly than usual, and put his money in a drawer.
Was he being a little paranoid? He knew that he was. His savings were guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which, as government officials have been reminding us lately, has never failed to cover a bank deposit in its 70 years of existence. Cash in a drawer comes with no such guarantee. If there's a house fire, the money is gone. But my friend figured that even if his savings were at no real risk of disappearing at the bank, they might become unavailable to him for some period of weeks or months, were the financial crisis to keep worsening. He didn't like that idea. So he was willing to give up a few months of interest -- meager interest, to be sure -- in exchange for a sense of control. Given all of the once-unthinkable events that had already happened, it was hard to know what might come next. 
For the better part of the past two decades, Americans have been living in a state of willful optimism about our financial future. It is probably fair to date the start of this period to the late 1980s, when the stock market took off and the Soviet empire began to unravel. Since then, our default attitude toward the economy has been to believe that, one way or another, things will work out.
Companies began ditching their pension plans, forcing workers into riskier 401(k)s. But, really, how risky could they be? They were invested mainly in the stock market, one of the most profitable investment vehicles in the history of mankind. We became so comfortable with Wall Street, in fact, that we moved money out of boring old F.D.I.C.-insured accounts and into uninsured mutual funds. Many people simply stopped saving altogether. So did the federal government in the last several years, despite the enormous Medicare and Social Security bills that are just around the corner. We told ourselves that everything would be fine, because the alternative seemed so implausible.
The personal saving rate -- that is, income minus spending -- arguably tells the best story about our recent optimism. From the mid-1950s through the mid-1980s, the rate hovered around 9 percent, which meant that, on average, Americans set aside nine cents of every dollar they earned -- to use in the future on college tuition, a down payment, retirement or an unexpected misfortune. In the late 1980s, however, the rate began to fall. In the 1990s, it averaged only 5 percent. In the last several years, it has barely exceeded zero.
There was a simple enough justification for the decline. Since the 1980s, incomes for most families haven't been growing very quickly, which has made it more difficult to save. At the same time, the value of assets, mainly houses and stocks, was growing enormously. So nest eggs continued to get larger even without much new money flowing into them.
For a time earlier this decade, it was intellectually fashionable among economists to point out that the size of the nest egg -- not the money flowing into it (which was the basis for the official saving rate) -- mattered most. By this standard, the country's savings behavior was perfectly healthy. The ratio of household assets to income actually looked high. In 2001, Lehman Brothers -- yes, that Lehman Brothers -- put out a report with the mischievous title of ''Are U.S. Households Saving Too Much?'' One section was called ''Forget Ben Franklin.''
The hitch, of course, was that asset values had to stay high. Many people simply could not conceive of another outcome. Not since the Great Depression, some analysts noted, as if to underscore the absurdity of such a possibility, had house prices fallen nationwide. And even skeptics had a hard time imagining that the situation could get nearly as bad as it has. I was one of those journalists who tried to point out over the past decade that house prices and stock values were getting out of control. Yet when I look back at those articles now, there are still passages that make me cringe. In 2005, while describing the dangerous boom in adjustable-rate mortgages, a colleague and I wrote, ''The impact is not likely to derail the economy on its own, economists predict, but it will probably slow growth.''
The point of that sentence was to make clear that we weren't anything like those crazy people walking around with doomsday sandwich boards. We understood that, despite our concerns, everything would work out just fine. It always had before, hadn't it?
At times over the past several weeks, the country has certainly gone too far in the other direction. Our binge of optimism has been followed by bouts of deep pessimism, which is a dangerous combination. It's the stuff of bank runs, stock-market crashes and once-in-a-century economic downturns. Finding the right middle ground -- in which we neither hoard our way into a deep recession nor spend our way into bankruptcy -- will not be easy. But it's also not impossible. Economic mores can change.
Well into the 1940s, Americans wondered whether the hard times had really ended. They spent the next few decades behaving as if the country's prosperity depended on their actions. They saved money, which provided the capital for the great postwar boom and also paid for their retirement. Then came the change, and many of us began to assume that prosperity was an inalienable part of life, regardless of what we did. We failed to be sufficiently afraid of the alternative. A little fear can often be a healthy thing.

HEADLINE: Help for Homeowners, at Last?

 BODY:
For all the government's actions to prop up the markets, credit tightened again last week and stocks sold off worldwide. Rather than confidence, fear of global recession has taken hold -- and for good reason.
 Bush administration officials have failed to deal effectively with the root cause of the financial crisis -- unaffordable mortgages peddled during the housing bubble and the mass foreclosures that have followed. The only ray of hope is that worsening conditions may finally force them to act. At a hearing on Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee, Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, confirmed that the F.D.I.C. is working with the Treasury to streamline the reworking of troubled mortgages. The aim is to make the loans affordable over the long term so that borrowers can avoid foreclosure and keep their homes.
 Though details of the plan are not yet worked out, the outline calls for creating standardized criteria that would be used by mortgage servicers, the firms that handle collection and foreclosure proceedings for lenders and mortgage investors. Loans modified under the criteria would be eligible for a federal guarantee that would protect lenders and investors against default. 
 If the criteria are well established, defaults on the modified loans should not be a big problem. When the F.D.I.C. took over IndyMac Bank in California last summer, Ms. Bair established a streamlined program for 60,000 troubled loans from the failed bank. The program, which is yielding encouraging initial results, calls for modifications that lower a loan's interest rate, extend the life of the loan or defer payment on a portion of the principle. Taken together, the modifications lower the monthly payment to no more than 38 percent of the borrower's pretax income.
 An IndyMac-like plan, on the federal level, would be significantly better than anything else tried so far. To date, servicers have been reluctant to amend loans, saying they could be sued by loan investors who might be disadvantaged by the modification. A government guarantee on the modified loan should reduce the risk of lawsuits. The new plan could also be up and running quickly, because the authority to offer the government guarantee was included in the bank bailout legislation passed this month.
 An IndyMac approach, with its emphasis on permanent changes to a loan's terms, is also superior to ad hoc anti-foreclosure efforts of the past year that have focused on offering catch-up repayment plans. The administration has often cheered the proliferation of repayment plans as evidence of the mortgage industry's willingness to work with troubled borrowers. But such plans often only delay foreclosure, because they do nothing to make the loan affordable over time. 
 No single approach will solve the foreclosure problem. But Ms. Bair and the F.D.I.C. -- an independent agency -- deserve enormous credit for bringing a workable plan this far along in an administration resistant to such efforts to address the problems of homeowners. 
 Congress should give the plan its full backing, and pursue other anti-foreclosure efforts. In a hopeful development at the hearing on Thursday, the Banking Committee chairman, Senator Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, said he was considering a new round of anti-foreclosure legislation in November. That would include allowing bankruptcy judges to modify troubled loans under court protection -- a much needed and long overdue change in policy. 
 In the meantime, the Treasury would do well by the American public by going where Ms. Bair and the F.D.I.C. are leading.

HEADLINE: Democrats Carrying Anti-Abortion Banner Put More Congressional Races in Play

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The political advertisement that aired in Montgomery, Ala., spoke plainly to conservative voters' values. As an image of three toddlers in diapers flashed across the screen, a narrator intoned that Mayor Bobby Bright, who is running for Congress, ''supports their right to life.''
 The anti-abortion pitch is standard fare in Alabama's Second Congressional District, a deeply conservative area that President Bush carried twice and that has been represented in Washington by a Republican for four decades. 
 What makes the spot unusual is that Mr. Bright is a Democrat. And that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has been pushing hard for Mr. Bright's election, paid for it.
 In fact, Mr. Bright is one of a dozen anti-abortion Democratic challengers the party has recruited to run for the House this year and has aggressively supported with millions of dollars and other resources in culturally conservative districts long unfriendly to the party.
 That is the highest number of anti-abortion candidates the party has fielded in recent memory to run either for open seats or against Republican challengers, according to party strategists and a leading anti-abortion organization. It is a strategy that that has received little attention in an election year dominated nationally by a grim economic picture and an unpopular president.
 But Democratic Party strategists contend that in Congressional races, in which local sensibilities and attitudes often play as a big a role as national trends, candidates like Mr. Bright could potentially deprive Republicans of the one realm where they have enjoyed a significant advantage: social issues.
 The Democratic effort to seek out candidates like Mr. Bright has not been without tensions, given the party's reliance on abortion rights groups for fund-raising and get-out-the-vote efforts. And there is the fundamental reality that the Democratic Party's platform explicitly embraces abortion rights.
 Kelli Conlin, the president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, called the recruitment strategy misguided, saying that surveys conducted by her organization showed that even some Republicans express support for abortion rights when her group described the consequences of outlawing the procedure.
 ''The movement to recruit anti-choice candidates ignores the larger reality that this is a pro-choice nation,'' she said. ''It misses the larger point.'' (Polls show a divided nation on the issue: A 2008 CNN-Opinion Research poll found that 53 percent of Americans characterized themselves as ''pro-choice,'' versus 44 as ''pro-life;'' a 2007 poll by the same organization showed the numbers reversed, 45-50.)
 Democrats began the effort to embrace anti-abortion activists after the party suffered major electoral defeats in 2004 at the hands of Republicans, who portrayed the Democratic Party as being out of step with Americans on issues like abortion, gun rights and religious values.
 By 2006, the party had moved aggressively, recruiting Bob Casey, a candidate opposed to abortion, to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania that he ultimately captured, and putting together a slate of eight House challengers who also opposed abortion. Six of those candidates won. But this year, the party has not only gone to great lengths to recruit such candidates, it has also provided them significant financial backing, underscoring a new pragmatism within the party, said Kristen Day, the executive director of Democrats for Life, an anti-abortion group.
 ''This is the year that pro-life Democrats have received the most support from the party in Washington,'' said Mrs. Day, whose group has argued for years that the party was limiting its reach by failing to cultivate candidates opposed to abortion. 
 Representative Christopher Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the strategy may neutralize the advantage Republicans have enjoyed on social issues like abortion while allowing Democrats to emphasize areas of Democratic strength, primarily jobs and health care.
 ''You help take the wedge issues off the table in these districts and allow the Democrats to focus on kitchen-table economic issues that unite Democrats and have the support of independents and even some Republicans,'' he said.
 Independent analysts say the strategy has given Democrats a strong opportunity for victories in Congressional districts that once seemed out of reach.
 All 12 of the Democratic Party's anti-abortion candidates recruited this year are running in districts that President Bush won in 2004 with significant margins, and about half of them are in races that analysts consider competitive. Two of the candidates were recruited for special elections they won earlier in the year. 
 In the Third Congressional District of Pennsylvania, for example, the Republican incumbent, Phil English, is facing what analysts describe as a strong challenge from Kathleen Dahlkemper, a Democrat who has benefited from more than $1 million in spending by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
 Mrs. Dahlkemper has spoken openly on the campaign trail about her opposition to abortion and even shared a deeply personal story to drive home her message: how she decided to have a child 29 years ago when she was a single woman and a college student. ''It was tough,'' she recalled recently. ''I was on food stamps.''
 But her position has become an issue among some Democrats who view abortion rights as a bedrock Democratic principle. In the primary, for example, her opponents repeatedly criticized her opposition to abortion. ''They were trying to say that I wasn't a real Democrat because I am pro-life,'' Mrs. Dahlkemper recalled. ''I believe they have a narrow view of what a Democrat is.''
 Some of the other Republican-held districts where Democrats are trying to go on the offense are in Ohio, Mississippi, Alabama, Nebraska and Louisiana.
 For example, in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, outside Omaha, Jim Esch, the Democratic candidate, is mounting what analysts say is a strong challenge against the Republican incumbent, Lee Terry.
 Mr. Esch has made his opposition to abortion a major theme of his campaign, distributing hand-held fans with the words ''pro-life'' printed on them.
 He, too, has had strong support from party leaders in Washington, who have spent more than $300,000 on television and radio advertisements on his behalf. By contrast, the National Republican Congressional Committee has spent about $150,000 on the race.

HEADLINE: At Rutgers, Yankee Stadium 101

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI. 
E-mail: cheers@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Typical first-year courses at Rutgers University include biology, calculus, English literature, history and economics. But 20 freshmen -- 19 of them Yankees fans -- are enrolled in a research seminar called Yankee Stadium. 
 Mike Glitch of Millstone, N.J., who is leaning toward a major in journalism, or perhaps music education, is on the roster for the 10-week fall course, which examines themes and issues related to the House That Ruth Built.
 ''Studying the Stadium is more than knowing Paul O'Neill's batting average in 1998,'' Glitch, 18, said. ''The stadium has diverse effects on different walks of life, and it's interesting to study how one building could spawn all that it has.'' 
 Topics of research include the hero in American culture, the pluses and minuses of urban development, and the relationship between public finance and private enterprise.
 Theresa M. Collins, a history professor at Rutgers for 17 years, teaches the one-credit course at the Livingston campus in Piscataway, N.J. With 220 applicants, she said, Yankee Stadium was the most requested first-year research seminar this fall.
 ''The purpose of this course is to open up the minds of these students to the joys of research, especially in places you wouldn't normally think of it -- like Yankee Stadium,'' she said. ''We often discuss the potential for certain research projects related to the Stadium, which allows the students an opportunity to maximize their sense of learning in this field.''
 On Sept. 6, her research team toured the Stadium, which was built in 1923.
 ''It was a pretty amazing day,'' said Nadia Kardan, an English major and Yankees fan from Marlboro, N.J. ''We sat in the dugout, went into the reporters' box and talked a lot about baseball.''
 The tour included stops in the Yankees' clubhouse and Monument Park, and what Collins called ''all this real behind-the-scenes stuff, like these little tunnels inside the stadium that you would never know were there.''
 She added, ''The students got a real kick out of seeing that water cooler in the dugout that Paul O'Neill used to beat up every time he got angry.'' 
 Of the 16 men and 4 women in the class, Evan Heffron stands out because he roots for the Philadelphia Phillies.
 ''I get teased by the Yankee fans all the time, but it's a lot of fun,'' said Heffron, 18, who wore his Phillies cap to class on Tuesday and said he planned to wear it for the last two classes, on Tuesday and Nov. 4. 
 ''By the time this class ends, we'll be World Series champions,'' he said. ''And I'll have had the last laugh on my classmates, and I'll really be rubbing it in to all of those Mets fans in my dorm.''
 Heffron, a political science major from Atlantic City, recently submitted a research proposal called ''The Great Yankees Opera.'' 
 ''Professor Collins always tries to get us to think outside the box, to come up with the next big thing,'' he said. ''I have a minor in music, and I have some rough ideas about creating an opera, maybe a rock opera, about the history of the Yankees. I think that would be a great and unique way to tell the story.''
 Other related proposals include topics like ''Understanding StubHub and eBay in the Shifting Ticket Resale Market'' and ''Security Matters: Comparing Protection in Different Eras.''
 ''On the topic of security matters, Chris Chambliss of the Yankees comes to mind,'' said Collins, referring to Chambliss's pennant-clinching home run against the Kansas City Royals in 1976. That ended the Yankees' 12-year American League championship drought, and fans spilled onto the field in celebration. 
 ''Since that night, running onto the field after a game has become taboo,'' said Collins, who is also a Yankees fan. ''Something like that will likely never happen again, but why it has not happened since is well worth researching.'' 
 Although the demolition of Yankee Stadium is scheduled to begin in March, Collins said she would teach the course again in September.
 ''There will be a new Stadium, and that will come with a lot of new expectations and questions,'' she said. ''Will the ghosts from the old Stadium pack their bags and move across the street? How will the change affect the environment? In addition to the old questions, there will be plenty of new ones to explore.''

HEADLINE: Familiar and Foreign, It's Main Street, New York City

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
Main Street America and New York City have always been the thrown-together in-laws at the nation's family picnics, waving across the lawn, their broad smiles slanted toward the side of the mouth whispering wisecracks. 
 The idea of Main Street as a state of mind has been invoked repeatedly these last tumultuous weeks, presented as the opposite of that distinctly New York of places, Wall Street. It would seem a place foreign to those used to high-rise apartment buildings and subway commutes, but not so. 
 This being New York, if something is good, then five of it must be better, and so it is possible, in the same city, to run across Main Street while dodging six lanes of traffic, or creep along a Main Street so narrow that two cars cannot pass without one pulling over. Children may be seen running down the street where their parents were raised, or gazing out from strollers pushed by new arrivals to the country. Main Street may be decorated for Halloween or congested with a Falun Gong demonstration decrying Communist China. A no-nonsense neighborhood pub on one corner, a tarot card reader on the next. 
 There are Main Streets in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, on Staten Island and even (technically) in Manhattan. Their farthest points are 80 minutes apart, a 40-mile automobile trek in light traffic -- a world away. 
 To visit all five in recent days was to be introduced to a sort of collective Main Street, New York, and some of the men and women who live and work there. Some, when they hear the expression, ''on Main Street,'' think about the place outside their window. Others see themselves far from that Main Street, a concept -- like the food pyramid, or heaven -- that they've never seen up close, but are glad it's there. 
 In Flushing, Queens, there are more people walking near the top of Main Street as there are in many American towns. This is by far the busiest Main Street in New York, with six lanes of traffic snarling through a bustling Asian neighborhood. The airplanes arriving at La Guardia Airport pass so close overhead you'd swear you can see the treads on the landing gear. 
 A 22-year-old bookkeeper who gave only his first name, Keith, has been visiting this neighborhood for years, but he doesn't think this qualifies as a typical Main Street. 
 ''I think of a main boulevard, a lot of chain stores, a lot of banks,'' he said. ''There are a lot of corporations moving into Main Street, U.S.A.'' He was waiting recently for the Q65 bus with 10 others -- considered a short line for a bus in this area. 
 His friends work at the Sago Tea Cafe up the block. ''The rent went up to $15,000 from $10,000,'' he said. ''It's shocking, you know?''
 Farther down Main, the businesses change from Asian to Jewish. Sheli Man-Steinberg, 28, is a manager at a kosher coffee shop, the Aroma Net Cafe, at 73rd Avenue, where the economic crisis shows itself one cup of coffee at a time. ''Some people who had a latte every day have maybe two a week now,'' she said. ''They're asking prices, whereas before, they would just order it.'' 
 A customer, Brian Kramer, 27, conjured a faraway Main Street when he heard the phrase. ''Some Montana Main Street,'' he said. The problem, as he saw it, was the implied opposition to Wall Street. ''It's not this Main Street,'' he said. ''That would be stupid. There's a brokerage house down the block.'' 
 The Main Street in Dumbo, Brooklyn, is quite the opposite of Flushing's, just a spit of cobblestones two blocks in length. Strips of old railroad track appear here and there, like bulging veins, before disappearing under the stones and asphalt again. 
 The preferred mode of transportation is the stroller, coming in all sizes. The restaurant Bubby's on the corner of Plymouth Street has a little parking area inside for strollers. Two mothers emerging from a new building of condominiums pushing strollers separately said they were too busy to speak to a reporter. 
 John Chichester, 41, smoking a cigarette, surveyed little Main Street. ''Go figure,'' he said. ''Two blocks long, nothing on it. This used to be bustling, back in the 1800s.'' 
 He has worked on Main for five years, but thinks of home when he hears the street name in speeches. ''I used to live in Andover, Ohio,'' he said. ''They had a town square.'' The streets that formed its four sides were all called Main. ''That's where everything happened, kind of like Mayberry,'' he said. 
 As in other development-heavy neighborhoods, there are no signs of pressing need for a government bailout in Dumbo. ''It was crack city down here,'' Mr. Chichester said. ''Now it's million-dollar condos.'' 
 Byron Jeffries has worked at a compact disc duplicating business on Main Street for three years, and like Mr. Chichester, sees little similarity between the road he stood on and the one cited in speeches. 
 ''It's a different country,'' he said. ''It's not Main Street, U.S.A. It's Dumbo.'' A couple carrying cameras and maps walked past, toward the water. ''Lot of tourists,'' he said. ''Lot of tourists. Everybody wants to get a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge.'' 
 A city bus passed. Unlike the buses in Flushing, this one was practically empty. There were people lined up down the block, but they turned out to be extras in something being filmed there, waiting for lunch. 
 Main Street on Roosevelt Island is just that, the main street running like a spine along the narrow island, and the closest thing to a Main Street in Manhattan, of which it is technically a part. 
 At either end of the street is a large hospital. Main Street, compared with streets in other boroughs, is crowded with the convalescing. Men and women in motorized and standard wheelchairs pass and pause to talk or sit in the sun or have a drink at the Trellis Diner beside the Church of the Good Shepherd.
 For some Roosevelt Island residents, Main Street is their first home in the United States. The families of people who work at the United Nations have historically rented apartments there. 
 Felicite Fulani, 27, from Rwanda, has lived here for four years. She stood on Main and pointed to the side of the street closer to Queens. ''This side,'' she said, ''is less expensive than this side,'' indicating the west side. 
 She said when she arrived on the island, she met other African immigrants. ''For people who are outside, it is good,'' she said. ''When I came here, I feel like I am at home.'' 
 This Main Street may be New York's closest to the idea of a traditional Main Street, as practically all business on the island takes place on it, most of it, like the hospitals, recession-proof. There are, among others, a Gristede's, a Duane Reade, a Starbucks, a deli, a liquor store, a library and a police office. There has been no immediately visible effect of the economic downturn. 
 ''The deli, they're nice people, they're like my family,'' said Jovente Samondo, 17, who grew up here. ''I bet Main Street, Kansas, is 10 times bigger,'' he said. 
 Some like it that way. 
 ''This place is very different from another place,'' said Osvaldo Ojeda, 38, a Chilean journalist living here while his wife works at the United Nations. ''The people want a calm place for their children.'' 
 Tottenville's Main Street is just short of the very southern end of Staten Island, six blocks in length. 
 ''It really is the main street in Tottenville,'' said Michael Cosgriff, 42, a retired city employee who spent years variously as a correction officer, a police officerand a firefighter, a stepladder of superlatives, from New York's Boldest to Finest to Bravest. ''The post office is on it, the bank. The train station is at the end.'' 
 Standing there, Mr. Cosgriff recalled Bob Seger, who penned the song ''Mainstreet.'' Although truth be told, amid the handsome homes and trim lawns and the doggy day care, there are few signs of the pool halls, the hustlers and the losers from the song.
 ''When I was a kid, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band played the Fourth of July right at Main Street and Amboy Road,'' he said. ''I rode my bicycle down to check it out.'' 
 To Mr. Cosgriff, Main Street is Main Street, and mention of the expression calls to mind the block he was standing on. ''Every time I hear it, I think it's where I live, right on Main Street,'' he said. 
 A fire engine passed, and the firefighters from his old firehouse leaned out the window and waved. The street is thick with first responders. Jerry Maniscalco, 52, an evidence control specialist with the Police Department, paused on his way home from the store. For four years, he has tried to get the Department of Transportation to make Main a one-way street. ''Traffic is horrendous lately,'' he said. ''People trying to pass. My son's car got hit the first week he got it.''
 Newer, bigger houses have been built at the bottom of the street, on the Atlantic Ocean side. ''It's turning into a money neighborhood,'' Mr. Maniscalco said. ''Years ago, you heard Tottenville, and you thought, old-timers.''
 The idea that Main Street was crying out for an economic bailout was clearly unpopular here. A sign in one shop window urged passers-by to visit the Web site www.votenobailout.org, and added, ''It's your money.'' 
 The most obscure of the five Main Streets is in Edgewater Park in the Bronx. The street changes names three times inside of a mile in this small fist of land near the Throgs Neck Bridge. A former camping site turned co-op neighborhood, it is extremely close-knit. People look up and stare at an unfamiliar vehicle. The roads do not appear to have been widened since the camping days. 
 One has to search to make sure he is on Main Street, finally finding a small handwritten sign stuck to a fence. ''We just got on Google two years ago,'' said Keith Freder, 37, the president of the co-op board. The development consists of about 675 homes over 60 acres, he said. Main Street begins at the volunteer firehouse and dead-ends at the waterfront of the Long Island Sound. 
 The street is mostly blue-collar. The houses are weathered, and old cars sitting in various degrees of disuse make some of the small lots seem even smaller. ''It's tough to pay the bills,'' Mr. Freder said. ''Con Ed's going up. Bills are going up. You can look at some of the houses and tell they can't afford to keep it up.'' 
 Around the corner, on First Avenue, Dennis Reilly, 35, a firefighter in the Bronx, was preparing to drain his Jacuzzi so he could build a frame around it with wood that he had bought. ''The frame was $750,'' he said. ''I can build it for $100. That's Main Street for you.''
 He said he rarely thought of the Main Street in his neighborhood as such, because he forgot it carried that name. Most people refer to the section they live in, not the street, using the letters A through E, he said. He described a typical exchange: '''Where do you live?' 'Oh, I live over in the C Section.' 'Oh, good.' If I told somebody I lived on First and Main, they'd say, 'What?' '' 
 Regardless, he doesn't care for politicians' use of Main Street, including the two running for president. ''Neither one of them know where it is,'' he said. ''The people who live on Main Street know where it is.'' 
 As for politicians, he said, ''They say it, 'Main Street, oh, my adviser told me to say it.' They don't ever go there.''

HEADLINE: Spending Stalls, And Businesses Slash U.S. Jobs

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE; Micheline Maynard and Ben White contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As the financial crisis crimps demand for American goods and services, the workers who produce them are losing their jobs by the tens of thousands. 
 Layoffs have arrived in force, like a wrenching second act in the unfolding crisis. In just the last two weeks, the list of companies announcing their intention to cut workers has read like a Who's Who of corporate America: Merck, Yahoo, General Electric, Xerox, Pratt & Whitney, Goldman Sachs, Whirlpool, Bank of America, Alcoa, Coca-Cola, the Detroit automakers and nearly all the airlines. 
 When October's job losses are announced on Nov. 7, three days after the presidential election, many economists expect the number to exceed 200,000. The current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is likely to rise, perhaps significantly. 
 ''My view is that it will be near 8 or 8.5 percent by the end of next year,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight, offering a forecast others share. That would be the highest unemployment rate since the deep recession of the early 1980s. 
 Companies are laying off workers to cut production as consumers, struggling with their own finances, scale back spending. Employers had tried for months to cut expenses through hiring freezes and by cutting back hours. That has turned out not to be enough, and with earnings down sharply in the third quarter, corporate America has turned to layoffs.
 ''People have grown very nervous,'' said Harry Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute, tracing cause and effect. ''They have seen a lot of their wealth wiped out and as they cut back their spending, companies are responding with layoffs, which hurts consumption even more.''
 The unemployment is widespread, with Rhode Island the hardest hit. 
 For Dwight and Rochelle Stokes of Phenix City, Ala., the layoffs are a family event. He lost his job two weeks ago as an aviation mechanic at the Pratt & Whitney jet engine facility near his home -- a few days after his wife lost hers as a cosmetologist at Great Clips, a family-owned barbershop and beauty salon. 
 ''It got really slow in July and August,'' Ms. Stokes said. ''I would sit there for two hours, and some days we had only 10 clients, four of us for 10 clients.''
 The broadening layoffs are most pronounced on Wall Street, in the auto industry, in construction, in the airlines and in retailing. The steel mills, big suppliers to many sectors of the economy, are shutting 17 of the nation's 29 blast furnaces -- a startling indicator of how quickly output is declining as corporate America struggles to adjust to the spreading crisis.
 ''We have seen a softening order book in the most dramatic ways in the last week,'' said Tom Conway, a vice president of the United Steelworkers of America, adding that layoffs in the industry ''are just starting now.''
 In September alone, 2,269 employers each laid off 50 people or more, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, up sharply from the spring and summer months, and the highest number since September 2001, when the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks coincided with a recession to spook employers. A spike in 2005 was related to Hurricane Katrina.
 The financial services industry has been cutting jobs since last summer, when the credit crisis took hold. By some estimates, 300,000 jobs will disappear from banks, mutual fund groups, hedge funds and other financial services companies before the crisis subsides -- 35,000 of them in New York.
 Goldman Sachs alone, among the best performers on Wall Street, has announced plans to cut 10 percent of its work force, which stood at 32,594 at the end of last month.
 The current unemployment rate, 6.1 percent -- up more than a percentage point since April -- is still relatively mild by post-World War II standards. The highest level since the Great Depression, 10.8 percent, came in November and December of 1982 as the economy was shaking off a severe recession.
 The unemployment rate hit 9 percent during the mid-1970s recession, and 7.8 percent in the 1990-1991 downturn. The next peak, 6.3 percent, occurred in June 2003, during a long jobless recovery in the aftermath of the 2001 recession. 
 Dwight and Rochelle Stokes, both in their late 20s, have just joined the layoff rolls. So has Mr. Stokes's father, Warren, 48, who lost a $30-an-hour job this month on the assembly line of the Chrysler truck plant in Fenton, Mo., near St. Louis., where the father had worked for 12 years. ''They just cut back,'' the son said.
 Just a year ago, he and Rochelle, and their two very young children, moved to Phenix City from Fenton so he could take the mechanic job at the Pratt & Whitney plant in nearby Columbus, Ga. Airlines send engines there for periodic overhauls, and when Mr. Stokes arrived 400 workers were tearing down and rebuilding 15 engines a month. 
 But as the airlines reduced their flights -- and announced 36,000 job cuts, nearly all of them taking place in the current fourth quarter -- that number fell to three engines this month and ''it was going to be worse for November, just one or two,'' Mr. Stokes said.
 ''We came in on Monday morning and our supervisor told us not to touch an engine, and we knew there would be layoffs,'' he said. By lunchtime, Mr. Stokes and 100 others had been escorted out of the building, with four weeks' pay as severance, along with four weeks of health insurance and a $1,000 departure check.
 As a starting mechanic, Mr. Stokes's pay, $11.50 an hour, was just over half of what he had earned as the manager of a chain of pawn shops in Missouri. But he took the job anyway, moving with his family, because Pratt & Whitney offered full college tuition. Mr. Stokes immediately enrolled in Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University to pursue a bachelor's degree in management and a minor in engineering sciences. 
 Using all his spare time, he had earned half the necessary credits when the layoff came. The severance included extended tuition, and Mr. Stokes, piling on course work, hopes to earn his degree by early summer. But he will do so by correspondence course; the family is returning to Missouri, moving in rent free with Mr. Stokes's sister in Fenton.
 ''I am going to take seven or eight courses and hurry up and get my degree, and my wife will go back to cutting hair,'' Mr. Stokes said, ''and when I have my degree in June, I'll apply for a management position. Even though things are bad, I hear there are openings in St. Louis requiring a bachelor's degree.''

HEADLINE: Wooing Undecideds With a Big-Tent Strategy

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
FOR years now, Lincoln has largely disavowed the cars that made its name: big, plush sedans whose gleaming chrome looked best against a formal black background. 
 The fading Town Car soldiers on in livery and limousine fleets. Other recent Lincolns, like the midsize MKZ sedan and the MKX crossover, have been like costumes, vaguely thought-out disguises for down-market Fords.
 They look interesting, but you're not sure what they want to be. Let's see, is that a Taurus in a tux? An American car with its Volvo underwear showing? Is that a $5,000 rebate coupon? Oh, I get it -- it's a Lincoln!
 By those standards, the MKS is a welcome improvement. It's the kind of car Lincoln should be doing, a king-size, no-apologies American luxury sedan. The same approach served Chrysler well with its 300, a big hit just four years ago. 
 At a fraction over 17 feet long, the MKS is one of the larger four-doors on the road, as lengthy and roomy as a Mercedes S-Class or BMW 7 Series. But starting under $40,000 in front-drive form, the MKS is priced closer to midsize luxury sedans. 
 Yet the Lincoln eschews the aggressive performance approach of rear-drive sedans like the Cadillac CTS, the Infiniti M line and the BMW 5 Series. Like the other Ford Motor Company vehicles based on this front- or all-wheel-drive platform -- including the Ford Taurus and Flex and the Volvo S80 -- the MKS excuses itself from backroad competition, preferring to focus on space, smoothness and amenities. 
 As such, the MKS offers a well-defined alternative to Euro-style sport sedans. But as ever, Lincoln's challenge won't be to win over people who prefer the classic American approach to luxury. The issue will be for buyers who cross-shop in the ruthless luxury-car class. Those potential customers may be impressed by the Lincoln's style and easy-fit comfort, yet still find all that and more from its competitors. 
 Stately proportions and a bold wall-to-wall grille give the MKS some visual heft. When I rolled up to curbs in a brilliant black, all-wheel-drive model, careful not to scour the huge 20-inch chrome wheels, pedestrians often stopped to admire the car. When's the last time you could say that about a Lincoln? 
 The positive impressions continue inside. The cabin's design and controls make a clean, uncluttered presentation, accented by well-shaped strips of wood. The cabin also highlights Lincoln's user-friendly technology. The touch-screen navigation system, with its large central display, offers solid mapping data and is refreshingly easy to use. The Bluetooth-based Sync system, developed jointly by Ford and Microsoft, ably manages phones and music players with voice commands. 
 The initial set-up for cellphone integration is too cumbersome, but once running, Sync easily uploaded my phone book, placed and received hands-free calls and made me feel less guilty about chatting while driving. Sync proved to be a wizard at recognizing hard-to-pronounce names, as when I asked my computerized Gal Friday to place a call to my friend John Gmutza in Detroit. 
 The solid surround-sound audio system included Sirius satellite radio and its latest gizmo, Sirius Travel Link, which adds $6.99 to Sirius's $12.95 monthly subscription fee.
 Besides features like real-time traffic, weather and sports scores, the service lists movies and show times at nearby theaters -- and more important, current gas prices at more than 120,000 gas stations around the country. The system can instantly sort nearby stations from the cheapest to the most expensive. During my testing on various Ford models, I was surprised at the wide range in prices -- as much as 40 cents a gallon -- at stations a few miles apart. 
 While the Lincoln is comfortable and accommodating, it doesn't take long to realize you're not in an Audi or Lexus. Window switches have a plasticky sheen; sliding storage covers on the center console wobble in their tracks. And while it's a little thing, the front cup holders are so close together they can't handle two large drinks. 
 The back seat is appropriately huge, with 41 inches of kneeroom. It's wide, too -- broad enough for three adults to sit back there in reasonable comfort. 
 Too bad the trunk isn't as well-packaged. The car's stylishly truncated rear deck comes with a small trunk opening, leaving a distressingly tiny entryway for larger suitcases or boxes. The trunk also has a raised ridge around its floor, again cutting down on practical space. Lincoln claims a huge 18 cubic feet of room, but it's hard to imagine cramming 18 cubic feet of anything -- aside from styrofoam pellets -- into the space. 
 The bad vibes get literal when you crank up the 3.7-liter engine, an upgraded version of Ford's Duratec V-6. I'd call the engine a workhorse, but it's more of a nag -- it gets the day's plowing done, but seems out of its league in a car that costs $39,000 to $49,000. The engine offers a reasonable 275 horsepower but works hard to motivate 4,300 pounds of all-wheel-drive sedan. It also sounds thrashy at high engine speeds.
 The fuel economy rating is relatively poor at 16 miles a gallon in town (23 on the highway). That is on par with many competitors' much stronger V-8 sedans. 
 The six-speed transmission is acceptably smooth in automatic mode. Yet again, Lincoln's competitors routinely dazzle you with gearboxes that are as seamless as they are sporty. The MKS shift lever -- an important tactile connection in a luxury sedan -- ratchets and wobbles through its positions like something from a $15,000 economy car. 
 But the manual-shift function isn't worth the effort: The first time I tried to shift and the lever didn't budge, I thought I had left it in the automatic position. In fact, the resistance was so stiff in the upshift direction, and so soft in downshift direction, that it felt like operating two different gearboxes.
 In its favor, the Lincoln is a smoothie on the road. It's not remotely sporty, but the ride is comfortable, quiet and well-controlled, like the Lexus ES 350's. 
 Come spring, the MKS is set to get the first of Ford's new Eco Boost engines, a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6. This engine -- which will be an optional upgrade from the current 3.7-liter -- will develop more than 340 horsepower and 340 pound-feet of torque, as much as many larger and less efficient V-8s. As the name implies, Eco Boost engines are designed to sip less fuel.
 On paper, the engine has the potential to transform this car, and might have transformed my impressions as well. But that's no consolation to someone who wants an MKS now. If a friend said she planned to buy an MKS, I would feel obligated to urge her to wait until the new engine arrives. 
 As it stands, it's fair to wonder whether the MKS will be hamstrung in its crucial early months, when new cars get their first and often only shot at capturing the market's attention. This is not the first time Ford has handicapped a promising new model by not having an equally promising new engine ready from the start. That approach dimmed the initial appeal of the Ford Five Hundred and Lincoln Zephyr.
 My MKS test car, loaded to its pretty black gills with a navigation system, a back-up camera and other options, reached $46,255. I'll try to put it nicely: that seems a little high. 
 Flaws aside, the MKS represents a step forward for a struggling luxury brand. The question for Lincoln -- and its equally battered parent company -- is whether a step is enough to stay ahead of an avalanche of troubles. 
 INSIDE TRACK: A lot of pennies for a Lincoln.

HEADLINE: Can I Get an Arrgh?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

DATELINE: Tybee Island, Ga. 

 BODY:
 THE pretend pirates came at dusk. October storms had buffeted the Georgia Lowcountry, and on the second Friday of the month, a rainbow ascended the Savannah skies.
 For all their claims of high-seas escapades, these pirates arrived mostly by land.
 In trucks and on motorcycles they came: old and young, black and white, entire families with their children done up in period garb, all following Highway 80 until the willows gave way to palm fronds before the beachfront appeared.
 ''Arrgh,'' one of them cried.
 ''Arrgh,'' sounded the reply, turning infectious like a crowd doing the wave on a boring ballpark afternoon, a guttural chorus of gentle self-mockery rising above the crash of the Atlantic. 
 ''Arrgh.''
 Long a sideshow at Renaissance fairs, craft festivals and historical conventions, pirate enthusiasts have become the darlings of seaside towns competing for tourism dollars.
 Like Civil War re-enactors, many of these latter-day pirates pursue historical authenticity -- down to their home-sewn underwear, pistol ribands and molded tricorn hats. Some have even hired blacksmiths to reproduce halberd axes from photographs. They can discuss their exploits without breaking character. 
 No Quarter Given, a journal of all things pirate, has counted nearly 130 re-enactment groups nationwide, compared with 9 in 1993, according to its publisher, Christine Lampe. 
 But there is trouble in the world of the pretend pirates. Just as deadly divisions developed amid pirate cliques deep in filthy, swaying wooden hulls centuries ago, so too are sides taking shape today, though perhaps less violently. 
 The ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' movies by Disney starring Johnny Depp not only fostered affection for long-dead seaborne robbers -- a favor that does not seem to extend to latter-day counterparts such as the Somali hijackers who recently captured a weapons freighter -- but they also gave birth to a new wave of pirate re-enactors. (The movies have collectively grossed more than $1 billion at the box office since 2003.)
 Longtime pirate enthusiasts, the 17th-century historical re-enactors who take their hobby seriously, find themselves sharing festival grounds with legions of would-be Captain Jack Sparrows dressed, more or less, in accordance with the big-screen version.
 Are they pretend pretend pirates? Traditionalists tend to view this new family-friendly theme thing with a sort of dismissive acceptance.
 At the Ojai Pirate Faire in California last month, a crew of pirate history zealots disarmed an unwitting Jack Sparrow, put him in a stockade and demanded a ransom of two harlots (a blonde and a redhead), Ms. Lampe said.
 ''I know there's some people who are tired of seeing so many Jack Sparrows out there,'' said Ms. Lampe, a retired schoolteacher who prefers to be called Jamaica Rose. (She says Lampe is her ''civilian name.'')
 Hollywood provided the spark, but some new converts spoke of a deeper restlessness. As Halloween approaches with distant wars unending, the country growing isolated and credit hard to come by, some described feeling as if they were born at the wrong time.
 ''It's the idea of being something you're not, something you can't be,'' said D'Andrea Seabrook, 19, an art student who attended a pirate festival on Tybee Island. ''It's this idea of being able to go out and do whatever you want and be whatever you want and throw all these morals away and not care about the law, when in reality you can't.''
 The costume industry has found no trouble tolerating the newcomers. A survey commissioned by the National Retail Federation predicted that more than 1.7 million American adults would dress as pirates for Halloween this year, beating out zombies, cowboys, devils and French maids combined. Among children, being a pirate ranked fifth. Not bad, considering that more than 1.5 million little Hannah Montanas plan to troll for sugar across this weary land.
 To meet the demand, some costumers have torn up their business plans. In Tustin, Calif., the Silhouettes Clothing Company abandoned its trade in 19th-century undergarments, according to promotional materials, to focus on developing ''a well-deserved international reputation for clothing the top Jack Sparrow impersonators.''
 Among the sewing-machine-owning, library-card-carrying pirate history buffs, a few timbers have been shivered. But wariness of the new mainstream appeal has been tempered with some critical self-appraisal.
 ''Why do some of them feel like they can wear blank spandex pants and a puffy shirt and be allowed to call themselves pirates?'' said John Macek, a member of the Pirate Brethren, a re-enactment group formed in the 1990s in Columbia, Md.
 In an e-mail message meditating on the state of his hobby, Mr. Macek added: ''Why do others bother to study pirates in minute detail to get it 'right,' because after all, these guys were just a bunch of criminals, murderers, etc? Why the animosity between these two groups? What would your grandfather have said about your hobby? Many of these re-enactors claim to be 'educating the public,' but just what gives them the notion they are knowledgeable enough?''
 For tourism promoters on this wind-swept barrier island, where pirates once found haven among the Savannah River waterways, education has ranked in priority somewhere behind filling barstools. Four years ago, after finding little success with promotions, including a Labor Day Luau, Tybee Island officials announced the pirate festival on a whim.
 ''It's done this time of year because business is slow,'' said Paul DeVivo, a member of the tourism council, estimating that the festival had injected $2.6 million a year into the local economy. ''We just lucked into it and we're running with it.''
 As the festival date approached this year, the Jolly Roger flags began to outnumber Georgia Bulldog banners along the sprawling verandas of the old wooden colonials. The Marshall Tucker Band was booked. A sports bar announced a late-night wench contest, an oyster restaurant advertised $2 grog shots and surf shops sold T-shirts with slogans such as ''Surrender the Booty'' and ''Prepare to Be Boarded.''
 Despite the stormy weather, thousands of pirate re-enactors, pirate admirers and pirate-curious onlookers arrived from Macon and Augusta, Ga., the Carolinas and beyond.
 ''It's for the kids,'' said Chad Carty, 33, who brought his children from Indianapolis. The oldest of the three, Ethan, 7, wore a vest, knee-length britches and an eye patch adorned with a ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' sticker.
 ''I like their swords and the guns, and I like tattoos, and they swordfight,'' Ethan said. ''I like the pirate ship.''
 Along the festival grounds, set up in a parking lot, more elaborate costuming was on display.
 Don McGowan, 52, a truck driver from Cynthiana, Ky., wore a braided goatee, printed bandanna, ruffled shirt, red sash, baldric, cutlass, parachute pants and sandals, sacrificing some authenticity for comfort as his outfit progressed from head to toe. Relaxing at a table, he offered a dramatic salute to a similarly attired passer-by.
 ''I'm more into the history part of it,'' Mr. McGowan said, recounting childhood trips to Ocracoke Island, N.C., Blackbeard's hideaway. ''The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' brought it all out. There were 10 or 12 people running through here with the lanterns straight out of 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' '' 
 Indeed, for every finely considered sartorial homage, there seemed to be a child running around swinging a glow-in-the-dark sword. A group of Shriners fired cannon blasts from atop a 1963 Ford school bus refashioned as a glowing Spanish galleon. A band covered Gram Parsons. Vendors hawked jewelry, airbrushed tattoos, beads, packaged eye patches, skull rings and golden teeth (''fits like a cap, matey''). At the Acme Costume stand, a jar of eyeliner pencil was marked ''Johnny Depp Eyes, $2.''
 Resplendent in long black hair, a talisman of buffalo teeth, a silver ring in the shape of a serpent and a .41-caliber sidearm, Dwight Yanguas, 52, indulged numerous requests for photographs. His teeth were even rotted.
 Mr. Yanguas, a vendor of handmade wooden long swords, daggers and cutlasses, stumbled into his trade in the 1990s, seeking to trade his shopping-mall maintenance job for show business.
 ''I would dress up as a medieval knight,'' he said.
 But soon, he added, ''all the kids would come up to me and the first thing they would say is: 'Are you a pirate? You look like a pirate.' I said, 'No, I'm supposed to be a knight.' So I decided if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. From there, I went total pirate theme.''
 By popular acclaim, the festival prize of $100 in gold coins and gift certificates was awarded to Lindsey Lee Miller, 23, from Marietta, Ga. She credited her sultry red costume to the work of fairies plying woven wolverine fur, Brazilian peacock feathers and ivory.
 One of Ms. Miller's costumed companions, Robert Bean, 45 and known as Pirate Bob, pronounced her triumph a rebuke to the Hollywood imitators.
 ''I find them dull and boring,'' Mr. Bean said. ''Everybody can be Captain Jack. Why not strive to be something different, like Lindsey Lee here?''
 As the festival neared its finale, spectators gathered along the main beach road to watch the pirates on parade. They unfolded portable chairs, crouched on curbs, leaned from balconies and let their children play. With a patrol car to lead the way, the pirates rode wooden floats towed behind sport utility vehicles. Some threw beads. A marching band pounded out a heavy rhythm. A pet-rescue group, a science fiction club and a group of bicyclists with eye patches, buccaneer caps and beer cozies passed by, all arrghing away. 
 Behind them a big green garbage truck flying a Jolly Roger balloon followed, its passengers dressed in lace, waving to the crowd, honking the loudest horn of all from the cabin of the good ship Waste Pro, its slogan painted to proclaim: ''God Bless America.''

HEADLINE: For the Early Birds, A Dispiriting Wait

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Monroe 

 BODY:
 DINNER beckons early to the retired, and by 5 p.m. the tables were already starting to fill at Spiro & Angie's Diner, the regulars streaming in from the gated, low-slung adult communities that encircle it. The stock market was down again, but the crabmeat-stuffed flounder special they hoped would distract them from their losses was holding steady at $11.50.
 ''With the red cabbage,'' said Estelle Simon, ordering the flounder, and then turning again to the subject that has dominated conversations here lately. ''I have my accounts in my computer and I had to look yesterday to see what I had in my checkbook, and I went like this,'' she said, holding her hand up to shield her eyes.
 Barbara Ross nodded in agreement. ''I expect my statements soon, and I don't want to open them,'' she said, and ordered a turkey burger. ''It's nerve-wracking.'' 
 Charlotte Futterman ordered a turkey burger, too, and made a mordant joke. ''I said to my son, 'I'm so glad you finished your basement because that's where you'll put me,' '' she said. ''There's a bathroom with a shower, so I'm all set.''
 Forty miles down the Turnpike from Wall Street, Exit 8A is the gateway to an early-bird swath of New Jersey where patient investors schooled in the long view have felt the world tightening around them. Much of the money that sustains life here -- along the serpentine streets of retirement villages carved into the old farmland -- was made elsewhere, long ago, and salted away for the future, which has now arrived, bearing unexpected perils.
 It is especially discomfiting to stand on the sidelines of a staggering economy when your earning years have passed, and all you can do is watch the money you entrusted to the generations behind you sag like a battered boxer. You can't get into the ring yourself to join the fight, only shout from beyond the ropes, averting your gaze as the fresh blows land.
 The three widows at the middle table eat here most Friday evenings, early enough so that Ms. Futterman, the most devout bridge player among them, can get to the Friday night duplicate session at the clubhouse in Concordia, the retirement community where they all moved from points north to be near their children and grandchildren.
 ''My son said to me, 'Mother, just remember it's only on paper,' '' said Ms. Futterman, 76, who worked at a printing company on Long Island.
 ''That's what my son said, too,'' said Ms. Ross, 68, who worked as an accountant at Brooklyn College. ''He said, 'Leave it alone, it'll get better, just leave it be.' ''
 ''The problem is, it'll get better, but when will it get better?'' said Ms. Simon, who, like some others at the restaurant, preferred not to give her age. She worked as a legal secretary in Bergen County and has lived in Concordia for 12 years. ''Will it be in our lifetime?''
 Spiro & Angie's opened six years ago, the only restaurant among the medical offices in a small shopping plaza, and it soon gained a loyal following among the transplanted retirees who missed the familiar comforts of the diners they left behind in their old neighborhoods, and who brought armloads of gifts when the owners' new granddaughter was born last year. 
 ''They come in and they ask me, 'Angie, did you hear what the stock market did today?' '' said Angie Mastoras, who, with her husband, Spiro, worked for many years in diners owned by other people before the couple finally opened their own. The Mastorases have no money in the market themselves -- ''Here,'' she said, pounding her fist on the counter to show where their investments are -- but they know what it means for their business that their customers do.
 ''Little by little, it's slower,'' Ms. Mastoras said.
 In a corner booth, Julia Bossinger ordered the marinated Romanian steak (''as rare as you can make it'') and said she felt grateful for the pensions she collects from her own job, as a rehabilitation counselor, and her late husband's, as an electrical engineer. ''I feel very fortunate right now,'' she said, despite the $5,000 her investments have lost this year. ''But I have grown grandchildren, and I'm very worried about their futures, about what kinds of opportunities they'll have.''
 Her dining companion, Dorothy Gross, 77, had just opened a financial statement with the stark news about the current value of the $10,000 Lehman Brothers bond that she and her late husband bought many years ago. ''About $530,'' said Ms. Gross, who still takes the bus several times each week to her longtime job with a women's clothing importer in Manhattan. ''As long as you don't have to cash them in, you have hopes that eventually they'll go up. They may not go up as rapidly as they fell down, but you have hope.''
 Across the room, Sheldon Raskin, a retired lighting engineer from Queens, was savoring the stuffed flounder. ''I would call it a depression, not a recession,'' said Mr. Raskin, 74, who had just emerged from the hospital after surgery to remove a transplanted kidney that had caused more problems than it solved. ''Our funds that we have that we're living on have lost about 30 percent since the market started to turn. My feeling is, we're never going to get back to where it was before.''
 His wife, Minna, 70, had a B.L.T. ''If you're younger, you have time to wait around and recoup your losses, but we don't know how much longer we have,'' she said. They met on a blind date 51 years ago when Mr. Raskin arrived in his black-and-yellow Ford convertible. She made him put the top up so the wind wouldn't muss her hair. They celebrated their 50th anniversary in March. ''If it takes 5, 10 years, we don't know if we're going to be here then.''
 When he retired at 65, Mr. Raskin didn't expect such worries. ''You work all your life and you save all of this, and then all the sudden it's disappearing before your eyes, and then you have to figure out if you're going to have enough money to survive,'' he said. ''It's scary. It's very scary.''
 The flounder came with dessert, and he chose a slice of sugar-free apple pie. ''Unfortunately it's not always the golden years,'' he said, and asked for the pie to go, saving it for later. ''There's a lot of rust around the edges.''

HEADLINE: Fury of Girl's Fists Lifts Up North Korean Refugee Family

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
For South Koreans, boxing is mainly a sport of the past, a metaphor for what the country was in the 1970s and '80s before its economy jumped to 13th largest in the world and a generation of young people grew up with privileges their parents could only imagine. Boxing was the sport of poor people, fighting for what they believed was rightfully theirs.
 Now, a girl whose family fled North Korea is breathing just a hint of new life into the sport by winning a world championship at age 17. In a soccer-crazed country, her hardscrabble tale has generated some headlines. 
 Her promoters, striving to fill the seats for matches, played up her story. Posters for her fights bill her as Choi Hyun-mi, the ''Defector Girl Boxer.'' 
 The boxing metaphor is still apt for Ms. Choi and her family. She and her parents and an older brother fled the North for a better life only to run into prejudice. Even many South Koreans who want their nation to reunite with the North view the approximately 10,000 refugees a bit like poor relations, less skilled and less urbane than the South's highly educated citizens.
 Ms. Choi's father, who had been a successful businessman in the North, has been unable to find work, and the family has been reduced to living mainly on government handouts to the refugees.
 Ms. Choi hopes to supplement her family's income with her fighting fees. Like Americans who vaulted past class bias through a life in the ring, Ms. Choi also hopes to lift her family's stature. 
 ''My parents gave up everything in North Korea to give their children a better life in the South,'' she said. ''Boxing is my way to prove that my parents made the right decision.'' 
 Ms. Choi pursues that dream in a gym on the top floor of a five-story building with no elevator, in a ring with an uneven and patched canvas. Faded photos of former South Korean boxing greats line the walls.
 The photos, and the American hip-hop that blares from speakers, are constant reminders of how much Ms. Choi's life has changed since her family arrived here four years ago. When she began her boxing career in North Korea, she trained daily under portraits of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il. 
 Government scouts in North Korea detected Ms. Choi's potential when she was 13. Ms. Choi, now 5 feet 7 inches, was almost a head taller than her peers in a country where many children suffer from malnourishment, and she was faster than anyone in her school in Pyongyang, the North's capital. 
 In 2003, she was approached by the head coach of the prestigious Kim Chul-joo Educational University in Pyongyang, who was developing a national women's team in the hope that women's boxing would be added as an event in the 2008 Olympics. 
 She was the youngest of the 20 girls the government trained, encouraging them with more food and a cash allowance. (The International Olympic Committee, however, decided not to admit women's boxing as an Olympic sport.) 
 In 2004, her father, Choi Chul-soo, decided that the family should flee the North's rampant repression and poverty. He had gotten a taste of the freedoms other countries offered while on business trips abroad.
 It was not an easy choice. The family had lived a life of relative comfort. He traveled overseas for his state-owned company, which exported zinc to China and sea urchins to Japan. The family's apartment was stocked with Japanese appliances. 
 ''I dressed my children in nothing but Japanese clothes,'' Mr. Choi said. ''But in North Korea, even if you were rich, you were always under surveillance. People disappeared.'' 
 He was still worried enough about North Korea when he first arrived that he changed his given name to the one he has now, hoping the North's government would take longer to identify him and possibly punish his relatives who remained behind.
 The family escaped when Mr. Choi was on a business trip in China. He sent for his family and bribed border guards to ensure a safe crossing. From China, the family was smuggled into Vietnam. After four months there hiding in hotel rooms, the family was granted asylum by the South Korean government and flown to Seoul. 
 But once here, Mr. Choi's fears were realized. Without work, he could no longer afford luxuries for his family, which lives in a rented apartment that is half the size of its apartment in Pyongyang. 
 ''I sometimes miss my life in North Korea and wonder whether I made the right choice,'' he said.
 One bright spot is his daughter's budding career. After entering amateur contests in 2006, she swept five domestic championships, suffering only one defeat in 17 fights. In September 2007, she turned professional.
 A little more than a year later, on Oct. 11, Ms. Choi beat Xu Chun Yan of China for the World Boxing Association's women's featherweight championship. 
 It was not an easy match. Ms. Choi's more experienced opponent landed many punches. But she eventually tired, and Ms. Choi used her straight punches to dominate the later rounds. Her coach, Kim Han-sang, said Ms. Choi's height gave her an advantage. 
 The win made her one of five South Korean women to hold a boxing championship title.
 ''When I returned to my corner between rounds of my championship bout, I glimpsed down at my mother sobbing,'' Ms. Choi said. 
 It was clear to Ms. Choi that she was not only helping shoulder the family's hopes, but that she might even be able to raise its income a bit with her cut of the $7,000 she makes per fight.
 On a recent day, she returned to the gym after taking a week off to recuperate from her championship bout. She wore oversize sunglasses on the street to hide her black eyes and swollen face. Her arms still bore bruises. 
 She said she boxed for her family, for fame and for her figure. ''Boxing makes you curvy,'' she said, striking a pose with a giggle. ''I want to be a pretty girl who does pretty boxing.'' 
 She added: ''But in this sport, you do take some punches.'' 
 She is about to resume her daily training routine, which includes three sessions a day, in order to prepare to defend her title in December. Her school allows her time off to train. She must lose 10 pounds to weigh in at 126 pounds or under for her featherweight class.
 Her coach says she needs to develop a knockout punch. But he has faith. He says that, unlike other female boxers, she is at least as concerned with being a good fighter as with staying in shape. 
 Ms. Choi says she wants to sweep all the world titles in her weight division and then break into the country's entertainment industry, where a few former athletes have found success. 
 Raising her gloved hand into the air, she said, ''I'm going to make everyone recognize my name.''

The Perils of Specialization
 To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''Walking Away: A Top Recruit Left UConn When a Long-Held Goal to Be the Best Lost Its Luster,'' Oct. 19: The article about Elena Delle Donne gave renewed hope among those of us who encourage athletes in youth leagues and secondary school to play at least two sports. Clearly Delle Donne burned out on basketball, just as many youngsters do in whatever sport when they play only one exclusively throughout middle school and high school.
 The comments by Bonnie Kenny, Delaware's volleyball coach, were most appreciated. I hope she will speak to many of her colleagues in college coaching. They often directly or indirectly encourage youngsters to play only one sport. The youngsters, and often their parents, hope for an athletic scholarship or at least a wedge to help them to get into a good, competitive college. 
 Keep in mind that Penn State's star tailback, Evan Royster, was considered by some the best high school lacrosse player in the country as a senior. Jon Frere

 Priorities at Rutgers
 To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''Work in Progress,'' Oct. 18: Planning a football expansion takes years, and the only fault you can place on Rutgers University is its unlucky timing with the economy and a down year for the football team.
 There will always be complainers, but I thank Richard L. McCormick, the university president, and Athletic Director Robert E. Mulcahy III for the foresight to improve Rutgers athletics. Not only does it spotlight the athletic teams, but it also increases pride in the university. 
 Most universities are trying to bolster their academics as their athletic teams flourish. Rutgers athletics is trying to catch up with its fine academic standing. Balancing the two is a good thing. 
 Charles Slane
 Galena, Ohio
 To the Sports Editor: 
 From this high school student's point of view, it is ridiculous that Rutgers is spending $102 million to improve its football stadium. It is bad enough that colleges are getting tougher to get into on an academic basis, but when the economy is in such a bad place that students are taking on tens of thousands of dollars in debt in their final years of college, how can a university even think about spending that kind of money on a stadium?
 Even student-athletes should agree that academics must be of paramount importance to any institution of higher learning. There is a reason the student in student-athlete comes first. Caroline Blair

 Inside the A-11 Offense
 To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''Who's on Line? Who's a Back? Even the Referees Don't Know,'' Oct. 17: The A-11 offense appears to differ from six- and eight-man football only in the number of players involved. All members of six- and eight-man teams are eligible receivers.
 Because defenses can handle the problem with six- and eight-man football, presumably all teams confronting the A-11 have to adopt the same coverage mentality used in those leagues. If he may be the receiver, treat him as one. Who cares if some of the players on offense turn out not to be eligible? And if the A-11 reduces injuries, that should settle the question.

 No Divided Loyalty
 To the Sports Editor,
 Re ''Room for a Longtime Yankees Fan at Fenway,'' Oct. 18: I ask Harvey Araton not to insult Mystique and Aura, priestesses of the Yankees ghosts. Boston has a long way to go before it ever earns such intimidating legends. Kathryn Lagana

HEADLINE: WHERE THE THUNDER COMES DRIBBLING DOWN THE PLAIN

BYLINE: By BRUCE SCHOENFELD. 
Bruce Schoenfeld is the author of ''The Match: Althea Gibson and Angela Buxton,'' and writes frequently about the business of sports.

 BODY:
On the far northern edge of Oklahoma City, in a converted fitness center off a desolate road past a lumberyard, the National Basketball Association's newest team has been holding its practices. One morning earlier this month, Clay Bennett, the Oklahoma City Thunder's controlling owner, was standing beside a stack of free weights, his elbow resting on a chest-high dividing wall, watching a preseason workout. Despite his size -- 6-foot-5, close to 300 pounds -- he seemed to cast almost no presence. Later that day, the Thunder would fly to Billings, Mont., for its first exhibition game and make history, after a fashion: no sports franchise permanently based in Oklahoma had ever competed in one of North America's four major leagues. Bennett stayed quiet as he pondered these high-priced athletes in their cornflower blue jerseys who were now representing his state and his city. ''There's a word for this, and it's an overused word and not quite the right word,'' he told me, ''but the word is 'surreal.' '' 
 I'd been thinking exactly the same thing. For more than 40 seasons, the Thunder played in Seattle as the SuperSonics. The team captured an N.B.A. title in 1979, reached the finals on two other occasions and, at one point in the 1990s, sold out every home game for more than three consecutive seasons. With Seattle on a roll -- it's home to Microsoft, Amazon.com, Starbucks, Costco, Nordstrom -- it is difficult to fathom why any team (or business, for that matter) would leave the city and its famous quality of life for a metropolitan area one-third its size. And why Oklahoma City? Even in its own state, Tulsa would seem to have greater national prospects, with its rolling hills, mansion-filled neighborhoods and cultural accouterments of a serious place, as opposed to flat, brown, insular Oklahoma City, where unseemly oil wells blight even the Capitol grounds. Farther afield, metropolitan areas without N.B.A. teams include San Diego, St. Louis, Kansas City, Nashville, Tampa and Anaheim, big-league markets all. So it's not surprising that Oklahoma City wasn't even on the N.B.A.'s list of potential candidates for expansion or relocation three years ago. It is, as Bennett admits, almost the archetype of the minor-league place: ''When they first started looking at this, and the idea of the team moving from Seattle, a lot of the other owners said to me: 'I like you, Clay. But when I hear Oklahoma City, I think Des Moines and Omaha.' ''
 Perhaps nobody finds the metamorphosis of the SuperSonics into the Thunder harder to accept than many of the citizens of Seattle. Every relocation of a big-league franchise begets a certain amount of hand-wringing and recrimination, but this one unfolded with remarkable acrimony. It ended in July, at least officially, when a suit brought by the city of Seattle seeking to keep the Sonics in town until 2010 was settled for $75 million. (The payment will be substantially reduced if Seattle gets a replacement team within five years.) But the emotions invested in keeping the Sonics appeared to be less about a consuming interest in professional basketball than the humiliation of a smart, sophisticated city losing a franchise to a perceived cow town. ''There wasn't much excitement about the Sonics, to be honest,'' Nick Collison, who is beginning his fifth season as one of the team's players, told me. But the idea of the Sonics moving to Oklahoma City, he adds, ''said something about Seattle that people there didn't want to believe.''
 The same attitude manifested itself in antipathy toward Bennett, one of four principal partners and several minor investors who together paid $350 million to buy the team from Howard Schultz, the Starbucks chief executive, and his partners in July 2006 and then tried in vain to get public financing for a new arena. With his brush cut and beefy build, his lifelong Republicanism and partners made rich by fossil fuels, Bennett pushed all the wrong buttons in liberal, urbane, health-conscious, ecologically sensitive Seattle. In fact Bennett is substantially more nuanced than his image suggests. He is polite almost to the point of courtliness. He and his wife, Louise, own a literary bookstore outside Aspen, Colo. His office is decorated with glossy books featuring the work of the Colombian artist Fernando Botero. Far from being a stereotypical cowboy from the plains -- ''I don't even own a pair of cowboy boots,'' he says -- he was raised by a Jewish mother and celebrated a bar mitzvah, though he now attends his wife's Presbyterian church. But Bennett didn't show any of that worldliness, and Seattle wasn't looking to see it. ''Everybody there but me knew I was heading down the wrong path,'' he says. ''Hindsight suggests I was not going to be successful.''
 Yet given the way professional basketball has evolved, the Sonics' move may have been inevitable. As I spent time in both Seattle and Oklahoma City, it became evident that the intense passions on both sides -- Oklahoma City has been as feverish about the team's arrival as Seattle was about its departure -- were obscuring a larger issue facing the N.B.A. It may be that a midsize market like Seattle, with its big-league baseball and football teams and a wealth of recreational and entertainment options, has outgrown professional basketball, or at least the desire to fight terribly hard to keep it. A more appropriate home for a franchise these days seems to be a smaller city on the rise, with maybe a million to a million and a half people, plenty of money, local and regional art museums and a few ambitious restaurants but not too much else for its population to do, and an excess of civic pride ready to be harnessed. A place, in other words, exactly like Oklahoma City.
 For delivering the Thunder, Bennett has gained the status of a civic benefactor. To older residents, he lives in the shadow of his father-in-law, Edward L. Gaylord, who before his death in 2003 amassed an empire that included newspapers, luxury hotels, a television network and Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. Bennett's own, under-the-radar business success -- he runs Dorchester Capital, a private investment company whose size he refuses to disclose -- has been modest in comparison. His identity is now that of N.B.A. owner. He was inducted into Oklahoma's Hall of Fame last year at the age of 47. That the N.B.A.'s commissioner, David Stern, flew in to make Bennett's introduction shows how much that honor derives from his bringing big-league sports to the state.
 Economically speaking, the Thunder will cause barely a ripple in Oklahoma City, where two energy companies with combined annual revenues approaching $20 billion, Devon and Chesapeake, are headquartered. The average N.B.A. team generates $120 million or so in revenue. The psychological impact, however, will be much greater. Never mind that the N.B.A.'s television ratings are slipping or that it doesn't generate nearly the buzz that it did when Michael Jordan was taking the sport worldwide. When the Thunder begins its regular season against Milwaukee this Wednesday, Oklahoma City will find itself listed in the league standings among Dallas and New York and Los Angeles. ''It will enhance public perception of the entire state,'' gushed Brad Henry, Oklahoma's governor, when we spoke. ''We'll be on SportsCenter every night.''
 Almost unanimously, it seems, Oklahoma City's establishment -- businessmen and columnists, Democrats and Republicans -- believes that the N.B.A.'s presence will validate a community that seemed hopelessly downtrodden only a short time ago. In April 1995, a bomb ripped through the Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people and added a horrific climax to both an economic slide that started with the decline of oil prices in the late 1980s and a self-esteem problem dating to the Great Depression. 
 But even during its boom times, when oil barons were spending freely, Oklahoma City had no reason to believe that it would ever be major-league. For Bennett, as for most Oklahomans, the home team was the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys, who play three hours down the highway. As an adolescent, he once dreamed of owning the Cowboys; though he's built like a former defensive lineman, with a belly spilling over his belt, his main interest in sports has always been administrative. He still follows the Cowboys, and University of Oklahoma football, but he's not one to quote statistics or know much about the subtleties of various players, even his own, and it's impossible to imagine him pulling on a team sweatshirt and heading off to a sports bar. At one point, he considered moving to New York to pursue a business career in sports. But he'd already fallen in love with Louise Gaylord, whom he started dating in high school, and Edward Gaylord's daughter wasn't going anywhere.
 After attending O.U. for two years and Binghamton University for one, he began work at his own family's business, which manufactured windows and doors for residential construction. The company was successful, but it couldn't contain Bennett's ambition to somehow act on a larger scale. Based on contacts he'd made in the local business community, and boosted by his Gaylord connection, he landed the job of running the U.S. Olympic Festival, which had been awarded to Oklahoma City for 1989. A multisport event for U.S. athletes that at the time was held in non-Olympic years, the occasion ended up being the first great thing to happen in the city since the bottom fell out of oil in the mid-1980s. ''Writers from papers around the country were saying, 'Oklahoma City did a great job,' '' Bennett says. ''For Oklahoma, that was significant.'' The event put Bennett on the city's radar as more than the mere suitor who landed Gaylord's daughter. It also rekindled his enthusiasm for sports. Seeing precious little on the local landscape beyond minor-league franchises in baseball and hockey, he decided to make Oklahoma City the amateur-sports capital of America.
 In 1992, the city passed a referendum calling for a new minor-league baseball stadium, a new arena (the Ford Center, where the Thunder now play), gentrification of the downtown warehouse district and other revitalization projects. One of these was a rowing facility that Bennett intended to be the first step toward attracting the national governing bodies of various sports. But by 1995, civic support had waned. Then the Murrah Building was bombed by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. ''The bombings galvanized the average person to realize that the city needed to make a statement,'' Frank Keating, then the state's governor, told me. ''There was a sense of pride and optimism and faith that bordered on the spiritual. It was quite remarkable.'' Nearly 200,000 residents went to at least one funeral; 75 percent of the population volunteered or gave money. ''It brought us all to our knees,'' Bennett says. ''We all became connected.''
 Caught up in the spirit of goodwill, business and City Hall agreed to supplement the original revitalization effort, called MAPS, with further initiatives. Oil and gas recovered. Transforming the city into a hub for national amateur sports bodies wasn't working -- Indianapolis grabbed that distinction -- but Bennett, working on Gaylord's behalf, helped keep the Class AAA baseball team, the 89ers, in town by buying it. (The team is now called the RedHawks and owned by someone else.) When Gaylord became a major investor in the N.B.A.'s San Antonio Spurs, Bennett participated in the ownership group, at one point serving as its representative to the league's board of governors. Gaylord sold his interest in 1996, and Bennett came away with a keen awareness of what the N.B.A. had done for a minor market. ''For the first time, I recognized the role a team could play in the visibility and marketability of a community,'' he says. ''I became aware of just how important to a place a big-league team could be.''
 FOLLOWING THE DEPRESSION, about the only display of excellence the state of Oklahoma had to offer was O.U. football. When George L. Cross, the institution's president from 1943 to 1968, told the state's Legislature that he wanted to build a university that the football team could be proud of, that wasn't misplaced priorities on display but an acknowledgment of the standard that football, and only football, had set. ''It was the dominant program in the country,'' Joe Castiglione, O.U.'s current athletic director, says. ''It gave Oklahoma an identity it didn't otherwise have.''
 Growing up in Oklahoma, Mick Cornett appreciated the renown the Sooners brought to the state. He spent 17 years as a sportscaster before turning to politics, and then he was elected mayor in 2004 on a pro-business platform. In office, he had a keen awareness of how outsiders perceived his city. ''We had a branding problem,'' he says now. ''We have allowed ourselves to be branded by our tragedies. If you said 'Oklahoma City,' chances are the next word out of your mouth was 'bombing.' '' Determined to use sports to change the city's image, he turned to Bennett, whose investment business was beginning to provide him with, as he puts it, ''significant money.'' Armed with Bennett's interest in leading an ownership group, Cornett started pitching the people who could get him a team. Oklahoma City had failed before in a bid to land a National Hockey League expansion franchise, but Cornett visited Gary Bettman, the league's commissioner, anyway. And he lobbied Stern; the N.B.A. commissioner was sympathetic but hardly optimistic. The N.B.A. had no plans to expand, he told Cornett, and no teams looking to relocate. ''After a while, he started calling me 'the Mayor Who Won't Go Away,' '' Cornett says. He remembers standing on a sidewalk in New York after a meeting in Stern's office in 2005, painfully aware that he had no logical reason to return again.
 That August, Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana. Within hours, Cornett called Stern to propose that the N.B.A.'s suddenly homeless New Orleans Hornets play at the Ford Center. Stern dimly recalled that he knew a wealthy investor in Oklahoma who once represented the Spurs. He couldn't remember Bennett's name, according to Cornett, which shows what shallow footprints Bennett must have left his first time around the league, but he had positive recollections. That Saturday, Stern tracked down Bennett in a luxury suite at an O.U. football game. Bennett took a phone into a janitor's closet and, amid the mops and pails, agreed to guarantee $40 million in sponsorships and ticket sales, hire a local staff, make temporary arena enhancements and do whatever else was necessary to attract the Hornets for a year and perhaps longer, depending on the extent of the storm's damage.
 George Shinn, the Hornets' owner, didn't have Oklahoma City on his radar screen. ''I was getting calls from around the country, Vegas and on and on, and David threw out Oklahoma City,'' Shinn says. ''And I said: 'David, I don't think I want to go there. I've never even been there, and it doesn't sound like -- do they even have an arena?' But David's got a way of recommending that sort of pushes you.'' Stern had a hunch that it was the right place for the Hornets to go. ''Clay Bennett, Mick Cornett, the attempt to get an N.H.L. team, the arena -- it seemed like it could work,'' Stern says. More important, perhaps, he had the right man. ''Clay was the leader,'' says Larry Nichols, who runs Devon Energy, one of America's largest producers of natural gas. ''He knew how to do it. He called a few friends and said: 'O.K., here's what we need.' We all signed up.'' Within hours, Bennett had his $40 million.
 The Hornets' relocation was supposed to be temporary. Seats were expensive, and the team was terrible. Bennett pushed the city's executives not merely to buy advertising and sponsorship deals but also to spend freely at the box office, which he knew the N.B.A. would notice first. ''He knows exactly how much he -- 'window-dressed' is the term I heard -- the market,'' says Ian Edmundson, a sports consultant who has worked with the Hornets. In New Orleans the previous season, the Hornets drew 11,299 fans per game. But in Oklahoma City, with ticket prices $13 higher on average, they managed 16,330 and brought a carnival atmosphere to downtown. ''It was an almost euphoric response,'' Castiglione says. ''A unique set of dynamics that made for an incredible run.''
 Convinced that the city was ready to go national, Bennett tried to buy the Hornets and keep them in Oklahoma. According to a letter Shinn subsequently wrote to Stern, Stern recommended that he sell. ''You pressed me to sell the team,'' Shinn wrote. ''You even told me that owners were asking you, 'What's wrong with George -- why doesn't he sell his team[?]' '' Shinn's response made it clear that he, too, coveted the new territory. ''We need to immediately begin laying the foundation for what I believe will be great relationships in Oklahoma City,'' he wrote. ''I believe there are several options that we have, none of which involve returning to New Orleans.'' And just as Shinn had designs on Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City had designs on the team. ''The Hornets are ours,'' the sports columnist Berry Tramel proclaimed in the Gaylord-owned Oklahoman.
 But sports in New Orleans was about to take on metaphoric significance. Swaggering and self-confident before Katrina, the city now looked to its teams to bear out its recovery, in the same way that Oklahoma City was seeking a franchise to trumpet its own transformation. ''We look at sports teams as businesses, and they are,'' says Hugh Weber, Shinn's brother-in-law and the Hornets' president. ''But they're also community treasures. They can rally people around ideas.'' The N.F.L.'s Saints returned to the Superdome in September 2006, shortly before the Hornets began their second season in exile, and amazingly, illogically, began to win as never before. With each victory, it felt as if another ward of the city had been restored. After that, the Hornets could hardly sneak away. Shinn returned the Hornets to New Orleans, which had never much cared for them. He negotiated a new lease (with an attendance-based escape clause to keep his options open), then watched the team catch fire, both on the court and at the ticket window.
 Rebuffed by Shinn, Bennett found another option. The SuperSonics had been trying to replace outdated Key Arena for almost a decade, spanning two ownership groups. I attended one of the last games the Sonics would play there last April and felt as if I were visiting my old elementary school as an adult. Hallways were cramped and narrow, and the arena lacked the amenities -- upscale restaurants, retail areas, meeting spaces -- that serve as profit centers for today's pro franchises. What's more, it was widely acknowledged that the Sonics' lease was the N.B.A.'s worst. It gave the city a large percentage of revenues from luxury suites, club seats and concessions, income that teams leaguewide routinely keep for themselves.
 For four years, Howard Schultz (who declined to be interviewed for this article) had been trying to persuade government officials to build him a new facility. A Seattle celebrity, the man who made the city's coffee famous, he pulled every string at his disposal, without success. Largely against their will, taxpayers had recently financed two expensive stadiums, one for Major League Baseball's Mariners and one for the N.F.L.'s Seahawks. They were in no mood to finance another. Defeated, Schultz offered the team to wealthy executives around town. Then he sold it to Bennett.
 Because the new owners came from Oklahoma, locals assumed they were intent on moving the Sonics there. Unaccustomed to the glare of big-city media, Bennett reverted to his default position in almost any endeavor: Be circumspect, say little, acquire information. ''People interpreted his reticence, his quietness, as 'He must be holding something back,' '' says Peter von Reichbauer, a council member in King County, which includes Seattle. ''Decisions were made instantly, both in the media and in the bars and taverns, 'This is a guy from out of state who wants to take this team out of state.' '' But while Oklahoma City was always an option, Bennett insisted that the group's preference was a new arena somewhere in greater Seattle. ''We had to make the business work,'' he says now. ''It wasn't like we bought it for $20 million two decades ago. We'd just spent $350 million.'' He coveted the business potential of a metropolitan area of 3.3 million people and a long-established franchise that had lacked the means to maximize its revenue. And after years of shielding his three children from the public fascination of what it means to be Gaylord heirs, he was wary of subjecting them to the scrutiny that putting his team in Oklahoma City would invite.
 Bennett says he thought that negotiating as an outsider would be a strength, not a weakness. ''Howard didn't have leverage,'' he says, whereas he had an arena waiting. Watching his Sonics lose a nail-biter to Portland before a sellout crowd in the first game of what the newspapers were calling the Bennett Era, he felt giddy. ''I remember thinking: We did it. We saved basketball for Puget Sound. I had this vision of our new building. I could taste it.''
 HOW TO DETERMINE WHICH CITIES are best suited for big-league sports seems obvious. Notwithstanding various local and regional affections (Edmonton's for hockey, Green Bay's for football), shouldn't franchises be located where the largest fan base and greatest corporate presence can support them? And yet, the competitive and financial success of some small-market franchises indicates that other factors also matter. ''The Yankees don't win the World Series every year,'' says Aubrey McClendon, the C.E.O. of Chesapeake Energy, who owns 20 percent of the Thunder. ''Los Angeles doesn't have an N.F.L. team. It isn't just about size.''
 Still, Seattle, the nation's 14th-largest television market, isn't merely far larger than Oklahoma City, the 45th. It's the home of several major corporate players in America's Internet economy and of manufacturers and top brick-and-mortar retailers, a diversity that would seem to protect it from the boom-and-bust cycles that have plagued Oklahoma City. Seattle is regarded as the gateway to Asia and all those nascent basketball fans in China. And it's a terrific place to live, or even visit. Few N.B.A. players, executives or beat writers are excited about swapping their Seattle visits for road trips to Oklahoma. ''When a city's in the league for 40 years and everyone really likes it, it's going to be missed, no question,'' says P. J. Carlesimo, the Thunder's head coach, who came to Seattle before last season to lead a rebuilding effort centered on the lanky, 6-foot-9 sharpshooter Kevin Durant, the second player chosen in the 2007 draft. Those with historic ties to the franchise are especially saddened. ''There's a soul and a history to basketball in Seattle,'' says George Karl, the Denver Nuggets' head coach, who previously coached the Sonics. ''I know owners want to make more money, but is the way to do it really by making the sport more business-oriented?'' 
 But does the Sonics' move toOklahoma City make sense from a business perspective? For the fourth time since 1985, the N.B.A. has traded down to a smaller market. That trend risks shrinking its television footprint and stunting the value of its other franchises. If a substantial number of fans follow the sport because a local team provides a vested interest, then the league has lost millions of potential viewers, T-shirt wearers and ticket buyers. ''It's important to have bigger markets,'' Shinn told me. ''That increases the chances for television revenues, that's obvious. And the bigger the market, the better the chance that you succeed.''
 Such logic isn't lost on Stern. He remains adamant that N.B.A. franchises must remain in the nation's largest cities. He ticks them off: ''Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles. . . . If I've forgotten one, I don't mean to. The Top 10.'' But he also acknowledges that the other dozen and a half teams might be better situated as the lone big-league option in a small market rather than fighting popular baseball and football teams for corporate and fan support and media attention. That means successful N.B.A. markets like San Antonio, Sacramento, Portland and Salt Lake City. It doesn't mean Seattle. ''I wake up every morning thanking the Good Lord that we're the only game in town,'' says Peter Holt, who owns the San Antonio Spurs.
 Like Oklahoma City, Seattle once craved the status that comes with a big-league designation. In 1967, it secured an expansion franchise to play in a five-year-old arena that had been upgraded with taxpayer money to attract a team, a situation almost precisely analogous to Oklahoma City with its Ford Center. Seattle was different then, pre-Starbucks, pre-Nirvana, on the fringe and without the Seahawks or the Mariners. Getting the N.B.A., the city's hierarchy felt, would put the region on the map. Once it gained a reputation as a desirable place to live, and entertainment choices multiplied, the Sonics found themselves struggling to generate the depth of interest they had previously taken for granted. ''The Seattle of today is not the Seattle of the 1980s or even the 1990s,'' says Anne Levinson, a former deputy mayor who heads the group that owns the Seattle Storm of the Women's National Basketball Association. That arc of maturation has left the N.B.A. behind.
 As in every market on the continent with franchises in multiple leagues, Seattle's football and baseball teams have been its priority. The Sonics, tradition-rich as they were, ran a distant third, and the civic and corporate resources needed to support big-league sports may not have extended that deep. In Oklahoma City, by contrast, the team will have almost no competition for the sports-entertainment dollar beyond college programs, and residents are hungry for a team. ''The voters in Oklahoma City passed $126 million in improvements to the arena,'' says Gavin Maloof, whose family owns the N.B.A.'s Sacramento Kings. ''That shows me they really want the team.'' Maloof understands the allure of uncontested territory. The Kings struggled alongside baseball and football teams in Cincinnati and Kansas City, finding prosperity only in 1985 when Greg Lukenbill, then the owner, moved the team to Sacramento, a growing city devoid of big-league sports. ''The owner of a franchise has to be able to make money,'' Maloof says. ''I'm for whatever the owner wants.''
 ONE WARM TUESDAY IN OKLAHOMA CITY last spring, Bennett presided over a presentation to N.B.A. executives and three members of its relocation committee. First they toured the Ford Center, which Bennett had gussied up with a showcase suite, an expanded shopping concourse and other improvements. ''I wanted to show them that we knew what the N.B.A. standard was like, and we were prepared to go even further,'' he says. Later, the group convened in a hotel ballroom that had been transformed into a stage set. Seated in an arc around the participants were Mick Cornett and his two predecessors as mayor; the state's last two governors; C.E.O.'s of local corporations; the athletic directors of O.U. and Oklahoma State; even the Sooners' football coach, Bob Stoops, and Tulsa's mayor. The unanimity was striking. ''I've never seen anything like it,'' Stern says. Soon after getting the committee's recommendation, the league's owners voted on Bennett's plan to relocate the Sonics to Oklahoma. It passed 28-2.
 These days, Oklahoma City is exultant. ''You're going to be hearing about Oklahoma City now in a way that you've never heard about it before,'' McClendon says. On the radio and in The Oklahoman, the talk is of the Wunderkind general manager, Sam Presti, who is 31, building a winning team around Kevin Durant and succeeding on the model of the Spurs, a small-market franchise that more than holds its own against the competition. Yet Bennett still seems reluctant to celebrate his -- and the city's -- good fortune. As he walked me through the team's hastily constructed office space, past empty boxes and earnest young executives peddling sponsorship packages, he seemed more like a disinterested tax assessor than a city father who has pulled his hometown into the upper echelon. 
 One explanation for such detachment could be the lingering effect of the abuse he received in Seattle at the hands of talk-radio jocks, newspaper columnists and outright wackos, jarring attacks that ranged from shouted insults to death threats. ''It tested both my faith and my own self-confidence,'' he says. Another is his temperament: for the public face of a sports franchise, he's almost preternaturally private. Don't expect Bennett to rant like the Dallas Mavericks' Mark Cuban or spend like the New York Knicks' James Dolan; he runs his basketball team with the same measured strategies he uses to manage his investments.
 And I couldn't avoid the sense that, despite selling 13,000 season tickets in five days and reaching the first-year target for merchandise sales at the Thunder's downtown store in less than a month, he's daunted by his investment in Oklahoma City. What if, after all the chest-pounding and horn-blowing, it isn't ready to support a team for the long term after all? ''The worst thing we could do,'' he admits, ''is to bring a team to Oklahoma City and have it fail.'' Such an outcome would be disastrous financially for Bennett, and especially for his partners, who have suffered heavy losses in the ongoing financial crisis. More tellingly, it would also undo much of the work this generation of civic leadership has done to alter the city's image.
 When I asked him if that was his concern, he answered by talking about the pride and enthusiasm with which Oklahoma City has embraced the team. ''Anything we ask of anyone in this city, it's done,'' he told me. ''And it's done in the right spirit, and it's done professionally, and with respect.'' He shook his head. ''We have an awful lot to live up to.'' Whatever the result of Wednesday's game, Oklahoma City will have won something, at least symbolically. But though the template is there for N.B.A. success, and a team that contends within a few years is likely to continue to be received warmly, the market remains small for big-league sports, and the current economic conditions could hardly be worse. Perhaps Bennett is wise to be circumspect. It may well be that taking a team from Seattle, as improbable as that seemed, was the easy part. n

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Guys From 'Government Sachs' '' (Oct. 19), about former Goldman Sachs employees who moved to the Treasury Department: 
 I take issue with those who voice questions about the relative youth and inexperience of Neel T. Kashkari, a former technology investment banker who, at 35, now has a prominent role in Treasury's bailout effort. As someone older who has been through some of the same demanding training he has, I can assure you that he has the intellectual and judgment skills to tackle the toughest problems. 
 Maybe we should question the experience and expertise of many 50- and 60-somethings in our world as we look at the financial and economic ruins all around us.

HEADLINE: Performing Arts Center To Receive $11 Million

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
 LAWRENCE P. GOLDMAN, the president and chief executive officer of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center here, had an understandable reaction when the philanthropist Betty Wold Johnson told him she would donate $11 million to the center. 
 She made the pledge several months ago, when he met her at her home in Hopewell, he recalled. 
 ''We were sitting at her kitchen table, and I got up and gave her a hug so big I was afraid I was going to crush her,'' he said. 
 The gift, which was announced this week, is the largest individual donation in the arts center's history, according to Jeffrey Norman, a spokesman for the center, known as NJPAC. 
 The center will use $8 million of the donation for a maintenance endowment and $3 million for immediate capital needs and artistic development, Mr. Norman said. 
 Josh Weston, who is on the NJPAC board and who has, along with his wife, Judy Weston, donated millions to the center, called Mrs. Johnson's gift ''terrific.''
 ''It helps in its own right and it might be an inspiration or motivator for other high net worth people in New Jersey to also step up to the plate,'' he said.
 Mrs. Johnson's gift brings NJPAC to within $10 million of a fund-raising goal of $180 million it announced in 2006, Mr. Norman said. Of that amount, $100 million will be used for the endowment, $60 million for five years' worth of operating funds, $14 million for capital improvements and $6 million for the reserve fund, center officials said.
 Mrs. Johnson, of Hopewell, is the widow of Robert Wood Johnson III and the mother of Robert Wood Johnson IV, who owns the New York Jets. She learned about the center at a 1991 reception at the governor's mansion, Mr. Norman said, and after the center opened in 1997, she donated more than $2 million. 
 The annual budget of NJPAC, which opened in 1997, is $27 million, Mr. Norman said, of which $10.6 million comes from private contributions and $1.4 million from the New Jersey State Arts Council, with the balance from ticket sales, parking and other revenue. More than 60 percent of the center's original $187 million cost came from federal and state economic development funds.

HEADLINE: But Have We Learned Enough?

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to President Bush and advised Mitt Romney in his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
LIKE most economists, those at the International Monetary Fund are lowering their growth forecasts. The financial turmoil gripping Wall Street will probably spill over onto every other street in America. Most likely, current job losses are only the tip of an ugly iceberg.
 But when Olivier Blanchard, the I.M.F.'s chief economist, was asked about the possibility of the world sinking into another Great Depression, he reassuringly replied that the chance was ''nearly nil.'' He added, ''We've learned a few things in 80 years.'' 
 Yes, we have. But have we learned what caused the Depression of the 1930s? Most important, have we learned enough to avoid doing the same thing again?
 The Depression began, to a large extent, as a garden-variety downturn. The 1920s were a boom decade, and as it came to a close the Federal Reserve tried to rein in what might have been called the irrational exuberance of the era. 
 In 1928, the Fed maneuvered to drive up interest rates. So interest-sensitive sectors like construction slowed.
 But things took a bad turn after the crash of October 1929. Lower stock prices made households poorer and discouraged consumer spending, which then made up three-quarters of the economy. (Today it's about two-thirds.) 
 According to the economic historian Christina D. Romer, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, the great volatility of stock prices at the time also increased consumers' feelings of uncertainty, inducing them to put off purchases until the uncertainty was resolved. Spending on consumer durable goods like autos dropped precipitously in 1930. 
 Next came a series of bank panics. From 1930 to 1933, more than 9,000 banks were shuttered, imposing losses on depositors and shareholders of about $2.5 billion. As a share of the economy, that would be the equivalent of $340 billion today. 
 The banking panics put downward pressure on economic activity in two ways. First, they put fear into the hearts of depositors. Many people concluded that cash in their mattresses was wiser than accounts at local banks.
 As they withdrew their funds, the banking system's normal lending and money creation went into reverse. The money supply collapsed, resulting in a 24 percent drop in the consumer price index from 1929 to 1933. This deflation pushed up the real burden of households' debts.
 Second, the disappearance of so many banks made credit hard to come by. Small businesses often rely on established relationships with local bankers when they need loans, either to tide them over in tough times or for business expansion. With so many of those relationships interrupted at the same time, the economy's ability to channel financial resources toward their best use was seriously impaired.
 Together, these forces proved cataclysmic. Unemployment, which had been 3 percent in 1929, rose to 25 percent in 1933. Even during the worst recession since then, in 1982, the United States economy did not experience half that level of unemployment.
 Policy makers in the 1930s responded vigorously as the situation deteriorated. But like a doctor facing a patient with a new disease and strange symptoms, they often acted in ways that, with the benefit of hindsight, appeared counterproductive.
 Probably the most important source of recovery after 1933 was monetary expansion, eased by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision to abandon the gold standard and devalue the dollar. From 1933 to 1937, the money supply rose, stopping the deflation. Production in the economy grew about 10 percent a year, three times its normal rate.
 Less successful were various market interventions. According to a study by the economists Harold L. Cole and Lee E. Ohanian, both of the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, President Roosevelt made things worse when he encouraged the formation of cartels through the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. Similarly, they argue, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 strengthened organized labor but weakened the recovery by impeding market forces. 
 LOOKING back at these events, it's hard to avoid seeing parallels to the current situation. Today, as then, uncertainty has consumers spooked. By some measures, stock market volatility in recent days has reached levels not seen since the 1930s. With volatility spiking, the University of Michigan's survey reading of consumer sentiment has been plunging.
 Deflation across the economy is not a problem (yet), but deflation in the housing market is the source of many of our present difficulties. With so many homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their houses are worth, default is an unfortunate but often rational choice. Widespread foreclosures, however, only perpetuate the downward spiral of housing prices, further defaults and additional losses at financial institutions. 
 The Fed and the Treasury Department, intent on avoiding the early policy inaction that let the Depression unfold, have been working hard to keep credit flowing. But the financial situation they face is, arguably, more difficult than that of the 1930s. Then, the problem was largely a crisis of confidence and a shortage of liquidity. Today, the problem may be more a shortage of solvency, which is harder to solve.
 What's next? Perhaps the most troubling study of the 1930s economy was written in 1988 by the economists Kathryn Dominguez, Ray Fair and Matthew Shapiro; it was called ''Forecasting the Depression: Harvard Versus Yale.'' (Mr. Fair is an economics professor at Yale; Ms. Dominguez and Mr. Shapiro are at the University of Michigan.)
 The three researchers show that the leading economists at the time, at competing forecasting services run by Harvard and Yale, were caught completely by surprise by the severity and length of the Great Depression. What's worse, despite many advances in the tools of economic analysis, modern economists armed with the data from the time would not have forecast much better. In other words, even if another Depression were around the corner, you shouldn't expect much advance warning from the economics profession.
 Let me be clear: Like Mr. Blanchard at the I.M.F., I am not predicting another Great Depression. We have indeed learned a lot over the last 80 years. But you should take that economic forecast, like all others, with more than a single grain of salt.

HEADLINE: THE BARNYARD STRATEGIST

BYLINE: By MAGGIE JONES

 BODY:
Not long ago, I stood outside a closed-down slaughterhouse in Chino, Calif., with Wayne Pacelle, the first vegan to become president of the Humane Society of the United States -- he hasn't put butter on his rolls or poured milk in his cereal since he was a 19-year-old Yale undergrad. He tugged on the locked front gates of the slaughterhouse and called out to a security guard who sat unresponsive behind mirrored sunglasses in a small hut. Then, walking along the perimeter of the plant, Pacelle discovered a low brick wall, and he and I climbed on top. From there we could see the open-air section of the plant and its acres of quiet concrete. The trucks that once arrived at all hours of the morning and night, loaded with cows, were long gone. The pens that held the cows as they awaited U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection were empty. The slaughter chute that once moved about 500 cattle a day into the ''kill box'' sat motionless. 
 It was an animal rights advocate's dream: Pacelle and his organization had shuttered this $100 million plant, the Westland/Hallmark Meat Company, with the help of an undercover investigator wearing a hidden video camera with a lens the size of the tip of a pen. Over six weeks last year, the investigator -- a vegan who brought soy-riblet sandwiches for lunch -- filmed workers using chains to drag cows too sick or too injured to stand. The workers jabbed cows with electrical prods and rolled them with a forklift to get them onto their feet and into the slaughter chute. In addition to being excessively cruel, it was a risk to human health: cows too sick or injured to walk are more vulnerable to E. coli, mad cow and other diseases.
 After the Humane Society released the video to the San Bernardino County district attorney, the story made national news. Within weeks, the local district attorney filed charges of animal cruelty against workers at Westland/Hallmark. And the U.S.D.A. ordered the largest beef recall in U.S. history. 
 Pacelle, who is 43, tall and telegenic, has thick black hair that always seems to stay in place. For many years he was the chief lobbyist for the Humane Society before becoming its C.E.O. and president, and he exudes as much passion for the tactics and politics of the animal-welfare movement as he does for the animals themselves. Sending an investigator to the Chino slaughterhouse was one of Pacelle's first steps in a campaign to raise public awareness about animal cruelty in industrial farming -- and to garner support for Proposition 2, a sweeping California ballot initiative designed to improve the lives of millions of farm animals.
 Proposition 2, co-sponsored by the Humane Society and Farm Sanctuary, the biggest farm-animal-rights group in the United States, focuses on what are considered the worst animal-confinement systems in factory farms. The ballot initiative, which voters will decide on Nov. 4, requires that by 2015 farm animals be able to stand up, lie down, turn around and fully extend their limbs. In effect that translates into a ban on the two-foot-wide crates that tightly confine pregnant pigs and calves raised for veal -- a space so small that they can't turn around. And it would eliminate so-called battery cages where four or more hens share a space about the size of a file drawer. 
 Peter Singer, a professor of bioethics at Princeton University and a leading figure in the animal rights movement, compares Proposition 2 to Barack Obama's presidential campaign, calling Proposition 2 the ''other historic ballot this November.'' If it passes, it would affect more animals -- almost 20 million -- than any ballot measure has in U.S. history. 
 Because California is the largest agriculture state in the country, and often a trend-setter on social issues, the ballot is a bellwether for farm-animal-welfare reform nationwide. Many experts predict that if Proposition 2 becomes law it will create a ripple effect, putting pressure on other states to pass similar reforms and pushing major food corporations to go crate-free and cage-free. 
 Proposition 2 also marks a seminal moment for Pacelle, who, since he became the head of the Humane Society four years ago, has transformed America's largest animal-welfare group -- long known as a kindly protector of the nation's dogs and cats -- into an organization he likens to a National Rifle Association for the animal movement: a savvy, unapologetically aggressive political player. He has amped up his 10.3-million-member organization by merging with several smaller animal-welfare groups, cherry-picking some of their top leaders and boosting his budget from $75 million to $127 million, making the Humane Society the richest and most powerful animal-welfare group in the country, with its own in-house investigation, litigation and campaign teams. 
 And though his organization still does plenty for cats and dogs, Pacelle has made farm animals a top priority over the past four years. ''Nine billion animals are killed for food every year, and most of them are confined in intensive conditions,'' he told his staff members not long after he was appointed president of the organization in 2004. ''It is the greatest abuse of animals that occurs on this planet.'' 
 The question, as Pacelle sees it, is how to create change when Big Agriculture, with its big money, has made it nearly impossible to get meaningful farm-animal-welfare legislation passed. Here the ballot-initiative process is crucial, since it offers an end run around legislators by taking issues directly to voters. Another key element in Pacelle's strategy has been to create ballot measures that offer only modest reforms on which both vegans and hamburger lovers (at least many of them) can agree. That tactic, however, has earned Pacelle his share of critics, including some who claim that while the ballot initiatives may seem moderate, they are just a first step in a vegan agenda to dictate what Americans eat. On the other side, extreme vegan groups say Pacelle has sold out, giving carnivores a reason to feel virtuous about eating ''happy meat.'' Pacelle counters that he can't please everybody: ''Part of my job is to challenge certain orthodoxies. For people who want a vegan revolution -- that's too passive for me.'' 
 Instead, Pacelle says he can see the potential to influence millions of animal lovers by pushing them to expand their concerns, moving beyond the cuddly dogs and cats -- and the baby seals and dolphins -- that capture Americans' attention to include the billions of less-visible and far-less- romanticized pigs, cows and chickens raised for food every year. 
 A recently released commercial for Proposition 2 tries to help voters make that leap. It shows footage of dirty chickens being shoved into cages, a frightened-looking calf pulling against a tether in its crate and a pig biting on metal bars. The ad juxtaposes these images with that of a dog sitting on the grass in the sunshine, soaking up the attention of a veterinarian who strokes his fur: ''We wouldn't force our pets to live in cramped cages for their whole lives,'' Kate Hurley, the vet, tells the viewer. ''And farm animals should not suffer this misery either. All animals, including those raised for food, deserve humane treatment.''
 The ad's argument is, as Pacelle sees it, a logical extension of the animal-welfare ethic. ''Cruelty is cruelty,'' he says, ''and it's been our assumption that if decent people see images of these farm animals suffering, they will have a similar reaction.'' And in a generation or two, he argues, we will have made a mental shift. People will look back on these confinement systems and other standardized farm-animal abuses and wonder why we tolerated them for so long. 
 In the 1980s and '90s, as the animal rights movement flourished in the United States, advocates became known for their eye-catching antics. They sprayed red paint on people wearing fur. They flung a dead raccoon on the Vogue editor Anna Wintour's lunch plate at the Four Seasons. For years, PETA supporters have protested at KFC and other fast-food chains dressed as bloodied chickens or pigs, with phrases like ''Kentucky Fried Cruelty'' written across their chests. PETA's tactics have had an impact on consumer awareness, as well as on food-corporation policies. But often PETA's influence has come at the expense of alienating segments of the public who view the movement as abrasive and dogmatic. 
 ''Any social movement evolves,'' says Pacelle, who, as a college student in the '80s, founded the Student Animal Rights Coalition and demonstrated against fur stores. ''It was a different era then, and we all need to adapt.'' One way that Pacelle adapted was by changing his terminology: he now prefers the term ''animal protection'' to ''animal rights,'' which he says is laden with ''a lot of baggage.'' The implication of the animal rights rhetoric is that animals have ''an intrinsic right,'' he says. ''But it's really about human behavior and the responsibility we have toward animals.'' 
 That more-palatable mainstream message, coupled with the Humane Society's political power, is what the animal rights movement in America has needed for a long time, argues Singer, the Princeton bioethicist. While countries in the European Union have banned pig and veal crates and battery cages, or are in the process of doing so, some observers have speculated that Americans simply care less about animals. ''I don't think that's true,'' Singer says. ''In the United States, the movement's demands were simply too far-reaching for politicians to meet. We can't say we're going to legislate against eating meat.'' 
 Pacelle isn't alone in shifting his tone and tactics. Gene Baur, a founder of Farm Sanctuary, started his organization by selling vegetarian hot dogs from his VW van at Grateful Dead concerts, a story he tells in his recent book, ''Farm Sanctuary.'' Today, 20 years later, with a $5 million organization that has 200,000 members, Baur still uses terms like ''animal rights'' and proudly promotes veganism. But over time, he says, ''we've learned to present things in a way that resonates with the public. We're still telling it like it is. But we're less strident. We don't say, 'It's wrong and you shouldn't do it.' ''
 Even PETA doesn't always aim to shock. PETA's vice-president, Bruce Friedrich, says that the group's members are actively canvassing in support of Proposition 2 but that they won't be doing any media-grabbing protests. ''When you're working on passing legislation,'' Friedrich says, ''showing up with naked activists and bullhorns isn't ever going to be the right way of moving forward.''
 Industrial farming is increasingly on American's minds. In the last decade, the best-selling book ''Fast Food Nation,'' by Eric Schlosser, was followed by ''The Omnivore's Dilemma,'' by Michael Pollan. These books tap into animal-welfare concerns as well as the increasing preoccupation with where our milk, beef and eggs come from. Are they organic? Hormone-free? Locally grown? Humanely treated? Cage-free? 
 Stressing the link between the inhumane treatment of animals and the health risks of factory farming is one way the Humane Society is creating a political constituency big enough to include virtually anyone who worries about food, animals, the environment and the changing face of rural America. The campaign highlights those themes in its advertisements, on its Web site, in the dozens of talks the campaign staff members give around California and in the 500,000 fliers that Proposition 2 volunteers have distributed over the past several weeks at Whole Foods, farmers' markets, universities, dog parks, community festivals and churches. ''You can no longer write off this movement as a bunch of lunatics,'' says Jennifer Fearing, the campaign manager for Proposition 2 and the chief economist for the Humane Society. ''We desperately want to redefine what it means to be an advocate for animals.'' 
 Fearing's own story certainly is not one you usually associate with animal activism. Growing up, she was very active in her church and as a teenager was the president of the Christian singer Amy Grant's fan club. In college she interned for President George H. W. Bush's economic- and domestic-policy adviser, Roger Porter, before earning a public-policy degree from the Kennedy School at Harvard. She voted for each Bush president and is now registered as an independent. Pacelle would kill her, she said jokingly, if she became a Democrat; the campaign's nonpartisan message is central to the Humane Society's new efforts.
 And not only in California. For a previous Humane Society-sponsored ballot initiative in Arizona, to ban pig and veal crates, Pacelle enlisted the highly controversial Republican sheriff Joe Arpaio, who bills himself as ''America's toughest sheriff,'' to sell the idea. In a TV ad for the ballot initiative, Arpaio stood by his kitchen stove. ''I enjoy a good pork chop,'' he said. ''But I believe animals raised for food deserve humane treatment.'' The proposition passed with 62 percent of the vote. 
 Fearing isn't appearing in any TV ads, and she doesn't eat pork chops; she's a vegan. But she says that, for her, one of the most significant of the long list of Proposition 2 endorsers -- which includes the Center for Food Safety, the Consumer Federation of America, United Farm Workers, the California Veterinary Medical Association, Jane Goodall, Robert Redford, Wolfgang Puck, among hundreds of others -- is Matthew Scully, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, who also wrote Sarah Palin's convention speech. Scully is the author of the book ''Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals and the Call to Mercy.'' For Fearing, Scully helped her put inchoate thoughts about being an animal activist into words. Scully doesn't argue for animal rights but for humans to show mercy. ''One doesn't have to pull them from their place and demand perfect equality to care for them,'' he writes of animals in one of Fearing's favorite passages in his book, ''to refrain wherever possible from harming them, as only man the rational and moral creature can do.'' 
 Framing the animal-welfare movement in terms of compassion and morality has helped cultivate support from a broad spectrum of religious leaders. The campaign has received endorsements from the president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif., and other religious leaders throughout the state. ''Most denominations have statements on animals and ethics,'' says Christine Gutleben, the director of the Humane Society's program on animals and religion. ''We have a shared agenda here. Religious people are looking for ways to integrate their spiritual life with their daily life. There's this sense that animals were created and designed by God with wings to fly, feet to walk with, hooves to dig with, and by prohibiting them to engage in these natural behaviors we force them to live in contradiction with what they were born with.'' 
 Every one of these constituencies -- the foodies, the Republicans, the churchgoers -- was a potential audience for the Humane Society campaign's first official Proposition 2 video, released on YouTube in late September. The video didn't have the shock value of the PETA video called ''Meet Your Meat,'' which shows the grisly inner workings of slaughterhouses and other factory-farming operations. By contrast, the Humane Society's brightly colored animated video features a Babe-like pig singing Proposition 2-related lyrics to the Stevie Wonder song ''Superstition'' and dancing through barns, releasing pigs, chickens and calves from their cages. It's the kind of short video you could forward, without worrying about its appropriateness, to your grandmother, to your P.T.A. president, to your congregation, to anyone under the redefined big tent of farm-animal welfare.
 Though the Humane Society's videos and TV ads feature many pigs and cows, in reality the battle in California is all about chickens. The veal and pig industries are almost nonexistent in the state. The Humane Society included the ban on pig and cow crates in Proposition 2 largely as a preventive measure: each state that prohibits those confinement systems is one more place where producers with crates can't set up shop. And it sends yet another message to food corporations that their policies may be out of step with consumers' values. 
 But Julie Buckner, the spokeswoman for Californians for Safe Food, a coalition of groups opposed to Proposition 2, sees the issue differently. All those pigs and cows in the TV ads, in the YouTube video and in other campaign materials, are there, she says, to manipulate our emotions. ''We all care about humane treatment of animals,'' she says. ''But I care more about my kids' health and safety,'' she adds, referring to concerns some people have that cage-free eggs carry a greater risk of salmonella. Such health worries, though, haven't been borne out by the experiences of cage-free operations in the United States and Europe. Instead, the argument that has had the most traction with many editorial boards and consumer groups, particularly in this economy, is that the initiative risks putting out of business California's $330 million egg industry, in which more than 90 percent of eggs are from battery-cage operations. That explains, too, why the opposition's campaign, which has drawn millions of dollars from the egg industry (in California and out of state), has endorsements from some taxpayer groups, labor unions and senior-citizen associations. 
 Ryan Armstrong, an egg producer in Valley Center, Calif., says Proposition 2 would be the end of his three-generation family business. Not only would it be too expensive to convert to new hen housing, he says; if he were to go cage-free, he also wouldn't be able to compete against lower-priced battery-cage eggs trucked in from other states and from Mexico. ''This is the cheapest, healthiest way to make eggs,'' he says. ''Do we want chickens to flap their wings? Or do we want to eat?''
 There's no consensus on what the cost to consumers will be if Proposition 2 passes, although both sides agree that there will be a price increase. Proponents of Proposition 2 estimate an increase of 12 cents per dozen; opponents have claimed that prices could double. In fact, no one really knows the additional cost because the price of eggs is, in part, dependent on whether other states follow California's lead and on how much the demand for cage-free eggs, currently about 5 percent of the market, increases in the future. 
 Certainly cage-free eggs have a growing cachet not only among Whole Foods shoppers but also among other consumers, in part because of the Humane Society's efforts, as well as PETA's, to encourage supermarkets and major food corporations to go cage-free. And while Proposition 2 doesn't mandate a particular kind of housing, the ballot's wording -- which says chickens must be able to spread their wings without touching the sides of a cage -- essentially translates into cage-free housing. 
 That doesn't mean that California chickens will live like the chickens in the final scene of a Proposition 2 commercial, in which a handful of them peck and strut in the grass of an idyllic farm. ''Free-range'' chickens have access to outdoors -- though that may be only a slab of concrete -- while cage-free hens live in henhouses and usually never go outside. And depending on the producer, the henhouse may be a comparatively roomy, modern system with plenty of space and sunlight. Or not. The worst-run operations are dirty, dark barns crammed with thousands of chickens that never see daylight.
 ''I'd rather have seen something in the language that provided for nesting and perching,'' says Adele Douglass, the executive director of Humane Farm Animal Care, a voluntary certification program for cage-free farmers and other agriculture producers that requires minimum standards for ventilation, space, perches and nesting boxes, among other things. Pacelle says he would have liked to include all that -- and more. But as with everything in his approach, Pacelle walks a fine line between pushing for increased welfare and fending off opponents who would claim the Humane Society is legislating luxury housing for chickens. Pacelle says he hopes that Proposition 2 will create pressure on the egg industry to reform its standards and push corporations to seek cage-free eggs from the most humane suppliers. ''Cage-free is not cruelty-free,'' Paul Shapiro, the Humane Society's senior director of its factory-farming campaign, acknowledges. ''But social movements are about incremental change. This is a step in the right direction.''
 Or it's the wrong direction, if you ask some vegan activists who are not endorsing Proposition 2. ''We agree with an incremental approach, but if you give animals more space and a little sunshine and you take that to that logical progression, they are still raised for food,'' says Alex Hershaft, president of the 27-year-old organization FARM, the Farm Animal Rights Movement. Instead, animal rights groups, he argues, should focus on getting people to incrementally reduce -- and eventually eliminate -- meat altogether.
 Still, though Hershaft won't endorse Proposition 2 on principle, he says he hopes it passes, because it will reduce animal suffering. Other critics take a harder line. Gary L. Francione, a professor at the Rutgers University School of Law and an animal rights scholar, has written that if Proposition 2 passes, ''animals will continue to be tortured; the only difference will be that the torture will carry the stamp of approval from the Humane Society, Farm Sanctuary and other animal-welfare corporations that are promoting Proposition 2.'' He urges animal rights activists to either abstain from voting or to vote no. 
 State ballot measures were never the Humane Society's first choice of strategy for improving the lives of chickens and pigs. But few federal laws apply to farm animals, and the ones that do are mostly related to slaughter and transportation -- not to the treatment of animals while they live on the farm. And when state legislatures were unwilling or unable to pass laws on farm-animal welfare, one option was to go around them. 
 Throughout the 1990s, Gene Baur of Farm Sanctuary watched Pacelle win ballot propositions banning cockfighting and some forms of hunting and trapping. In 2000, he and Pacelle agreed they were ready to introduce ballot measures for farm animals. For the site of their first attempt, they chose Florida, which offered several advantages. The state had a pig industry but one that was not too formidable. Also, Florida is ''not like Wyoming and North Dakota,'' Pacelle explains, ''where there is a more utilitarian attitude toward animals.'' Instead, the state had several key urban areas where large groups of animal lovers could be expected to support the bill. In November 2002, the country's first ban on gestation crates passed with 55 percent of the vote. A few years later, in Arizona, the two organizations introduced the first ballot initiative to prohibit pig and veal crates -- with Sheriff Arpaio as a spokesman -- and won by a wide margin. Just as important, the two groups established a record of success that they could show to their memberships, to other states and to corporations. 
 In fact, companies and other states did seem to be paying attention. Only three months after the Arizona vote, SmithfieldFoods, the largest U.S. pork producer, announced that it was phasing out gestation crates, replacing them with group housing that would allow the sows more room to move. Smithfield insisted it was not bowing to activist or voter pressure but rather complying with requests from McDonald's and supermarket chains. Yet the significance of the timing, coming on the heels of the Humane Society's second win, was hard to dismiss. Less than one week after Smithfield's announcement, Maple Leaf Foods, the largest pork producer in Canada, announced that it, too, was phasing out gestation crates. 
 Around the same time, the Humane Society was getting ready for its next ballot initiative -- this one in Colorado. The organization had just filed paperwork with the state when Pacelle met Gov. Bill Ritter at a fund-raiser. Ritter said he wanted to avoid a divisive battle in his state. Then Bernard Rollin, a renowned animal-welfare expert and a professor of philosophy at Colorado State University, stepped in with others to help broker a deal between Pacelle and cattlemen and other agriculture interests. ''Wayne was sensitive to being educated about the cattlemen's perspective,'' says Rollin, who also served on the nonpartisan Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, which this year issued a major report recommending, among other things, a 10-year phase-out of crates and battery cages. ''I respect his ability to work in the real world.''
 On his end, Pacelle agreed to drop a provision -- at least for now -- to phase out battery cages. In exchange, in May Ritter signed into law a phase-out on crates for pigs and calves. The deal gave both the state government and agriculture interests a public-relations boost. For Pacelle, it helped solidify his reputation as someone willing not only to fight but, under the right circumstances, to negotiate too. 
 The undercover operation at the slaughterhouse in Chino was the most significant investigation in the Humane Society's history. It prompted the largest U.S. beef recall ever, the prosecution of workers, the shutting down of the plant and the closing of a loophole in a law that bans cows that are too sick or injured to stand from entering the food supply. But the undercover investigation also set up one of the Humane Society's major campaign themes: Whom do you trust? The organization that protects cats and dogs and dairy cows headed to slaughter? Or industrial farming, which brought you tainted meat slated for your kids' hamburgers?
 Chino was also a shot across the bow to the egg industry about how hard the Humane Society would fight over the coming months. Since last summer, the campaign has relentlessly and ruthlessly played offense, setting in motion more than a dozen legal actions against egg producers and the industry. One lawsuit took aim at the American Egg Board, a commodity program linked to the Department of Agriculture, for its plan to spend up to $3 million of public money for an advertising campaign that the Humane Society said was anti-Proposition 2. A judge agreed with the Humane Society and barred the American Egg Board from using the money to advertise during the campaign. Then, in early October, the Humane Society went after Ryan Armstrong, the egg farmer I interviewed. Like other targets of the Humane Society's litigation team, Armstrong was a contributor to the opposition campaign. What's more, he also offered tours of his farms to California reporters to show that cage operations were clean, efficient and humane.
 But the Humane Society claims that they are not, in fact, so clean. In a press release this month, the Humane Society said one of Armstrong's operations repeatedly discharged contaminated water into neighbors' properties, and the organization was petitioning the San Diego County water board to take action against the business. (Armstrong insists he is now in compliance with county inspectors.) ''It's all fair game,'' Jennifer Fearing said when I asked her if the Humane Society had purposefully gone after Armstrong because he held himself out as a spokesman for battery-cage egg farmers. ''He put a bull's-eye on himself. He tells everyone, 'Hey, I run a great farm.' Well, does he?'' 
 The battles with Armstrong and other producers are part of the Humane Society's continuing attempt to signal publicly how costly these ballot initiatives can be for agriculture industries -- in terms of money and public relations. ''Producers don't want to spend this kind of money fighting us every time we come into a state,'' Pacelle says. ''Wouldn't they rather negotiate and spend that money re-engineering their facilities and getting that much ahead of the game? Then they get to be heroes.'' 
 When I spoke with Pacelle with three weeks to go before the election and the latest poll showing Proposition 2 passing by a wide margin, Pacelle sounded confident. But in a way, win or lose, he already had a victory in hand. Proposition 2 had helped push his overall message about farm-animal welfare well beyond California. In late September, the comedian Ellen DeGeneres -- who held a fund-raiser that brought in $1 million for Proposition 2 -- had Pacelle on her show to talk about the ballot initiative. Then, in mid-October, Oprah Winfrey devoted an entire show to Proposition 2, with Pacelle and members of the opposition as guests. Instead of baby seals and whales as the darling cause of two of TV's most popular daytime shows, it was America's pigs, calves and chickens. 
 In the midst of all these events was Pacelle, wearing a well-tailored suit, serving as the articulate ambassador for these animals. He hadn't single-handedly created the cultural momentum around farm animals, but he was giving it a presentable form, pushing the movement out of the fringe and into the mainstream. And not insignificant, of course, was the fact that he was doing it with considerable muscle. ''We aren't a bunch of little old ladies in tennis shoes,'' Pacelle says, paraphrasing his mentor Cleveland Amory, an animal rights activist. ''We have cleats on.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Infant Mortality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''29th on Infant Mortality'' (editorial, Oct. 19):
 You note the high and increasing infant mortality rate in the United States but might be more precise about some of its causes. Merely answer the following questions: 
 How many million Americans have no health insurance because they have no money, or although well employed are refused by cherry-picking insurance companies? How many physicians refuse to treat patients on Medicaid? How many illegal immigrants fear to seek medical assistance, seek it only when in extremis or try to reach their country of origin for free, less expensive and even better care than the United States affords?
 What group believes that veterans' hospitals represent socialism and since the time of Ronald Reagan chronically underfinances what it cannot openly destroy? 
 Which ideologues regard public health insurance itself as socialist? Who has been misgoverning for the last eight years?
 Robert D. Cromey Richmond, Va., Oct. 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''Infant Deaths Fall in U.S., Though Rate Is Still High'' (news article, Oct. 16) was much too narrow in discussing the causes. In light of the nation's economic crisis, and the escalating racial tension during this presidential campaign, I hope that you will expand your reporting on infant mortality beyond concerns about the nation's health care.
 Here in the Seattle-King County area, for example, American Indian/Alaska Native babies die at a rate three times higher than whites, Asians and Hispanics. This despite the tireless work of urban Indian organizations and local agencies. 
 The cause? Chronic stress, which American Indian/Alaska Native mothers in our region suffer at rates five times higher than the others. 
 What types of chronic stress? A Health Department study cites racism, homelessness, addiction, isolation and violence, among other causes.
 Until we understand the issues of our most vulnerable people, we will fail to help this nation's babies survive.

HEADLINE: Former Student Radical in Runoff for Mayor of Rio

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
In September 1969, Fernando Gabeira helped kidnap the American ambassador to Brazil to protest the military government's oppressive dictatorship here. On Sunday, he could become this city's next mayor.
 In the nearly four decades since that episode catapulted Mr. Gabeira into Brazilian history, the former student militant, now 67, has become a respected writer, congressman and symbol of the left here -- although a photo of him wearing a woman's bikini bottom also made him a sex symbol of sorts.
 Now the slender, soft-spoken former guerrilla has a chance to help chart the future of a city that many say is crying out for radical redefinition after decades of steadily losing its place as a diplomatic and business hub in Brazil.
 Heading into a runoff here, Mr. Gabeira was running in polls last week only slightly behind Eduardo Paes, a 38-year-old congressman allied with Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president. 
 Just a month ago, few political analysts gave Mr. Gabeira much of a chance. But a campaign backed by many of Rio's wealthy businessmen and intellectual elites has helped him make a surprising surge in recent weeks.
 Powerful men like Eike Batista, the billionaire mining magnate, have thrown their support behind Mr. Gabeira. Even Valerie Elbrick, the daughter of the late Ambassador C. Burke Elbrick, whom Mr. Gabeira helped kidnap, supports his campaign. She says she forgave him long ago for the kidnapping.
 ''He is a charming man, and if I were not working for Obama I would probably be working for Gabeira,'' Mrs. Elbrick said by phone from Washington on Friday. If he wins, she said, ''it's going to be a huge task with the scale of the problems in Rio.''
 ''But he has taken on huge tasks before, and I have confidence in him,'' she added.
 What Mr. Gabeira lacks in administrative experience, his supporters say, he makes up for with a remarkably even temperament and a reputation for clearly stating his positions, which include legalizing marijuana, abortion and gay marriage.
 Mr. Gabeira has been engaged with a wide-ranging group of Rio residents who are debating the future of a city that has become best known for its beaches, violent crime and bacchanalian street carnivals.
 ''Rio is a city that needs inspired leadership, someone that that can really help us reinvent ourselves,'' said Amaury de Souza, a political analyst who heads MCM Consultants here. ''Gabeira is modern, someone that is completely attuned to present times.''
 In the last half-century, Rio has suffered one disappointment after another. In 1960 it lost its place as the country's capital and federal district when Brasilia was built. Then the military merged the city with the adjoining state of Rio de Janeiro, forcing the city almost overnight to share its tax base with a much larger and far poorer entity.
 Today the city of six million people still has about the same average income per person that it did in the 1970s, adjusted for inflation, even as outlying areas of the state have become wealthier, Mr. de Souza said.
 Several economic blows took a further toll on the city's importance. Rio's major banks and many of its industries left the city in the past two decades, most going to Sao Paulo. A trading scandal forced Rio's stock exchange to merge its meager assets with Sao Paulo's Bovespa in 1989. Today the Bovespa is the largest stock exchange in Latin America.
 The feeling in Rio is not dissimilar to the feeling that existed in Bogota, Colombia, some 15 years ago when that city was crying out for bold change. A series of mayors there, including Enrique Penalosa, helped lower crime and redefine the urban landscape by restricting automobile use and creating grand public spaces.
 In Rio, many would-be reformers are betting on Mr. Gabeira to turn around a city where he made headlines as a 28-year-old guerrilla fighter.
 He was among four men with pistols who kidnapped Mr. Elbrick on Sept. 4, 1969, threatening to kill him if the Brazilian government did not release 15 political prisoners and fly them into exile. Brazil's military leaders met the demands after a tense four-day standoff.
 ''I don't condone the methods,'' said Mrs. Elbrick, 66. ''But they were idealistic people. My father realized he wasn't dealing with thugs. These were intelligent young men who were at heart peaceful people.''
 It is not clear how the kidnapping would affect Mr. Gabeira's ability to obtain a visa to enter the United States were he to be elected mayor. A State Department spokeswoman did not return calls Friday seeking clarification.
 Mr. Gabeira was later captured, tortured, convicted and incarcerated by the military dictatorship. In June 1970, he was expelled from Brazil as part of a prisoner swap for the kidnapped German ambassador, and for 10 years he lived in exile in Algeria, Cuba, Chile, Sweden and Italy. 
 He wrote a memoir about the kidnapping that was the basis of a 1997 movie, ''Four Days in September,'' starring Alan Arkin as Ambassador Elbrick. It was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language film. 
 When Mr. Gabeira returned to Brazil in 1979 he made headlines again when a photo was published of him on Ipanema Beach in an itsy-bitsy bathing suit. Years later he said it was the bottom part of a bikini belonging to his cousin, Leda Nagle, a Brazilian television hostess.
 His experience in Western Europe shaped many of the political ideas he brought back to Brazil. He helped found the Green Party in Brazil and was an early promoter of ecological awareness in a country that had long considered environmental protection a luxury of more developed nations.
 His political career initially stalled when he ran unsuccessfully for governor of Rio State in 1986. After the defeat, he focused on his journalism career, serving as a foreign correspondent in Germany in the early 1990s.
 In 1994, he was elected to Congress, running as a Green on an ''ecological and economical'' campaign; he used recycled paper in his pamphlets and sought votes while riding a bicycle affixed with a microphone and speakers. 
 Despite his recent climb in the polls, victory is still not a given in the mayoral race. Mr. Gabeira remains a polarizing figure, and in particular he is unpopular with evangelicals because of his positions on drugs, homosexuality and abortion. In a debate with Mr. Paes this month, both men said they had smoked marijuana; Mr. Paes said he did not like it.
 Beyond those cultural flashpoints, neither man has proposed any bold, sweeping initiatives. Mr. Gabeira has said he would light streets better to try to reduce crime, and Mr. Paes has said he would seek more state funds for city projects. But Mr. Gabeira, especially, has repeatedly said he would not make big promises.
 ''Neither of them has any administrative experience to speak of,'' Mr. de Souza said. ''But that is not what voters are asking for. They want something new and fresh to be done to the city of Rio. He who embodies that kind of message will win the election.''

HEADLINE: A Label for A Pleather Economy

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
IN an economic climate in which buying a handbag with a four- or five-digit price tag is starting to seem gauche, the free-spending style hounds formerly known as ''fashionistas'' are rebranding themselves.
 Consider the $1,235 patent-leather satchel with golden hardware designed by Anya Hindmarch.
 Mary Hall, a marketing manager at I.B.M. in Redondo Beach, Calif., heard its siren call. Then she went to Target to purchase a similarly shiny purse, made out of polyvinyl chloride, by the same designer. Price: $49.99.
 ''In the current economy, I thought I would reform,'' Ms. Hall said. 
 Welcome to ''recession chic'' and its personification, the ''recessionista,'' the new name for the style maven on a budget. That the word represents the times could explain why Sarah Palin's new wardrobe ($75,000 at Neiman Marcus and nearly $50,000 at Saks) struck some as distasteful.
 Ms. Hall, who first read the term in newspapers and on Web sites like Jezebel.com, even started a blog to chronicle her cheap and chic choices: therecessionista.blogspot.com. 
 In part, the word reflects the efforts of fashion and beauty publicists to spin the economic downturn as an attractive retail trend. For instance, Bourjois, a moderately priced makeup line from France, sent a recent press release by e-mail to reporters promoting the brand's cheapest mascara and lip glosses as ''the Recessionista Collection,'' an antidote to gloom. An e-mail message sent last week on behalf of Salon Eliut Rivera in Manhattan promoted ''Recessionista Beauty,'' offering discounts on haircuts and eyebrow shaping.
 The use of the word recessionista is ''making light of a situation that isn't so favorable for the consumer-driven industries of our nation, spinning it ... and delivering a luring message to the masses -- PR 101 ladies and gentlemen,'' wrote Heather Viggiani on the blog of a public relations firm where she works part-time, www.piercemattiepublicrelations.com.
 Ms. Viggiani, who is also an undergraduate student in advertising and marketing at Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, went on to describe a ''recession chic'' movement in retail. ''A host of discount brands kneel graciously at the feet of recession and position their products and services not only as the smart thing to do, but the posh one.''
 Grant Barrett, a lexicographer who specializes in new words and slang, said the word is being used to give Americans an excuse to buy more stuff. 
 ''It's kind of permitting consumers to have justification for their spending habits,'' he said. Mr. Barrett included ''recessionista'' as an up-and-coming catchphrase earlier this month on his Web site, DoubleTongued.org. ''The idea is, because they are spending less or getting more value, it is still O.K. to shop,'' he said in a recent phone interview. ''It's a very self-serving message.'' 
 ''Recession chic'' is yet another in a long line of terms created by fashion writers who have an affinity for the suffix ''chic'': hippie chic, Seventies chic, tribal chic, military chic, geek chic, Camilla chic, rehab chic, eco chic.
 Back in February, the headline ''Recession Chic'' topped an article in The Times of London by Lisa Armstrong, the newspaper's fashion critic, who noted a return to tailored dressing among businesswomen. In April, the same headline accompanied a piece by Kate Betts in Time magazine that described the new somber collections of fashion designers.
 ''Come fall, fashion will follow the downward spiral of home values and investment portfolios, as designers embrace restraint with a dark palette and severe silhouette,'' Ms. Betts wrote. 
 For recession chic to become a trend, however, the stigma of profligacy associated with shopping for clothing in an uncertain economy would have to be played down. 
 Style.com, the Web site of Vogue magazine, has declared passe the free-spending fashionista of the type lionized in ''Sex and the City.'' In her stead, the Web site fashioned a new icon for the new austerity, a plucky heroine able to fixate on designer logos even at a time when her house might face foreclosure.
 Derek Blasberg wrote this summer on style.com: ''You should know that while the fashionista may have locked herself in the vault with her tiaras, her younger, hipper sister -- recessionista -- is at the mall finding designer threads (or diffusion designer threads) at discount prices. Look for her at Target, Uniqlo, Payless or Kohl's, all of whom have inked deals with designers recently. That's because recessionistas aren't letting a little thing like falling stock prices and rising gas bills get in the way of their wardrobe.''
 The nomenclature may be new. The idea of moving merchandise in a tough climate is not.
 A Sears catalog from 1930 at the beginning of the Great Depression offered ''coats of the new mode in the spirit of smart economy'' priced to sell at $9.75 to $25. Phrases like ''be smart and thrifty'' and ''look at the chic economy'' promoted dresses that cost $4.98 to $8.98.
 In the wake of the stock market crash of 1987, designers began to offer less-expensive second lines. In 1989, for example, Donna Karan introduced DKNY.
 Certainly, the word ''recessionista'' has its roots in economic hardship. Finance executives first used the term to connote a person predicting a recession or a person who believes a recession would benefit the long-term health of the economy, according to lexicographers.
 But, over the last six months, publicists, retailers and even a few consumers have refashioned the word that rhymes with fashionista.
 ''It's a sound-alike word,'' said Paul McFedries, the proprietor of an on-line dictionary of catch-phrases called wordspy.com, which added ''recessionista'' to its lexicon in July. While it may seem inane to make use of a weighty word like ''recession'' to form a playful neologism that embraces shopping, people are using it because it is fun to pronounce, he said. ''If you are a grammar pedant, you are going to lose a lot of the joy of the language.''
 Ms. Hall of therecessionista.blogspot.com said her friends like the word so much they have nicknamed her Recessionista. ''It is more lighthearted to say 'I am the Recessionista, and I don't really go for that,' instead of saying 'I can't afford that or I don't want to spend the money,' '' Ms. Hall said. ''The 'ista' on the end there, it gives it a little touch of the bling, I think.''
 Indeed, ''recessionista'' carries an upbeat tone that recalls an earlier credit crisis neologism: ''staycation,'' a euphemism for spending one's vacation at home. Similar terminology -- ''frugal chic,'' ''recession-proof dressing,'' going on a ''spending fast'' -- with more negative connotations has not caught on among consumers or the fashion world. 
 Mr. McFedries said the word is a more encouraging term than phrases like ''conspicuous austerity'' or ''inconspicuous consumption.''
 Publicists ''want to come up with a word or phrase that makes things seem not as bad as they are,'' Mr. McFedries said.
 He added: ''You've got to put a positive spin on it because you have to get people to spend money when they don't want to on an optional purchase.''
 But recessionista may not be the final incarnation of a style hound on the scent of designer discounts. 
 In the event that the economy worsens, make way for the depressionista.

 GROW MORE POTATOES,
 Food Specialists Urge
 With the price of grains at historically high levels, a number of scientists, nutritionists and aid groups are increasingly convinced that the humble potato should be playing a much larger role in ensuring a steady supply of food in the developing world. And unlike grain prices, which have skyrocketed, potato prices remained stable. PAGE 6
 BOXING OUT OF A CORNER
 A 17-year-old girl whose family fled North Korea for the South has breathed a hint of new life into the sport of boxing by winning a world championship. She is also helping to support her family with her fees, and hopes to parlay her success in the ring into the world of entertainment and become as famous as Laila Ali, the boxing-star daughter of Muhammad Ali. Meanwhile, trainers say developing a knockout punch would be a nice idea, too. PAGE 16 
 THREE DEAD IN KABUL
 The director and deputy of an international courier service were shot dead in central Kabul just outside their office, by one of their security guards, a police official said. The Afghan guard then turned the gun on himself. One police official said the attack was an internal issue, but another said it could be related to terrorism. PAGE 10

 IN WYOMING, AN EFFORT
 To Help the Grieving
 Wyoming law calls for the removal of privately erected highway memorials, but a victim's family can have the state put up a version without cost that can stand for five years. ''It was paramount to let the families know that we understand how important memorializing their loved ones is,'' a state official said. PAGE 21
 AN INAUSPICIOUS FIRST
 At 8.8 percent, Rhode Island now has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, the first time the state has held that distinction in the three decades since such records have been kept. Saul Kaplan, executive director of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, said the situation ''could likely get worse before it gets better,'' adding, ''ironically, we were the home of the Industrial Revolution.''

 Is an N.F.L. Institution
 Brett Favre's telephone chat with Matt Millen (who, it turns out, should have been asking about job hunting) a few weeks ago has created a stir among some fans, but was met largely with a shrug from around the N.F.L. Still, it did pull back the curtain on a widely practiced slice of the football culture that does not just accept the casual trading of information, but encourages it. PAGE 1
 SMOKE, MIRRORS AND NO. 1
 Coach Clint Conque of Central Arkansas called it ''smoke and mirrors'' after losing to Tulsa last month. Others just call it fast -- Tulsa's no-huddle, spread offense aims to put the ball in play in the first 10 seconds of the allotted 40. And Tulsa entered the weekend ranked first in total offense (624.7 yards a game) and scoring (56.6) in the Football Bowl Subdivision. PAGE 11

 TURNING TO FACEBOOK
 To Fill Up the Pews
 Enticing young people to become regular members of a Christian congregation is a major challenge for many church leaders. The tools they use can include concerts, scenes from movies like ''Shallow Hal'' or ''Braveheart'' and profiles or groups on Facebook or Christian networking Web sites, like MyChurch.org. The aim is to tweak all the senses. PAGE 35
 FOCUS ON THE STATE SENATE
 State Senate races have been drawing the attention -- and financial support -- of a number of donors and groups who have backed gay and lesbian causes across the country. One reason is that, with Democrats just two seats away from capturing the majority in the Senate, the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York is seen as a real possibility. PAGE 33
 LOW-COST HIGHER ED
 Parents touring the campus of SUNY Binghamton, the top-rated school in the State University of New York system, are given many reasons to consider it for their children. These days, one pitch in particular can make their ears perk up: cost. The number of applications this fall has risen roughly 50 percent.

 A LOOK AT THE LIFE
 Of the Mother of 'May I?'
 In a new biography on Emily Post, whose name is synonymous with etiquette, Laura Claridge finds that her subject is very much an eat-on-the-run, elbows-on-the-table, feet-on-the-furniture type of lady. She also seemed not to have needed friendship or to have the capacity for it, and seemed completely disengaged from the social cataclysms of her day. PAGE 9

 LEARNING TO INTERJECT 
 At Pundit School 
 Tucker Carlson says being a political commentator is pretty simple: ''Don't wear white, show up sober and try to speak in complete sentences.'' But if one must be a television pundit, it makes sense to be good at it. And so the Leadership Institute and other research groups that offer punditry training help opinionators become more adept at bantering, pivoting and parrying. PAGE 1
 Travel
 A DANGEROUS PAST, 
 A Delicious Present
 Previously, the Colombian port of Cartagena was known for the cocaine trade and its accompanying violence. But where once cargo was measured by the kilo, now the port finds itself the destination of food lovers, with restaurants to justify it. It is a place to sample the delicacies of Colombian food that many have been missing. ''This country is not just about drugs,'' one chef says. ''Soon, it will be about the food.'' Page 10

 Beneath a public park in the village of Erbil in northern Iraq are the remains of a detention center left over from the days of Saddam Hussein. But this predominantly Kurdish part of Iraq has maintained peace during the continued conflict elsewhere. The only noise to disturb the calm is that of construction, not war. The region is working hard to project an image of ''The Other Iraq,'' in the hopes of attracting Western tourists. Page 3

 THEY'RE SHOCKED, SHOCKED ABOUT THE MESS
 While Wall Street was wading into the dangerous territory that was responsible for the current financial crisis, the Securities and Exchange Commission remained silent and the credit rating agencies gave stamps of approval to companies with shaky assets. And so the testimony to Congress by the people who run those institutions about their non-roles in the crisis was hard to swallow. Gretchen Morgenson, Fair Game. PAGE 1
 LEARNING FROM LAST TIME
 A chief economist at the International Monetary Fund said the chances of the world sliding into another Great Depression were nearly nil. But N.

 Who, or what, exactly are the Olsen twins? The two fraternal but identical-looking sisters have acted, but that seems almost a tangential part of their celebrity. Ginia Bellafante writes that what distinguishes the pair from their peers in the tabloids is their resistance to a certain kind of recklessness on the one hand and a decidedly less egomaniacal approach to branding on the other.

 JOHN MCCAIN,

HEADLINE: Scrimping on Medical Care

 BODY:
The economic crisis is exposing further weaknesses in this country's health care system. With family finances strained, many Americans are skimping on medications, physician visits and preventive screening in order to pay other household bills. This could be dangerous to their health and costly for the economy if more Americans lose work time or end up in the hospital. 
 The latest tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one in three Americans say their family has had problems paying medical bills in the past year, and nearly half say someone in their family has skipped pills or postponed medical care because of the cost. Other surveys by insurance groups and health care organizations have had similar findings. 
 For the first time in at least a decade, American consumers are ordering fewer prescription drugs than the year before, according to an analysis by IMS Health, a research firm. Although the decline is modest -- less than 1 percent for the first eight months of this year compared with the same period a year ago -- and several factors may be at play, many experts believe that people in financial difficulty are choosing to forgo medications in order to pay for other necessities.
 Some evidence suggests that many people are cutting back on drugs that fight chronic conditions like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, osteoporosis and diabetes. They will not feel the effects now but could be in for severe illness later. 
 The scrimping underscores the need to provide health insurance with affordable premiums and co-payments for all and to bring down medical costs. In tough times, no one should have to forgo needed health care.

To the Editor:
 I have long been fascinated by Goldman Sachs's ability to convince people that it operates on a higher plane than other firms on Wall Street, as described in ''The Partnership,'' by Charles D. Ellis (Oct. 12). Certainly its financial results have been superior. However, in other respects Goldman's reputation is unjustified. 
 I was an equity research analyst at Goldman from 1986 to 1992. Goldman was the only one of the six investment banks I have worked for that handed me a statement of principles during my first day on the job and then systematically violated them. Partners censored my research for seven years, long before Eliot Spitzer's investigation into biased research during the Internet bubble. In addition, Goldman was not a very pleasant place to work if you were not a partner. As one of my colleagues told me shortly after he had left for another firm, ''It's great to be off the plantation.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Higher Education at Lower Prices

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: BINGHAMTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 As with any campus tour, you get a lot of numbers at SUNY Binghamton, the top-rated school in the State University of New York system.
 There's the average grade-point average for incoming students (93 or 3.5), the number of applications last year (26,500), the acceptance rate (39 percent), where the metropolitan area ranks in safety among the nation's midsize cities (11), and where Kiplinger's Personal Finance ranked the university nationally in terms of value (1).
 But for the slightly shellshocked parents taking the tour on Friday, peering nervously at the daily disaster on the television screens where the tag on CNN read ''Financial Crisis and You,'' chances are the number that made the biggest impression was this one: 16,452.
 Add a dollar sign, and it's the annual tuition, fees, room and board at a time when the price tag at most competitive private colleges is nearing $50,000. 
 The result is one more number: a roughly 50 percent increase in applications so far this fall as college-savings plans melt away, parents worry about job security and price becomes a major factor in the college-application anxiety pit, even for well-off families, in a way it has not been in the past. 
 ''Can you afford not to choose Binghamton?'' reads the leaflet university officials hand out at college fairs. 
 Clearly, along with the high stress level that comes with a record number of students applying to colleges, there's the even higher stress level that comes with the realization that in tough times, affording college is no given and there are things that trump fancy windshield stickers from brand-name colleges.
 ''I tell people that SUNY Binghamton is becoming the new Harvard,'' said Bob Sweeney, a college counselor at Mamaroneck High School in Westchester. ''My son is an eighth grader, and I whisper the names of the SUNY schools in his ear every evening.''
 The new Harvard is probably still Harvard. The stratospheric private-school sticker price is not what most people pay. And there are still armies of kids getting in line to be rejected at the nation's most competitive universities.
 But on the 10 a.m. tour at Binghamton on Friday, Maureen Haas of Jamesport, on Long Island, wore a Cornell lacrosse sweatshirt yet seemed thrilled that her daughter, Erika, who wants to be a doctor, is more interested in Stony Brook or Binghamton. Margaret Heller of Hicksville, also on Long Island, has one child at Villanova but said she was not sure how she could make it work for two at comparable prices. 
 Binghamton's president, Lois B. DeFleur, said the university had seen a steady increase in applications even before the fiscal crisis, ''but it looks this year like it's going to be a quantum leap.'' She attributed the growing interest to the school's reputation, campus environment and success in the job market. But she knows that's hardly the only thing.
 ''People want value,'' she said. ''They always want value. But in this environment, they're even more concerned with value.''
 The people on the tour were a reminder that the education universe is wider than the wish lists in the most college-obsessed precincts of Manhattan, Westchester, Bergen, Fairfield or Nassau.
 Joanne Grover's son, Tyler, is interested in Clarkson University, a 3,000-student research institution in Potsdam, N.Y., and she thinks she can swing that with financial aid if it works out. Scot Ioset has a daughter at Houghton College, a Christian school in western New York. There's talk of Delaware, Connecticut and Rutgers, more often than the Top 10 in the U.S. News rankings. Almost everyone has price in mind. 
 ''You have to,'' Mr. Ioset said. ''I'm from Hamilton, where Colgate costs something like $46,000. These schools have to follow Harvard and find a way to bring the price down.''
 Harvard, of course, has the singular luxury of its $36.9 billion endowment, or whatever is left of it after the market carnage of the past few months. The best-endowed schools can guarantee financial aid for the top students.
 But there's only so much scholarship money out there. So cost is looming as a huge issue for those with marginal resources as well as those in fancier neighborhoods who may find that their income and net worth last year will look a lot higher to universities doling out financial aid than it feels to them in the current environment. 
 ''I think the most difficult issue confronting parents is the issue of uncertainty,'' said Barbara Leifer-Sarullo, the director of counseling at Scarsdale High School. ''I had a family come in and say, 'What if I lose my job in February, March or April?' It's a very valid question. So one thing we're seeing is more people applying to state schools in case their family situation changes.''
 That, of course, will trickle down to the students for whom there's not much give on price. Amy Levitan, a single mother from Little Neck, Queens, said that she would be able to afford the expensive schools like Tulane, Delaware, Pittsburgh and Miami that her son Jeremy is considering only if they get a substantial aid package. But with so many more people applying to Binghamton, she knows it will be harder than ever to get in, so Jeremy is also looking at other SUNY schools like Buffalo, Oneonta, New Paltz and Geneseo.
 Some also warn that people looking at SUNY need to consider the effects of looming state budget cuts. Some hope there might be a slightly better chance of getting into the top schools if others decide not to apply this year.
 Andy Finn, whose daughter Natalie is a senior at Ossining High School in Westchester, has already visited Binghamton as well as a raft of other schools. He's open to all options, but said the public route looks a lot better now that it did a few months ago.
 ''We did everything we were supposed to, and after the last 12 months, whatever we contributed to our 529 is all we have left,'' said Mr. Finn, an executive with Tourneau watches. ''I sat her down after we visited one of the schools in D.C. and said, 'Let's look at reality. Some of these schools cost $50,000 and the SUNY schools cost $15,000. That's a $140,000 difference over four years. With that I will pay for grad school. I will pay your rent when you live off campus. I will buy you a car, and send you to Europe for a summer and still be way ahead.' 
 ''You want to do what's best for your kid, but you also want to make financial sense.''

BYLINE: By MAC MONTANDON. 
Mac Montandon's book ''Jetpack Dreams: One Man's Up and Down (But Mostly Down) Search for the Greatest Invention That Never Was'' will be published next month by Da Capo Press.

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, my wife and I moved into a large, friendly, oddly affordable apartment building half a block from Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Soon after we settled in, I began to run on the jogging loop around the park with some regularity, if not sustained enthusiasm. Three or four times a week during motivated moments, less often from December through March. 
 Part of what keeps me going are the close-up views of the changing seasons. There are few better ways to see the first blooms of spring or encounter the early crunch of fall underfoot. 
 But what I look forward to most on my runs is seeing the familiar faces stream past me on the path, or the profiles that fade back when I actually pass anyone. I've come to think of these people as characters in my own personal serialized fiction -- Dickens, brought to you by Saucony. It's an unusual experience to so frequently see the same strangers with whom I've exchanged plenty of painfully commiserating glances but not a single word. 
 With the rock soundtrack booming from my headphones, I've begun to construct mini-narratives for some of my favorite characters. Their continuing stories are produced in 10-second bursts -- the time it takes to notice them approaching up ahead and then to have them huff past, disappearing in a ripple of air. This being New York, many of the flushed faces I pass possess literary qualities. Others are intriguingly eccentric, or at least they appear that way when seen in such brief installments. 
 Rushdie -- named, of course, for his resemblance to Salman Rushdie, the author of ''Midnight's Children,'' among many other books -- is 54, divorced (it was mostly amicable), childless and dedicated to his work as a psychotherapist (we're near Park Slope, after all, and he wears glasses and a sophisticated beard). He began running about two years ago, after his cardiologist noticed an irregular beat or two. 
 He has taken to the necessary exercise with resigned determination. He looks into the middle distance as he strides, his navy T-shirt tucked neatly into matching shorts. Rushdie runs for his health, yes, but he also runs for his girlfriend, Astrid, a publicist at Simon & Schuster who sometimes pats his remaining paunch with affection. Perhaps her tacit reminders are helping: Rushdie has been looking fit.
 When I first spotted Skinny Ginsberg, he struck me as a sad soul. His big, brown, searching eyes peer out behind what may or may not be protective lenses meant for soldering. He wore rumpled sweatsuits, the sleeves pushed up to the elbows, revealing twiggy arms. 
 Skinny Ginsberg is always alone. But one day he was accompanied by two, three, maybe even four friends: healthy, smart-looking friends with thick, vigorously unmaintained hair, like actors in a Woody Allen movie. 
 It was suddenly so clear, I couldn't believe I'd missed it. Skinny Ginsberg is the unlikely life of the party. To the writer Malcolm Gladwell, he'd be a connector. Skinny Ginsberg is king of his social empire, finding time to bring artists, intellectuals, entrepreneurs and impresarios together in what he'd call salons, if he didn't think that word sounded pretentious -- despite working too-long hours in some vague-sounding field like emerging markets. 
 Skinny Ginsberg has been underestimated all his life -- the last kid picked in street basketball games but the first to knock down that clutch jumper. Sure, he had a slight problem with amphetamines a decade or so ago, but that was just a function of his drive, his work ethic, the tiny terror that he might end up like his father, a pinched man, a high school principal in Paramus. 
 But now, look at him. Admired by Rita, his wife of 27 years, and their sons, Charlie and Sebastian, he has surpassed the old man and can take comfort in that small fact as he unwinds nightly with Gordon Lightfoot MP3s, cable news and rum raisin ice cream. 
 Big Tony is not so lucky. Big Tony has been bitten by life and has not yet bitten back. He may never get the chance. A talented outside linebacker at Baylor University in the late '90s, Anthony Ulysses Ferndale once had pro football aspirations. A hyperextended left knee precipitated a junior year rife with injuries, however, and Big Tony was forced to reconsider his dreams. 
 Turning lemons into lemonade, he recommitted to his coursework in biochemistry, graduating with honors three years ago. In the midst of the economic downturn, though, he was laid off from a great gig at an Upper East Side lab, and so Anthony is now on the hunt for a new job. 
 IN the meantime, he comes to the park to clear his head and strengthen his knee. Because he can't run, he has devised his own workout routine, which involves kicking two red rubber gym-class balls around the loop. Tony knocks one up ahead and then the other; somehow he's able to keep them both more or less on track. I haven't resolved what happens next in Big Tony's story, but I sure hope it ends happily. 
 There are minor characters, too, in these aerobic episodes. The Walking Girl, well, walks. Head down, sadly contemplating the pavement as she methodically circumnavigates the park, she is a model of consistency. There isn't much one can count on in this world, but I can be certain that once a week or so, I will see the Walking Girl, and she will be walking, morosely kicking at pebbles. 
 I will see her, that is, as long as Running Wild doesn't deck me first. Running Wild takes the park clockwise -- against the traffic. Most folks who go clockwise defer to the traffic-obeying counterclockwise jogger. Not so, Running Wild. She does not yield, does not slow down; she will, in fact, apparently flatten all comers, should that be required. If, ultimately, that is how I meet my fate -- plowed down on the Prospect Park jogging path by a frenzied fitness maniac -- I could take some last, gasping solace in this: At least I wasn't done in by the hard-charging and all-too-often-shirtless Sweaty.

HEADLINE: How to Take a Cake Knife to Wedding Costs

BYLINE: By MARIANNE ROHRLICH

 BODY:
YES, Leah Brickley had her favorite flowers for her wedding last month. Luckily -- given the cost of roses -- her favorites were sunflowers. 
 The white 1940s dress, bought for $59 and retailored for $100, pleased her more than any new bridal gown would have. She and Paul Hope, her fiance, also hired a photographer for $240. And with fruit pies, cookies and a chocolate cake, who needed tiers of white frosting? 
 And because both are graduates of Johnson & Wales University's culinary programs, the couple cooked the dinner themselves.
 By cutting so many corners, Ms. Brickley and Mr. Hope, who live in Manhattan, sliced a zero off the average cost of a New York City wedding -- $3,500 versus the $35,000 estimated by the Wedding Library, a Manhattan planning service. 
 With wedding costs spiraling up everywhere and the tremors of a shaky economy threatening to rattle even the best-laid plans, more couples may have to become more resourceful -- and develop an affection for sunflowers.
 ''Everyone is sitting back to see what happens,'' said Ann David, a partner in David Reinhard Events in Manhattan.
 Terry deRoy Gruber, a Manhattan wedding photographer whose company's fees start at $7,500, said that, beginning in midsummer, he noticed there were fewer calls coming in. ''Typically, people book a year or more in advance,'' he said. ''But now they are coming in at the last minute for weddings taking place one or two months from now.''
 Other families, Mr. Gruber noted, are going forward but paring. ''You get engaged and you always dreamed of a wedding in St. Barts,'' he said. ''Well, now you might not go there.''
 Ms. Brickley, 27, and Mr. Hope, 22, were married Sept. 6 much closer to home -- in front of 32 guests in a friend's backyard in Park Slope, and had the reception inside.
 So the venue was free, but ''we needed to rent 40 chairs, and 8 small tables, dinnerware and glassware,'' Mr. Hope said. With rain predicted (accurately it tuned out), they decided at the last minute to rent a tent. Some rental businesses had minimums of $1,000 to $1,500, but a careful Internet search turned up West Side Party Rental, which charged $950 for everything, including the tables, etc. 
 The couple cooked the dinner of tenderloin of beef (bought at Costco) and prepared salads. They poured prosecco instead of Champagne, and with dinner served only one white wine and one red wine. The entire alcohol bill was $252. 
 According to Claudia Hanlin, who runs the Wedding Library, even midprice wedding photographers typically charge $5,000. 
 Knowing this, Ms. Brickley posted an ad on Craigslist offering photographers a flat $200. She said she received 70 responses within a few hours. ''We eliminated anyone who called but didn't say congratulations,'' Mr. Hope said. They selected one just starting out in wedding photography, Kat Cheng, to whom they gave an extra $40, ''to rent a better lens for the day.'' 
 Ms. Brickley found the short white vintage dress on eBay. A 1940s hat, borrowed from her aunt, coordinated perfectly. Dozens of gorgeous cookies were made by a pastry-chef friend, and the bridegroom's mother baked his favorite chocolate cake.
 For music, a friend became a D.J. And the sunflowers? They were bought as a gift and lovingly arranged by yet another talented friend.
 Even among families to whom a $50,000 to $100,000 wedding might not have seemed a reach earlier this year, some are now ''reprioritizing,'' said JoAnn Gregoli, owner of Elegant Occasions in Manhattan. ''People are rethinking, downsizing, inviting fewer people and rethinking the decor,'' she said, something she said she hasn't seen before in her 20-year career. ''In the last few weeks, calls are coming in saying, 'Let's streamline.' ''
 Molly Mannion Soudant, 29, and Joe Alterio, 30, who are to marry Nov. 1 at the Swedish American Hall, an event space in San Francisco, are splitting the cost of their $20,000 wedding with their parents. And Mr. Alterio's sister is making the wedding gown as a present.
 Although they planned their event half a year ago, before the economy plummeted, the couple's budget was already tight, Mr. Alterio said, noting, ''Neither one of us is loaded anyway.'' 
 Their 124 guests will eat a dinner catered by their favorite taqueria for $800. A friend who is a brewmaster is donating beer. They bought the rest of the alcohol wholesale. Instead of a photographer, there will be a photo booth for the guests. ''We thought it would be more fun,'' Ms. Soudant said, adding that Mr. Alterio's father will be taking more-formal photographs, and one of Mr. Alterio's friends from the University of Southern California film school will record the event using a Super 8 film camera.
 Darcy Miller, the editorial director of Martha Stewart Weddings, said: ''People are spending more time planning and researching their weddings, and technology is helping brides look for good deals. There are so many aspects to a wedding and so many ways to be creative and save.''
 For example, if music is important, then hire a live band. But if flowers mean more, save on music by using an MP3 player and buy a more expensive bouquet. Hiring live music doesn't have to break the bank, either; a call to a local music college can turn up a young and vibrant string quartet that charges a low fee.
 For indoor weddings, Ms. Hanlin suggests a restaurant rather than an event space if the budget is tight because restaurants typically do not charge a venue fee, but rather by the person.
 That was one reason Samantha Schabel, 33, and Tom Foster, 34, chose a restaurant near their home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, for their Nov. 8 wedding. 
 She said they were spending $30,000 to $35,000, but that still means being unsentimental when it comes to costs. There will be no one younger than 16 among their 90 guests and none of their friends are allowed to bring a casual date. 
 She had not planned to buy a gown, but there sentiment got the better of her. She hired a freelance stylist to decorate the restaurant. To stay within her budget, she is considering having candles and paper leaves on the place-card tables instead of fresh flowers, and only seasonal ones (no orchids) on the dinner tables.
 Even those who are not financially constrained may worry about appearances and think twice about mounting an extravagant wedding in hard times. 
 ''Most successful men with daughters in their 20s set aside funds for the big day,'' said Mr. Gruber, the photographer. ''The money for her wedding is still there. Today it is a matter of perception: 'Can I have the wedding I have always envisioned for my daughter, or is it insensitive to spend that kind of money right now?' ''

HEADLINE: A Healthy Dose Of Misery For Company

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
THE world is trembling with anxiety. Fingernails are being chewed across America as the presidential race enters its last innings, and the financial Tilt-a-Whirl of the past month has left everyone from Riga to Reykjavik to Rochester unsettled. I am surely not alone in averting my eyes when firing up a search engine for fear that my home page will feature a stock graph resembling a ski slope. 
 The time is ripe for some giddy escapism, with crowds stampeding multiplexes to see ''Beverly Hills Chihuahua.'' I too have seen ''Beverly Hills Chihuahua.'' It's cute. Not once does a talking dog make gloomy reference to his 401(k).
 I'll also admit to fleeing the spinning wheel of doomsaying economists on the news networks for the most unedifying of alternatives. I have seen every episode of ''The Rachel Zoe Project,'' the Bravo series about a pampered stylist to the stars -- kind of a Beverly Hills Chihuahua herself, in her fur shrugs and froggy glasses -- whose greatest worries are whether her peevish pair of assistants will learn to get along, and where her next venti cappuccino is coming from. 
 Something tells me that Rachel Zoe has not allowed the global tumult to pull her focus from the pressing need to find Debra Messing the right gown for the Emmys. Oh, to be Rachel Zoe. Or one of her blithely bickering assistants. Or, for that matter, her venti cappuccino cup. 
 And what is the New York theater offering to lift the load of woe from our hearts? Well, there's the usual fun to be had, in the form of standbys like ''The Lion King'' or last season's somewhat exhausting farce ''Boeing Boeing.'' And the fleet-footed ''Billy Elliot'' is warming up at the barre.
 But in a case of colossal bad timing, the most notable, the most accomplished -- the most important -- new productions of the fall theater season so far are as dark-hued as theater gets: Ian Rickson's existential take on ''The Seagull'' on Broadway and the shattering Sarah Kane play ''Blasted'' at Soho Rep.
 See them both in a single day and, well, you won't be worrying about your retirement plan anymore. You will probably be sitting in a padded cell, staring into some inward abyss. Still, as an unabashed partisan of serious theater, I'm happy to make a case for embracing these undeniably harrowing evenings. Three cheers for misery, I say. It may hurt, but it can be healthy.
 Of course it's simplistic to say that good sad plays are moral or emotional tonics, like fiber cereal for the soul. But on some level it is fundamentally true. Escapist entertainment can offer fleeting rewards, but in the long run only art really nourishes. Sure, it's sweet to daydream our way into the worlds inhabited by George Clooney and Angelina Jolie, but it's more important for us all to know ourselves. Great theater, like much high art, tells us who we are, not who we would like to be. 
 You could make the argument -- well, I could, anyway -- that some of the havoc caused by the subprime mortgage crisis can be traced to a collective amnesia on the part of the powers that be about the essence of human nature. At one point Alan Greenspan argued that it was not the lack of regulation that caused the firestorm; it was an excess of greed on Wall Street. He didn't see that coming? 
 This apparent ignorance of our baser nature among top-tier economists should be quickly cured, lest more problems be caused. I hereby recommend for them a crash course in what men and women are, and what they will do to survive and prosper when the restraints of civilization fall away. I prescribe an evening in the hair-raising company of ''Blasted.''
 As with an inoculation, a single visit will suffice. ''Blasted'' is not a play to be seen more than once; an experience this unsettling would not have the same impact if it were repeated. Fortunately for New Yorkers, the play has arrived in a superlative production, directed by Sarah Benson, that does full justice to the integrity of Ms. Kane's singular vision. (It is only to be regretted that it took more than a dozen years after its London premiere for the play to be produced here at all.)
 Theater watchers have probably heard a few hints about the grisly details of the plot. The play begins as a reunion between a jaded journalist and his younger former lover in a well-appointed hotel room. He is cynical, bitter, death-haunted and cruel; she is gentle, wary, intellectually handicapped. The evening ends unhappily, in fact brutishly. And then, the morning after, the play suddenly explodes into a savage allegory of survival amid the wreckage of a civilization riven by martial conflict.
 Descriptions give little sense of the play's impact in the theater, just as reading the script would provide only a sketchy impression of its potential to latch onto the viscera and squeeze tightly. I have seen much theater seasoned with outrageous acts of violence -- like Tracy Letts's gnarly noir comedy-dramas and Martin McDonagh's blood-drenched tales of Irish backwaters. In almost all of them, violence onstage is trimmed with humor that disarms our instinct to recoil, or serves a story and a set of characters conveniently removed from the realm of the real. 
 Not so ''Blasted.'' Each moment of the play feels like a moment in real time, depicting actual experience, even when the play dissolves from naturalism into something closer to expressionism. The brutalizers are not villains but petty, unexceptional men. And Ms. Kane's aim is not mere entertainment, or even provocation; it's revelation -- of how men and women revert to feeding their most basic hungers when their existence is threatened, or when exposure to brutality has corroded their humanity.
 Without moralizing for an instant, Ms. Kane imbues her play with a deep moral vision; the clinical manner in which she presents the descent into bestiality condemns the cheapening of suffering that is in so many violence-riddled works. Life is so brutal, and people so potentially cruel, the play argues, that to sentimentalize or temporize is to settle for a soothing lie.
 If ''Blasted'' all but flays your soul, Chekhov's ''Seagull'' strums gently on the heartstrings, although its worldview is hardly more comforting. ''Blasted'' depicts man's potential for savagery in extraordinary circumstances; ''The Seagull'' is a drama of ordinary sadness, everyday frustration, more attuned to our capacity to disappoint than to destroy. Chekhov was no less dry-eyed than Ms. Kane as he observed his characters' self-absorption, and he was no less heart-sore, at bottom, that life should be this way. 
 Although Chekhov classified ''The Seagull'' as a comedy, and the actors -- led by the ravishing Kristin Scott Thomas as the vain Arkadina -- infuse their performances with a gentle awareness of their characters' absurdities, the production strikes a consistently bleak note. Mr. Rickson and Christopher Hampton, who provided the supple new English translation, quietly but insistently trace the agony of hopes unrealized: the yearning for understanding that is denied, the aching, desperate sense that the possibility of happiness is decaying moment by moment. 
 The somber palette, the eerie, shuddering music and the echoing silences between speeches subtly underscore the play's proto-existentialist underpinnings. Even the symbolist drama written by Konstantin, which is almost always played for comedy as the arch attitudinizing of an immature writer, radiates a dark fundamental truth here. The production honors the honest emotion behind Konstantin's clumsy poetry, the ache for a ''universal soul'' that would unite the scattered hearts of humanity. 
 Tellingly, a single phrase -- ''If you only knew'' -- echoes like a musical refrain throughout Mr. Hampton's text. ''If you only knew how much I hated leaving you!'' Nina confesses to the assembled company when she must leave the charmed circle on Sorin's estate to return home. ''If you only knew how much they upset me,'' Polina complains when her husband causes an unnecessary kerfuffle. ''If you only knew how unhappy I am,'' Konstantin upbraids Nina, repeating the same phrase to his mother when he has lost Nina's love. ''If you only knew!'' the distraught Nina cries to Konstantin in her last scene, unable to describe the suffering she's endured. 
 The words cut to the heart of the mournful truth the play illuminates. Each of the characters looks desperately for understanding from another, while more often than not denying a similar understanding to someone else. It's not that they are heartless; no production I've seen contains so many fully rounded portraits. But Chekhov seemed to sense that obstacles to true communion are built into the human condition. We are so absorbed in our own experience -- the slights and aches, the romantic hopes and comforting illusions -- that everyone else's can be impossible to fathom, even if we believe ourselves to be compassionate people, highly sensitized to the suffering of others.
 In flush times, ignorance of this natural tendency toward solipsism is lamentable; in dark times, as Ms. Kane's play so gruesomely illustrates, it can be dangerous. Neither of these plays leaves you in the carefree frame of mind of your average lapdog from Beverly Hills. You are left instead with a tense awareness of the frailty of human happiness and social equilibrium, the potential for tragedy that shadows all existence, but also a grateful appreciation for art that speaks somber truth in a manner that is as honest as it is humane.

HEADLINE: Movement Against Bottled Water Gains Municipal Adherents

BYLINE: By NICOLE COTRONEO

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND residents love to stay hydrated on the go -- they consumed half a billion bottles of water in the past year. The evidence is everywhere: plastic bottles stuffed in treadmill cup holders at the gym, lined up neatly along the buffet table at office meetings and, even more often, tossed empty on the side of the road. 
 But where you won't find them sold, at least, is at the public park, Town Hall or any other municipal facility in Babylon Town. 
 In September, the Town Board decided to pull single-serve water bottles from the town's vending machines. Instead, water fountains are being upgraded and the town is offering free reusable bottles to residents. The 20-ounce containers are made from plastic that will not leach chemicals, according to the Suffolk County Water Authority, which created the bottles as part of its recently begun campaign to help people ''kick the habit'' of buying bottled water.
 Such an effort represents a trend across America, said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of the Washington-based consumer advocacy group Food and Water Watch.
 ''This year we're seeing more localities promoting their tap water,'' Ms. Hauter said. The weakened economy has made people think twice about buying bottled water, she noted. 
 In June, the New York City Council announced it would stop making single-serving bottled water available at Council functions. Corporate Accountability International, an advocacy group, has reported that more than 30 cities in the United States and Canada have taken steps to cut spending on bottled water.
 On average, a gallon of tap water costs one-thousandth of a gallon of purchased bottled water, according to the Suffolk authority.
 Ms. Hauter said the public and local governments were becoming wary of the industry's assertion that bottled water is better than tap water. ''People thought they were getting a better product, and they feel misled,'' she said.
 Steve Bellone, the Babylon town supervisor, agreed. ''The water bottle industry has done an effective job of convincing people that drinking bottled water is good for you,'' he said. ''But we have some of the most pristine water in the country. You can save some money.''
 In response to a report by the Environmental Working Group that attacked bottled water quality, the American Beverage Association said this month that members' procedures and testing helped ensure that their products met or exceeded federal safety guidelines. 
 Tap water is as good as, if not superior to, any bottled water you can buy, the Suffolk County Water Authority contends. New York State's standards for testing water quality are among the strictest in the nation. 
 Babylon is not the first municipality to promote what the water authority calls ''Long Island's buried treasure.'' Also in September, Hempstead Town mailed its residents, along with their water bills, 130,000 brochures extolling the benefits of drinking tap water. 
 Hempstead is also considering removing bottled water from its vending machines, said Mike Deery, director of communications for the town.
 Earlier this year, the Suffolk County Legislature banned the use of public money for buying single-serve bottles of water. However, the law exempts contracts with vending machine suppliers. 
 The Long Island Neighborhood Network, an environmental group, considers the county measure ''a baby step.'' A more significant decision would be to eliminate traditional water coolers from municipal offices and replace them with more environmentally sound coolers that filter tap water, said Neal Lewis, the executive director. The organization has installed such a cooler in its East Farmingdale headquarters.
 The transportation of water jugs for traditional coolers is as damaging to the environment as transporting single-serve water bottles, Mr. Lewis said. ''Water is heavy -- it takes a tremendous amount of energy to transport these five-gallon jugs,'' he said. ''It's an extraordinarily idiotic waste of diesel fuel, not to mention the fumes.'' 
 According to the Pacific Institute, an environmental research organization, United States plastic bottle production consumes at least 17.6 million barrels of oil annually. Add 49 million barrels of oil to carry the process through filling the bottles with water, transporting them and ultimately recycling of the plastic or putting it in the trash. 
 But don't even count on the latter. On Long Island, ''nondeposit plastic water bottles tend to be the biggest item found in parks and roadsides as litter,'' Mr. Lewis said.

HEADLINE: You Don't Always Know When the Sky Will Fall

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
NOW, as the great Phil Rizzuto used to say, for ''some high hops and short stops'' -- only not in sports, but in finance and life.
 First, I get a certain amount of mail asking why I was unable to spot the stock market crash in advance, sell short and become rich. And why was I unable to foretell the future, so my readers could avoid losses and make money?
 Well, I am just a person. I don't have any magical powers to foresee the future. In this case, I did not foresee the catastrophic mistake, as I view it, by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to allow Lehman Brothers to fail. That failure left a gaping hole in the financial services industry, and blew away confidence that the Feds knew what they were doing. 
 Months ago, one of the greatest of American economists, Anna Jacobson Schwartz, who was co-author with the late Milton Friedman of ''A Monetary History of the United States,'' accurately said that American banks did not face a liquidity crisis, but that they might soon urgently face a solvency crisis. In other words, banks would have ample reserves to lend but might lack assurances that they could meet all their financial obligations if those loans went bad. She was right. In fact, bankers have had so many losses and faced so much uncertainty that they dared not lend, for fear of killing their banks with bad loans -- so we have actually had a solvency crisis.
 (By the way, it's a disgrace that Mrs. Schwartz, a mainstay of economic insight since before World War II -- as well as my late mother's college roommate at Barnard -- has not been a Nobel laureate. That hints at a dismal sexism in the dismal science.) 
 The solvency crisis exploded when, in mid-September, Mr. Paulson allowed Lehman Brothers to die a sudden death. I would never have believed that it could happen, which shows one of my many limitations as an economist and a human being. I assume that the future will be much like the past, but sometimes it isn't. 
 After Lehman, I felt sure that the government would realize its mistake and issue blanket solvency guarantees to banks. But that didn't happen, the stock market fell apart, credit went icy cold and the wheels started to come off the economy. This also took me by surprise.
 The failure of government to limit the loss possibilities from credit-default swaps has also been a mystery to me. And credit-default swaps themselves are something of a mystery. They are derivative instruments that supposedly insure a bond or similar entity against default. In fact, they are a wager about the possibility of default of anything, and the potential payouts for the wagers that have been made are many times larger than the value of all the subprime mortgage bonds that ever were. 
 The need for the government to take action seemed so clear -- and still seems so clear that I cannot believe a day passes without its happening. But the days pass, nothing happens, and I am proved wrong again. And I lose some of my life savings and it hurts.
 Now let me move to another point: all of the recent misery, including the stock market's plunge, the disasters at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the loss of retirement savings. These did not happen out of the blue. The catastrophe of giving bonds ratings far higher than they deserved did not happen by chance. And endlessly rosy reports from banks and investment banks about their health did not result from a butterfly flapping its wings in China.
 Human beings did these things. The harm to the American people and to the world has been substantial. There has been real pain here. Why is it taking so long to find out who did what and whether laws were broken? That's what prosecutors are for. 
 And, closer to home, a talented makeup artist who works with me almost daily in my TV appearances asked what happened to people in a recession. (She is young.) I said that fear and insomnia happened to most people but that a few million would actually lose their jobs and millions more would lose income.
 ''What do they do?'' she asked, looking worried.
 ''They find other work or live off their savings,'' I said. ''They certainly cut back on their spending.''
 ''What if they don't have any savings?'' she asked. ''I don't have any savings,'' she said. ''No one I know except you has any savings.'' She looked extremely worried.
 This is perhaps the main lesson of this whole experience. It is basic but still unlearned: human beings must have savings. This is not just a good idea. It's the difference between life and death, terror and calm. So start saving right now, and don't stop until you die.
 FINALLY, I'll turn to the oil companies. When crude was skyrocketing, the beautiful people wanted to beat Exxon Mobil, Chevron and BP into a pulp. Many people assumed that oil barons controlled prices, made ''obscene'' profits and made life difficult for ordinary citizens. But the price of oil has fallen by more than half from just a few months ago. Gasoline prices are at levels no one thought we would ever see again. Very expensive projects that the oil companies commenced, like extracting oil from tar sands in Canada, may now be major money losers. 
 What do you say, folks? Let's acknowledge that we were a bit hasty. The oil companies are just corks bobbing up and down on the ocean of worldwide demand and supply, exactly as the oil companies said they were. They are not going to be starving, but they are clearly not the invincible demons that their enemies said they were. Now that we see how vulnerable they are, is there any reason to hit them with a surtax?
 Will we ever learn that they are just dust in the wind, like the rest of us? Probably not.

HEADLINE: Out of Blight, a Step-Up Neighborhood

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
IT would be hard to get much emptier than the landscape of Crotona Park East in the late 1970s.
 After being eviscerated by highway projects, poverty, public health crises and crime, this square-mile South Bronx neighborhood took its final blow in the form of arson, both by tenants and landlords, which helped to reduce rows of tenements to rubble.
 The ruined streets conjured fear when used as film locations, whether for horror movies (''Wolfen'') or police dramas (''Fort Apache the Bronx''). They also served as a different type of media backdrop when, 31 years ago this month, President Jimmy Carter paid a visit, describing the area as America's ''worst slum.''
 In the intervening decades, much has changed. Once-desolate lots now have housing, whether rebuilt two-families or luxury condominiums. 
 One lot that Mr. Carter visited is now the site of Intervale Green and Louis Nine House, a $46 million complex with 173 moderately priced apartments, built with planted roofs and leafy courtyards by the nonprofit Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation. It is to open to renters next month. 
 Some new homes in the area make use of materials that are sensitive to Crotona's high asthma rates. In fact, 28 new brick-and-stone two- and three-families with nontoxic rugs and paints built by the Blue Sea Development Company, won a city environmental award in September. 
 Other burned-out lots in this neighborhood of 33,000 residents have become Charlotte Gardens, a 1980s subdivision of raised ranches with deer lawn ornaments and covered boats in driveways. One resident is Elizabeth Jurden, who said that when she checked out Crotona more than 20 years ago, it didn't look much different from the way it had when she watched Mr. Carter's visit on the news.
 ''Rats were running across the street,'' said Ms. Jurden, a retired transit worker, who moved here from a two-bedroom rental on the Upper West Side. ''But I figured if it's the pits now, it can only go one way, and that's up.''
 Her 1,500-square-foot home, with three bedrooms and one and a half baths, as well as grass on all sides, cost $50,000 in 1983, she said. Today, owing to its suburb-in-the-city feel, it might sell for $400,000, even in the downturn. 
 As tranquil as parts of Crotona might look, however, they still have their share of crime, as the barred windows on Ms. Jurden's block suggest. 
 There have been 12 killings this year in the 42nd precinct, of which this neighborhood is a part. This is four more than in 2007. But from 1990 to 2007 murders here fell by 85 percent. Robberies are keeping pace with last year's total, with 288 reported so far in 2008, about the same as late October 2007. And high unemployment persists, city officials say.
 Yet now that Crotona's long-term build-out seems to be nearing completion, attention can be focused more fully on social issues in this mostly black and Hispanic area, says Peter Williams, president of the Mid Bronx Desperadoes, a nonprofit developer and community organization founded in 1974 by women who patrolled to stop arsonists. 
 ''Our next phase is human-capital development,'' said Mr. Williams, whose group has worked on 121 local buildings, including Charlotte Gardens.
 ''We always believed this community could be revitalized,'' he said, ''and that dream seems closer.''
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 The Cross Bronx Expressway forms Crotona's northern border. The Sheridan Expressway frames it to the east. 
 To the west lies Crotona Park, which in the 1980s was known for its crime. Today, through an $11 million Parks Department project, the 127.5-acre expanse is receiving new sidewalks, a pool house, tennis courts and a soccer field. 
 To restore Indian Lake, workers are removing concrete banks. A 500-seat amphitheater is to open in May. Among other events, hip-hop concerts will be held there on Thursdays in July, said Steven Cain, the park's administrator.
 Crotona Park East's southern boundary, which touches Morrisania, is open to interpretation, but in terms of housing stock, there's little distinction.
 Both have squat vinyl-sided homes tucked in between three-story brick tenements that survived earlier eras. In Crotona, examples line Hoe Avenue, and Simpson and Home Streets. 
 Along Bryant Avenue, yellow-brick row houses feature terra-cotta inlays of cherubs. Some are in rough shape, with graffiti-scrawled doors, cracked stoops and plywood-covered windows. 
 In places, sneakers dangle from power lines. Sizable spray-painted murals also punctuate the area, like the eulogy to Mad Mark on East 167th Street (''the only M & M that will melt your heart'').
 Early-20th-century apartment towers face Crotona Park. Their residents, like most in the area, are renters -- many in Housing Authority buildings.
 But the area has its share of owners, who live in single-family homes or in buildings where they rent out the upper floors, brokers say.
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 Even though many rents are set low, they're slipping out of the reach of some residents, says Nancy Biberman, the president of Women's Housing, citing its Intervale project, where the most expensive three-bedrooms are $1,089 a month. 
 ''We're having trouble filling it, which is extremely unusual,'' she said. She guesses the problem is the current economic climate.
 Otherwise, the rental market is fairly tight, with only about 75 apartments out of 3,000, or 3 percent, changing hands every month, brokers said. 
 Sales inventory, on the other hand, is escalating; it is currently at about 200 homes -- three per block. Buyers, many of them investors, typically pay $360,000 for three-families whose units have two bedrooms, a bath and 900 square feet each, said Leslie Bhagwandin, a broker with Nardin Real Estate in Baychester. That price is off 20 percent from 2007; most of the decline occurred in the last 90 days. Older row houses on Bryant Avenue average about $425,000.
 Still, ''this is a step-up neighborhood,'' for first-time buyers who ultimately settle in areas like Throgs Neck or Pelham Parkway, Mr. Bhagwandin added.
 One troubling sign is the recent spike in foreclosures in a place where ''for sale by bank'' signs are not uncommon. Foreclosures have tripled since 2005, Mr. Bhagwandin said. 
 WHAT TO DO
 The commercial strips are Southern Boulevard and Boston Road; under a flaking trestle sit auto-body shops, storefront churches and bodegas.
 For groceries, most residents head to the New Horizons mall on East 174th Street, which offers a Pathmark, a Radio Shack and a Hollywood Video. At El Despertar restaurant nearby, $6 buys a plate of chicken, beans and rice.
 On Bristow Street, at the quarter-acre Model T Senior Citizens Garden, volunteers grow figs, squash and beets, and tomatoes the color of plums. People can pick what they need, said Tina Espinell, as she sat at a picnic table under wind chimes, ''and it's just a nice place to come for peace of mind.''
 THE SCHOOLS
 Crotona's many public schools receive mixed reviews; one of the better-performing schools is Public School 61, the Francisco Oller School, which teaches prekindergarten through fifth grade. On state proficiency exams, 45 percent of fourth-graders there met standards in English, 83 percent in math. Citywide, percentages were 61 and 80.
 For Grades 6 through 8, many head to Intermediate School 98, the Herman Ridder School, which enrolls about 500. On the 2008 state exams, 24 percent of eighth graders met standards in English, 57 percent in math, versus 43 and 60 citywide.
 In recent years, the city has replaced large dropout-plagued schools with smaller specialized ones; South Bronx High School in Morrisania, for example, gave way to three schools, among them Mott Haven Village Prep. This year, averages at Mott Haven were 377 in reading, 355 in math and 369 in writing, versus 488, 503 and 475 statewide.
 THE COMMUTE
 The Nos. 2 and 5 trains, which share elevated tracks through Crotona, have stops at Freeman Street and 174th Street, though the 5 skips those stops during the morning rush.
 Most morning commuters take the 2 and transfer at 149th Street-Grand Concourse to the 4 or 5, to arrive in Midtown in 35 minutes.
 Buses include the Bx11, Bx17, Bx19, Bx21 and Bx36. There is also the Bx35, which runs to the George Washington Bridge Bus Station. 
 THE HISTORY
 The area's hip-hop legacy is notable, says Mark Naison, a professor of African-American studies at Fordham. 
 Joseph Saddler, known as Grandmaster Flash, inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame last year, grew up on Fox Street, just south of Crotona, and gained fame as a D.J. at parties at Public School 63. A block away lived Theodore Livingston, a k a Grand Wizard Theodore, who is said to have invented turntable scratching, Mr. Naison said.

HEADLINE: Democrats See Risk and Reward If Party Sweeps

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The possibility of a victory by Senator Barack Obama combined with significant Congressional gains by his party could give Democrats extraordinary muscle to pursue an ambitious agenda on health care, taxes, union rights, energy and national security. 
 Democrats, who are within reach of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster in the Senate, would also face high expectations, especially from the party's more liberal quarters, that could be difficult to meet even with enhanced numbers in the Senate as well as the House. And they would be at risk of overreaching, a tendency that has deeply damaged both parties in similar situations in the past.
 But given the opportunity and the magnitude of the problems facing the country, Democrats said they would welcome the chance -- and the potential accountability -- even though winning the White House is no assurance that their initiatives would sail through Congress. And all of the issues on their agenda may be overshadowed by the need for urgent action on the deepening financial crisis.
 ''I think we are in enough trouble in enough areas,'' said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, ''that I would rather own it and then have to perform than continue with this back and forth, back and forth with Republicans, particularly while they are engaged in this absolute determined policy of obstruct, obstruct, obstruct.'' 
 ''If the choice is continue to deal with Republican obstruction in the Senate versus having the ability to move but having the responsibility to get it right,'' Mr. Whitehouse added, ''I would rather have the latter.'' 
 Armed with polls that raise the possibility of decisive wins in House and Senate races, Congressional Republicans are trying to turn the situation to their advantage, warning voters about unchecked one-party government and urging them to split their tickets to deny Democrats unfettered control. The Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, issued warnings about one-party control as he campaigned Friday and Saturday. 
 That is also the premise of a recent television advertisement supporting Senator Elizabeth Dole, Republican of North Carolina, whose seat is an integral part of the Democratic drive toward 60 votes, as she fights to hold on against Kay R. Hagan, a Democratic state senator. 
 Ominous music plays in the background as a narrator intones: ''These liberals want complete control of government, in a time of crisis. All branches of government. No checks and balances. No debate. No independence. That's the truth behind Kay Hagan. If she wins, they get a blank check.'' 
 If Mr. Obama, of Illinois, defeats Mr. McCain, he could be the first president since Jimmy Carter to enter office with wide control of the House and 60 votes in the Senate. That in theory would give Democrats the power to overcome procedural hurdles that have bedeviled both parties in recent years.
 ''Whether or not the Democrats have 60 is something that is going to be a very significant factor in the way the country is governed,'' said Robert A. Caro, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer and Senate historian, referring to the number needed to cut off Senate debate and push legislation to a vote. 
 But even with a 60-vote majority, Democrats could face challenges in pushing their agenda, said former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who had experience with such wide margins during the Carter administration and as a Democratic senator in the 1960s. 
 ''People tend to think that if you have got 60 votes you can pass anything you want,'' Mr. Mondale said. ''It means you can pass a lot more. There's no question about it. But it's not a slam-dunk.'' He added: ''It's not just a push-button Congress. For sure, they'll have their own ideas.'' 
 Democrats said they were well aware of the mistakes of the past and the overconfidence exhibited during one-party rule of the Clinton and Bush administrations that led to Democrats' losing control of the House in 1994 and to Republicans' experiencing a similar defeat in 2006. 
 Chastened by their years in exile, Democrats said they were determined to avoid those pitfalls should voters deliver them control of the White House and Congress.
 The nature of the Democratic majority, expanded partly through the election of centrists and even conservatives, would also temper Democratic zeal to pursue an overly ideological agenda, Democrats said.
 ''We are going to get new members with a clear understanding that the reason they won is appealing to independents and disaffected Republicans, and they are going to want to continue to do that,'' said the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland.
 Yet even in the last two years, with a slimmer majority, Mr. Hoyer, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders have struggled to manage the competing demands of party factions, including antiwar liberals on the left and fiscal hawks on the right. 
 Republicans said they hoped to retain at least 41 seats in the Senate, giving them the ability to stop legislation they find most objectionable, and still command some leverage in policy negotiations.
 ''I think the Senate operates best when it makes things happen in the middle, and that happens when you have 41 or more people who resist an idea to the point where you can compromise,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and a lawmaker whose own seat is at risk. ''I think there will be enough Republicans plus discerning Democrats in the Senate after January to keep a kind of far-left agenda from steamrolling through the Senate like it often does through the House.''
 Despite having control of Congress for the past two years, Democrats have a pent-up agenda on health care, public works, energy, employment policy and other matters where they clashed with President Bush. Mr. Obama has his own detailed proposals on the economy, taxes, health care and climate change, among other major issues. Democrats say they would move quickly after the election to put their stamp on federal policy.
 The key to their ability to do so would probably remain the Senate, where many initiatives stalled in the past two years because of Republican resistance and what was effectively a narrow 51 to 49 Democratic majority. A 60-vote majority would give Democrats the power to roll over Republican objections to legislation, executive nominations and judicial appointments, at least on paper.
 But the number might not be the legislative panacea some envision. 
 One of those 60 would presumably be Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the independent who has backed Mr. McCain this year. 
 And Democrats, particularly more moderate ones, could always align with Republicans to block legislation they found objectionable. In fact, the level of Republican opposition in the Senate has masked some disagreements among Democrats since there were cases when Democrats saw themselves as free to vote with their party on legislation they knew was destined to stall.
 On the other hand, Democrats say a majority of 57 or 58 senators is tantamount to 60 since Democrats, after an election triumph, expect to be able to peel away two or three Republicans to join them -- an easier task than getting the nine they need now.
 ''If the White House political team can't figure out a way to get two Republican senators to vote with us between Air Force One, tea at the White House, U.S. attorneys and judges and dams and roads and ambassadors and all that other stuff,'' Senator Whitehouse said, ''somebody should take them out to the woodshed.'' 
 Mr. Mondale said that even with 60 Democratic senators, the Carter administration had to sweat for some legislative victories, like ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty in 1978. 
 ''I see some people say, 'Don't let them get 60 votes because then they'll get everything they want,' '' Mr. Mondale said. ''In my experience, don't worry about that.'' 
 ''You still have to work with Congress, you have to consult with them,'' he added. ''It's a tension between being tough and assertive as president on the one hand, and making sure that you are going to have followers when you are leading.'' 
 Since World War II, Republicans have never held more than 55 seats in the Senate. The last time the Republicans enjoyed a majority in the House as large as the Democrats could win was in 1947, as a result of dissatisfaction with President Harry S. Truman. 
 For Democrats, expansive majorities in Congress, coupled with control of the White House, have generally occurred in times of crisis -- in the 1930s during the Great Depression and in the 1970s after Vietnam and Watergate. 
 Mr. Caro, the biographer, said that in many ways the Democrats could find themselves in circumstances similar to those after 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president and Democrats won a huge majority in the House and held 59 of the 96 seats in the Senate. 
 But Mr. Caro noted that such broad control of Washington by one party had benefits and disadvantages. ''Right now we are in another crisis, and it's very similar in some ways economically,'' he said. ''Government must be able to move fast and decisively. So that's an argument for saying it would be a good thing, if we had the same party in control.''
 ''But there is another side,'' Mr. Caro added. ''Because it's precisely when one party sweeps to a huge majority that a check on its powers is needed, so that government doesn't go too far. That's why the founding fathers gave the Senate such great powers.''

HEADLINE: The Party of Yesterday

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN. 
Timothy Egan writes Outposts, a column at nytimes.com.

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
 Two years ago, a list of the nation's brainiest cities was put together from Census Bureau reports -- that is, cities with the highest percentage of college graduates, which is not the same as smart, of course. 
 These are vibrant, prosperous places where a knowledge economy and cool things to do after hours attract people from all over the country. Among the top 10, only two of those metro areas -- Raleigh, N.C., and Lexington, Ky. -- voted Republican in the 2004 presidential election. 
 This year, all 10 are likely to go Democratic. What's more, with Colorado, New Hampshire and Virginia now trending blue, Republicans stand to lose the nation's 10 best-educated states as well.
 It would be easy to say these places are not the real America, in the peculiar us-and-them parlance of Sarah Palin. It's easy to say because Republicans have been insinuating for years now that some of the brightest, most productive communities in the United States are fake American -- a tactic that dates to Newt Gingrich's reign in the capitol. 
 Brainy cities have low divorce rates, low crime, high job creation, ethnic diversity and creative capitalism. They're places like Pittsburgh, with its top-notch universities; Albuquerque, with its surging Latino middle class; and Denver, with its outdoor-loving young people. They grow good people in the smart cities.
 But in the politically suicidal greenhouse that Republicans have constructed for themselves, these cities are not welcome. They are disparaged as nests of latte-sipping weenies, alt-lifestyle types and ''other'' Americans, somehow inauthentic. 
 If that's what Republicans want, they are doomed to be the party of yesterday. 
 Not only are we becoming more urban as a nation, but we're headed for an ethnic muddle that could further shrink the party of small-mindedness. By 2023, more than half of all American children will be minority, the Census Bureau projects.
 Ronald Reagan was lashed by liberals for running a ''Morning in America'' campaign, but he knew this country, at heart, was always tomorrow-looking -- and he fared very well in educated cities as well as small towns. ''Whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone,'' said Reagan, ''I hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears.'' Barack Obama, who brings that music to the stage, leads by 30 points on the ''hope and optimism'' question in polls.
 Spurning the Reagan lesson, John McCain made a fatal error in turning his campaign over to the audience of Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. In so doing, he chose the unbearable lightness of being Sarah Palin, trotted out Paris Hilton and labeled Obama a socialist who associates with terrorists. 
 At a recent Palin rally, the crowd started chanting, ''We want Fox!'' McCain has given them just that. But how isolated and out-of-touch is this audience? At the end of each debate, a sure-fire way to decide who won was to look at the Fox viewers poll -- typically showing a landslide for McCain. Within a day, scientific surveys found big wins for Obama.
 Whether Americans are real or fake, they can see through Palin, a woman who couldn't correctly answer a third grader a few days ago when asked to explain the duties of vice president. Somewhere, between the shuffling to costume and accessorize Palin with a $150,000 wardrobe, her handlers never handed her a copy of the Constitution. 
 Republicans blow off the smart cities with the counterargument that they win the exurbs -- the frontier of new homes, young families and the fresh middle class. And it's true, in 2004, George Bush won 97 of the 100 fastest-growing counties in America.
 That will not happen this year. Polls show McCain is losing 20 percent of self-described moderate Republicans. And new registration figures and other polls indicate that Obama will likely win such iconic exurban centers as Washoe County, Nev., Loudoun County, Va., and Wake County, N.C. 
 But in the kind of pattern that has held true since McCain went over to the stupid side, his brother recently referred to suburban northern Virginia as ''communist country'' and a top adviser, Nancy Pfotenhauer, said it was not ''real Virginia.''
 Here in Seattle, it's become a one-party city, with a congressman for life and nodding-head liberals who seldom challenge a tax-loving city government. It would be nice, just to keep the philosophical debate sharp, if there were a few thoughtful Republicans around.
 That won't happen so long as Republicans continue to be the party of yesterday. They've written the cities off. Fake Americans don't count, but this Election Day, for once, they will not feel left out.

HEADLINE: A Makeover With an Ugly Gloss

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
McCain advisers have been scathing about the ''sexism'' of critics who dismiss Sarah Palin as Caribou Barbie.
 How odd then, to learn that McCain advisers have been treating their own vice presidential candidate like Valentino Barbie, dressing her up in fancy clothes and endlessly playing with her hair.
 In 1991, with Americans fretting about a shaky economy, Poppy Bush visited a J. C. Penney and bought $28 worth of tube socks and a toddler's sweat suit in a desperate effort to seem in touch with the common folk. Palin might have followed that example and popped into Penney's to buy some new American-made duds. She is so naturally good-looking, there is no need to gild the Last Frontier lily. 
 Instead, with the economy cratering and the McCain campaign running on an ''average Joe'' theme, dunderheaded aides, led by the former Bushies Nicolle Wallace and Tracey Schmitt, costumed their Eliza Doolittle for a ball when she should have been dressing for a bailout. 
 The Republicans' attempt to make the case that Barack Obama is hoity-toity and they're hoi polloi has fallen under the sheer weight of the stunning numbers: 
 The McCains own 13 cars, eight homes and access to a corporate jet, and Cindy had her Marie Antoinette moment at the convention. Vanity Fair calculated that her outfit cost $300,000, with three-carat diamond earrings worth $280,000, an Oscar de la Renta dress valued at $3,000, a Chanel white ceramic watch clocking in at $4,500 and a four-strand pearl necklace worth between $11,000 and $25,000. While presenting herself as an I'm-just-like-you hockey mom frugal enough to put the Alaska state plane up for sale on eBay, Palin made her big speech at the convention wearing a $2,500 cream silk Valentino jacket that the McCain staff had gotten her at Saks.
 At that point, Palin should have been savvy enough to tell those doing her makeover that she was a Wal-Mart mom. The sartorial upgrade was bound to turn into a strategy downgrade, as Palin pressed her case as a homespun gal who was ever so much more American than the elite, foreignish Obama, while she was gussied up in Italian couture.
 Politico broke the news that the Republican National Committee spent over $150,000 on a ''Pretty Woman''-style shopping spree for Palin, including about $75,000 at Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis and nearly $50,000 at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York and St. Louis.
 Palin advisers did their best to spin the fashion explosion during the economic implosion, telling The Times that she needed new outfits to match the climate changes across 50 states. 
 Republicans once more charged the media with sexism for reporting on Palin's Imelda Marcos closet. ''No one would blink if this was a male candidate buying Brooks Brothers suits,'' said William F. B. O'Reilly, a G.O.P. consultant.
 It doesn't wash to cry sexism now any more than it did at the beginning, when the campaign tried to use that dodge to divert attention from Palin's lacunae in the sort of knowledge you need to run the world. The press has written plenty about the vanities and extravagances of male candidates. (See: Haircuts, John Edwards and Bill Clinton.) Sexism would be to treat Palin differently, or more delicately, than one of the guys.
 The governor who spent all her time talking about how she had cleaned up excesses in Alaska, and would do the same in Washington, also went over the top on hair and makeup. As a former beauty pageant contestant and sports anchor on TV, Palin already seemed on top of her grooming before the McCain campaign made her traveling makeup artist, Amy Strozzi, the highest-paid individual on the campaign for the first two weeks of October. Ms. Strozzi, who earned an Emmy nomination for her war paint skills on the TV show ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' made $22,800 for the first half of this month.
 Governor Palin, who used to get her hair done at the Beehive in Wasilla and shop at an Anchorage consignment shop called Out of the Closet, paid her traveling hairstylist -- recommended by Cindy McCain -- $10,000 for the first half of October. 
 In The New York Times Magazine today, Robert Draper reveals that the campaign also hired a former New York stage and screen actress, Priscilla Shanks, to be her voice coach for the convention. The expense was listed in finance reports as Operating Expenditures and Get-Out-The-Vote consulting. Apparently getting out the vote includes teaching a potential vice president the correct way to pronounce ''nuclear.''
 The conservative big shots who have not deserted Palin and still think she can be Reagan in a Valentino skirt are furious at those who have mishandled the governor and dimmed her star power. They mourn that she may have to wait now until 2016 to get rid of the phony stench of designer populism.
 Makeovers are every woman's dream. But this makeover has simply pushed back Palin's dream of being president.

HEADLINE: Maybe Everyone Will Be a C.E.O.

BYLINE: By KELLEY HOLLAND. 
E-mail: newmanage@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SENATORS Barack Obama and John McCain have been competing fiercely to be president. But there is a win-win option for both of them: they could just take corporate jobs. 
 There are presidents everywhere in business these days -- corporate presidents, of course, but also presidents of divisions, regions and product lines. General Motors has around a dozen, from the president of the whole company to presidents in various countries to the president of its OnStar division. 
 Leonard M. Lodish, a consultant who is a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says the title of president has become much more common in the last 15 years among companies with whom he works. 
 But it is not only presidencies that have proliferated. Title inflation is rife in corporate America.
 There are seemingly endless numbers of chief officers -- of technology, marketing, sustainability, people, diversity and more. Vice chairmen (not so many vice chairwomen) are cropping up all over.
 ''Now you find instead of the head of human resources, it's chief people officer,'' said Steven E. Gross, the global rewards consulting leader at Mercer. ''The role hasn't changed. There is this upward pressure for everybody to have bigger titles.''
 And the title of managing director, once treasured on Wall Street, now sometimes appears with fancy add-ons. The late Bear Stearns, for example, had a number of senior managing directors, a title it dangled when it recruited managing directors from top-tier firms.
 Another round of title inflation may be at hand, because managers often dole out chiefdoms, directorships and vice presidencies in times of economic weakness as a substitute for raises and bonuses. 
 This year, Mr. Gross said, ''employers will use the recognition value of a title'' in lieu of pay increases.
 Certainly, fancy titles can make employees feel that they are scaling the ladder. A chief whatever officer may also be able to negotiate for more pay. 
 An early wave of title inflation occurred in the 1970s, when wage and price controls were in place, said Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the Wharton School. Employers sometimes handed out bigger titles to get around the controls and give valued employees raises, he said.
 On Wall Street, a bigger title can mean that an employee's base pay rises, even if his or her bonus is unchanged, said John E. Lee, the sector leader for United States global markets at Heidrick & Struggles. 
 An employee with a lofty title may also have more leverage in a meeting, or in dealings with customers or government officials. Impressive titles can be especially helpful for senior managers overseas, particularly if they or their employers aren't well known. 
 But, too often for companies, many positive effects of inflated titles are short-lived. For one thing, employees with big titles may want to be paid at a level that matches the words on their business cards.
 ''In the short term you're saving some money by giving them the title,'' Professor Cappelli said. ''But in the long term, it erodes the value of the hierarchy and it does lead people to want to cash in the title. And if they can't do it with you, they'll do it someplace else.''
 Too many titles or too-fancy titles can dilute the value of each one. Consider Kim Jong Il of North Korea, who has something like 1,200 formal and informal titles. Haile Selassie, who was emperor of Ethiopia, also held the titles of King of Kings and Conquering Lion of Judea. (It kind of makes president of the United States seem a little plain, doesn't it?)
 The same often holds true in corporate life. In the old days, maybe 20 years ago, companies generally had one C.E.O. at most, but that is not necessarily the case today. 
 The executive team at CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services firm, includes four chief executives -- some as leaders of divisions -- five presidents and a group president. In the sales force are numerous vice chairmen and executive vice presidents. 
 Robert McGrath, a spokesman for the firm, said the C.E.O. title represents ''significant revenue responsibility and operating responsibility for major business,'' while titles for ''sales professionals are honorary'' and awarded based on revenue generation over time. He says the title structure is consistent with standard practice in the industry.
 CB Richard Ellis does not limit how many people can earn a given title, but in many other organizations, the awarding of lofty titles can create logjams. If an employer limits how many people can hold a given title, and if people with that title don't move up or retire, more-junior employees may become frustrated and leave for other jobs. 
 Cranium, a toy company that was acquired by Hasbro earlier this year, took a different tack with titles. The co-founders, Richard Tait and Whit Alexander, let employees come up with their own titles, provided they accurately described what the employees did. As for themselves, Mr. Alexander became chief noodler, and Mr. Tait became the grand poo-bah. 
 Come to think of it, grand poo-bah has a nice ring to it. Maybe I'll try it out the next time I deal with the tech support people -- sorry, customer service specialists -- at the phone company.

HEADLINE: Economy Voters' Top Worry, But Agreement Stops There

BYLINE: By FRAN SILVERMAN

 BODY:
WITH just a few weeks to go before the presidential election, voters from wealthy suburban enclaves in Fairfield County to urban neighborhoods in Hartford expressed similar concerns about the deteriorating economy, but distinctly different views on whom to support on Election Day. 
 In Darien, Jay Wood, 61, a financial analyst at Merrill Lynch, said he was worried about his job and that he intended to vote for the Republican presidential candidate, Senator John McCain, because he shared his belief in the merits of a free market.
 ''Most of my concern has to do with finances,'' said Mr. Wood, as he grabbed a sandwich at Uncle's Deli in Darien Center. ''I don't think anyone has an answer on the economy, but I'd rather let the free market take care of it.''
 In Hartford, a state worker who said he has consistently voted Republican in the past said he was leaning toward the Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, because he thought Mr. Obama would do a better job addressing his concerns about layoffs amid climbing gas and grocery prices. 
 ''It's been eight years of damage by what Bush has done,'' said Jason Purslow, 41, a Cheshire resident who works for the State Department of Revenue Services.
 Mr. Purslow, who is married and has one child, said that while he originally supported the war in Iraq and considers himself anti-abortion, the state of the economy is trumping all of that as he heads into the voting booth, prepared to cast a ballot for Mr. Obama, who opposed the war from the start and supports abortion rights.
 In a state that has been decidedly blue since 1992 in presidential elections, but where unaffiliated voters outnumber Democrats and Republicans, many said this was one of the toughest election decisions they've ever had to make. The secretary of the state's office reported last week that 845,311 out of 2,021,749 registered voters called themselves unaffiliated.
 But as in the rest of the country, voters in Connecticut appear to be poised to go to the polls in droves. The secretary of the state also reported that huge numbers of voters have registered, including more than 50,000 just in October.
 In interviews, voters across the state talked about the tangled mix of issues they were sorting through as they prepared to cast their ballots on Nov. 4: the war in Iraq, the cost of health care and the experience that they believe each candidate has -- or lacks -- to lead the country through its troubles. Some said they worried the country was not ready for an African-American president; others said they were favoring McCain, until he picked Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska, as his running mate.
 Tonja Bailey, 47, a freelance court stenographer from Stamford, said the cost of health care was a main issue for her. As she headed into the Ferguson Library last week in this Democratic-leaning city, walking past signs for an upcoming Obama rally, Ms. Bailey said it was time for a change in leadership. Ms. Bailey, who is African-American, said she was voting for Mr. Obama not because he is black, but because he understands her financial concerns.
 ''We need a change but it's not about color. I agree with Obama that health care is a right,'' said Ms. Bailey, who is spending more than $500 a month on health insurance that just covers the basics. ''It's tough right now. It's very, very hard.''
 In Bridgeport, Lamicha Murphy, 40, a packer in a warehouse, said she was voting for Mr. Obama because she was turned off by Ms. Palin, who she said was too inexperienced to be president. But Ms. Murphy, who is African-American, said she worried about whether the country was ready for a black president and was concerned that harm might come to him if he is elected.
 Others seem so stumped by the choices -- or dissatisfied with both candidates -- that they said they were not voting at all. Carley Andrews Brown, 32, who was strolling in downtown Stamford with her 7-month old son, said she felt neither candidate understood her financial situation. This will be the first presidential election in which she said she doesn't plan to vote at all.
 Ms. Brown, who in previous elections has voted for Democratic candidates, said Mr. Obama doesn't seem to understand that in Fairfield County, making $250,000 a year doesn't make you wealthy, and she doesn't want to face paying more taxes.
 ''My husband is an auditor, but we are judged on his income as if we live in the Midwest,'' Ms. Brown said. ''I would like the candidates to say 'I will look at people's cost of living.' I would like to be seen as someone more middle class.'' 
 She said that she is worried that her husband, who works for a British bank, could lose his job.
 ''I just feel very disenfranchised as a voter. I feel like they are not listening to voters' real concerns,'' said Ms. Brown, a stay-at-home mother.
 In Darien, many residents commute to Manhattan and work in the hard-hit financial, real estate and insurance industries. Jenifer Jonson, 35, a stay-at-home mother whose husband works in the financial industry, supported Hillary Clinton in the primary, but she said she is not enamored of the two candidates in the general election.
 ''I haven't been happy with the choices in recent presidential elections, and this particular election even more so,'' said Ms. Jonson, sipping coffee during a meal with her 2-year-old twins at the Sugar Bowl Diner in town. 
 While Ms. Jonson said she approved of the $700 billion taxpayer bailout for financial firms, she did not think that either candidate had offered a sufficient comprehensive solution to the economic meltdown.
 Ms. Jonson said her husband has watched the size of his 401(k) shrink. She also said that all her friends were concerned about their spouses losing their jobs. 
 ''I think McCain is a little old,'' Ms. Jonson said. ''I think his greatest moments already have happened. Obama has potential for leadership, but I haven't seen it. We need someone brilliant. Someone with vision.'' 
 In Waterbury, a city at the crossroads of Route 8 and Interstate 84 that was once known for its brass industry, Wendell F. McKennerney, 82, a lifelong resident and retired history teacher, shared Ms. Jonson's concerns. He said he wasn't confident either candidate could lead the country through the current economic turmoil. 
 ''This is the first time I've been so undecided,'' he said. ''I worry very much for the country and for the future of my grandchildren.''
 Mr. McKennerney, who had stopped at a Walgreens in a strip mall outside the city, said he had paid off his mortgage and received a nice pension. But, he said, he has taken sharp losses in his stock portfolio. 
 ''I haven't yet had the courage to determine how much I have lost,'' he said. 
 In West Hartford, Nady Saila-Ngita, 18, a first-time voter and a freshman attending Tunxis Community College, said Mr. Obama was her man. As she sat with a friend in Blue Back Square, the town's newest retail development, she said the country needed a major change in perspective.
 ''I like Obama. He's different, and that is a really big thing. Maybe somebody new will be good for this country,'' Ms. Saila-Ngita said.
 Along the Naugatuck River in Shelton, Reagan Democrats helped swing this cluster of old mill towns for George Bush twice. In this part of Connecticut, many leaf-covered lawns are dotted with signs for Chris Shays, the 10-term Republican Congressional incumbent who is locked in a tight battle with his Democratic challenger, Jim Himes. On Main Street, at a trendy salon, workers say their dwindling bank accounts are influencing their vote for president.
 Amy Allen, 46, a singer turned esthetician for the New Day Hair and Skin Salon in town, said three clients had canceled appointments for facials earlier this month because they couldn't afford to pay. She said clients were crying when they called or telling her their fears when they do come in.
 ''We are their therapists,'' she said. ''Everyone is scared.''
 And Ms. Allen said she's having a very tough go herself. She said she is spending $60 to fill her gas tank to visit her ailing mother in Queens and is struggling to pay for home heating oil as her tips dwindle at the salon. She takes the bus to work to avoid buying gas.
 ''It's just a whole other world. I used to sing and make up jingles but the places I did that for closed down. Now I peel faces,'' Ms. Allen said.
 Ms. Allen and a co-worker, Jill Breeden, 30, from Ansonia, who cuts hair, said they were going to vote for Mr. Obama.
 ''I want a major change,'' Ms. Allen said.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the views of Connecticut residents on the presidential campaign misidentified the occupation of one voter, Jay Wood of Darien. He is a financial adviser for Merrill Lynch, not a financial analyst. The article also misstated Mr. Wood's attitude toward his employment. He did not say he was worried about his job.

Jenifer Jonson, 35, of Darien, with daughter Francine, right, voted for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primary but doesn't like either major party nominee.
THE SPECTRUM: Wendell F. McKennerney, 82, of Waterford, far left, said, ''This is the first time I've been so undecided.'' Carley Andrews Brown, 32, left, of Stamford, said she was disturbed about Mr. Obama's tax proposals. Nady Saila-Ngita, 18, a college student from West Hartford, likes Mr. Obama.
 SPLIT: Tonja Bailey, 47, of Stamford, left, said she was worried about finances and pays $500 a month for basic medical insurance. She plans to vote for Mr. Obama. Jay Wood, 61, of Darien, a Merrill Lynch employee who said he was concerned about his job, said he was voting for Senator John McCain. When it comes to the economy, he said, ''I'd rather let the free market take care of it.'' (PHOTOGRAPHS BY THOMAS MCDONALD FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)(CT6)

HEADLINE: Leaders of Europe and Asia Call for Joint Economic Action

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Leaders from across Asia and Europe gathered in Beijing on Friday and Saturday and called for a coordinated response to the global financial crisis, in an event that underlined China's growing role as a diplomatic counterweight to the United States, but fell short of offering specific solutions. 
 In the difficult balance between preserving financial innovation and ensuring adequate regulation, the presidents, prime ministers and other leaders clearly tilted toward more regulation. A joint statement at the conference did not suggest how to accomplish this, but noted that ''necessary and timely measures should be taken.''
 The statement did not exclude innovation, but indicated the preference of the attendees: ''Leaders were of the view that to resolve the financial crisis it is imperative to handle properly the relationship between financial innovation and regulation and to maintain sound macroeconomic policy. They recognized the need to improve the supervision and regulation of all financial actors, in particular their accountability.''
 China said that it would attend the international conference in Washington on Nov. 15 that President Bush has organized. But without directly criticizing the United States, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China noted that the effect of global financial turmoil on his country's financial institutions had been muted.
 China has moved cautiously in allowing greater financial competition and in permitting money to flow in and out of the country. ''We need financial innovation, but we need financial oversight even more,'' Mr. Wen said at a news conference in Beijing on Saturday, according to Reuters.
 President Bush and his advisers have also accepted a need for more regulation in some areas. But in a subtle yet potentially important difference of tone that reflects many years of more market-oriented policies in the United States than in Europe or Asia, the Bush administration has repeatedly said that regulation should not prevent banks and other financial institutions from finding effective yet safe ways to meet their customers' needs.
 David H. McCormick, the under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, said in a speech in Hong Kong on Wednesday that, ''we have undoubtedly learned that our own financial system is in need of reform.''
 But he later added, ''It would be unfortunate if, as a result of this turmoil, policy makers in China mistakenly abandon their pursuit of financial sector innovation and liberalization that has been so important to supporting China's growth in productivity and macroeconomic stability.''
 The event in Beijing drew heads of state and other top officials of the 27 member countries of the European Union, the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as well as China, Japan, South Korea, India and Pakistan. 
 Asian nations do not share the close economic policy coordination that the European Union has fostered, and pan-Asian gatherings seldom put forth detailed proposals for international economic policy changes. 
 This pattern showed up again with the lack of specifics in the statement issued at the conference. It declared that, ''Authorities of all countries should demonstrate vision and resolution and take firm, decisive and effective measures in a responsible and timely manner to rise to the challenge of the financial crisis.''

HEADLINE: Reading List: The Coming Anti-Bush-Book Bust

BYLINE: By ALEX and CHRISTOPHER BEAM. 
Alex Beam is a columnist at The Boston Globe and the author of ''A Great Idea at the Time: The Rise, Fall, and Curious Afterlife of the Great Books,'' to be published next month.Christopher Beam is a political reporter for Slate.

 BODY:
One segment of the economy will crash for sure on Jan. 20, 2009: the land-office business in anti-George W. Bush books. Through every fault of its own, the Bush-Cheney White House has been a money-belching milch cow for serious critics and random freebooters who understand that a catchy Bushophobic book title generally translates into solid sales. Herewith a pre-postmortem on the genre:
 Bushwhacked: Life in George W. Bush's America,by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (2003). Two Texas journalists with bulging notebooks get the ball rolling with an omnibus takedown/mockery of our 43rd president. 
 Sales: Reached No. 4 on the New York Times best-seller list. Impact: Along with Al Franken's ''Lies (And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them),'' starts the anti-Bush publishing avalanche. Sad note: Ivins died in 2007, without seeing Bush leave office. Excerpt: ''Policy Matters; stop the presses.'' 
 Dude, Where's My Country?,by Michael Moore (2003). The showboat documentarian makes the case for ousting Bush. 
 Sales: No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list. Original reporting: God tells Moore about his opposition to Bush. Sage prediction: Moore floats Oprah for president. Inevitable reader reaction: At least this guy's not president. Impact: Bush re-elected. 
 The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill,by Ron Suskind (2004). Suskind casts the former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, one of the Bush administration's first high-profile defectors, as the One Just Man. 
 Sales: Mission accomplished. Original reporting: Suskind maps out the Bush power structure. Turns out Karl Rove is running the Treasury Department. Impact: Cabinet secretaries sign up literary agents. The price of royalties: Suskind returns to the well for two more Bush-bashers. 
 Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror,by Richard A. Clarke (2004). The former terrorism czar accuses the Bushies of falling asleep at the Al Qaeda corral. 
 Sales: Big casino. Revelations: Not much that wasn't self-evident on Sept. 11. Predictable push-back: ''Deeply irresponsible.'' -- Condoleezza Rice Impact: Best-seller status emboldens Clarke to publish two novels, ''The Scorpion's Gate'' and ''Breakpoint.'' 
 The I Hate George W. Bush Reader: Why Dubya Is Wrong About Absolutely Everything,by Clint Willis (2004). This misleadingly titled volume contains well-argued essays by mostly froth-free authors. 
 Why hate? ''He's mean,'' ''he's anti-American,'' ''he's corrupt,'' ''he gets away with it.'' Impact: Spawned copycat ''I Hate'' readers for Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft, Condoleezza Rice and Republicans in general. 
 Bush on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President,by Justin Frank (2004). A psychoanalyst traces Bush's brash personality and Manichaean worldview back to his absentee father and ''cold disciplinarian'' of a mother. 
 Sales: Even we didn't buy it. Psychobabble: ''How can someone so friendly and playful be the same person who cuts funds from government programs aiding the poor and hungry?'' Scoop: Bush displays an ''anal/sadistic'' indifference to the pain of others. Unasked question: ''How did that make you feel?'' 
 Bush Must Go: The Top Ten Reasons Why George Bush Doesn't Deserve a Second Term,by Bill Press (2004). An MSNBC commentator ham-handedly purloins David Letterman's famous format. 
 Sales: Friends and blood relatives. Argument 1: ''He lied us into war.'' Argument 2: ''He has made us less safe from terrorism.'' Arguments 3 to 10: You get the drift. Policy impact: Bush stays. 
 Worse than Watergate: The Secret Presidency of George Bush,by John W. Dean (2004). The perennial skunk at the picnic suggests that Bush is more duplicitous than -- gasp! -- Richard Nixon. 
 Sales: Strong. Noted: Carl Bernstein agrees with Dean. Also noted: Brad Pitt will play Dean in the forthcoming movie ''Dirty Tricks.'' Sharon Stone will play Katharine Graham. 
 The Politics of Truth. Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir,by Joseph Wilson (2004). The roving ambassador turned Vanity Fair poster boy savors his 15 minutes. 
 Sales: Mid five figures. Hamburger Helper: He needed 513 pages to rehash his 1,500-word New York Times Op-Ed piece, ''What I Didn't Find in Africa''? Fallout: Lewis (Scooter) Libby sentenced for lying to investigators about his role in outing Wilson's wife, making a Libby book deal seem inevitable. Thanks, Joe. 
 The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot, by Naomi Wolf (2007). Wolf goes all in, says George Bush's United States is on the road to fascism. 
 Reception: ''You're way out there on this stuff.'' -- Fox News Reception, Part Deux: ''Ne pas manquer.'' (''Not to be missed.'') -- Amazon France In case you missed it: She compares Bush's America to Nazi Germany. Missed blurb opportunity for: Jonah Goldberg. 
 Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. Bush,by Robert Draper (2007). A GQ and Texas Monthly scribe snags six hours of interviews with the president. 
 Sales: Respectable. That explains a lot: ''I really do not feel comfortable in the role of analyzing myself.'' Shocking revelations: Bush's post-election plan is to ''replenish the ol' coffers.'' One-word review: Bush calls the interviews ''worthless.'' Fallout: Bush's suggestion that disbanding the Iraqi Army wasn't part of his plan prompts L. Paul Bremer III to release letters showing that Bush knew all about it. 
 The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder,by Vincent Bugliosi (2008). The famed Los Angeles prosecutor and acclaimed crime writer builds the case for a murder trial. 
 Sales: Best seller despite mainstream media blackout. Gist: Bugliosi holds Bush accountable for 100,000 Iraqi deaths. Outlandish claim: A judge could sentence Bush to death. Pull quote: Bugliosi addresses the reader as ''stupido.'' 
 What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception,by Scott McClellan (2008). The former Bush flack accuses bosses of misleading him and the American people on Iraq and the C.I.A. leak case. 
 The L-word: ''Top White House officials who knew the truth -- including Rove, Libby and possibly Vice President Cheney -- allowed me, even encouraged me, to repeat a lie.'' Speak, memory: McClellan overhears Bush telling a friend he doesn't remember if he did cocaine or not. The critics rave: ''Snitch.'' -- Matt Drudge. ''This is not the Scott we knew.'' -- Dana Perino, current White House press secretary. 
 Goodnight Bush: A Parody,by Gan Golan and Eric Origen (2008). A successful parody of the 1947 children's classic ''Goodnight Moon.'' 
 The takeaway: Goodnight George, and happy trails; Thanks so much for boosting sales!

HEADLINE: Desperately Seeking Seriousness

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Maybe the polls and the conventional wisdom are all wrong, and John McCain will pull off a stunning upset. But right now the election looks like a blue sweep: a solid victory, maybe even a landslide, for Barack Obama; large Democratic gains in the Senate, possibly even enough to produce a filibuster-proof majority; and big Democratic gains in the House, too.
 Yet just six weeks ago the presidential race seemed close, with Mr. McCain if anything a bit ahead. The turning point was the middle of September, coinciding precisely with the sudden intensification of the financial crisis after the failure of Lehman Brothers. But why has the growing financial and economic crisis worked so overwhelmingly to the Democrats' advantage? 
 As someone who's spent a lot of time arguing against conservative economic dogma, I'd like to believe that the bad news convinced many Americans, once and for all, that the right's economic ideas are wrong and progressive ideas are right. And there's certainly something to that. These days, with even Alan Greenspan admitting that he was wrong to believe that the financial industry could regulate itself, Reaganesque rhetoric about the magic of the marketplace and the evils of government intervention sounds ridiculous.
 In addition, Mr. McCain seems spectacularly unable to talk about economics as if it matters. He has attempted to pin the blame for the crisis on his pet grievance, Congressional budget earmarks -- which leaves economists scratching their heads in puzzlement. In the immediate aftermath of the Lehman failure, he declared that ''the fundamentals of our economy are strong,'' seemingly unaware that he was closely echoing what Herbert Hoover said after the 1929 crash.
 But I suspect that the main reason for the dramatic swing in the polls is something less concrete and more meta than the fact that events have discredited free-market fundamentalism. As the economic scene has darkened, I'd argue, Americans have rediscovered the virtue of seriousness. And this has worked to Mr. Obama's advantage, because his opponent has run a deeply unserious campaign.
 Think about the themes of the McCain campaign so far. Mr. McCain reminds us, again and again, that he's a maverick -- but what does that mean? His maverickness seems to be defined as a free-floating personality trait, rather than being tied to any specific objections on his part to the way the country has been run for the last eight years. 
 Conversely, he has attacked Mr. Obama as a ''celebrity,'' but without any specific explanation of what's wrong with that -- it's just a given that we're supposed to hate Hollywood types.
 And the selection of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential candidate clearly had nothing to do with what she knew or the positions she'd taken -- it was about who she was, or seemed to be. Americans were supposed to identify with a hockey mom who was just like them.
 In a way, you can't blame Mr. McCain for campaigning on trivia -- after all, it's worked in the past. Most notably, President Bush got within hanging-chads-and-butterfly-ballot range of the White House only because much of the news media, rather than focusing on the candidates' policy proposals, focused on their personas: Mr. Bush was an amiable guy you'd like to have a beer with, Al Gore was a stiff know-it-all, and never mind all that hard stuff about taxes and Social Security. And let's face it: six weeks ago Mr. McCain's focus on trivia seemed to be paying off handsomely.
 But that was before the prospect of a second Great Depression concentrated the public's mind.
 The Obama campaign has hardly been fluff-free -- in its early stages it was full of vague uplift. But the Barack Obama voters see now is cool, calm, intellectual and knowledgeable, able to talk coherently about the financial crisis in a way Mr. McCain can't. And when the world seems to be falling apart, you don't turn to a guy you'd like to have a beer with, you turn to someone who might actually know how to fix the situation.
 The McCain campaign's response to its falling chances of victory has been telling: rather than trying to make the case that Mr. McCain really is better qualified to deal with the economic crisis, the campaign has been doing all it can to trivialize things again. Mr. Obama consorts with '60s radicals! He's a socialist! He doesn't love America! Judging from the polls, it doesn't seem to be working.
 Will the nation's new demand for seriousness last? Maybe not -- remember how 9/11 was supposed to end the focus on trivialities? For now, however, voters seem to be focused on real issues. And that's bad for Mr. McCain and conservatives in general: right now, to paraphrase Rob Corddry, reality has a clear liberal bias.

HEADLINE: Taking the Nation's Pulse, If We Pick Up the Phone

BYLINE: By GERRI HIRSHEY. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HAMDEN
IT'S suppertime in America. A few pizza-chomping students getting off a shuttle bus from the main campus of Quinnipiac University are headed toward a long, voluble evening toiling in the carrels of public opinion polling. They will be calling voters in four heartland swing states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Colorado.
As the polling shift files in to work, the setting sun haloes the pink-toned Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, perched on a hillside beneath Sleeping Giant mountain. For the next three hours, they will be asking voters about the two presidential candidates and their second debate performances, about George W. Bush and the economy.
It has been a touchy time to dial up 401(k)-challenged Main Streeters fretting over their meatloaf. This Friday night, Oct. 10, closes a week that saw the Dow bungee cord snap, plunging that industrial index 679 points the previous afternoon. 
Despite the gloom, Doug Schwartz, director of the poll, cannot stop smiling here in his top floor aerie with a view of Sleeping Giant. That other drowsing titan, the electorate, has been roused to startling public candor and voter registration numbers. And for a lifelong civics aficionado with a doctorate in political science and a stint as Ed Bradley's election analyst on CBS News, nights like this one are exhilarating.
''This is the best, the most fascinating election in my lifetime,'' Dr. Schwartz says. ''It's the first without an incumbent candidate since 1952. And we have those other firsts -- a viable African-American candidate. And Hillary Clinton. And young voters are registering in impressive numbers.''
It is his challenge, as both designer and analyst of the surveys, to tell us where it's all headed. In the decades since an unwitting start as a professor's marketing survey in 1988, Quinnipiac polls -- unaffiliated, not-for-hire and rigorously vetted -- have become respected gauges of public opinion nationwide. The Institute polls year-round on issues from local bond referendums to Mayor Bloomberg's bid for a third term in New York. In these days of snap polls and CNN's live audience, hand-held ''people meters,'' Dr. Schwartz is an unapologetic Luddite, eschewing automated robo-call polls for live interviews. ''I trust the data more,'' he says. And he relies on his longtime associate poll director, April Radocchio, to manage an interviewer force of up to 160.
''When we started out, it was basically Doug and me and a few phones,'' recalls Ms. Radocchio. ''I think they were rotary dial.'' Besides overseeing interviewing and data collection, she has designed a rigorous set of fail-safe measures, including follow up interviews by supervisors to insure that procedures were correctly followed and that callers were accurate and courteous. She echoes Dr. Schwartz's credo: ''You're only as good as your numbers.''
And your interviewers. Exactly who is calling you from Quinnipiac? Housed in the Institute's commodious lower level, the calling center is a civil, convivial hive of students, family folks working second jobs and seniors, all paid $9.50 an hour for shifts from 6 to 9:30 p.m. -- depending on the time zone being polled. As the shift begins, callers are adjusting their headsets and watching their computer screens light up with the first live numbers of the night. The numbers are dialed randomly by computer.
''An average night will see my machine dial 150 to 200 calls,'' says Erin Kelly, a Quinnipiac junior who has been working here since November 2006. ''And sometimes I'm lucky if I complete a questionnaire with four people.'' Ms. Kelly has found that some responses tend to skew geographically. ''In New York, it's 'Sorry, no time for that.' In Florida it's 'How dare you call at 9?' New Jersey just doesn't tend to like participating, period.'' Nonetheless, she says, ''Most people are very nice.''
There is a specific questionnaire, administered by callers well trained in keeping respondents to crisp, one- or two-word answers. Ideally, such surveys should take 7 to 9 minutes. They rarely do.
If people want to talk when the questionnaire is done, Virginia King, 78, does not cut them off. ''Sitting here in Connecticut, it's quite an eye-opener. Senior citizens everywhere are just so worried, so -- well, just beset now. In Florida, taxes are a huge issue. There are lots of referendums about it. They can't sell their homes down there.''
Ms. King, retired from careers in word processing and real estate, hears America sighing, catches the strains of some hopelessness in Ohio, in Pennsylvania. ''Those states are really feeling the impact of lost jobs. A lot of people have told me they're leaving Ohio.''
For all the reports of a surge in registrations of young voters, says Ms. King, ''You can't get them to participate in a poll. They're always in a hurry.'' In seven years of calling, she says, ''I think I've interviewed three first-time voters.''
At the end of many interviews, some respondents thank Ms. King. For what? ''They say it gives them a chance to vent. They feel nobody asks for their opinions, and it's a relief to tell somebody, even if it doesn't count.''
It's a quiet alienation that others are hearing as well. Sometimes, voters are so down on themselves, they grouse, ''You don't want to hear from me.'' Or ''I'm too old for anyone to care.''
Enter Quinnipiac's secret weapon. Leone Mancinelli's toffee-smooth, cultured voice telegraphs a long career in radio broadcasting. He has been working at the Institute for eight years, and when a potential interviewee carps about age, he challenges, ''I'll make you a bet, and if I win, you'll answer my few questions. I'll bet I'm older than you.''
Then he tells them he has just turned 90. ''Believe me, their tone changes.''
Mr. Mancinelli, too, believes that once he gets his data, it's a fair exchange to listen. ''They do get very worked up -- it might take 25 minutes to complete a 7-minute questionnaire. My wife asks me, 'How can you have this much patience?' ''
Mr. Mancinelli says that parsing the roaring, whining, reasoned and perplexed voice of We the People sure beats the nightly alternative. ''After I retired, I sat in a chair and fell asleep in front of the TV. When I woke it was 10 at night. I didn't care for that.''
Dapper in silver wire-rims and a crisp Eisenhower jacket, he slips the headphones on once again, faces the blinking screen and says, politely, to Michigan, ''Hello, this is Leone calling for the Quinnipiac University poll in Hamden, Connecticut.''

HEADLINE: While Some Republicans Feel the Weight of Bush's Image, a Senator in Maine Soars

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me. 

 BODY:
It is shaping up as one of the most challenging years that anyone can remember for Republican senators seeking re-election. But as other Republican incumbents elsewhere are battling for their political lives, Senator Susan Collins appears to be gliding toward a third term. 
 Recent voter polls showed Ms. Collins heading into the final stretch of the race with a double-digit lead over her Democratic challenger, Representative Tom Allen. Mr. Allen is a well-known and well-regarded congressman with a strong fund-raising record -- a model candidate as far as the national Democrats are concerned, in a state that has voted for Democrats in the last four presidential elections. 
 But he just cannot seem to gain any traction against Ms. Collins, who has presented herself as a moderate with a long record of work on bipartisan legislation. 
 While other Republican incumbents have found themselves brutally assailed by Democrats as allies of President Bush, who is mortally unpopular, and have seen their poll numbers plummet as a result of the financial crisis, Ms. Collins has offered Republicans a very bright spot on an otherwise bleak political map. 
 ''She is absolutely untouchable,'' said Rebecca Fisher, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''It truly is a case where she has elevated above party. She is their senator, and they love her, and they don't care about anyone else.
 ''They don't care about Washington or how bad the Republican brand is or who is president. She has just been a star.'' 
 In New Hampshire, next door, and in Oregon, across the country, two states that like Maine have shifted heavily toward the Democrats in recent years, the political landscape could not be more different. 
 In Oregon, Senator Gordon H. Smith, a Republican, has tried to emphasize his ability to reach across the aisle by running television advertisements featuring his past work with Democrats, including the Democratic candidate for president, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, and the 2004 nominee, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. But his Democratic opponent, Jeff Merkley, the speaker of the State House, has tied Mr. Smith to Mr. Bush and leads the polls. 
 And in New Hampshire, the Republican incumbent, John E. Sununu, continues to campaign vigorously on behalf of the party's presidential team, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, even though it could cost him votes among independents. Mr. Sununu's Democratic challenger, former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, is ahead in that race. 
 But in Maine, Ms. Collins has cut her own path. While she is the state co-chairwoman of the McCain campaign, she recently disavowed a barrage of automated phone calls that attacked Mr. Obama, and she called on Mr. McCain to stop the calls, which threatened to infuriate voters. 
 ''She has really been able to differentiate herself from President Bush,'' said MaryEllen FitzGerald, the president of Critical Insights, a marketing and research firm that found Ms. Collins leading by 12 points in a poll released late last week. 
 ''She is very popular,'' Ms. FitzGerald said. ''She draws from Democrats as well as Republicans. She really is bipartisan. I can't ever remember anybody saying anything disparaging about her.'' 
 And at a time when the biggest liability for many candidates is that they are Republicans, Mr. Allen's biggest liability seems to be his close ties to the Democrats. 
 ''He has good name-recognition,'' Ms. FitzGerald said. ''He is well-known. But there is not a level of dissatisfaction with her and she has not repositioned herself in any way.'' She added: ''Tom Allen has really always closely identified as a Democrat. He votes in lockstep with the party. He defines himself first and foremost as a Democrat.'' 
 The Democrats now have a slim Senate majority, 51 to 49, including two independents who mostly side with the Democrats. But with Republicans expected to lose as many as nine Senate seats in the Nov. 4 election, most of the Republican incumbents who are well-positioned for re-election are those from the reddest of states, like Pat Roberts in Kansas, Thad Cochran in Mississippi, Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Michael B. Enzi in Wyoming. 
 In Maine, Mr. Allen has insisted that Ms. Collins has supported the Bush White House much more consistently than she admits. ''If you approve of his policies, you should vote for her,'' he said in a recent debate at the University of Southern Maine here. 
 But the associations with Mr. Bush refuse to stick. 
 Ms. Collins, who speaks with the slow, gentle cadence of a kindly aunt or a patient teacher, has repeatedly called for ending ''the hyper-partisanship in Washington'' while accusing Mr. Allen of toeing the Democratic line more than she sided with Mr. Bush. ''I am one of the least partisan members of Congress,'' she said at their debate. ''My opponent is one of the most partisan members of Congress.'' 
 Still, she is willing to engage in political maneuvering. Challenged recently over her decision to seek a third term, after promising earlier to serve just two, Ms. Collins said, ''The world is a very different place than it was in 1996.''
 ''I don't think it's wrong to change your mind when circumstances change,'' she added. 
 After the debate, she told a voter concerned about health care who came up to talk to her that she was open to supporting Mr. Obama's health care plan, should he be elected president. ''I actually think his plan is pretty good,'' Ms. Collins said.

HEADLINE: Candidate Close-Up

 BODY:
Over the last year and a half, The New York Times has taken a close look at the life and career of Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic nominee for president. Brief summaries of the major biographical and investigative articles that have appeared in The Times are below, listed in order of publication and covering Mr. Obama's unconventional youth, his Chicago ties, his finances and his political rise.
 Investments and Donors, Intertwined 
 Mr. Obama invested in a biotech concern and a satellite communications company shortly after he was elected to the United States Senate. Some big political donors were principal investors. March 7, 2007, by Mike McIntire and Christopher Drew.
 Young, Gifted and Biracial in Hawaii
 In his private high school, B-student Barry talked basketball and wrote poetry, classmates remember. His sister recalls a restless seeker in search of a cultural identity. March 17, 2007, by Jennifer Steinhauer.
 The Pastor Problem
 He grew up sampling faiths but practicing none. When he found the church for him, it came with a firebrand preacher who was as much about the past as Mr. Obama was about the future. April 30, 2007, by Jodi Kantor.
 Schooled in the State Senate
 Mr. Obama earned his politics degree from the Illinois Legislature. He skipped grades there, too, as he excelled in pragmatism, strategy and a little extracurricular hardball. July 30, 2007, by Janny Scott.
 Professor vs. Panther
 Bobby Rush, former Black Panther, was a legend in the Chicago neighborhood he represented in Congress. That didn't stop Mr. Obama from taking him on in 1999. And losing badly. Among the lessons learned, in the words of an adviser: ''Speak more Irish and less Harvard.'' Sept. 9, 2007, by Janny Scott.
 New York, New York
 He wrote about Soviet nuclear disarmament at Columbia and mobilized student volunteers at City College in Harlem, but mostly his Manhattan years are a closed book. Oct. 30, 2007, by Janny Scott.
 The 'Present' Vote
 Of the more than 6,000 votes Mr. Obama cast in the Illinois Senate, it is the 150 ''present'' votes that have drawn the most scrutiny. He says the vote was a common tactic to register objections to provisions in bills, or to protest bills he thought had been drafted unconstitutionally, or as part of a broader legislative strategy, but his use of the tactic (on a juvenile crime bill, for example) led to accusations that he sidestepped tough issues. Dec. 20, 2007, by Raymond Hernandez and Christopher Drew.
 The Not-Sharpton Candidate
 A postracial style that wants constant refinement, and not a little tightrope-walking, to woo white voters without losing black voters, and vice versa. Dec. 29, 2007, by Janny Scott.
 A 'Passed' Bill That Didn't
 He took up the cause of Illinoisans outraged that Exelon Corporation had not disclosed radioactive leaks at one of its plants. But the notification bill Mr. Obama championed in the Senate for a while, and cites as an achievement, never passed, even in a watered-down version that would have made reporting of leaks voluntary. Feb. 3, 2008, by Mike McIntire.
 Back When He Was 'Barry'
 Mr. Obama recalls his youthful self dabbling in pot, cocaine and alcohol, but old friends are less sure that was his scene. Feb. 9, by Serge F. Kovaleski.
 The Antoin Rezko Connection
 A Chicago entrepreneur who raised tens of thousands of dollars for Mr. Obama's campaigns and helped him in a real estate deal is indicted on federal charges of business fraud and influence peddling involving the Illinois governor. An examination in two parts of the senator's relationship with a major patron. June 14, 2007, and March 2, 2008, by Christopher Drew and Mike McIntire.
 A Star Goes to Washington
 Unimpressed by the ''glacial pace'' of the Senate, Mr. Obama begins to test the warmer waters beyond. March 9, by Kate Zernike and Jeff Zeleny.
 An Unconventional Mother
 She's described as the ''white mother from Kansas,'' but Stanley Ann (her father wanted a boy) was unconstrained by cultural, racial or geographical boundaries. Her son, Barack, both embraced and bridled at that free spirit. March 14, by Janny Scott.
 Birth of a Chicago Pragmatist
 He courted the left, then moved to the center. He had Palestinian friends and Jewish mentors. He ran on reform, and cultivated party bosses. In becoming the consummate politician, he was hard to pin down. May 11, by Jo Becker and Christopher Drew.
 A Writer First, a Politician Second
 ''Dreams From My Father'' sowed the seeds. ''The Audacity of Hope'' reaped them. Mr. Obama's writing career in ways parallels his political career. A natural storyteller, he leaves an impression of ease that obscures a more complex amalgam of drive, ambition and timing. May 18, by Janny Scott.
 The Organizer on a Journey
 In moving to Chicago to be an organizer, Mr. Obama for the first time lived and worked among African-Americans. For three years, he taught and also got an education ''better than anything I got at Harvard Law School.'' July 7, by Serge Kovaleski.
 A Popular Law Teacher, Testing Ideas
 Leading debates on contentious topics with a sometimes galling neutrality, Mr. Obama drew students out on rights, race and gender. Professorial reserve, or political caution? July 30, by Jodi Kantor.
 Obamanomics
 There's a vast disagreement on just how liberal Mr. Obama is on the economy. He offers detailed proposals, but no obvious ideology. ''My core economic theory is pragmatism,'' he says, ''figuring out what works.'' Call him a free-market-loving, big-spending, fiscally conservative wealth redistributionist. Aug. 24, by David Leonhardt.
 The Weatherman 'in My Neighborhood'
 In Chicago in 1969, Bill Ayers helped hatch the Weathermen, a group of anti-Vietnam War militants who spread the message via bomb. Fast forward to 1995, when Obama met Mr. Ayers as the two helped hatch a school-reform project. How close was their subsequent relationship? Oct. 4, by Scott Shane.
 Lobbying vs. Advertising
 Mr. Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, accuses a McCain campaign counterpart of selling access to public officials on behalf of his lobbying clients. But Mr. Axelrod has ties of his own to corporate interests. He has not, however, ever registered as a lobbyist, and says there is a distinction between lobbying and the kind of public relations and advertising work he has done. Oct. 18, by Mike McIntire.

HEADLINE: Climate

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
SENATOR MCCAIN co-authored legislation in 2003 to cap greenhouse gases and said at a hearing: ''It is time for the United States government to do its part to address this global problem, and a discussion of mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required.'' 
 But this year, he has sometimes appeared to soften his stance. At a news conference in June, he said: ''I believe in the cap-and-trade system, as you know. I would not at this time make those -- impose a mandatory cap at this time. But I do believe that we have to establish targets for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions over time.''
 His climate plan, like his opponent's, includes a declining ceiling for emissions and allows polluters who surpass targets to sell credits to others who have fallen short. But under the McCain plan, the initial emissions permits would be given away, not sold, saving billions of dollars for the industries affected. Targets could also be achieved by investing in ''carbon offsets,'' which are produced by avoiding emissions elsewhere.
 SENATOR OBAMA envisions legislation that leaves scant wiggle room on emissions cuts and exacts a price from the start for emissions permits. He would use $15 billion a year from those proceeds to promote non-polluting energy sources and cut energy waste.
 In the second debate, Mr. Obama said investments in boosting energy efficiency and the use of non-polluting sources would be part of his economic recovery plan and would not be sacrificed even under a constricted budget.
 But he has been criticized by climate activists, who otherwise tend to support him, for statements about pursuing ''clean coal'' as a climate strategy, one that Mr. McCain also advocates. The phrase ''clean coal'' historically has applied to capturing sulfur dioxide and other contaminants released by burning coal. Capturing carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping emission, is far harder. 
 THE CONTEXT 
 It is hard to see how legislation that, by design, raises the cost of energy will take hold in Congress while the economy remains in turmoil. Some environmentalists are pushing for a focus on more research or actions a president can take without legislation. 
 On the international front, prospects are poor for significant progress. Globally, and particularly in China and India, economies are being fueled mainly by an ever-expanding use of coal. The next president will take office just 11 months before a deadline that the world's nations have set for a new climate treaty, a situation that many experts say almost guarantees a weak result.

PERSON: John McCain 

HEADLINE: John McCain, Flexible Aggression

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
Senator John McCain races through the final days of the presidential race reciting a familiar admonition. It is the same mantra he has called upon to steel himself for moments of conflict as a collegiate boxer at the Naval Academy, a prisoner of war bracing for interrogation, a legislator twisting arms for votes, or as a Republican primary candidate rallying crowds against an all-but-certain defeat. 
 ''Game face on!'' he murmurs to himself, borrowing the advice of so many athletic coaches. 
 Some friends say the expression is a metaphor for an essential tension that runs through Mr. McCain's life. He is often deliberative, self-critical and flexible, his advisers and fellow senators say, and has frequently corrected course during his 36 years in public life. ''He is a much more supple mind than he is usually portrayed,'' said Philip Bobbitt, an international relations scholar and Democrat the senator consulted this summer. 
 But when he confronts an adversary, a starkly different John McCain can emerge, fired up with certainty for an all-or-nothing battle. ''I am going to win this thing and you are going to have to run me over to defeat me,'' said former Senator Bob Kerrey, a Democrat close to Mr. McCain, explaining his friend's attitude. ''It is a face that makes his opponent think, 'I don't know if I want to get my nose bloodied by this guy.' ''
 The conflicting impulses toward deliberation and aggression have been the alternating currents of his singular career and, if Mr. McCain wins the White House, could shape his presidency. As a Navy pilot, Mr. McCain has written, he let his ''cockiness'' deafen him to the risk of a buzzer warning of enemy fire. But as a returning prisoner of war he drew nuanced conclusions about political leadership and public opinion that have left him at some times a dove (Lebanon, Somalia ) and others a hawk (the Balkans, Iraq). 
 In the Senate, he is almost as well known for his handwritten apology notes as for his outbursts. (''I think I learned a few things in prison but possibly one of the most important things was the value of friendship,'' Mr. McCain wrote in one note provided to The Times. ''Chalk it up to the 'McCain temper.' '') He fires advisers who disappoint or embarrass him, but then keeps seeking their advice. He frets publicly that his ambition might tempt him to compromise his principles, but he also races headlong into battles in pursuit of political power. 
 If elected, Mr. McCain would arrive well-scarred at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: 72 years old, the oldest president to enter office, the first Vietnam veteran, a survivor of five and a half years in a North Vietnamese prison camp who could also have a son at war. Jimmy McCain, a Marine, recently returned from Iraq, while his brother John Sidney McCain IV, a Naval Academy midshipman, could be on the way. 
 Driven as much by his notion of honor as by ideology, Mr. McCain could make an unpredictable -- his critics say ''erratic'' -- chief executive. By default he is a limited-government conservative, but he readily bends those convictionsif a cause seems worthy. He has regularly picked fights with both parties over everything from the tax policy to the war on Iraq, but also knows how to force through bipartisan deals.
 Mr. McCain has called his decision-making style ''instinctive, often impulsive,'' as he put it in ''Worth the Fighting For,'' a 2002 memoir written with his aide Mark Salter. ''I don't torture myself over decisions. I make them as quickly as I can, quicker than the other fellow if I can.''
 But he also says he has also learned to cultivate what Navy pilots called ''situational awareness'' -- gathering as much information as possible about the context of any decision, including an inventory of his weaknesses and his enemy's strengths. He got a lesson in its importance 41 years ago over Hanoi. 
 Convinced of his invulnerability, ''I placed too much faith on what was beyond my knowledge or control: luck,'' Mr. McCain wrote with Mr. Salter in a recent book, ''Hard Call.'' ''I had five and a half very long years to regret my decision and the lapse in self-awareness.''
 A Reflective Gadfly
 Politically and intellectually, Mr. McCain is a gadfly. Most other lawmakers cultivate one area of expertise like health care, foreign affairs or the budget. Senator McCain, at the apex of his career, hopscotches in and out of pet causes, from patients' rights to sue health insurers to fuel-efficiency standards to defense contract cost overruns. 
 He reads widely, not only in public policy but also in fiction and history. An aide who looked in his briefcase in July found three books he was reading, two of which he has echoed in public statements since then.
 One was ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams,'' by the hawkish foreign policy thinker Robert Kagan, which posits a return to regional great power politics and arguably anticipated Russia's recent incursion into Georgia. Another was ''Tell Me How This Ends,'' an admiring account of the troop ''surge'' in Iraq that Mr. McCain was among the first to embrace. A third book was ''Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922,'' a popular history of a remote event, the sacking of an Aegean city.
 Mr. Bobbitt, the scholar who met with Mr. McCain over several days three months ago to talk about his recent work, ''Terror and Consent,'' said he was surprised by the candidate's willingness to question his own suppositions. ''He is still reading and learning,'' Mr. Bobbitt said. ''He didn't have any of the attitude of 'Look, I am in the middle of a campaign, this is what I have said, this is how it is going to be' that you would understandably get three months before an election.''
 Mr. McCain first tasted politics in 1977 as the Navy's liaison to the United States Senate -- a bag carrier, some called the job. He was 40 and unsure of his future, devouring Theodore H. White's election chronicles to fill in the history he missed, and he turned the assignment into a training seminar for his own political career.
 Escorting lawmakers on overseas trips and entertaining them with stories of his naval escapades, Mr. McCain listened as the senators gossiped over evening cocktails, or brought him into closed committee staff meetings. And he capitalized on their goodwill: Senator William Cohen of Maine, best man at Mr. McCain's 1980 wedding, and Senator John Tower of Texas, who many said treated Captain McCain like a son, provided invaluable help in his 1982 election to a House seat in Arizona. 
 As a senator or presidential candidate, Mr. McCain prefers to make decisions by consulting experts with opposing views, preferably watching them clash. ''He encourages disagreement in front of him, to see the evidence that disagrees with where he might be headed,'' said Kevin A. Hassett, an economist close to Mr. McCain. 
 He sometimes re-examines a position with as little prompting as a voter's comment in a town hall meeting, his advisers say. After questions during his 2000 primary campaign about global warming or health insurance, for example, he set out to investigate. He soon startled Senate Democrats by co-sponsoring a ''patients' bill of rights.'' He read widely about climate change, visited both polar ice caps and became the leading Republican sponsor of legislation to cut emissions.
 Vietnam, inevitably, has become a recurring reference point. He has often cited the familiar lesson that the United States should never commit its troops without broad public support -- ''the Vietnam thing,'' he recently called it. But he also faults the political leaders of that time for failing to rally Americans to the fight.. He argues that the withdrawal emboldened foes by damaging the nation's credibility, and ultimately concluded that he had taken the wrong lesson from Vietnam when he supported the pullout of United States troops from Somalia in 1994. 
 ''Osama bin Laden observed our withdrawal,'' Mr. McCain wrote in his 2002 memoir, ''and concluded that America no longer had the stomach for war.''
 Mindset of a Warrior
 Though his causes may change, Mr. McCain brings the mindset of a warrior to each fight. After Sept. 11, 2001, for example, he argued forcefully and almost immediately for invading Iraq. He repeated assertions about Iraq's weapons programs and terrorist ties, but his main argument was that the public reaction to the attacks presented an ''opportunity'' to deter other potential threats by making an example of Saddam Hussein.
 On other Senate issues, he would bark out tactical goals in morning strategy sessions with his legislative co-sponsors. ''It is like laying out a battle plan,'' Mr. Salter said. ''He would say, 'O.K., this guy in my caucus is a lawyer and he is going to say this. Who do we got that is a lawyer to talk to him? Who do we got? Who do we got?' '' 
 He can take defeat hard. After conservatives blocked a major tobacco bill he had negotiated in 1998, Mr. McCain excoriated his own party for consigning children to lung cancer. After losing fights over campaign finance rules, he would lash out at his opponents as corrupt. 
 He relishes conflict, his friends say, and would make a confrontational president. As Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close friend put it: ''The man will run across the street to get in a good fight.''
 But Mr. McCain could be effective. He learned to exploit his combative instincts to maximize his power, mastering the Senate's sometimes Machiavellian maneuvers and intrigues. He started trying to climb the ladder of the Senate Republican leadership; aside from his quixotic assaults on earmarks and campaign donations, he was a reliable conservative.
 Then his man-against-machine clash with the Republican front-runner George W. Bush in 2000 opened a new path. Mr. McCain returned to the Senate with a new national reputation as a ''maverick,'' more popular with liberals and independents than with conservatives. 
 He recognized that in a narrowly divided Senate he could be a pivotal swing player, often able to push forward proposals he favored on the Democratic agenda or at least thwart the will of Republican leaders on the matters he chose (on judicial confirmations or detainee interrogations, for example).
 His shifting allegiances infuriated opponents. Sometimes, he conspired with former Republican Senate foes against their party leaders and President Bush (judges). Other times, he joined the president to battle the Democrats (on the Iraq war) or fellow Republicans (on immigration). In between, he basked in accolades from Democrats for siding with them on taxes, Alaskan oil drilling, generic drugs, emission rules and other matters. 
 Mr. McCain made plenty of enemies. In confrontations, he could explode in profanity, bolt from meetings in rage, or order other lawmakers out of the room. He says he sometimes uses his explosive temper tactically, to intimidate opponents. But he left enough bruises that Democrats had sheaves of old quotes from fellow Republicans about his volatile temper at the ready when he ran for president.
 Contradictory Impulses
 In his first race in Arizona, John McCain campaigned as a well-connected insider with ''experience in Washington'' who could bring home pork -- parochial spending projects -- for the state. (He angered Senator Barry Goldwater by attempting to steal credit for a defense contract the senator had steered to the state.) 
 In his 2000 presidential run, he campaigned as an anti-politician. He denounced pork-barrel spending, made campaign finance rules the centerpiece of his agenda, and railed against the influence of special interests in Washington. He opened his bus to the press and mocked the idea of ''message discipline.''
 And though for years he had played down his prison ordeal (''I don't want to be the P.O.W. senator,'' Mr. McCain once told a reporter. ''I don't think it made any change in my basic character''), he began talking about it as a more formative experience. Echoing his 1999 autobiography, ''Faith of My Fathers,'' Mr. McCain described Vietnam as the crucible that taught him the importance of dedication to a cause greater than himself -- a formulation that became his campaign theme.
 This time around, Mr. McCain -- still the ''maverick'' -- has variously run as anointed front-runner, then cash-strapped long shot, and finally a battle-tested ''fighter'' out to change Washington. In the final rounds of his campaign against Senator Barack Obama, his Democratic rival, Mr. McCain is again in full game face. 
 His campaign has pelted his rival with attacks that make some of his old advisers wince, like questioning Mr. Obama's patriotism or tying him to ''a domestic terrorist.'' He made a high-stakes bet on a telegenic but untested running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, with no qualms about leading the charge. 
 If the election were a contest to hold your breath under water, ''you would be giving John McCain mouth to mouth before he would let Obama win,'' said his friend, former Senator Kerrey.
 At times, Mr. McCain's confidence in the righteousness of his own cause may blind him to contradictions. He bashes lobbyists as ''birds of prey'' but hires a staff of former or ''on leave'' lobbyists to run his campaign. (While attacking the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Mr. McCain was recently embarrassed by the disclosure that until their collapse this summer they had been paying big monthly fees to the government relations firm of his campaign manager, Rick Davis.)
 Mr. McCain promises to avoid even the appearance of impropriety or official favors. But around the start of his 2000 race, he wrote a letter of recommendation and arranged a Pentagon meeting to help a big donor win two lucrative California land deals. At the same time, several top advisers were warning him to keep his distance from a female lobbyist because the two appeared overly friendly, two participants in those conversations said. 
 In more reflective moments, Mr. McCain says he tries to maintain a stoic detachment about the prospect of victory or defeat, a habit of mind he says he acquired as Navy pilot and prisoner of war. ''I tend to be fatalistic about these things,'' he said in an interview not long after he had locked up the Republican nomination, shrugging off his success. 
 The son and grandson of four-star admirals, Mr. McCain wrestles publicly with the burdens of trying to live up to their standards of both accomplishment and honor. Contemplating his first run at the White House, he worried about balancing his ambition for the prize with his own sense of virtue, he wrote in ''Worth the Fighting For.''
 After his loss, he professed himself grateful, at the age of 65, for what might be left of his time. ''I did not get to be president of the United States. And I doubt I shall have reason or opportunity to try again,'' he wrote, but added, ''I might yet become the man I always wanted to be.''

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: ON LANGUAGE: METAPHOR MIX: 10-26-08

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE.

 BODY:
Metaphor Mix Metaphor is speech with a cute figure. That's a metaphoric sentence, taking ''a verbal device that implies comparison with a wholly different subject'' and comparing that figure of speech to a woman with a fine physique. 
 Such trope-a-dope can be an effective play on words; poets and politicians love it. In Shakespeare's time, ''a sea of troubles'' was a gloomy metaphor of life itself; when in his ''to be or not to be'' soliloquy, Hamlet said he might ''take arms against a sea of troubles,'' he was speculating about using a weapon against his life -- ''not to be.'' 
 But you have to keep the comparison straight; mixing the elements, especially mixing cliches, invites ridicule. Decades ago, I wrote a speech for Senator Everett Dirksen hailing a president's ''firm hand on the rudder of the ship of state''; the mellifluous senator glumly forwarded me a letter from a constituent saying that ''if Nixon's hand is on the rudder, he's drowning and nobody is minding the tiller.'' Recently, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina assured us that the current financial crisis would not cause the developed world to ''plunge like a bubble.'' That simile caused many to burst into a smile.
 In the metaphor mixer, you hear examples like ''that isn't rocket surgery'' and ''he's cut out of the same mold.'' Rush Limbaugh once gave listeners a sinking feeling when he reportedly said, ''I knew enough to realize that the alligators were in the swamp and that it was time to circle the wagons.'' 
 Bloggers gleefully zapped Gov. Sarah Palin for mixing a bear image with an aircraft: ''As Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America, where do they go? Alaska.'' Few noted, however, another resounding clash of cliches in the current election cycle. In the second presidential debate, Barack Obama said, ''Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears.'' Obama apparently confused one century-old metaphor, green around the gills, meaning ''nauseated,'' with another, wet behind the ears, meaning ''immature, gullible.''
 That wet metaphor began with its opposite: ''Dry back of the ears'' was cited in Dialect Notes in 1914 and was defined as ''adult, experienced.'' That led to a 1931 citation by Eric Partridge of wet behind the ears in a British soldier's song, which the great slang lexicographer defined as ''a term of reproach imputing ignorance or youth.'' The origin of green around the gills is obscure, but it may be a reference to uncured, stale fish, causing the potential customer to feel ill and his cheeks to appear pale. Green, now an adjective embraced by environmentalists, also has a longtime meaning of ''unripe,'' as in bananas; it is a possible reason that Obama -- like others before him over the years -- substituted green in its derogative sense for wet, stuffing both metaphors into a mental blender. Modern musicians attuned to the delights of mixation might call it a mashup. 
 MONDAY'S CHILD
 A nursery rhyme was introduced in the 16th century that helped children not only to memorize the days of the week but also to brace themselves for the vicissitudes of fate. It began, ''Monday's child is fair of face.'' Some speculate that this was a subtle allusion to the ''face'' of the moon, source of the name ''Monday.''
 Wall Streeters and millions of investors called the date of the stock market crash -- Friday, Oct. 25, 1929 -- ''Black Friday'' (despite the child of that day in the rhyme being ''loving and giving''). Ever since, black -- with the ''black looks'' of gloom -- has been associated with bad-news days in the financial world. 
 That posed a problem to headline writers recently: what adjective should be used to describe a day of great good news? ''Bonny and blithe and good and gay'' is out, because Sunday is a day the stock market is closed. White is also out in contrast to black, for subliminal reasons of sensitivity to race. Last month, a British newspaper, The Guardian, turned to tried-and-true alliteration in dating days of dreary drops, with ''Meltdown Monday,'' which came along ''nearly every other week nowadays, along with 'Frantic Friday' and 'Tsunami Tuesday' and 'black' any old day.''
 But leading up to Monday, Oct. 13, 2008, it seems the whole English-speaking world had been testing the moniker for the hoped-for good-news day, pioneered as the title of a song by the singer Prince in 1984. Google reported hundreds of usages this month of a date that will live in the opposite of banking infamy: Manic Monday.
 Intriguing choice of adjective: if alliteration was the preferred rhetorical device, why not merry, marvelous, magnificent, miraculous or, to get with it, mind-blowing Monday?
 The choice of manic was mindful of current meaning. Related to mania, with its Greek root in mad, the word was taken up in psychiatry to describe a state including excessive enthusiasm and unstable moods; when manic depressive became stigmatized, as many illnesses do, doctors adopted bipolar disorder. The word manic, however, has remained in everyday discourse to mean ''a wildly high state'' -- one that resulted in the largest point gain in the history of the financial averages. Manic Monday carried the connotation of caution: ''a big swing upward, but watch out for unrealistic joy.''
 So much for alliterative nomenclature based on days of the week in some of this month's financial news. In politics this coming week, the old nursery rhyme will bear recalling: For about half the nation's voters, next Tuesday's child will be ''full of grace,'' while Wednesday morning, for the other half, will be -- only temporarily, of course -- ''full of woe.''

LENGTH: 1292 words

HEADLINE: Economy Is No. 1 Concern, But Agreement Stops There

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: MASSAPEQUA 

 BODY:
 PAUSING in front of Kirsch's ice cream parlor here, Daniel P. Mazzola, 72, a semiretired financial planner, said, ''I'm leaning toward McCain, though he's making it more difficult every day.''
 A dissenter stood at Mr. Mazzola's side. It was his wife, Mary Ann, 67, a retired clerk-typist. ''I'm for Obama,'' she said. ''I like his style.''
 The Mazzolas' differences over the presidential candidates capsulize the deep divisions among many Long Islanders, as reflected in interviews with dozens of residents on street corners and in shopping malls here and in Huntington.
 The No. 1 issue is no surprise. ''My concern is the economy, like everybody else,'' said Carol Eckard, 62, an assistant office manager from Greenlawn. ''I'm going for McCain, and I'm a Democrat. I didn't even think twice about it.'' 
 Some voters also raised the Iraq war and health care as issues, and a few mentioned immigration, national security, energy and the environment. One mentioned the onetime radical William Ayers.
 Although Long Island has become more diverse, it remains predominantly white, like most of the people interviewed. They generally dismissed Senator Barack Obama's race as a consideration in his campaign against Senator John McCain, but a few said it was a factor.
 Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, stood out as a polarizing figure. A few voters proclaimed themselves fans, while more characterized her as an unprepared running mate for Mr. McCain. Her critics included women and Republicans. Senator Joseph Biden, the Democratic candidate for vice president, got few mentions, but those he did get were positive.
 Whatever the conflicting views, nearly everyone seemed captivated by the campaign. And they sounded uniformly worried about the nation's problems, even as they disagreed over the solutions and over which candidate would make the better president. 
 Senators Obama and McCain have ardent backers on the Island, along with hesitant supporters.
 ''I'm a huge Obama fan,'' said Cindy Buffa, 64, a computer consultant from Huntington. ''I like his idea that we should talk to our enemies. I like it when he says we all have to share the pain'' in righting the economy,
 Joseph P. Burderi, 55, a CVS photo supervisor from Massapequa, said he was leaning toward Obama. He cited health care and the economy as his main concerns. He added with a smile that although he is a Democrat, ''my family is all Republicans, and if they came out here, we'd be arguing.''
 Mr. McCain can count on Nikki Palmieri. ''We're voting for McCain,'' said Ms. Palmieri, 29, of Huntington, who works in finance in Manhattan, as does her husband. Nodding toward their 7-week-old girl in a baby carrier outside the Kmart in Huntington, she said, ''We have a little daughter and college to pay for, and we don't need money redistribution'' under the Democrats.
 Tina Miranda, 41, a Republican homemaker from Massapequa, said, ''I think I'm going to vote for McCain, but I'm trying to keep an open mind.'' She said she regretted that the attention in the debates focused so much on how the candidates related to each other rather than on the issues.
 Some voters said they remained undecided.
 ''I'm still stuck in the middle,'' said Sam Rappaport, 69, a retired teacher from Massapequa. ''I'm not sure about Obama. I don't know about his position on Israel, which is important to me. I'm not sure I understand McCain's economic plan. Actually, I'm afraid of both.''
 Iona Faer, a retired cashier from Massapequa, said that while ''McCain's too old, and Obama's too young,'' she was leaning to the Democrat.
 Several other residents faulted both candidates.
 ''I don't think anybody represents me,'' said Joseph C. Tripodi, 36, sitting on a bench across from the ice cream parlor in Massapequa with his dog, a shepherd mix. ''I'm sick of hearing about Main Street, because I don't think anybody running is from Main Street. It's a scary time of life, with the whole state of affairs. The economy is in terrible shape.'' He said he was trying to decide between ''basically the lesser of two evils.''
 An elderly homemaker from Muttontown, who would not give her name, threatened to boycott the election. ''I don't want to vote,'' she said as she carried her purchases to her car at the Kmart in Huntington. ''I wanted Hillary.''
 The vice-presidential candidates drew sharply conflicting reactions.
 ''I'm for McCain, and I love Sarah,'' said Nanette Hackett, 73, a homemaker from Woodbury. 
 But several voters viewed Governor Palin as a liability to the ticket.
 ''I am totally against McCain and his running mate,'' Mrs. Mazzola said at the ice cream parlor. ''I'm for women and equality, but the thought of her a heartbeat away is too much.''
 Mr. Rappaport, the retired teacher, said of Ms. Palin, ''I dread having her there'' and called her '' a nonentity, a rabble-rouser.'' 
 Anne Morgan, 26, an Obama supporter who works at the Book Revue bookstore in Huntington, said, ''My mother was intending to vote for McCain till he picked Palin, and now she doesn't know what she's going to do.''
 Marilyn Wiebalck, 80, a retired nurse from Huntington, said that she shifted to the undecided column because of Ms. Palin. ''If Palin weren't there, I would be for McCain,'' she said. ''It's not because she's a woman, but she's certainly not ready.''
 Another undecided voter, Lynn Lucarelli, a real estate agent from Huntington, said: ''I don't like Obama, but if something happened to McCain, Palin is not ready. I'd like to have a woman, but not Palin. Obama made the right choice. If it could be McCain-Biden, I'd be happy.''
 Race is a great unknown in the election. Asked if race was a factor for them or people they knew, most of those interviewed answered like Nikki Palmieri, the finance worker and new mother. ''It's not a factor for me,'' she said. ''Honestly, I never heard it brought up.''
 Ms. Lucarelli said: ''Race is definitely not a factor for me, but I don't think he should be the first black president. Now Colin Powell, I would have no trouble voting for him.''
 Ms. Eckard, the assistant office manager, said that some young people support Mr. Obama for change and racial progress, and some voters said he would draw overwhelming support from black residents.
 One black voter, Tyaisha Harvey, 24, a supervisor at Kmart, said she supported Mr. Obama, but cautiously. ''I like Barack, but I'm not really sure he's going to do what he says,'' she said. ''I waited for the debates, and I like both sides. I'm not sure about Barack's experience, but I think he'll be all right. I do think he should have picked Hillary.''
 Asked about race, the elderly white homemaker from Muttontown who would not give her name said, ''I think at my age, I'm not ready'' for a black president.
 One white supporter of Mr. Obama, George Spicer, said that ''it's tragic'' that racial and religious bigotry are factors. Mr. Spicer, 83, of Huntington, a former hospital administrator and now a greeter at Kmart, cited two examples.
 One person said of Senator Obama, ''You know he's black,'' Mr. Spicer recalled. He said he replied, ''So what?'' Another comment about Mr. Obama was ''But he's a Muslim,'' Mr. Spicer recalled. His reply, he said, was, ''But he's not a Muslim, and even if he were, so what?''
 Wearing a white apron in front of the Almarco Italian Grill and adjoining Junior's Pizza in Huntington, where he is a manager, Steven Natalello, 56, said he was worried about the economy and the war. He is a Republican and McCain supporter but respects Mr. Obama. 
 ''Maybe we do need a change,'' Mr. Natalello said. ''Maybe everybody, as Mr. Obama said, could get together for once. I hope to God they can get us out of this hole.''

OF TWO MINDS: George Spicer, 83, who backs Mr. Obama, believes race is an election factor, and calls it ''tragic.'' Nikki Palmieri, 29, who backs Mr. McCain, says race doesn't matter to her, adding that she has not heard voters cite it.
 THE GAMUT: From far left, Sam Rappaport, 69, a retired teacher from Massapequa, has not decided who'll get his vote. ''Actually, I'm afraid of both,'' he says. Carol Eckard, 62, an assistant office manager from Greenlawn, says that even though she's a Democrat, she'll vote for Senator McCain. And Iona Faer, a retired cashier from Massapequa, seen with her husband, Irving, said that even though ''McCain's too old and Obama's too young,'' she was leaning to the Democrat. CHOOSING SIDES: Tyaisha Harvey, 24, right, a supervisor at Kmart in Huntington, says that she supports Senator Obama, but adds that she wishes he had chosen Hillary Clinton as his running mate. Tina Miranda, 41, a Massapequa homemaker and a Republican supporter of Mr. McCain, says she wishes that the presidential debates had focused more on the issues.

HEADLINE: The Making (and Remaking and Remaking) of the Candidate

BYLINE: By ROBERT DRAPER. 
Robert Draper is a correspondent for GQ and the author of ''Dead Certain: The Presidency of , George W. Bush.''

 BODY:
 On the morning of Wednesday, Sept. 24,John McCain convened a meeting in his suite at the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Among the handful of campaign officials in attendance were McCain's chief campaign strategist, Steve Schmidt, and his other two top advisers: Rick Davis, the campaign manager; and Mark Salter, McCain's longtime speechwriter. The senator's ears were already throbbing with bad news from economic advisers and from House Republican leaders who had told him that only a small handful in their ranks were willing to support the $700 billion bailout of the banking industry proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. The meeting was to focus on how McCain should respond to the crisis -- but also, as one participant later told me, ''to try to see this as a big-picture, leadership thing.'' 
 As this participant recalled: ''We presented McCain with three options. Continue offering principles from afar. A middle ground of engaging while still campaigning. Then the third option, of going all in. The consensus was that we could stay out or go in -- but that if we're going in, we should go in all the way. So the thinking was, do you man up and try to affect the outcome, or do you hold it at arm's length? And no, it was not an easy call.''
 Discussion carried on into the afternoon at the Morgan Library and Museum as McCain prepared for the first presidential debate. Schmidt pushed for going all in: suspending the campaign, recommending that the first debate be postponed, parachuting into Washington and forging a legislative solution to the financial crisis for which McCain could then claim credit. Exactly how McCain could convincingly play a sober bipartisan problem-solver after spending the previous few weeks garbed as a populist truth teller was anything but clear. But Schmidt and others convinced McCain that it was worth the gamble.
 Schmidt in particular was a believer in these kinds of defining moments. The smartest bit of political wisdom he ever heard was dispensed by George W. Bush one spring day at the White House residence in 2004, at a time when his re-election effort was not going especially well. The strategists at the meeting -- including Schmidt, who was directing the Bush campaign's rapid-response unit -- fretted over their candidate's sagging approval ratings and the grim headlines about the war in Iraq. Only Bush appeared thoroughly unworried. He explained to them why, polls notwithstanding, voters would ultimately prefer him over his opponent, John Kerry.
 There's an accidental genius to the way Americans pick a president, Schmidt remembers Bush saying that day. By the end of it all, a candidate's true character is revealed to the American people. 
 Had Schmidt been working for his present client back in 2000, he might have disputed Bush's premise. After all, in McCain's first run for the presidency, ''true character'' was the one thing the Vietnam hero and campaign-finance-reform crusader seemed to have going for him eight years ago in the Republican primaries. Bush had everything else, and he buried McCain. What campaigns peddle is not simply character but character as defined by story -- a tale of opposing forces that in its telling will memorably establish what a given election is about. In 2000, the McCain effort played like that of a smart and plucky independent film that ultimately could not compete for audiences against the Bush campaign's summer blockbuster. Four years later, in the race against John Kerry, Schmidt and the other Bush strategists had perfected their trade craft. With a major studio's brutal efficiency, they distilled the campaign into a megabudget melodrama pitting an unwavering commander in chief against a flip-flopper, set in a post-9/11 world where there could be no room for error or equivocation. 
 Schmidt has been in charge of strategy for the McCain campaign since early this summer, and his effort to prevail in the battle of competing story lines has been considerably more problematic. The selling of a presidential ''narrative'' the reigning buzz word of this election cycle has taken on outsize significance in an age in which a rush of visuals and catch words can cripple public images overnight. Mitt Romney, it is said, lost because he could not get his story straight. Hillary Clinton found her I'm-a-fighter leitmotif too late to save her candidacy. By contrast, the narrative of Barack Obama has seemed to converge harmonically with the shifting demographics and surging discontent of the electorate. It may well be, as his detractors suggest, that Obama is among the least-experienced presidential nominees in our nation's history. But to voters starved for change, the 47-year-old biracial first-term Democratic senator clearly qualifies. That, in any event, is his story, and he has stuck to it.
 John McCain's biography has been the stuff of legend for nearly a decade. And yet Schmidt and his fellow strategists have had difficulty explaining how America will be better off for electing (as opposed to simply admiring) a stubborn patriot. In seeking to do so, the McCain campaign has changed its narrative over and over. Sometimes with McCain's initial resistance but always with his eventual approval, Schmidt has proffered a candidate who is variously a fighter, a conciliator, an experienced leader and a shake-'em-up rebel. ''The trick is that all of these are McCain,'' Matt McDonald, a senior adviser, told me. But in constantly alternating among story lines in order to respond to changing events and to gain traction with voters, the ''true character'' of a once-crisply-defined political figure has become increasingly murky. 
 Schmidt evidently saw the financial crisis as a ''true character'' moment that would advance his candidate's narrative. But the story line did not go as scripted. ''This has to be solved by Monday,'' Schmidt told reporters that Wednesday afternoon in late September, just after McCain concluded his lengthy meeting with his advisers and subsequently announced his decision to suspend his campaign and go to Washington. Belying a crisis situation, however, McCain didn't leave New York immediately. He spent Thursday morning at an event for the Clinton Global Initiative, the nonprofit foundation run by former President Bill Clinton. As McCain headed for Washington later that morning, he was sufficiently concerned about the situation that Schmidt felt compelled to reassure him. ''Remember what President Clinton told you,'' Schmidt said, referring to advice Clinton had dispensed that morning: ''If you do the right thing, it might be painful for a few days. But in the long run it will work out in your favor.''
 After arriving on Capitol Hill nearly 24 hours after his announcement, McCain huddled with three of his closest political allies: fellow senators Lindsey Graham, Joe Lieberman and Jon Kyl. Later that day at a White House meeting convened by Bush and also attended by Congressional leaders of both parties as well as both candidates, McCain said almost nothing, even when House Republicans declared that they were not yet willing to sign onto the administration's $700 billion proposal. Despite the fact that the deal maker had produced no deal, McCain announced the next day that his campaign would resume -- ''optimistic that there has been significant progress towards a bipartisan agreement,'' as a campaign statement put it -- and traveled to Mississippi that Friday afternoon to debate Obama. On Sunday morning, Schmidt went on ''Meet the Press'' to insist that his boss's foray had been crucial in bringing ''all of the parties to the table,'' with the result that ''there appears to be a framework completed.'' The next day -- Monday, Sept. 29, the day by which Schmidt had earlier warned the crisis ''has to be solved'' -- the House Republicans played the key role in defeating the bailout legislation. 
 Scene by scene, McCain failed to deliver the performance that had been promised. Of course, this was no mere movie. America was in crisis. Perhaps with the Bush theory in mind, Steve Schmidt had advised McCain to ''go in all the way'' on the financial crisis so as to reveal his candidate's true character. But given a chance to show what kind of president he might be, McCain came off more like a stymied bystander than a leader who could make a difference. Judging by the polls, the McCain campaign has yet to recover.
 In reporting on the campaign's vicissitudes, I spoke with a half-dozen of McCain's senior-most advisers -- most of them more than once and some of them repeatedly -- over a period that began in early August. I spoke as well to several other midlevel advisers and to a number of former senior aides. Virtually all of these individuals had spoken with me for previous articles concerning McCain. Their insights and recollections enabled me to piece together conversations and events. My repeated requests to interview McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, were denied, and with only a couple of exceptions those who spoke to me did so with the stipulation that most or all of their comments not be attributed to them.
 Despite their leeriness of being quoted, McCain's senior advisers remained palpably confident of victory -- at least until very recently. By October, the succession of backfiring narratives would compel some to reappraise not only McCain's chances but also the decisions made by Schmidt, who only a short time ago was hailed as the savior who brought discipline and unrepentant toughness to a listing campaign. ''For better or for worse, our campaign has been fought from tactic to tactic,'' one senior adviser glumly acknowledged to me in early October, just after Schmidt received authorization from McCain to unleash a new wave of ads attacking Obama's character. ''So this is the new tactic.''
 NARRATIVE 1:
 The Heroic Fighter vs. the Quitters
 Steve Schmidt is 38, bald and brawny, with a nasal, deadpan voice and a relentless stare. He is also a devoted husband and father of two young children, introspective and boyishly vulnerable for someone of such imposing stature. On mornings, he can be seen standing outside the McCain campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va., smoking a cigarette while he scowls at his BlackBerry. After campaign events in the evening, he often hangs out at a hotel bar drinking beer with fellow campaign workers and members of the media. Whenever possible, he flies back to California to spend the weekend with his family. He is not a hothead and tends to hesitate for several beats before offering a well-tailored, often wry answer to a question. Though commonly described in the press as a Karl Rove protege, Schmidt was a Republican operative for a dozen years before he ever worked for Rove. When Bush returned to the White House, Schmidt was not among those from the 2004 re-election effort who were rewarded with plum jobs, despite his well-regarded work overseeing the campaign's rapid-response unit. After spending the first half of 2005 heading up the press office for Vice President Dick Cheney, Schmidt was sent to Baghdad to improve the administration's anemic communications strategy in Iraq. He also orchestrated the Senate confirmation hearings of the Supreme Court nominees John Roberts and Samuel Alito and their presentation to the outside world. Along the way, Schmidt never really developed the personal relationship with Bush that would have enabled him to advance in accordance with his talents. In early 2006, when an opportunity came to jump ship, Schmidt took it, departing the Bush administration to spearhead the successful re-election campaign of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in California. He still lives outside Sacramento, far from Washington. Though Schmidt often brandishes his geographical remove from the Beltway and his lack of interest in another White House job as proof of his equanimity, you get the sense that a McCain victory would bring him no small measure of personal vindication.
 For a man who seems to relish Rove-like alley fighting, Schmidt is not an ideologue and claims he harbors no ambition of delivering the Republican Party to a state of lasting supremacy. He also displays great nuance in office politics. Until Schmidt consolidated his power this summer, McCain, it's fair to say, was not a big believer in organization. The important decisions were all made by him, with various confidants of ambiguous portfolio orbiting around him and often colliding with one another (and often staying in the picture well after their departure -- as was the case of Mike Murphy, a strategist from the 2000 campaign, who remained close enough to McCain that rumors of his return persisted until fairly recently). 
 A year earlier, in the summer of 2007, the McCain campaign all but collapsed under the weight of financial woes, vicious infighting and the conservative base's fury over his moderate stance on immigration. Among the senior staff members who walked out were McCain's longtime political guru John Weaver and several alumni of the well-oiled 2004 Bush campaign. Schmidt -- who until that point was not particularly influential -- decided to stick around, even without pay. He began to earn McCain's trust while also befriending the senator's two closest advisers, who happened not to care for each other. 
 One was Rick Davis, a charming Southern lobbyist and Republican jack-of-all-trades who had assumed control of the campaign's day-to-day operations. McCain and Davis have for years called each other a half-dozen times a day, but Davis has also cultivated a close bond with Cindy McCain, who once when talking to Katie Couric referred to Davis as ''our best friend.'' The other adviser was 53-year-old Mark Salter, a brilliant, pugnacious writer who has composed all of McCain's books and major speeches and in a more encompassing sense is McCain's definer, looking after what Salter himself calls the ''metanarrative'' of McCain's transformation from a reckless flyboy and P.O.W. to a courageous patriot. The complicated interdependence between McCain and Salter could be glimpsed during the candidate's acceptance speech at the Republican convention. Salter sat in the front row, dead center, no more than 15 feet from McCain. I watched as Salter gazed intently at McCain throughout, making subtle motions with his hands and face, and when McCain came to the pivotal line in his P.O.W. tale -- ''I was no longer my own man; I was my country's'' -- its author leapt to his feet and applauded. 
 But in the summer of 2007, Salter and McCain's relationship frayed when Salter and others tried to marginalize Davis, and McCain resisted. While Salter brooded and Davis spent his hours at headquarters begging donors and volunteers not to jump ship, Schmidt stepped into the void. There was still more than a year until the election, he figured. The problem was that McCain was spending his time talking about Iraq, in distinctly funereal tones. ''It's long and it's hard and it's tough,'' the senator told one audience in Gilford, N.H., that summer. ''I could recommend books on it that'll make you cry. . . . I know how frustrated you are. I know the sorrow you experience.'' Virtually all of his senior staff members, Schmidt and Davis among them, had been begging McCain to focus on the economy, health care and tax policy. Anything, really, except Bush's war. But according to several senior advisers, the candidate felt a deep sense of responsibility to cheerlead for the troop surge, which he believed would turn the tide in Iraq. It began to dawn on Schmidt that McCain's stubborn patronage of an unpopular war wasn't impeding the campaign's quest for narrative -- it was the narrative. 
 ''Sir, is the surge working?'' he said he asked McCain one day. ''Are we winning?''
 ''Yes,'' McCain said.
 ''That's not what you're saying on the trail.''
 ''It is!''
 ''No, sir. It's not. You're saying things are getting better. Do you believe we're actually winning now?''
 McCain indicated that he did.
 ''Well, going forward, that's what you should say,'' Schmidt replied. He encouraged McCain to denounce the Democrats for advocating a withdrawal of troops -- a kind of surrender in the face of victory. Thus did Schmidt initiate the No Surrender Tour late in the summer of 2007, a push through the early primary states that saw John McCain surrounded by war veterans while he lashed out at weak-kneed war critics. Employing considerable artistic license, Schmidt linked McCain's stance on Iraq with his bravery during his years in captivity in Vietnam, something the candidate had shied away from. Indeed, as McCain told me two years ago, he decided to write his Vietnam memoir, ''Faith of My Fathers,'' with Salter largely to put the subject to rest once and for all: ''I just got bored telling the same old story over and over again. . . . After the 3,000th time, you think, Hey, I'd rather talk about something else.''
 As one adviser told me two months ago: ''It's against his better nature to be self-aggrandizing. But everybody was telling him, 'This is about the election, the election's about your character and this stuff goes along with your narrative.' '' Schmidt warned McCain that declining to discuss personal matters like his P.O.W. days and his religious faith would very likely have ramifications at the polls. The candidate acquiesced. In speeches, debates and advertising, the McCain campaign made liberal use of his war-hero metanarrative. On March 28, 2008, with the Republican nomination secured, McCain's first national ad was shown. It concluded with grainy black-and-white footage of the wounded P.O.W. reciting his serial number to his captors, followed by a spoken line that Schmidt loved and adamantly defended, even when others inside the campaign argued that it made no sense: ''John McCain. The American president Americans have been waiting for.'' Thereafter, McCain seldom wasted an opportunity to extol his own patriotism. 
 NARRATIVE 2:
 Country-First Deal Maker vs. Nonpartisan Pretender
 Schmidt spent this spring futilely trying to broaden the story line. Americans, he knew, did not share McCain's devotion to the surge in Iraq. Their concerns lay at home. Accordingly, Schmidt toured McCain through Annapolis, Alexandria and Jacksonville, the towns of his beginnings (an idea conceived by Karl Rove, according to a senior adviser), and then made an empathy swing through poor regions of the country. Both came off as contrivances. McCain's speech in New Orleans on June 3 of this year -- the night Obama effectively clinched the nomination -- was delivered against a sickly green backdrop, a poorly executed version of an idea Schmidt borrowed from the eco-friendly 2006 Schwarzenegger campaign. Contrasted with Obama's ringing articulation of change in St. Paul that very night, McCain's speech (with its ''That's not change we can believe in'' refrain) struck even some Republicans as churlish. McCain was so frustrated by his own, at times, stumbling performance that he vowed never to deliver another teleprompter speech again. 
 The campaign was in the throes of an identity crisis by June 24, when a number of senior strategists gathered at 9:30 a.m. in a conference room of McCain's campaign headquarters in Arlington. As one participant said later, the meeting was convened ''because we still couldn't answer the question, 'Why elect John McCain?' '' Considering that the election was less than five months away, this was not a good sign.
 ''We had a narrative problem,'' Matt McDonald recalls. ''Obama had a story line: 'Bush is the problem. I'm not going to be Bush, and McCain will be.' Our story line, I argued, had to be that it's not about Bush -- it's Congress, it's Washington. And Obama would be more about partisanship, while John McCain would buck the party line and bring people together.''
 The others could see McDonald's line of reasoning -- and above all, the need to separate McCain from Bush. But the message seemed antiseptic, impersonal. That was when the keeper of McCain's biography, Mark Salter, took the floor. There's a reason McCain bucks his party, McDonald remembers Salter arguing. It's because he puts his country ahead of party. Then the speechwriter, who is not known for his dispassion, began to yell: ''We're talking about someone who was willing to die before losing his honor! He would die!'' 
 Salter stalked out of the meeting to have a cigarette and didn't return. But he had said enough. The metanarrative of Heroic Fighter was now joined with one that evoked postpartisan statesmanship. The new narrative needed a label. The first version was ''A Love for America.'' Then ''America First.'' And finally, the one that stuck: ''Country First.''
 The McCain campaign maintained that in contrast to Obama, their candidate had taken on his own party while working with Democrats on such issues as immigration and campaign-finance reform. ''Obama pays no price from his party -- never has,'' Salter told me. ''My guy has made a career out of it. So, how can you get people to believe that if you can't get the press to make an honest assessment of it? You tell a story. 'When it came down to a choice between my very life and my country, I chose my country.' That's why the story's important. Just as Obama's story is important to him. I don't gainsay it. You know, tell your story!''
 Salter and Schmidt had hoped that the mainstream press would warm to this new narrative. But the matter of which candidate had shown more acts of bipartisan daring failed to become Topic A. The two advisers -- each of whom had friendly relations with the media but had grown increasingly convinced that Obama was getting a free ride -- took this as further proof that today's reporters were primarily young, snarky, blog-obsessed and liberal. To Schmidt's and Salter's minds, John McCain had always been honest and straightforward with the press, and the press in turn was not acting in good faith toward their candidate. As such it was now undeserving of McCain's unfettered ''straight talk.'' 
 But this rationale for shutting out the press has its limitations. For one, when McCain's Straight Talk Express first rolled out in 1999, the notion was not conceived simply out of the sense that being transparent with the media -- and by extension the voters -- was just the right thing to do. Instead, it was implemented because the 2000 campaign lacked the money to compete with Bush's ad campaign. As John Weaver, McCain's former strategist told me, ''We needed the coverage.'' For another, McCain happened to like passing the time with reporters, whom he would sometimes refer to as his ''base.'' In addition, talking openly with the press had some important advantages early on for McCain. According to some of his aides, McCain's victory in the make-or-break New Hampshire primary in January of this year might not have transpired had he not spent time talking to and overtly courting every editorial board in the state for their endorsements. 
 Regardless, this summer Schmidt sought to convince his voluble candidate that the press was no longer his friend. By July, a curtain was literally drawn to separate McCain from the reporters traveling on his plane. He no longer mingled with them, and press conferences were drastically curtailed. The Bushian concept of message discipline -- the droning repetition of a single talking point -- that had been so gleefully mocked by McCain's lieutenants in 2000 now governed the Straight Talk Express.
 NARRATIVE 3:
 Leader vs. Celebrity
 ''Gentlemen, let me put a few things on the table for observation and discussion,'' Steve Schmidt said to his fellow strategists while sitting in a conference room in the Phoenix Ritz-Carlton. ''Would anyone here disagree with the premise that we are not winning this campaign?'' 
 No one disagreed. It was Sunday, July 27, and Obama had just concluded an eight-day swing through the Middle East and Europe that received practically round-the-clock media coverage. ''Would anyone disagree with the premise,'' Schmidt went on, ''that Mr. Obama has scored the most successful week in this entire campaign? I mean, they treated him like he was a head of state! So tell me, gentlemen: how do we turn this negative into a positive?''
 ''It's third and nine,'' Bill McInturff, a pollster, observed. ''Time to start throwing the ball down field.''
 Eventually, it was Schmidt who blurted out the epiphany concerning Obama. ''Face it, gentlemen,'' he said. ''He's being treated like a celebrity.''
 The others grasped the concept -- a celebrity like J-Lo! or Britney! -- and exultation overtook the room.
 John and Cindy McCain showed up at the end of the daylong meeting, and Schmidt took the opportunity to run the celebrity concept by them. The McCains liked it -- though the candidate was otherwise cranky: he was tired of being overscheduled and always late and demanded that this change immediately. (It did, according to a senior adviser: ''After that meeting, you will rarely see McCain do an event before 9 in the morning.'')
 Three days later, the new ad went up. ''He's the biggest celebrity in the world,'' a female voice intoned, as images of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton flashed on the screen. ''But: is he ready to lead?'' In a conference call with reporters that morning, Schmidt framed the issue with a binary choice straight out of the 2004 playbook: ''Do the American people want to elect the biggest celebrity or an American hero?''
 The idea, McDonald told me, was ''to exalt Obama's eloquence. Push it up to a place where there's no oxygen. Make it an Icarus thing.'' The notion of Obama's apparent presumptuousness seemed to grow on viewers. And when Russia invaded the fledgling republic of Georgia on Aug. 8, McCain's strategists saw an opportunity for another stark binary choice -- albeit one that abruptly shifted the story line back to the international arena: combat-ready leader versus unready celebrity.
 The execution of the new narrative left something to be desired, however. Three days after the invasion, McCain made a statement to reporters in Erie, Pa., intended to showcase his mastery of the Russia-Georgia situation. Instead, the candidate mispronounced the name of the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, three times. The next day, I watched as McCain appeared in York, Pa., to engage in one of his free-form town-hall meetings. But he began the event by standing next to a lectern and reciting Russia-Georgia talking points from prepared notes. Though no doubt this was intended to avoid his previous flubs, McCain's scripted performance seemed more like that of a foreign-policy novice than a sure-handed sage. 
 When I mentioned this episode later to one of McCain's advisers, he winced and said: ''This is part of the Schmidt gotta-have-absolute-message-discipline thing. That's one of the disagreements. And John can be really resistant. He's always worried about being put in a box. He's got a very sensitive nerve about it. A lot of times I would hear him say: 'Don't control me. This is my campaign.' But I think Steve has convinced him that we've got to do this if we're going to win.'' 
 NARRATIVE 4: 
 Team of Mavericks vs. Old-Style Washington
 On Sunday, Aug. 24, Schmidt and a few other senior advisers again convened for a general strategy meeting at the Phoenix Ritz-Carlton. McInturff, the pollster, brought somewhat-reassuring new numbers. The Celebrity motif had taken its toll on Obama. It was no longer third and nine, the pollster said -- meaning, among other things, that McCain might well be advised to go with a safe pick as his running mate.
 Then for a half-hour or so, the group reviewed names that had been bandied about in the past: Gov. Tim Pawlenty (of Minnesota) and Gov. Charlie Crist (of Florida); the former governors Tom Ridge (Pennsylvania) and Mitt Romney (Massachusetts); Senator Joe Lieberman (Connecticut); and Mayor Michael Bloomberg (New York). From a branding standpoint, they wondered, what message would each of these candidates send about John McCain? McInturff's polling data suggested that none of these candidates brought significantly more to the ticket than any other.
 ''What about Sarah Palin?'' Schmidt asked.
 After a moment of silence, Fred Davis, McCain's creative director (and not related to Rick), said, ''I did the ads for her gubernatorial campaign.'' But Davis had never once spoken with Palin, the governor of Alaska. Since the Republican Governors Association had paid for his work, Davis was prohibited by campaign laws from having any contact with the candidate. All Davis knew was that the R.G.A. folks had viewed Palin as a talent to keep an eye on. ''She'd certainly be a maverick pick,'' he concluded.
 The meeting carried on without Schmidt or Rick Davis uttering an opinion about Palin. Few in the room were aware that the two had been speaking to each other about Palin for some time now. Davis was with McCain when the two met Palin for the first time, at a reception at the National Governors Association winter meeting in February, in the J. W. Marriott Hotel in Washington. It had not escaped McCain's attention that Palin had blasted through the oleaginous Alaska network dominated by Frank Murkowski and Ted Stevens, much in the same manner that McCain saw himself doing when he was a young congressman. Newt Gingrich and others had spoken of Palin as a rising star. Davis saw something else in Palin -- namely, a way to re-establish the maverick persona McCain had lost while wedding himself to Bush's war. A female running mate might also pick off some disaffected Hillary Clinton voters.
 After that first brief meeting, Davis remained in discreet but frequent contact with Palin and her staff -- gathering tapes of speeches and interviews, as he was doing with all potential vice-presidential candidates. One tape in particular struck Davis as arresting: an interview with Palin and Gov. Janet Napolitano, the Arizona Democrat, on ''The Charlie Rose Show'' that was shown in October 2007. Reviewing the tape, it didn't concern Davis that Palin seemed out of her depth on health-care issues or that, when asked to name her favorite candidate among the Republican field, she said, ''I'm undecided.'' What he liked was how she stuck to her pet issues -- energy independence and ethics reform -- and thereby refused to let Rose manage the interview. This was the case throughout all of the Palin footage. Consistency. Confidence. And . . . well, look at her. A friend had said to Davis: ''The way you pick a vice president is, you get a frame of Time magazine, and you put the pictures of the people in that frame. You look at who fits that frame best -- that's your V. P.'' 
 Schmidt, to whom Davis quietly supplied the Palin footage, agreed. Neither man apparently saw her lack of familiarity with major national or international issues as a serious liability. Instead, well before McCain made his selection, his chief strategist and his campaign manager both concluded that Sarah Palin would be the most dynamic pick. Despite McInturff's encouraging new numbers, it remained their conviction that in this ominous election cycle, a Republican presidential candidate could not afford to play it safe. Picking Palin would upend the chessboard; it was a maverick type of move. McCain, the former Navy pilot, loved that sort of thing. Then again, he also loved familiarity -- the swashbuckling camaraderie with his longtime staff members, the P.O.W. band of brothers who frequently rode the bus and popped up at his campaign events, the Sedona ranch where he unwound and grilled wagonloads of meat. By contrast, McCain had barely met Palin.
 That evening of Aug. 24, Schmidt and Davis, after leaving the Ritz-Carlton meeting, showed up at McCain's condominium in Phoenix. They informed McCain that in their view, Palin would be the best pick. ''You never know where his head is,'' Davis told me three weeks later. ''He doesn't betray a lot. He's a great poker player. But he picked up the phone.'' Reached at the Alaska State Fair, Palin listened as McCain for the first time discussed the possibility of selecting her as his running mate.
 These machinations remained thoroughly sub rosa. McCain's close friend, Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator, continued to argue passionately for Lieberman -- ''a McCain-Plus ticket,'' he would say. McCain, referring to Romney, at one point said that ''Mitt's been awfully helpful with fund-raising,'' according to a senior aide who was present during the discussion. ''And he'd bring us Michigan.'' Pawlenty's name frequently came up in internal discussions, says that aide. But as for Palin, says another: ''She just wasn't one of the names. I mean, we heard more about Bloomberg.''
 On Tuesday, Aug. 26, Schmidt picked up the phone around noon and called Jon Berrier, an old friend and partner at Schmidt's consulting business in Northern California. Berrier was asked to get on a plane to Anchorage, check into a hotel, await further details and tell no one. The next morning, Davis White, who oversaw all of McCain's travel logistics, met Berrier for breakfast in Anchorage. White informed Berrier that they would meet Palin at a private airstrip that afternoon, and that White would fly with Palin to Arizona to meet with Schmidt and Salter that evening -- and then, the following morning, with McCain. If McCain offered the vice-president slot to Palin, White told Berrier, then Berrier would surreptitiously fly Palin's husband, Todd, and their children to Ohio on Thursday evening, and a public announcement would be made there the next morning. The final decision wasn't to be made until Thursday morning, but they should proceed as if it was going to happen. 
 Palin and her assistant, Kris Perry, met Schmidt and Salter on Wednesday evening in Flagstaff, at the house of Bob Delgado, the chief executive of Hensley & Company, Cindy McCain's beer distributorship. McCain's speechwriter had never spoken with Palin before. A senior adviser said: ''Salter was always a big Pawlenty fan -- son of a truck driver, salt of the earth, genuine guy. Just thought he was a good, honest addition to the McCain brand as opposed to, say, Romney.'' That so much momentum had been building in Palin's favor was likely a surprise to Salter, says one of the few individuals privy to the vice-presidential selection process: ''Mark was new to it, and so it was important to us to make sure that he was in on the situation that was brewing.''
 For two hours, Salter and Schmidt asked Palin questions based on the vetting material. Salter says they discussed her daughter's pregnancy and the pending state investigation regarding her role in the controversy surrounding the state trooper who had been married to her sister. The two advisers warned her that nothing was likely to stay secret during the campaign. Salter says that he was impressed. ''The sense you immediately get is how tough-minded and self-assured she is,'' he recalled three weeks after meeting her. ''She makes that impression in like 30 seconds.'' 
 Now all three of McCain's closest advisers were on board. The next morning was Thursday, Aug. 28. Salter and Schmidt drove Palin to McCain's ranch. According to Salter, the senator took the governor down to a place where he usually had his coffee, beside a creek and a sycamore tree, where a rare breed of hawk seasonally nested. They spoke for more than an hour. Then the two of them walked about 40 yards to the deck of the cabin where the McCains slept. Cindy joined them there for about 15 minutes, after which the McCains excused themselves and went for a brief stroll to discuss the matter. When they returned, McCain asked for some time with Schmidt and Salter. ''And we did our pros and cons on all of them,'' Salter told me. ''He just listened. Asked a couple of questions. Then said, 'I'm going to offer it to her.' ''
 Late that same evening, a McCain spokeswoman, Nicolle Wallace, and the deputy speechwriter, Matthew Scully, were ferried to the Manchester Inn in Middletown, Ohio. Schmidt instructed them to turn off their cellphones and BlackBerrys. Then he opened the door of Room 508 and introduced them to McCain's running mate. The two aides were surprised. Palin and Scully spoke for about 45 minutes, and the governor handed him a copy of the speech she had intended to give as one of the Republican convention's many guest speakers. With this scant information in hand, Scully began his all-night drafting of Palin's first speech to a national audience. 
 During the evening, Scully also traded e-mail messages with Matt McDonald, who had just gotten the news from Schmidt that the vice-presidential pick was someone who did not quite fit the campaign's current emphasis on ''readiness.'' The story line, Schmidt informed McDonald, was now Change. The two of them, along with Rick Davis, talked through this rather jolting narrative shift. What they decided upon was workable, if inelegant. First, define the problem as Washington, not Bush. Second, posit both McCain and Palin as experienced reformers. And third, define Obama and his 65-year-old running mate, Senator Joe Biden, as a ticket with no real record of change. McDonald in turn transmitted this formulation to Scully and Salter, who was busily drafting McCain's announcement speech.
 The spunky hockey mom that America beheld the next morning instantly hijacked Obama's narrative of newness. (''Change is coming!'' McCain hollered, almost seeming startled himself.) And five days later, in the hours after Palin's stunningly self-assured acceptance speech at the G.O.P. convention, I watched as the Republicans in the bar of the Minneapolis Hilton rejoiced as Republicans had not rejoiced since Inauguration Night three and a half long years ago. Jubilant choruses of ''She knocked it out of the park'' and ''One of the greatest speeches ever'' were heard throughout the room, and some people gave, yes, Obama-style fist bumps. When the tall, unassuming figure of Palin's speechwriter, Matthew Scully, shuffled into the bar, he was treated to the first standing ovation of his life. Nicolle Wallace confessed to another staff member that she had cried throughout Palin's speech. Allowing his feelings to burst out of his composed eggshell of a face, Schmidt bellowed to someone, ''Game on!'' 
 Just as quickly, he resumed his natural state of arch contemplativeness. ''Arguably, at this stage?'' he observed. ''She's a bigger celebrity than Obama.''
 A commotion erupted, followed by outright hysteria. It was 11:45, and the Palins had entered the bar. Dozens of staff members and delegates flocked to the governor, cellphone cameras outstretched. Todd and Sarah Palin posed, shook hands and extended their gracious appreciation for 15 minutes. Then, no doubt realizing that they would never be able to enjoy a drink in peace, they withdrew for the evening, again to raucous applause.
 While all of this was going on, an elegant middle-aged woman sat alone at the far end of the bar. She wore beige slacks and a red sweater, and she picked at a salad while talking incessantly on her cellphone. But for the McCain/Palin button affixed to her collar and the brief moment that Tucker Eskew, Palin's new counselor, spoke into her ear, she seemed acutely disconnected from the jubilation swelling around her. 
 In fact, the woman was here for a reason. Her name was Priscilla Shanks, a New York-based stage and screen actress of middling success who had found a lucrative second career as a voice coach. Shanks's work with Sarah Palin was as evident as it was unseen. Gone, by the evening of her convention speech, was the squeaky register of Palin's exclamations. Gone (at least for the moment) was the Bushian pronunciation of ''nuclear'' as ''nook-you-ler.'' Present for the first time was a leisurely, even playful cadence that signaled Sarah Palin's inevitability on this grand stage.
 In the ensuing two and a half weeks (which surely felt longer to the Obama campaign), the Palin Effect was manifest and profound. McCain seemed, if not suddenly younger -- after all, the woman standing to his side was nearly the same age as his daughter, Sidney -- then freshly boisterous as he crowed, ''Change is coming, my friends!'' Meanwhile, Palin's gushing references to McCain as ''the one great man in this race'' and ''exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief'' seemed to confer not only valor but virility on a 72-year-old politician who only weeks ago barely registered with the party faithful. 
 But just as you could make too much of Shanks's quiet coaching of Palin, you could also make too little of it. The new narrative -- the Team of Mavericks coming to lay waste the Beltway power alleys -- now depended on a fairly inexperienced Alaska politician. The following night, after McCain's speech brought the convention to a close, one of the campaign's senior advisers stayed up late at the Hilton bar savoring the triumphant narrative arc. I asked him a rather basic question: ''Leaving aside her actual experience, do you know how informed Governor Palin is about the issues of the day?''
 The senior adviser thought for a moment. Then he looked up from his beer. ''No,'' he said quietly. ''I don't know.''
 NARRATIVE 5: 
 John McCain vs. John McCain
 In the period before the campaign's decision earlier this month to wage an all-out assault on Obama's character as the next narrative tactic, McCain was signaling to aides that it was important to run an honorable campaign. People are hurting now, McCain said to his convention planners as Hurricane Gustav whirled toward the Gulf Coast. It's a shame we have to have a convention at all. But because we have to do this, tone it down. No balloons, nothing over the top. When his media team suggested running ads that highlighted Obama's connection with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, McCain reminded them that he pledged months earlier not to exploit the matter, and John McCain was not about to go back on his word. In such moments, the man who renounced negative ads during the 2000 campaign because he wanted (as he told his aghast advisers back then) ''to run a campaign my daughter can be proud of'' has been thoroughly recognizable.
 But that John McCain had lost. Of the noble but perhaps naive decision in 2000 to unilaterally take down his attack ads, Rick Davis would vow: ''That's not gonna happen a second time. I mean, the old dog can learn a few new tricks.'' And yet on this landscape of new tricks -- calling your opponent a liar; allowing your running mate to imply that the opponent might prefer terrorists over Americans -- McCain sometimes seemed to be running against not only Barack Obama but an earlier version of himself. 
 The flipside to John McCain's metanarrative of personal valor has always been palpable self-righteousness. In this campaign, his sense of integrity has been doubly offended. First, an adviser said, ''He just really thinks the media is completely in the tank for Obama and doesn't feel like he's getting a fair shake at all.'' And second, another said, ''I don't think John likes people who try to do jobs they're not qualified for'' -- referring, in this case, to Barack Obama.
 In June, McCain formally proposed that he and his Democratic opponent campaign together across America in a series of town-hall-style meetings. He had in fact suggested the same thing to Joe Biden three years earlier, Biden told me back then: ''He said: 'Let's make a deal if we end up being the nominees. Let's commit to do what Goldwater and Kennedy committed to do before Kennedy was shot.' We agreed that we would campaign together, same plane, get off in the same city and go to 30 states or whatever together.'' According to Biden, he and McCain sealed their agreement with a handshake. When McCain extended the same offer to Obama in 2008, the Democrat said that he found the notion ''appealing'' but then did little to make it happen. Since that time, McCain has repeatedly told aides what he has also said in public -- that had Obama truly showed a determination to have a series of joint appearances, the campaign would not have degenerated to its current sorry state. 
 But to McCain, that Obama failed to do so carries a deeper significance. Authenticity means everything to a man like McCain who, says Salter, ''has an affinity for heroes, for men of honor.'' Conversely, he reserves special contempt for those he regards as arrogant phonies. A year after Barack Obama was sworn into the Senate, Salter recalls McCain saying, ''He's got a future, I'll reach out to him'' -- as McCain had to Russ Feingold and John Edwards, and as the liberal Arizona congressman Mo Udall had reached out to McCain as a freshman. McCain invited Obama to attend a bipartisan meeting on ethics reform. Obama gratefully accepted --but then wrote McCain a letter urging him to instead follow a legislative path recommended by Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate. Feeling double-crossed, McCain ordered Salter to ''send him a letter, brush him back a little.'' Since that experience, says a Republican who has known McCain for a long time, ''there was certainly disdain and dislike of Obama.'' 
 A senior adviser to McCain said: ''The town halls, the ethics bill, immigration reform -- all are examples. I think McCain finds it galling that Obama gets credit for his impressive talk about bipartisanship without ever having to bear the risk that is a part of that. It is so much harder to walk the walk in the Senate than to talk the talk.'' By extension, then, if the McCain campaign's conduct would appear to be at odds with the man's ''true character,'' it is only because the combination of a dishonorable opponent and a biased media has forced his hand. Or so goes the rationale for what by this month was an increasingly ugly campaign.
 The worry among his aides had long been that McCain would let his indignation show. Going into the debates, an adviser expressed that very concern to me: ''If he keeps the debates on substance, he's very good. If it moves to the personal, then I think it's a disaster.'' Accordingly, Salter advised McCain before the first debate to maintain, one person privy to the sessions put it, ''a very generous patience with Obama -- in terms of, 'I'm sure if he understood. . . .' ''
 ''The object wasn't to appear condescending at all -- really, the opposite,'' an adviser said of Salter's tactic, which judging by the postdebate polls seemed to backfire. ''You put a bullet in a gun, figuring it'll get shot once. We had no idea it would be shot 10 times.''
 NARRATIVE 6:
 The Fighter (Again) vs. the Tax-and-Spend Liberal
 Having fallen back on the most cliched of political story lines -- the devil you know versus the devil you don't -- only to see the negative tactic boomerang, Schmidt and his colleagues cobbled together one last narrative with less than a month to go. Kicking it off atan event in Virginia Beach on Oct. 13, McCain delivered a speech that did not mention ''maverick,'' or ''country first,'' or ''no surrender.'' The new motif was a hybrid of the previous five story lines, especially the first. Mentioning some version of the word ''fight'' 19 times, McCain was once again a warrior -- only more upbeat, more respectful of his opponent, more empathetic to suffering Americans and far more disapproving of the president. Rick Davis told me in September, ''The worst scenario for Obama is if he winds up running against the McCain of 2000,'' an authentic independent. But if this was the McCain that was now emerging, it was awfully late in the game, and he was encumbered by other versions of McCain gone awry. 
 In the final debate on Oct. 15 at Hofstra University on Long Island, McCain barely mentioned any version of the word ''fight'' but performed forcefully, perhaps even indignantly. By the time Steve Schmidt entered the postdebate spin room, his Obama counterpart, David Axelrod, had already been holding the floor for 20 minutes. Schmidt wore a pinstripe suit and his blue eyes carried a victor's gleam. Like every other McCain aide I encountered that night, he was convinced not only that the senator had turned in his best performance but that viewers would see him as the clear winner. 
 Schmidt vowed that McCain would spend the final days of the campaign focused on the economy -- and on Joe the plumber, the kind of entrepreneur (so McCain thought at the time) who would become an endangered species in an Obama administration. But that did not stop Schmidt from a lengthy monologue questioning Obama's character and assailing the opposition's ''vicious'' and ''racially divisive'' ads. At a certain point, when a member of the foreign media asked him if all of this spinning was likely to help McCain, Schmidt allowed himself a small grin and said: ''Well, look. One of the things I always wonder is why we come in here at the end. . . . It doesn't really matter, to be totally truthful with you. It's just part of the ritual. Like eating turkey on Thanksgiving.''
 A few minutes later, his close friend and colleague Nicolle Wallace tugged Schmidt away from the scrum. They exited the spin room while Axelrod was still holding forth and flew back to Washington late that night.
 McCain and a number of his advisers remained at their hotel on Long Island. At the hotel bar where many of them lingered into the late hours, I asked one of them whether the debate could make a difference at this late stage. The adviser maintained that regardless of the instant-poll numbers, Joe the plumber and other talking points would likely resonate in the weeks to come.
 Then the adviser said with a helpless smile, ''Hopefully that'll change the narrative.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 26, 2008

 CORRECTION:
 The cover article on Page 52 this weekend about Senator John McCain's campaign misspells the given name of Mr. McCain's fellow senator from Arizona and the surname of the governor of Florida, both McCain supporters. The other Arizona senator is Jon Kyl, not John, and the Florida governor is Charlie Crist, not Christ. The article also misstates the name of the Ohio city where some McCain campaign staff members first met Mr. McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska. It is Middletown, not Middleton. And the article overstates the duties of Tucker Eskew, a member of Ms. Palin's team. He is officially her counselor, not her chief of staff, though campaign officials say that he performs many of the same duties.

HEADLINE: If Larry and Sergey Asked for a Loan ...

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
The hardest thing about analyzing the Bush administration is this: Some things are true even if George Bush believes them.
 Therefore, sifting through all his steps and missteps, at home and abroad, and trying to sort out what is crazy and what might actually be true -- even though George Bush believes it -- presents an enormous challenge, particularly amid this economic crisis.
 I felt that very strongly when listening to President Bush and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson announce that the government was going to become a significant shareholder in the country's major banks. Both Bush and Paulson were visibly reluctant to be taking this step. It would be easy to scoff at them and say: ''What do you expect from a couple of capitalists who hate any kind of government intervention in the market?'' 
 But we should reflect on their reluctance. There may be an important message in their grimaces. The government had to step in and shore up the balance sheets of our major banks. But the question I am asking myself, and I think Paulson and Bush were asking themselves, is this: ''What will this government intervention do to the risk-taking that is at the heart of capitalism?'' 
 There is a fine line between risk-taking and recklessness. Risk-taking drives innovation; recklessness drives over a cliff. In recent years, we had way too much of the latter. We are paying a huge price for that, and we need a correction. But how do we do that without becoming so risk-averse that start-ups and emerging economies can't get capital because banks with the government as a shareholder become exceedingly cautious.
 Let's imagine this scene: You are the president of one of these banks in which the government has taken a position. One day two young Stanford grads walk in your door. One is named Larry, and the other is named Sergey. They each are wearing jeans and a T-shirt. They tell you that they have this thing called a ''search engine,'' and they are naming it -- get this -- ''Google.'' They tell you to type in any word in this box on a computer screen and -- get this -- hit a button labeled ''I'm Feeling Lucky.'' Up comes a bunch of Web sites related to that word. Their start-up, which they are operating out of their dorm room, has exhausted its venture capital. They need a loan.
 What are you going to say to Larry and Sergey as the president of the bank? ''Boys, this is very interesting. But I have the U.S. Treasury as my biggest shareholder today, and if you think I'm going to put money into something called 'Google,' with a key called 'I'm Feeling Lucky,' you're fresh outta luck. Can you imagine me explaining that to a Congressional committee if you guys go bust?''
 And then what happens if the next day the congressman from Palo Alto, who happens to be on the House banking committee, calls you, the bank president, and says: ''I understand you turned down my boys, Larry and Sergey. Maybe you haven't been told, but I am one of your shareholders -- and right now, I'm not feeling very lucky. You get my drift?''
 Maybe nothing like this will ever happen. Maybe it's just my imagination. But maybe not ... 
 ''Government bailouts and guarantees, while at times needed, always come with unintended consequences,'' notes the financial strategist David Smick. ''The winners: the strong, the big, the established, the domestic and the safe -- the folks who, relatively speaking, don't need the money. The losers: the new, the small, the foreign and the risky -- emerging markets, entrepreneurs and small businesses not politically connected. After all, what banker in a Capitol Hill hearing now would want to defend a loan to an emerging market? Yet emerging economies are the big markets for American exports.''
 Don't get me wrong. I am not criticizing the decision to shore up the banks. And we must prevent a repeat of the reckless bundling and securitizing of mortgages, and excessive leveraging, that started this mess. We need better regulation. But most of all, we need better management. 
 The banks that are surviving the best today, the ones that are buying others and not being bought -- like JPMorgan Chase or Banco Santander, based in Spain -- are not surviving because they were better regulated than the banks across the street but because they were better run. Their leaders were more vigilant about their risk exposure than any regulator required them to be.
 Bottom line: We must not overshoot in regulating the markets just because they overshot in their risk-taking. That's what markets do. We need to fix capitalism, not install socialism. Because, ultimately, we can't bail our way out of this crisis. We can only grow our way out -- with more innovation and entrepreneurship, which create new businesses and better jobs. 
 So let's keep our eyes on the prize. Save the system, install smart regulations and get the government out of the banking business as soon as possible so that the surviving banks can freely and unabashedly get back into their business: risk-taking without recklessness.

HEADLINE: Energy

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
SENATOR MCCAIN draws a snappy chant from supporters at his rallies -- ''drill, baby, drill'' -- but his approach is broader and more nuanced. He does support increased and immediate oil exploration on public lands and off the coasts. But unlike his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, and many other Republicans, he opposes oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Mr. McCain advocates adding as many as 45 nuclear power plants, which would reduce consumption of fossil fuels, chiefly coal and oil, and the greenhouse gases they release that are the main culprits in global warming. He says that the Navy's 50-year history with nuclear-powered ships proves that the technology is safe. Mr. McCain supports increased use of renewable energy sources like wind, solar, geothermal and hydroelectric, but opposes large government subsidies for them, saying the market, not the government, should decide which new technologies are most promising. 
 SENATOR OBAMA said he believes oil companies should exploit existing leases on public lands and off the coasts before new areas are opened to drilling. He, too, opposes drilling in the Alaska refuge. Unlike Mr. McCain, he supports a windfall profits tax on oil companies. Mr. Obama does not oppose expansion of nuclear power in principle, but says it must be done safely and economically, considerations that for decades have halted construction of nuclear plants. Mr. Obama advocates spending $15 billion a year for the next 10 years to develop alternative-energy businesses, which he says will produce millions of new jobs. Mr. Obama, who is from Illinois, a big corn-producing state, supports federal subsidies for ethanol production. He also supports requiring utilities to produce about 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. And he backs higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks.
 THE CONTEXT
 While the two candidates agree that the nation must wean itself from a $700-billion-a-year addiction to imported oil, they disagree on how to do it. Both hew fairly closely to party orthodoxy: Mr. McCain backs using the tax code to encourage oil drilling, while Mr. Obama would use the proceeds from a windfall profits tax on oil companies to finance alternatives and help the poor. Although both acknowledge a need to encourage energy conservation and development of renewables, only Mr. Obama would use government mandates and tax incentives to achieve it; Mr. McCain calls such subsidies boondoggles.

HEADLINE: Scrutinizing Both Tickets, At the Top and the Bottom

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

 BODY:
WIPING down the washing machines at the Showcase Laundromat in Elizabeth, Anna Hamed became animated while talking about the presidential race. A solid supporter of Senator John McCain, Ms. Hamed, a 42-year-old native of Brazil who moved here 15 years ago, said she believed the Republican candidate had the experience and stature to be president, especially compared with his opponent.
''Obama, he talks too much and doesn't know what he is doing,'' said Ms. Hamed, who manages two laundromats. ''He has too many feelings, like a woman. To be president, you don't have to feel, you have to think, use your brain.''
Nearby, Yves Baudin pulled his clothes out of a dryer. A 44-year-old Haitian who came to Elizabeth 30 years ago, he spoke with equal passion about the Democratic candidate: Barack Obama. 
''I'm for Obama because I don't want to see any more pain from this war,'' said Mr. Baudin, a part-time truck driver who lost his job as a computer programmer in the economic downturn. ''They talk about the 4,000 soldiers who have died, but nobody's talking about all the people over there who've been killed.''
It may be true that there's not much talk about foreign casualties in the Iraq War -- or, for that matter, the war itself at the moment -- but there's no shortage of discussion about the 2008 presidential race throughout New Jersey. At diners and grocery stores, playgrounds and post offices, on Main Streets and Broad Streets, from farmlands to inner cities, New Jerseyeans are abuzz about the election now just over a week away. And as at the Showcase Laundromat, opinions are divided, not only over who would make the better president, but also about what issues matter most, how the campaigns are being run, and what the New Jersey electorate will do on Election Day.
While it should come as no surprise that New Jersey residents are highly opinionated, the level of knowledge about the race is extraordinary: from Jennifer Mustacchio, a 28-year-old Haddon Township funeral director and new mother who can cite Mr. McCain's proposal for 401(k) retirement plans, to Mike Thomas, a 51-year-old Newark hospital technician from Grenada who denounces the United States' poor relationship with the third world and sees Mr. Obama as the candidate who can re-establish diplomatic ties.
With the nation's economy in freefall, and an unpopular war costing billions of dollars that many feel would be better spent at home, New Jersey voters, like those in the rest of the country, seem to be paying closer attention to this race than any in recent history -- especially that handful of undecideds (a surprisingly substantial group in a designated ''blue state'') who have become the focus of both campaigns' efforts. Maria Buoy, a communications consultant from Millburn, said she and her husband were in that category.
''No one has said anything outstanding that makes me want to vote for or against them,'' said Ms. Buoy, 44, in between pushing her daughter Sophie, 5, on the swings at a Millburn playground. Economically, she said, they would be hurt by Mr. Obama's plan to increase taxes for those earning more than $250,000, but she said she was left cold by Mr. McCain's choice of running mate.
''I was leaning toward McCain, but I was really disappointed in Sarah Palin,'' Ms. Buoy said. ''That was a poor choice, and that concerns me about him.''
According to conventional wisdom, voting decisions are made based on the top of the ticket, but in this race, voters seem to be scrutinizing the vice presidential candidates more closely than usual. Many voters interviewed brought up Mr. McCain's age, and said that they were concerned about whether he would survive his term in office. They also talked about Mr. Obama's race, saying that they worried that as an African-American he would be a target of hate. Voters also had strong feelings for and against Ms. Palin. For as many people like Ms. Buoy who questioned Mr. McCain's selection, there were those who have fallen for the 44-year-old governor of Alaska.
''I love her,'' said John Millett, a 43-year-old single father who owns an import-export business in Millstone. ''I think she's a good choice. I love the way she speaks, her honesty, and I think it's good to have a woman in there.''
On the other hand, Diana Davis, a therapeutic touch therapist from Merchantville, said she lived in fear of a Palin presidency.
''I think McCain is too old, and, God forbid, if anything should happen to him, we'd have her for president,'' said Ms. Davis, 62, while licking an ice cream cone at the Maple Shade Custard Stand. ''I'd have to move to Canada.''
While Mr. Obama's choice of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. as running mate has gotten far less attention, some voters said that pick helped them make up their minds.
''I was a Hillary supporter all the way, so the biggest clincher for me for Obama was his choosing Joe Biden,'' said Lawrence Lehmann Jr., a 31-year-old student at Rutgers University in Camden, who works two part-time jobs to pay for college. ''He and McCain both have similarly long resumes, but Biden has not been a buddy of Bush's for the last eight years.''
Despite Mr. McCain's efforts to create distance between himself and President Bush, many voters who lean toward Mr. Obama linked Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush in explaining their choice.
''I was going to vote for McCain, but he's kept to the same ideas as Bush: raising taxes, keeping the troops in Iraq,'' said Sidney Cohen, 77, of Washington Township, over lunch at the Skylark Diner in Edison. ''Besides, he's too old.''
But if Mr. McCain's age and ties to the current administration stir reaction, Mr. Obama's race remains a factor for some. Though the sagging economy appears to be a primary consideration in selecting a candidate, racial issues have lingered just beneath the surface throughout the campaign. Shelley Lubetkin, who joined Mr. Cohen for a pastrami sandwich at the Skylark Diner, reflected the opinion of other older white women who have come around to Mr. Obama.
''In the beginning, I did care -- I didn't want a black person in there,'' said Ms. Lubetkin, 67, of Edison. ''But I don't care anymore. Obama's outgoing, and on top of everything, he's a good guy.''
Jasu Panara runs a car repair shop in Hamilton Township. He said he supported Mr. Obama because he was the best candidate to fix the economy.
''I don't care if Obama was a Muslim or if he had a relationship to a terrorist -- I care about what's in my pocket,'' said Mr. Panara, 54. ''As far as race, he's overcome that issue by himself.''
Adrienne Wallace, a homemaker from South Brunswick, agreed, arguing that Mr. Obama's mixed heritage helped mute the issue.
''He's black and white,'' said Ms. Wallace, 62. ''He has great potential. And hopefully, he's going to do the right thing for blacks, whites and all nationalities.''
Though opinions run deep this election season, many are keeping their positions to themselves, either by choice or on order. A 35-year-old firefighter manning the radio at a fire station in Newark said he was not allowed to talk about politics -- and then proceeded to praise Mr. McCain, largely due to the senator's plan of ''sticking it out'' in Iraq. At the Army recruiting center in Mercerville, Sgt. First Class Frank Colavita said that while in uniform, military personnel ''can't support, campaign or speak on behalf of any candidate,'' adding, with a smile: ''but catch me out of uniform.''
With the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series for the first time since 1993, South Jersey voters are divided not only between which candidate to back, but which race to concentrate on. Sporting a new Phillies T-shirt on Broadway in downtown Camden, Norma Quinones, 40, said that she supported Mr. Obama but that her energy was focused on her baseball team.
''Right now, I'm worried about the Phillies, because they're playing this week,'' said Ms. Quinones, an X-ray technician. ''And the election is when, in November?''
If the election were decided by the commerce of Ray Brinson, a Camden T-shirt vendor, Mr. Obama would be the victor.
''Anything with Obama on it -- they're doing better than my Phillies T-shirts,'' said Mr. Brinson, 37, of Willingboro. ''It's crazy. He's made me rich.''

HEADLINE: Reverse Mortgages Retooled

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
REVERSE-mortgage loans have grown increasingly popular in recent years, but lately potential borrowers have been in a holding pattern of sorts, waiting for new federal laws to take effect.
 President Bush signed legislation earlier this year raising the loan limit on reverse mortgages that are guaranteed by the federal government; such loans make up a majority of reverse mortgages.
 The new laws are intended to give older homeowners access to more of their homes' equity, provide stricter consumer protection, and, most important for New York-area residents, offer co-op owners the chance to apply for these loans. 
 ''As long as the co-op board allows it, it'll be a big opportunity for people,'' said David Peskin, the chief executive of the Senior Lending Network, a reverse mortgage lender in Melville, N.Y.
 Reverse mortgages allow borrowers who are 62 or older to tap into their homes' equity without having to repay the loan in the conventional way.
 Only when a borrower no longer uses the home as a primary residence must he or she pay back the loan, with whatever interest costs have accumulated. If the borrower dies, the loan is repaid by the estate. In the interim, no loan payments are required.
 The size of the loan depends on a borrower's age and the amount of equity available, but the new legislation increases the maximum loan amount -- which had varied by region -- to a flat $417,000 in the continental United States. The limits may be higher for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands.
 Lenders have frequently charged more than $7,000 to close these loans, but under the new law the closing costs are to be capped at $6,000.
 Industry executives said they expect the regulations on loan limits and closing costs, to be issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to go into effect around Nov. 1.
 Regulations allowing for reverse mortgages in co-ops may not arrive until the end of the year, but residents considering such loans should check with their buildings' administrators before applying. Mr. Peskin said such borrowers can expect be thwarted ''maybe 20 percent of the time.''
 Reverse mortgages have been available to co-op owners in the past, but only through lenders who did not obtain federal insurance for the loans. Because these lenders must bear more risk, interest rates on such mortgages have been significantly higher. For instance, borrowers who sought reverse mortgages above the federal loan limits earlier this month faced interest rates of 8 percent, compared with 4 percent for federally insured loans.
 Depending on how many years the loan accrues interest, that can make a huge difference in the amount owed by the homeowners or their heirs.
 One other important regulation expected in the coming months relates to counseling. 
 Critics say that under the current counseling system, counselors were sometimes not sophisticated enough to understand the growing array of reverse mortgage products, and sometimes offered shoddy advice.
 Under the new law, counselors will be required to pass exams designed to test their knowledge of these loans, and borrowers will pay for counseling sessions, which can cost $125. 
 The AARP offers free education sessions, according to Peter Bell, the president of the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, an industry trade group, and its counselors must pass exams before they start work. As a result, the AARP is a good place for borrowers to start if they want to position themselves for a reverse mortgage when the regulations take effect.

HEADLINE: Economy Voters' Top Worry, But Agreement Stops There

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

 BODY:
SUSAN TRUMPBOUR was certain that by now she would know whether she would vote for Senator John McCain or Senator Barack Obama for president.
 ''I thought the last debate would help me make up my mind, but I turned it off about three-quarters of the way through because there was too much bickering,'' said Ms. Trumpbour, 42, who lives in Bedford and writes for her own beauty Web Site.
 Ms. Trumpbour, a registered independent, remains undecided, which was unusual among about three dozen people who were interviewed recently in Mount Kisco and White Plains. Most of those interviewed said they were supporting the Democratic ticket headed by Mr. Obama. That's not surprising in a county where 44 percent of registered voters are Democrats, 27 percent are registered Republicans and 29 percent are registered independents, unaffiliated or registered with minor parties.
 But Ms. Trumpbour's ambivalence about the candidates was typical, even among those who said they were committed to a candidate. 
 Ms. Trumpbour, working on her laptop at a Starbucks in Mount Kisco, said that she worried that Mr. McCain was ''an extension of Bush in many ways'' but that ''there is something I don't trust about Obama.'' She is concerned about Mr. McCain's age (he is 72) and believes that while Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska ''sets a wonderful example, especially for girls, I really don't think she is ready to be the vice president or to govern.''
 She said she would decide after immersing herself in Time magazine and other publications. Ms. Trumpbour said she would probably have regrets, whomever she pulled the lever for.
 Some voters were confident with their decision.
 ''Why am I voting for Obama? Have you got an hour and a half?'' asked John Rodner, a retired math teacher who lives in Yorktown Heights. ''It could be the foreign policy. It could be education. It could be the economy. It could be Sarah Palin. They all stand out.''
 Suyapa Olivo, 38, who lives in Yonkers and is a patient caseworker for a New York City hospital, is a longtime supporter of Mr. Obama. She said she believed he would help middle-class voters like herself by cutting taxes and giving students tax breaks. Though Ms. Olivo has health insurance through her employer, she said she was concerned for those who are unemployed. 
 ''It feels like the middle class won't benefit from McCain,'' she said. ''And $5,000 towards health care is just not enough.''
 Anne Miller, 73, cited concern about the direction of the Supreme Court as the main reason she is voting for Mr. Obama. Ms. Miller, a White Plains resident and retired preschool teacher, said she also worries about health insurance. She has coverage, but her grown daughter does not.
 ''Roe versus Wade and the whole shift of the court, health care, the economy, global warming -- you name it,'' Ms. Miller said, taking a break from shopping at Sears. ''McCain comes across as a cranky old guy who doesn't speak to the issues and raises phony issues like Joe the Plumber and William Ayers. I used to like him, too. He used to seem to have integrity.''
 Doug Geddes, a real estate consultant and registered Conservative, is a strong McCain supporter. Mr. Geddes, 46, of Lewisboro, said he believed that McCain's policies reflected his own views of fiscal and social conservatism. 
 ''I'm worried we're on a path to an extreme movement to socialism,'' said Mr. Geddes, who was reading The Wall Street Journal at Starbucks. ''Barack Obama thinks I'm rich and I'm not rich. I live in a condominium. I drive a Honda Accord.''
 He said his taxes were already far too high and he worries that they will climb even higher if Democrats control the White House and Congress. ''Pelosi, Reid and Obama -- it's just going to be a disaster,'' he said. ''What are they going to ask -- another $20,000 from me in taxes? I don't have it to give.''
 Others expressed ambivalence about their choice. Khamar Maitland, 24, was shopping at the Galleria Mall with his mother and younger brother. Mr. Maitland, who works at Morgan Stanley in Purchase, recently decided to vote for Mr. Obama, but not without giving Mr. McCain's candidacy serious thought. 
 ''There were some things that McCain was saying that made sense,'' Mr. Maitland said. ''I'm pro-business, and for us to raise taxes on business, that would diminish the creation of jobs. But I'm against the war, and the middle class definitely needs tax breaks.''
 Nearly every voter cited the economy as a major concern.
 ''Who isn't worried about the economy?'' asked Joe Walker, 52. Mr. Walker, who works in sales analysis for a large automotive company, was taking a cigarette break outside Tighes Tavern in White Plains, where he had been watching the Giants game. A registered Democrat, he is leaning toward Mr. Obama.
 ''I'm definitely not voting for McCain and trying to talk myself into voting for Obama,'' he said. ''It's more likely that I'll write in Barry Goldwater. I'm fiscally conservative and socially liberal.''
 Mr. Walker said he was very angry about the Iraq war and was shocked that it took the economy to shake people up.
 ''It's like, you can kill our sons in Iraq, but don't mess with our 401(k)'s,'' he said. ''Honestly, I can't believe that people don't seem to hold the Republican Party responsible for the current situation. If the election is close, I'll vote for Obama.''
 Many voters said they were concerned about Mr. McCain's age, and others objected to his choice of running mate. 
 ''I'm voting against Palin,'' said Nancy Torrellas, 45, a lawyer from Ardsley. ''I was originally going to vote for McCain because I think he's very pro-Israel, until he picked Palin as his running mate.''
 Ms. Torrellas said she would vote for Mr. Obama, but wasn't happy about it. She said she was worried about his affiliation with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, but believed Mr. Obama had ''the smarter ideology and understanding with respect to my family's needs.''
 Her friend Deborah Notis, with whom she was having a cup of coffee, has decided not to vote at all. Ms. Notis, 38, of Chappaqua, called Mr. McCain ''an American hero,'' but she also objected to Ms. Palin.
 ''If you could guarantee me he'd live for four years, I'd probably vote for him,'' she said of Mr. McCain. ''But Sarah Palin is too extreme, and she doesn't come across as someone who has any capacity of leading this country.''
 Ms. Notis, who is not registered with either party, also refuses to pull the lever for Mr. Obama, who she says is not strong enough on terrorism. She said she was living in Battery Park in downtown Manhattan on 9/11; her husband was on the ground floor of one of the towers but escaped.
 ''Israel and terrorism are my biggest concerns,'' she said. ''It's my perspective that he is not pro-Israel enough. I also think that as much as everyone in Westchester County wants to vote for him, after their taxes go up after $250,000, people are not going to be happy. But the most important thing to me is that whoever gets into office keeps this country safe.''
 Howard Chung, 36, said, ''If I voted with my wallet it would definitely be for McCain, but without the Democrats I wouldn't be where I am now.''
 Mr. Chung, a stay-at-home dad who was sharing some fries with his son Marcus at the Galleria food court, said he would vote for Mr. Obama. Mr. Chung said he grew up on welfare and was grateful for the opportunities it provided him. He recently sold his shares in a restaurant business; before that he worked in finance. His wife is an investment banker on Wall Street.
 ''We have benefited from the boom for the last nine years or so,'' Mr. Chung said. ''But at this point I am really concerned. I'm a huge believer that the existence of a middle class is absolutely critical for the United States. From a pure tax situation, I would think that most Westchester residents would benefit from McCain, but are we going to worry about short-term tax breaks or about the bigger picture?''
 Many voters said they did not see any quick relief from their worries, no matter who is elected. Linda Serkin, 62, a registered Democrat who lives in Katonah, said she was voting for Obama but not enthusiastically.
 ''I don't see a clear person who can lead this country out of trouble,'' she said. ''I'm worried about taxes. I'm about retirement age. I can't give away my house, let alone sell it. I don't see either one of these guys getting us out of this mess.''

HEADLINE: In Arizona, Democrats Mount Strong Challenge

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
The prospect of a red state going blue. Democrats flush with cash. Republicans fighting to hold on.
 It is an increasingly familiar situation in the presidential campaign as Senator John McCain strives to hold or gain ground in battleground states. But in this case, the fight is over the Congressional delegation in Mr. McCain's home state of Arizona.
 Few doubt that Mr. McCain will win Arizona's 10 electoral votes. But less clear is whether he will have the coattails to rescue his party from Democratic advances in the state.
 Democrats -- and privately, some leading Republicans -- say they believe that the Democrats can pick up one and possibly two Congressional seats now held by Republicans. That would give them a majority of Arizona's Congressional delegation -- now with eight members -- for the first time since 1966. 
 ''I don't think that there is probably any seat in the country for Republicans this year that is safe, and particularly not in light of the spending disparity,'' said Representative John Shadegg, a seven-term Republican who is battling to hold on to the seat for his north Phoenix district.
 The Democratic surge has other seemingly comfortable Republican members of Congress in the West facing stiff challenges too, many for the first time in their careers. Those in the Democratic sights include Representatives Brian P. Bilbray and Dana Rohrabacher of California, Jon Porter of Nevada and Dave Reichert of Washington. 
 Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that what was happening in Arizona and neighboring states was ''really a microcosm of what is happening around the country,'' with Democrats seeking not only to defend the seats they won in 2006 but also to pick up more.
 Arizona may have some built-in advantages for Democrats this year. While the state may have a reputation for conservatism, the influx of new residents that has made it among the fastest-growing states has brought in droves of Democrats and independents. Republicans still account for 37 percent of registered voters, but the numbers of Democrats (34 percent) and independents (28 percent) are growing faster.
 Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat in her second term, endorsed Mr. McCain's Democratic opponent, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, in the primaries and is campaigning for him now. Ms. Napolitano is more popular than Mr. McCain in most polls.
 ''The Democrats are well-funded, organized and hungry,'' Nathan Sproul, a Republican strategist here, wrote this month in a memorandum to party members. ''It is every man and woman for himself or herself. Good luck. You're going to need it.''
 A race getting particular scrutiny pits Mr. Shadegg, whose family had close ties to the conservative lion Barry Goldwater, against Bob Lord, 52, a Democratic tax lawyer and political newcomer.
 Months ago Washington prognosticators filed Mr. Shadegg, 59, a proud member of the Republican class of 1994 that swept to power on a reform platform, in the safe column. But now in the closing weeks, even he acknowledges that he is in a competitive race as national Democrats have poured $1.5 million -- among the highest in their nationwide efforts -- into unseating him.
 Another race, in the northern Arizona district of Representative Rick Renzi, who is retiring and is under indictment on federal corruption charges, is more likely to go Democratic, in the view of party leaders on both sides.
 Two incumbent Democratic members of Congress, Representatives Harry E. Mitchell and Gabrielle Giffords, who won their first terms in 2006, are widely expected to withstand Republican efforts to reclaim the seats.
 Still, predictions get tricky here. Arizonans love to split their ballots, voting one way in local races and another in national contests.
 ''How would I define Arizona politics?'' asked Mike Hellon, a former state Republican Party chairman who ran for Congress in 2006. ''A chaotic mess.'' 
 ''It is hard to draw any clear lines, if you will, and make hard and fast characterizations of anything political in Arizona,'' he said.
 Though Mr. McCain's spot at the top of the ticket may seem a natural boost to his party brethren, he has had a contentious relationship with the leadership of the state party, which has been rent by infighting and outstripped by the Democrats in fund-raising.
 Mr. Shadegg, in an interview, said party leaders' crusade against illegal immigration had damaged Republicans statewide and hurt their chances of drawing the growing body of Hispanic voters.
 ''I believe the Republican Party in Arizona has been hurt very badly by the image created by those who have been most outspoken in their attacks on the illegal immigration issue, who have created the appearance that Republicans are xenophobic, that seem by their comments and are by their comments intolerant,'' Mr. Shadegg said.
 Randy Pullen, the state party chairman, did not answer a message seeking comment.
 Mr. Lord hopes to unseat Mr. Shadegg by portraying him as a party lackey of President Bush and Congressional Republican leaders.
 Mr. Lord contends that demographic changes in the district have made it less conservative than Mr. Shadegg, who is portrayed in one advertisement, sponsored by national Democrats, digitally morphing into Mr. Bush.
 ''If we don't put principle over party we all pay the price,'' Mr. Lord says in his own advertisement.
 ''I consider myself a pragmatist,'' Mr. Lord said in an interview, promising to buck Speaker Nancy Pelosi even though she has raised money for him. ''I tend to come out moderate on social issues and conservative on fiscal issues.''
 He is counting on voters like Tom Yarows, a retired sales representative and an independent, who attended a recent neighborhood gathering for Mr. Lord. He found Mr. Lord's promise to increase the use of solar and other alternative energy particularly attractive.
 ''He appears intelligent and honest and has good goals to work toward,'' Mr. Yarows said. ''Renewable energy is a big one, and the byproduct of that is jobs.''
 Mr. Shadegg, however, believes that Democrats have overstated changes in his district and got overly excited when he announced a retirement in February only to quickly rescind it when colleagues pressed him to stay in office.
 Mr. Shadegg said voters tended to be as conservative as he was and had not yet forgotten his father, Steve Shadegg, a popular figure and close adviser to Mr. Goldwater.
 Much of his support, he said, ''is based on the fact they know me, not so much that I am a Republican.''
 Still, like other Republicans this season, Mr. Shadegg is eager to underline his differences with Mr. Bush.
 He opposed some of Mr. Bush's signature legislation, including the No Child Left Behind education law. Too much testing, Mr. Shadegg said.
 And though Mr. Lord has criticized him for supporting the deregulation that Democrats blame for the Wall Street crisis, Mr. Shadegg pointed out that he objected to Mr. Bush and the Treasury Department's initial economic rescue plan. He voted for the revised one.
 He also criticized Mr. Bush's handling of the Iraq war in a way sure to please non-Republicans in his district, saying the president had ignored the lessons of Vietnam. That means, he said, go to war only with overwhelming force to quickly finish it.
 ''How then could Bush handle the Iraq war -- and Rumsfeld and Cheney -- the way they did?'' he said, calling himself ''angry and frustrated.''
 Kate McGee, a former school board member in north Phoenix, attended a meeting of a Republican women's club at which Mr. Shadegg recited, sometimes in great detail, the inner workings of the House and behind-the-scenes negotiating on bills. He admits he can run on a bit.
 But Ms. McGee saw only virtue.
 ''John Shadegg has changed Washington,'' she said. ''He is a fiscal conservative. He is consistent, and you know where he stands. He holds colleagues and the White House to their principles.''

HEADLINE: Ceding the Center

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
There are two major political parties in America, but there are at least three major political tendencies. The first is orthodox liberalism, a belief in using government to maximize equality. The second is free-market conservatism, the belief in limiting government to maximize freedom.
 But there is a third tendency, which floats between. It is for using limited but energetic government to enhance social mobility. This tendency began with Alexander Hamilton, who created a vibrant national economy so more people could rise and succeed. It matured with Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War Republicans, who created the Land Grant College Act and the Homestead Act to give people the tools to pursue their ambitions. It continued with Theodore Roosevelt, who busted the trusts to give more Americans a square deal. 
 Members of this tradition have one foot in the conservatism of Edmund Burke. They understand how little we know or can know and how much we should rely on tradition, prudence and habit. They have an awareness of sin, of the importance of traditional virtues and stable institutions. They understand that we are not free-floating individuals but are embedded in thick social organisms.
 But members of this tradition also have a foot in the landscape of America, and share its optimism and its Lincolnian faith in personal transformation. Hamilton didn't seek wealth for its own sake, but as a way to enhance the country's greatness and serve the unique cause America represents in the world.
 Members of this tradition are Americanized Burkeans, or to put it another way, progressive conservatives.
 This tendency thrived in American life for a century and a half, but it went into hibernation during the 20th century because it sat crossways to that era's great debate -- the one between socialism and its enemies. But many of us hoped this Hamilton-to-Bull Moose tradition would be reborn in John McCain's campaign.
 McCain shares the progressive conservative instinct. He has shown his sympathy with the striving immigrant and his disgust with the colluding corporatist. He has an untiring reform impulse and a devotion to national service and American exceptionalism. 
 His campaign seemed the perfect vehicle to explain how this old approach applied to a new century with new problems -- a century with widening inequality, declining human capital, a fraying social contract, rising entitlement debt, corporate authoritarian regimes abroad and soft corporatist collusion at home. 
 In modernizing this old tradition, some of us hoped McCain would take sides in the debate now dividing the G.O.P. Some Republicans believe the G.O.P. went astray by abandoning its tax-cutting, anti-government principles. They want a return to Reagan (or at least the Reagan of their imaginations). But others want to modernize and widen the party and adapt it to new challenges. Some of us hoped that by reforming his party, which has grown so unpopular, McCain could prove that he could reform the country.
 But McCain never took sides in this debate and never articulated a governing philosophy, Hamiltonian or any other. In Sunday's issue of The Times Magazine, Robert Draper describes the shifts in tactics that consumed the McCain campaign. The tactics varied promiscuously, but they were all about how to present McCain, not about how to describe the state of country or the needs of the voter. It was all biography, which was necessary, but it did not clearly point to a new direction for the party or the country. 
 The Hamiltonian-Bull Moose tendency is the great, moderate strain in American politics. In some sense this whole campaign was a contest to see which party could reach out from its base and occupy that centrist ground. The Democratic Party did that. Senior Democrats like Robert Rubin, Larry Summers and Jason Furman actually created something called The Hamilton Project to lay out a Hamiltonian approach for our day. 
 McCain and Republicans stayed within their lines. There was a lot of talk about earmarks. There was a good health care plan that was never fully explained. And there was Sarah Palin, who represents the old resentments and the narrow appeal of conventional Republicanism.
 As a result, Democrats now control the middle. Self-declared moderates now favor Obama by 59 to 30, according to the New York Times/CBS News poll. Suburban voters favor Obama 50 to 39. Voters over all give him a 21 point lead when it comes to better handling the economy and a 14 point lead on tax policy, according to the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. 
 McCain would be an outstanding president. In government, he has almost always had an instinct for the right cause. He has become an experienced legislative craftsman. He is stalwart against the country's foes and cooperative with its friends. But he never escaped the straightjacket of a party that is ailing and a conservatism that is behind the times. And that's what makes the final weeks of this campaign so unspeakably sad.

 ''It's true that I want to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans and go back to the rate they paid under Bill Clinton. John McCain calls that socialism. What he forgets is that just a few years ago, he himself said those Bush tax cuts were irresponsible. He said he couldn't 'in good conscience' support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of 'middle class Americans who most need tax relief.'

HEADLINE: Hard Questions About the Economic Crisis Shape the Senate Contest in Minnesota

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: RED WING, Minn. 

 BODY:
Senator Norm Coleman kicked off the final stretch of his re-election campaign on Main Street in this old railroad town about two weeks ago with a new theme: The Hope Express.
 But the express had not even left its first stop when it hit a bump in the road in the form of tough questions from a crowd of Coleman supporters gathered in a hotel dining room.
 Norman Sampson, a retired banker, asked why Mr. Coleman and his peers had not ''blown the whistle'' on the bad lending practices that led to the recent financial meltdown on Wall Street because, he said, ''everyone knew what was going on.''
 On the contrary, insisted Mr. Coleman, a first-term Republican. 
 ''This one we didn't see,'' he said. ''Who could imagine that a mortgage on a house in Red Wing, Minn., would be tied into and have an impact on the collapse of banks in London?''
 Mr. Sampson, a fellow Republican, shot back, ''A lot of us did.''
 There is no issue on the campaign trail more vexing for Mr. Coleman, 59, than the financial crisis and the unpopular Congressional bailout package that he supported.
 Economic turmoil is working against Republicans all across the country, but it has drowned out almost every other issue here in Minnesota, a state that could help determine whether the Democrats gain a 60-seat majority in the Senate. 
 For months, Mr. Coleman had been leading his Democratic opponent, the entertainer Al Franken, 57, whose campaign seemed doomed earlier this year. But an abrupt change happened over the past month as the financial crisis has taken root.
 Mr. Franken, best known as a performer on ''Saturday Night Live'' and as a radio host, has pushed forward in several polls. And the race is now considered a tossup.
 ''Franken has clearly been propelled by the sense of almost panic by Minnesota voters about what's going on nationally and here at home with the economy, and also globally with the two wars,'' said Lawrence R. Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. ''That's the main focus that's helped Franken defy his near-death experience.'' 
 The spring was not a good time for Mr. Franken. His campaign suffered from a barrage of troubling revelations about his personal finances and the repeated airing of some of his wilder performances and statements from his entertaining days. 
 But now, in addition to reaping some benefit from voter anxiety about the economy, he is also profiting from the statewide popularity of Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president. In Minnesota, Mr. Obama was leading Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, by 51 percent to 40 percent as of mid-October, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.
 ''I come to you in challenging times,'' Mr. Coleman told the supporters here in Red Wing. ''I need your help. I need your hope. I need your prayers.''
 But what the crowd gave him, at least that night, were more hard questions. 
 About an hour into the session, an aide announced that it was time to wrap up. Mr. Sampson, the questioner, said he was ''not convinced'' by Mr. Coleman's answers, even though he is a supporter. ''I think he needs to be challenged and know that we're not happy with what's been going on in Congress,'' he said. 
 Mr. Coleman had succeeded in earlier months in trying to make this election about whether Mr. Franken was a true Minnesotan, or just a celebrity flying in for a new part. 
 (Coincidentally, both candidates were born in New York. Mr. Franken moved with his family to Albert Lea, Minn., in his preschool years and left as a student bound for Harvard. He moved back three decades later. Mr. Coleman, a former mayor of St. Paul, settled in Minnesota after graduating from the University of Iowa Law School, and took a job as a prosecutor in the state attorney general's office.)
 ''Franken was the question in the first part,'' said Mr. Jacobs, who helped conduct and analyzed the polling data. ''Now the campaign is shifting back to a referendum on the incumbent and whether he should be held responsible for what happened over the last six years. And that's a very hard question for Norm Coleman to win.''
 According to two polls by the Humphrey Institute and Minnesota Public Radio News, Mr. Coleman's nine-point lead over Mr. Franken before Oct. 2 disappeared after that date, which coincided with the news of the financial crisis and bailout, and the vice-presidential debate. After Oct. 2, Mr. Franken's support among likely voters stood at 41 percent, up from 31 percent. Mr. Coleman's support dropped to 37 percent from 40 percent. 
 A third-party candidate, Dean Barkley, 58, an independent, kept steady at 14 percent. 
 Also, the latter poll found that 87 percent of Minnesotans sampled thought ''the country is off on the wrong track,'' up from 80 percent earlier in the fall. Among the growing number of voters concluding that the country is off track, Mr. Franken's advantage over Mr. Coleman widened to 13 points from 4. Both polls have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
 Undeterred, Mr. Coleman says he is still in this race to win. He is visiting towns and shaking hands at a feverish pace with more of a positive attitude in contrast to some of his earlier messages -- particularly his own negative television advertisements, which, in a rare turn, he pulled from the air earlier this month. 
 ''We can get our way out of this,'' Mr. Coleman said of the bad economy at an appearance in Red Wing. ''We can move forward.''
 Republican Party officials said their candidates were suffering all over because of the amount of blame being thrown their way for the souring economy and because of President Bush's unpopularity.
 ''In a normal year, I think Norm Coleman would beat Al Franken by 20 points,'' said Senator John Ensign of Nevada, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''But it's just a very tough climate for Republicans everywhere right now. Norm's a great senator. He's done a great job representing that state. That's why he would normally be re-elected easily.
 ''This race is going to come down to who does the best in the last 12 days. When you have a dead-even race, it really is a question of who finishes the strongest.'' 
 As for Mr. Franken's strategy for the rest of the race, nothing is changing, he said after a news conference at small mountaineering shop in Duluth where he talked about saving jobs and doing away with tax cuts for the rich. ''We're going to be going as much as I can around the state talking to folks,'' he said. ''It seems to have worked pretty well so far.''
 Anyone who expected to see a jokester on the campaign trail must be disappointed. Mr. Franken is a student of policy and delivers his message with a sense of serious urgency and a dash of outrage on behalf of his target audience -- middle-class families. 
 ''It's been quite a roller-coaster ride,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''But at the end of the day we're feeling quite good.''
 It is still unclear what role Mr. Barkley's candidacy could have on election day. A campaign manager for former Gov. Jesse Ventura who briefly filled the seat left vacant when Senator Paul Wellstone was killed in a plane crash in 2002, he has come to tangle with Mr. Coleman in recent weeks, forcing Mr. Coleman to fight back and take on both of his opponents at once.
 ''I'm honored that I'm finally getting attacked,'' Mr. Barkley said during a recent debate. ''I wondered when I would. Thank you, Norm.''

 REPORT SHOWS IRAQI PROJECT
 To Be Late and Over Budget
 The substantial cost overruns and delays in the construction of a huge, American-financed wastewater plant outside Falluja has become an example of the failed and often oversold program to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure with American dollars and skill. In a report to be released Monday, federal investigators found that the project has tripled in cost to $100 million and has fallen at least two years behind schedule. PAGE A5
 A GAMBLE ON ISRAELI ELECTIONS
 When Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister of Israel and head of the centrist Kadima Party, asked President Shimon Peres to declare early elections, she assured him that she would win at the polls. That outcome, however, is by no means certain, as recent opinion surveys point to a likely victory for Benjamin Netanyahu. PAGE A8 
 EX-MILITANT CONCEDES IN RIO VOTE
 Fernando Gabeira, a Brazilian congressman who helped kidnap an American ambassador during Brazil's military dictatorship, came up short Sunday in his bid to be elected mayor of Rio. Mr. Gabeira conceded defeat to Eduardo Paes, a congressman who is allied with Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president. With 99 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Paes had 51 percent of the vote to Mr. Gabeira's 49 percent. PAGE A8
 REINVENTING THE FRENCH OYSTER
 The Gillardeau name is to fine oysters what Hermes is to neckties. Thierry Gillardeau is a member of the fourth generation of that family of oyster farmers, and he has tried to update the way they produce their fleshy oysters, called ''speciales,'' even as most people farm them the way they have for centuries. ''They could be more profitable,'' he said. ''But the past is so important to them that they don't want to change.'' PAGE A5
 SOMALIA AGREES TO PEACE DEAL
 Somalia's transitional government signed a document in the neighboring country of Djibouti in which it agreed to police the country jointly with an insurgent militia. It also said it would relocate Ethiopian troops, who are reviled by many Somalis -- but whose firepower has kept the transitional government from collapsing. PAGE A11
 COLOMBIAN LAWMAKER ESCAPES
 Oscar Lizcano, a former Colombian lawmaker who was kidnapped in 2000 by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, escaped through the jungles with one of his rebel captors. Mr. Lizcano, the politician held longest by the group, appeared at a news conference wearing a tattered black T-shirt and a tangled gray beard, and said that he had marched for three days with his rebel jailer before reaching an army post.

 A PYRAMID FOR THE LIVING
 That's All but Forgotten
 The explorers set out to find the world's sixth-largest pyramid, said to have been all but abandoned by the civilization that built it. They had only bottled water and a rental car's coolness to ward against temperatures in the oppressive low 70s. At first, despair. But then it loomed, 321 feet high, close to Interstate 40, the Great American Pyramid of Memphis. Dan Barry, This Land. PAGE A12
 BUSINESS WARY OF OBAMA PLAN
 Senator Barack Obama has not released details of his plan to provide affordable coverage for the uninsured, but economists believe he might require large and medium companies to contribute as much as 6 percent of their payrolls. Small-business owners, in particular, do not find that a reassuring prospect. ''To all of a sudden whack 6 to 7 percent of payroll costs, forget it,'' one said. PAGE A16
 STARTING EARLY ON VOTE DISPUTES
 Republican charges of voter fraud -- and Democratic charges of disenfranchisement -- are so expected that the only oddity might be an election in which they did not happen. But what is different this year is the degree of skirmishing, and the flurry of lawsuits, in advance of the election. ''It is definitely happening earlier and with far more ferocity than we've ever seen,'' said a lawyer with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights. PAGE A19
 EATING THE INVADERS
 It would be hard to come up with a greener solution, short of people themselves eating the weeds: Nationwide, sheep grazing is gaining popularity as a low-cost, nontoxic tool in the battle to control leafy spurge, knapweed, dalmation toadflax and other invasive weed species. And with a study indicating that nonnative weeds have invaded 40 percent to 50 percent of America's croplands, pasture and public lands and are spreading at a rate of 1.75 million acres per year, it is a ''growth industry,'' as a consultant with the American Sheep Industry Institute put it.

 AVOIDING A NEW DOT-COM BUST
 During the first Internet boom, Silicon Valley's start-ups either grew fast or died trying, sometimes spectacularly. Some of the casualties of the bust became legendary. But in this downturn, start-ups are adopting a strategy that they hope will let them hang on instead of flame out, investors and entrepreneurs say. PAGE B1
 THE QUIET TECH MOGUL
 Cher Wang, a daughter of one of the richest men in the world, is not one to sponge. She started her own multibillion-dollar company, the HTC Corporation, which makes one out of every six smart phones sold in the United States, including the T-Mobile G1, an iPhone rival. But you probably have never heard of her. ''I kind of like it that way,'' she said. PAGE B3
 PAYING LESS TO PLAY
 Record labels and Webcasters may be close to a compromise that would reduce the royalties that online radio stations pay artists and labels for the rights to stream songs to listeners. An agreement would still leave Webcasters trying to figure out how to bring in enough revenue to cover their costs. Broadcast stations pay nothing to artists and labels, under a longstanding agreement based on the notion that radio provides free promotion for their work. PAGE B4
 NO MORE WORLD RECORDS
 What happens when you write a book about how to get into ''Guinness World Records''? (Hint: You should not plan on a sequel.)

 THE GRAVY TRAIN ENDS
 Whichever side of the political fence you're on, it's hard to imagine that you'll miss the onslaught of campaign advertising that will suddenly come to an end after Election Day.

 After years in which tight school budgets and various federal and state testing mandates have narrowed curriculums nationwide to emphasize basic reading, math and science, Pelham Memorial High School is among a handful of high-performing school districts that have begun to expand their course catalogs with electives. Jewelry and Metalsmithing and the History of Rock 'n' Roll are two of the 17 new electives added to the curriculum this year. PAGE A21
 SHADES OF AN OLD CASE
 The comparisons seemed inevitable: a 24-year-old body piercer said that on Oct. 15 he was wrestled to the ground by a group of New York police officers on a subway platform and that one of the officers sodomized him with an object. The allegations revived memories of the case of Abner Louima, a 30-year-old Haitian immigrant who was brutally assaulted with a broken broomstick by an officer 11 years ago. But people who worked on the Louima case say the differences seem vast. PAGE A23

 SO FAR, ANOTHER BIG YEAR
 For Little Guy in Football
 With five teams from outside the major conferences ranked in the Bowl Championship Series standings, it has been a big year for the little guy in college football. But for those dreaming of crashing the B.C.S. party, it's highly unlikely that more than one team will qualify. Since the B.C.S. began in 1998, a non-B.C.S. team has qualified only three times, excluding Notre Dame. The last time it happened was in January, when Hawaii was routed by Georgia in the Sugar Bowl.

 Penn State took measures to protect the junior quarterback Daryll Clark after he sustained a concussion in Saturday's 13-6 win over Ohio State, sidelining him with the Nittany Lions behind by 3 points.

 THE WORLD OF THESE MAD MEN IS MADDER THAN THEY ARE
 The world didn't end with the Cuban missile crisis, yet the relief on ''Mad Men'' was faint and tentative, as if a burden was not so much lifted as tugged aside for a moment, like Don Draper's marital crisis, Alessandra Stanley writes. The second season of ''Mad Men'' ended on AMC on Sunday night not with the bang of mutually assured destruction but with a pause, she says. PAGE C1 
 A FAIR SHARE OF GEORGE
 ''George, Being George,'' an oral biography of George Plimpton, treats ''George'' as much more than a first name, Janet Maslin writes. It is a flattering adjective, a signifier of status and an explanation for practically any kind of behavior. It is very, very George in its heralding of the marvelously George qualities that shaped Mr. Plimpton's legend and legacy, she says. ''But George, being George, remained George'' is an actual sentence to be found in the book. PAGE C1 
 WHEN TIMES ARE BAD, SING OR SAW
 Bouncy teenagers and a psychotic killer -- in separate movies -- packed multiplexes over the weekend, delivering an unusually high box office take. Hollywood's prosperous weekend was led by ''High School Musical 3,'' above, and ''Saw V,'' which together brought in $72 million in North American theaters. The opening gross for ''High School Musical 3'' instantly made it one of the most profitable motion pictures of the decade. And the success of both movies delivered a forceful message to Hollywood about what sells in difficult economic times. PAGE C2 
 A BAND FOR THE MASSES
 The Killers' first two albums were treated by many critics as less than serious and a naked play for prestige, respectively. But no one told Killers fans, apparently, who at the Hammerstein Ballroom, during an often persuasive show, proved to be great agnostics, treating songs from both albums with equal reverence, Jon Caramanica writes. To them, he says, the notion that the Killers had ever been anything other than a worthy pop group seemed laughable. PAGE C3 HEARTBREAK AND PUPPETS
 Two years ago, Anthony Minghella's production of ''Madama Butterfly,'' featuring puppets, served as a calling card for the new general manager's vision of the Metropolitan Opera as a place for great singing and theatrical innovation. Mr. Minghella died in March, and his production (now carried through by Carolyn Choa, his widow and the original choreographer) had largely shed its novelty value when it returned to the Met recently. Yet even as it grows familiar, this staging retains its full capacity to beguile and move the viewer, Steve Smith writes. PAGE C5

Silicon Valley has always been a land of big, bold dreams. In the first Internet boom its start-ups either grew fast or died trying, sometimes spectacularly. The casualties of the bust, like Pets.com and Webvan, became legendary. 
 In this downturn, say investors and entrepreneurs, start-ups are adopting a strategy that they hope will let them hang on instead of flame out. 
 To preserve cash, many tech start-ups are rushing to lay off employees and cut expenses. They are shelving their dreams of Google-size riches and getting small, humble and thrifty, all with the more modest goal of surviving the coming economic winter. 
 Once upon a time, an unprofitable Internet start-up like Zivity, a social site that revolves around photos of models, might have turned into just another dot-bomb. Though it has paltry revenues and just 20,000 registered users, the company pays only $8,000 a month to rent its offices in San Francisco and has received $8 million from investors. This month it laid off 8 of its 22 employees -- saving enough money to stay alive through 2011 and survive even a prolonged recession. 
 ''We think we have a valuable product,'' said Cyan Banister, Zivity's co-founder. ''We should be able to weather the storm.'' 
 Even in normal economic times, a majority of start-ups fail. But the same factors that have made it so easy to create Web 2.0-style start-ups -- low fixed costs, access to inexpensive overseas programmers and cheap ways to advertise online -- also make it relatively easy for even faltering companies to cut back their operations to the bare minimum and hang on through a slump.
 Web start-ups ''don't fail in the same way they used to fail,'' said Brad Burnham, a partner at the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, adding that the previous generation of Internet companies lived hard and died young. Knowing when to pull the plug on the current crop of more frugal companies is now ''different, more subtle, more problematic,'' he said. ''They don't run into a wall.''
 The Web companies in this new generation are so efficient with capital that venture capitalists ''may not have the plug in our hand,'' Mr. Burnham said.
 The only certainty in Silicon Valley is that survival is quickly becoming more challenging. The growth in online display advertising, which helps fuel the new Internet ecosystem, is declining. Venture capitalists and other investors in start-ups, like hedge funds, are cutting back. The market for initial public offerings remains closed and potential acquirers -- Google, Yahoo and the rest -- are deep in their own problems. Many entrepreneurs and deal makers agree that a shake-out is indeed coming. 
 Venture capitalists have begun preaching frugality, urging the start-ups they have invested in to cut costs and get profitable. Their advice shares themes: cut employees, do not count on raising more money and move quickly. 
 The entrepreneurs appear to be listening. AdBrite, an online advertising network in San Francisco that raised $35 million in venture capital, recently laid off one-third of its staff, or 40 employees, to get to profitability next year. The company's chief executive, Iggy Fanlo, ran the e-commerce site Shopping.com during the first dot-com bust, and he said he recalled how wave after wave of layoffs sank morale. 
 ''I had gone through this before and we had death by a thousand cuts,'' Mr. Fanlo said. ''I wanted to credibly look people in the eye this time and say we are profitable.''
 Every day seems to bring a new round of layoffs. In the last two weeks, the music site Imeem, the social search site Mahalo, the visual search engine Searchme, the real estate site Zillow, the Internet radio site Pandora and the social network Hi5 all cut as much as a quarter of their employees. 
 For many entrepreneurs, the lone goal has become survival. At Seesmic, a video blogging service, the day of reckoning -- when it runs out of the $6 million it raised in May -- will come in three years. To make the money last, Loic Le Meur, the chief executive, recently laid off seven employees, or one-third of his staff, and cut all projects not directly related to the video service. 
 ''If I can't make this work in three years it will be a failure,'' Mr. Le Meur said. ''If I can and I get through this, it will be much stronger.'' 
 Even companies with less than stellar track records and revenues say they can live through a protracted slump. 
 Lala, a music site based in Palo Alto, Calif., has scrapped two music services and recently began a third site in conjunction with the major labels. The company raised $35 million three years ago and, thanks to financial prudence, has $20 million in the bank. It recently delayed plans to double its staff and it put its excess office space up for sublet. 
 Lala's founder, Bill Nguyen, expressed a measure of relief at the chill in the Valley. ''This whole economic crisis allows me not to have to grow,'' he said. ''I view this as a free hall pass.''
 That wholesale resetting of expectations might be the biggest change to settle over Silicon Valley. Instead of aiming for blockbuster public offerings or market-shaking acquisitions, most entrepreneurs now just want to endure. But if not enough people use these start-ups' services and revenue does not grow fast enough to attract potential acquirers, mere survival may not look so good.
 At Faraday Media, a Palo Alto start-up that is trying to create a personalized version of the Internet for its users, there is no revenue, no office space (the five employees work from their homes) and little chance of raising any capital from the newly miserly angel investors who would otherwise support a start-up of its size.
 Chris Saad, Faraday Media's founder, said the company saw no reason to give up. ''We are committed to the idea that the company and technology we are building is fundamentally going to reshape the Web,'' he said. ''We are committed to investing our time into this for as long as it takes.''
 If these skeletal start-ups do succumb to the downturn, firms like Sherwood Partners, which specializes in bankruptcy consulting and shutting down companies, will be waiting. Sherwood Partners has not yet had the kind of activity it witnessed during the last bust, but Martin D. Pichinson, a partner at the company, is preparing for a burst of new business as many start-ups acknowledge that just because they can survive does not mean they should. 
 Failing start-ups ''are already out there, and we are starting to close some of them, when investors say it needs to be done,'' Mr. Pichinson said.

HEADLINE: New Horizons in High School Classrooms

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: PELHAM, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The students in the jewelry and metalsmithing class at Pelham Memorial High School painstakingly coiled copper and brass wires into necklaces the other morning, while across the hall, the history of rock 'n' roll class pondered the meaning of Don McLean's ''American Pie.'' 
 These are two of the 17 electives added this year to the curriculum in this affluent Westchester County suburb, redefining traditional notions of a college-preparatory education and allowing students to pursue specialized interests that once were relegated to after-school clubs and weekend hobbies. Now, budding musicians take guitar lessons, amateur war historians re-enact military battles, and future engineers build solar-powered cars -- all during school hours, and for credit.
 ''It's letting people learn about what they love rather than dictating what they should be learning,'' said Morgan McDaniel, a senior who added the rock 'n' roll class to her roster of Advanced Placement classes in calculus, biology, European history and studio art. 
 After years in which tight school budgets and a battery of federal and state testing mandates have narrowed curriculums nationwide to emphasize basic reading, math and science, Pelham and a handful of other high-performing school districts have begun to expand their course catalogs with electives. 
 In Briarcliff Manor, also in Westchester, cardio fitness, advanced Java programming and Mandarin are among a half-dozen classes that have been introduced at Briarcliff High as both less-stressful alternatives to high-powered A.P. courses and as a tool to keep seniors interested in school. 
 In New Jersey, Ridgewood High School is bringing back woodworking and adding global economics, 3-D animation and seven other electives over the next two years to encourage students to cultivate interests beyond traditional subjects and to demonstrate the depth and seriousness of study that appeal to colleges.
 And on Long Island, Roslyn High School recently added nine electives, many in business specialties like sports and entertainment marketing, investments, and accounting because many of its graduates pursue business careers. Kevin Scanlon, Roslyn's principal, said the courses have raised grade-point averages because students ''tend not to skip electives.''
 While some high schools have long offered a smorgasbord of electives, many began cutting back in the late 1970s and '80s under a back-to-basics movement. They eliminated even more after the No Child Left Behind law in 2001, to focus on bringing all students up to minimum federal and state standards. According to the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based research group, about a dozen states and the District of Columbia have decided to lower elective requirements for graduating classes over the next five years, in many instances swapping them for core subjects like math, science and foreign languages.
 Even amid this trend, Richard A. Flanary, a senior director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said he had seen a smattering of high schools, which had met the No Child Left Behind standards, move to free up resources and staff for electives in the past couple of years. While some schools consider these courses as fun breaks from the pressure of academics, Mr. Flanary said, much of the demand for electives comes from parents and students who see them as a way to round out transcripts for entrance to elite colleges.
 With the recent sharp economic downturn, some school officials say they may have to re-evaluate their new electives, perhaps raising the minimum enrollment from 15 to 20 or 25 students. ''This is an area of discretion, so if schools are struggling financially, you can understand why this is a tempting target,'' said James Kaishian, Briarcliff's principal.
 In Pelham, the high school spent $125,000 -- with $21,000 of it from a local foundation -- to expand its electives by 50 percent this year after extending its school day and adjusting the class schedule to create an extra 40-minute class period. Jeannine Clark, the principal, said she hired only one new teacher, in art, covering the other classes by adding stipends or rearranging teachers' workloads.
 John Brice, the Pelham school board president, said the electives have allowed the district to expand its art and music instruction and to offer the diversity of courses of a much larger high school -- without losing the intimacy of a smaller one (Pelham has 767 students). ''There's a serendipitous value in taking a course that you might not have thought would be of interest, and discovering it's a lifelong passion,'' he said.
 Joan Morgan, a fund-raiser and event planner whose daughter, Morgan McDaniel, is taking history of rock 'n' roll at Pelham, said that after she and her husband got a 10-minute overview of the class last month at an open house, ''we were both panting to stay.''
 The new electives were drawn from a list of 38 topics proposed by teachers, and include digital music, ecology and math preparation for the SAT -- which is being taught by Jon Totillo, who also teaches A.P. calculus and tutors students for the SAT outside of Pelham at $85 an hour. Minimum enrollment in the electives was 15 students; the rock 'n' roll class drew 33.
 Julia Filemyr, a senior who is taking jewelry making, said the skills she was learning would help her pursue an art career. She is already creating wearable pieces inspired by the Egyptians and Greeks. ''I'll have a lot more to add to my collection,'' she said, displaying drop earrings that she had crafted from beads made of recycled magazines. 
 One of the more popular new electives, on military history, grew out of an after-school club in which students gathered for war games like Stratego and Axis and Allies. Greg Bratone, a senior who wrote in his college applications about his passion for military history, said that while there was no game-playing in class, there was plenty of discussion about war strategy to hold his interest. 
 ''With some classes, you don't like the subject that much -- I wasn't a big science person -- but now that it's military history, I'm all ears,'' he said.
 One recent afternoon, Greg and his classmates hunkered down over scraps of yellow and green paper spread on a classroom floor to represent opposing armies. As the green army was outnumbered and outflanked by the yellow, the teacher, Andrew Scott, asked students what they would do.
 ''Run?'' offered one student, drawing laughs.
 Mr. Scott conceded that the student had a point -- and paraphrased the wisdom of the Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu that the greatest generals do not have to fight.
 ''It a little more lighthearted and relaxed because we're an elective,'' he said. ''We're not driving toward a big goal or a big state exam.''

HEADLINE: Fame, Yes; Fortune, Not So Much

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
''Climbing on, climbing aboard,'' the English band Friendly Fires sang during at least two of its many sets at the CMJ Music Marathon. ''Giving it a little bit more!'' 
 The group was among the more than 1,100 bands performing in Manhattan and Brooklyn during CMJ's annual showcase of mostly new, mostly independent music: five days of listening, club-hopping, panel discussions, schmoozing, texting and, time and space permitting, dancing. 
 What were all those bands climbing onto? A music business in bewilderment and disarray, fueled far more by musicians' compulsion to create and perform than by any assurance of a career. Perhaps that's the same as it ever was, only with the Internet twist that while record labels hold less power and sales potential than they have in decades, music can reach more listeners more quickly than ever. 
 It's a great moment for musicians who want to be heard and a difficult one for musicians who need to be paid. Which didn't prevent thousands of them from performing at CMJ -- up to a dozen times in five days for bands like the Muslims, Women, Jay Reatard, the Vivian Girls and Pattern Is Movement -- in hopes that sheer exposure will, sooner or later, pay off. 
 The marathon, which concluded on Saturday night, was created in 1980 by the weekly college-radio newsletter once called College Music Journal and now known as CMJ New Music Report. It started as a pre-Web way to share information, practical knowledge and contacts among the many do-it-yourself bands discovered and nurtured by noncommercial college radio, groups that at the time were just beginning to create lines of communication between local scenes.
 Now, after the alternative-rock boom of the 1980s and '90s briefly thrust independent bands onto major labels and pop radio playlists, the CMJ Music Marathon is in a way back where it started: gathering do-it-yourselfers, even though what once was word-of-mouth is now thoroughly accessible online. 
 In the 21st century it's more important to draw listeners to a Myspace or iTunes or Emusic page than to find a limited-edition vinyl manufacturer, as in the '80s. But one thing hasn't changed: the overwhelming majority of musicians are going to survive by performing, and CMJ is one long battle of the bands. 
 This year's marathon was as fragmentary and niche-happy as the online realm of blogs and Internet radio. There were only a handful of college-radio heroes returning in triumph, among them Deerhoof, Broken Social Scene and Crystal Castles. Coheed and Cambria took over Terminal 5 to play through their four albums in four nights; a big hip-hop concert headlined by Talib Kweli and David Banner was also incorporated into CMJ.
 The marathon also encompassed at least one full-fledged pop star: Roisin Murphy, an Irish pop-electronica update of Annie Lennox of Eurythmics, making her American debut in a costumed and choreographed spectacle with her band at a Chelsea megaclub, the Mansion. While CMJ offered its share of conceptual, college-circuit electropop -- from Crystal Castles, Passion Pit and Little Boots -- Ms. Murphy had snappier songs and richer arrangements. 
 Meanwhile, there was no unified, overwhelming buzz band, a role filled by bands like Arcade Fire and Black Kids in past years. The closest contenders were probably Friendly Fires, whose songs are wonderfully overstuffed with reshuffled and reinvigorated ideas from the 1970s and '80s -- postpunk guitars, funk beats, singalong choruses, worldbeat percussion -- and School of Seven Bells, merging dance beats, throbbing meditative drones, guitar distortion and blissed-out harmony vocals by twin sisters. Crowds also turned out for multiple appearances by enjoyable but limited throwbacks like Crystal Antlers, playing tangled late-'60s psychedelia, and the Muslims, playing streamlined latter-day punk. 
 It's perpetually amazing how many collegians are eager to relive their parents' musical childhoods. Perhaps, during an intractable war and an economic decline, both the psychedelic late-1960s and the punk and disco 1970s don't seem so distant. 
 Though sampling error is guaranteed when it's possible to hear only a small fraction of the marathon, it's clear that music remains far healthier than the music business. There were representatives from countless categories and minicategories, from freak folk to alternative rap, neo-soul to metal. 
 Many musicians who strive to support themselves onstage are writing material that doesn't strive for radio-style catchiness but mesmerizes and clobbers live audiences instead, like Ponytail's joyfully consonant guitar blare and whooping vocals, or the way Drink Up Buttercup bashed out its bouncy, oompahing songs on a much-dented garbage can. 
 My CMJ itinerary led to a surprising amount of expansive, musicianly progressive rock. Kirsten Ketsjer, a Danish trio, moved between long stretches of precise, perpetual-motion guitar patterns and bursts of punky rock. Women, from Canada, ambled from calmly intoned songs to meshed dissonant guitars to noise squalls. Pattern Is Movement, from Philadelphia, had passages of Broadway or operetta melody amid burly drum-and-keyboard workouts, and Villa Vina, from New York, veered between unison heavy-metal riffing and complex, meter-shifting counterpoint. 
 There was also a streak of optimistic internationalism. Ruby Suns, from New Zealand, cheerfully sampled and layered everything from African guitars and soca rhythms to a Phil Spector drumbeat. Gang Gang Dance, from New York, mingled electronic dance beats with exotica. The songs of Au, from Portland, Ore., spanned East-West drones and upbeat Afro-Caribbean rhythms. 
 The din of conversation during CMJ sets grew quiet for intimate songs about heartache from the Norwegian performer Ane Brun, with sparse, modal guitar parts and an eerie quaver in her voice, and Chris Pureka, from Massachusetts, playing folky, richly imagistic tales of separation. There were brasher songwriters, too. Wye Oak, the Baltimore duo Jenn Wasner and Andy Stack, segued thoughtful roots-tinged rock into richly overwhelming textural excursions. Arboretum mixed the Celtic and the cosmic in somber, reverberating dirges with lyrics that often turned apocalyptic. ''The strange is assured,'' they sang. 
 For much of CMJ, the large-scale music business might as well have been on another planet. Money is tight. Although overall attendance (including musicians) was up 5 percent from last year, there were surprisingly few exhibitors at convention booths in the Skirball Center at New York University, where CMJ's panel discussions were held. The bands lugging their amplifiers around the Lower East Side and Williamsburg were envisioning not arena audiences and big royalty checks but the congratulations of a new fan or two and the chance to be mentioned on a music blog. Their music can now spread worldwide instantaneously, but in the meantime, they have to make it to the next club gig.

HEADLINE: As China Goes, So Goes ...

 BODY:
As the world tips into recession, China's economic decisions could affect how other countries fare in the downturn. 
 Over the last 30 years, China has hitched its economy to the industrial world, exporting cheap goods to the United States and other developed nations, building up an enormous trade surplus that will hit about $400 billion this year. As those industrial economies sputter, China is now in a position to pick up some of the slack: selling more of its own goods at home and buying more from the rest of the world. 
 To get China's consumers to spend, the government will need to spend more at home, investing in public works projects and providing more social benefits -- including health insurance and pensions -- so its citizens don't feel they have to save so much for a rainy day. 
 This is clearly in Beijing's interest, though China's leaders are still clinging to the old export strategy. 
 China is already feeling the impact of a slower world economy. Both economic growth and export growth have braked sharply. The slowdown threatens job creation, direly needed to absorb millions of rural Chinese seeking employment in the cities. 
 Over the summer the Chinese central bank put an end to its short-lived policy of allowing the yuan to gradually appreciate against the dollar, a policy aimed at reducing inflation that would also raise the price of Chinese exports. Last week, the Chinese government announced that it would increase its rebates on taxes charged to exporters -- giving them a further boost.
 But trying to capture a bigger share of shrinking markets in the United States, Europe and Japan -- just as they tip into recession -- won't provide China much of an economic lift. What it will do is contribute to the slowdown in the rest of the world by hogging demand. China would get much more bang for the buck if it focused on stimulating its own domestic markets for goods and services. 
 Given the desperate mess Washington has made of its own financial system, few countries are eager to take American advice these days. After years of Congressional China-bashing, Beijing may be especially resistant.
 Still, it is in China's interest to change. China has grown 13-fold over the last 30 years, thanks to hypercharged exports and white hot investment. But its economy is lopsided. Consumer spending amounts to little over a third of economic production, probably the lowest share in any country in the world. And its overwhelming dependence on exports has made it overwhelmingly vulnerable to changes in world demand. 
 The government in Beijing, which is running a huge budget surplus, also has money to spare. 
 The government has announced some measures to fuel domestic spending --including a tax cut on home purchases to revive an ailing housing market and a vague plan to invest in public works. But it must do more to unlock the savings of its citizens and encourage them to spend. 
 To do that it needs to rebuild the system of social insurance that fell apart when state-owned industries collapsed and were replaced by the private sector. Government investment in things like health care, education and pensions would help develop China's middle class and its domestic market.
 A boost to consumer spending would undoubtedly help China weather the economic storm. But by raising Chinese imports and reducing its dependence on exports, it would also help the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: Shoot the Horses?

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
I was talking to a banker friend, and he told me the ''unraveling'' could go on for ages. I thought he meant the unwinding of all the leverage that had inflated everything from the price of stocks to the price of homes.
 But, just to be sure, I asked him: ''Unraveling of what?'' 
 He paused, before saying, ''Almost our way of life.''
 A friend of his, he went on, has a horse farm north of New York City. ''I told him, for heaven's sake, you have to get rid of your horses. Shoot them if necessary.''
 That got me thinking. Are we going to be living on horse meat before we get to the bottom of this?
 It's now clear that our credit system the world over was rotten all the way through, a giant house of cards maintained by the ingenious connivance of banks, rating agencies and insurance companies in a monumental heist. The only buyers anyone trusts any more are governments.
 No wonder Alan Greenspan says he's in a state of ''shocked disbelief.'' He's not the only one.
 But as the state intervenes, in what Ed Yardeni, an investment analyst, called ''a giant global game of Whac-A-Mole,'' the moles keep popping out of new black holes in our financial system.
 ''We've tried rubber mallets, now we're using bazookas, but we're flying blind,'' Yardeni told me.
 It's really a wonder, when you think about it, that there are still two guys in the race to become U.S. president, pulling out all the stops in these last eight days of campaigning to be chosen as the one to face the nightmare.
 Let's fast-forward a year to October 2009. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 10 percent. Crime is up across the country. The economy is shrinking. No arm-twisting from the Treasury has managed to restore the broken confidence between borrowers and lenders. Banks, the few still standing, are holding fast to their cash. Property prices are down more than 25 percent from current levels.
 The Dow is still heading south as people get used to the idea of stocks trading at no more than 10 times earnings, rather than the much higher ratios our former leveraged world delivered.
 New buildings stand empty all over New York because at the end of a boom -- that's to say right now -- a lot of new construction comes to market. Exports, long a bright spot in the economy, have plummeted because of a rising dollar. The deficit and national debt stand at unprecedented levels.
 The hedge fund industry is decimated -- its model of flipping cheap borrowings into leveraged bets around the world has blown up -- and one desperate, even contrite, former master of the universe has just sold a Rauschenberg for $9 million less than he paid in 2004.
 People still have way too much debt, and the collateral for it keeps evaporating. They are angry. Civil unrest is stirring.
 I ask you, Senator McCain, Senator Obama, do you still want the job? 
 It may not get that bad, of course. On the bright side, gas prices are plunging. There's a lot of money sitting on the sidelines in places like Dubai. And, as I mentioned, the dollar is up -- more than 20 percent against sterling and the euro in the last three months.
 You can get a plate of pasta in central London now for less than $50. You can even take a short tube ride for less than $6. There must be hope for us all!
 In a way, what's going on with the dollar is a measure of the extent of global desperation. Here's a currency backed by debt so massive that it will presumably have to be inflated away some day -- and it's rocketing upward.
 Every investment position that made sense during a global boom and doesn't make sense during a global bust is being unwound, and the people doing the unwinding want dollars. They are buying U.S. Treasury bills yielding basically zilch because they are too plain scared to buy anything else. Capital preservation is the name of the game if you have any capital left.
 Of course, there's the option to try preserving that capital in euros or other currencies. But at some very basic level -- and we're down to basics -- the full faith and credit of the U.S. taxpayer is still deemed more credible than any other. That's a confidence vote, slim but real, in the United States and its ability to come back.
 As Avinash Persaud, the chairman of Intelligence Capital Limited, told me: ''Money, in the end, is confidence. It's a check the Federal Reserve has issued.''
 Perhaps that's why Obama and McCain are still in the race: because they believe confidence can be restored.
 But both candidates should be clear-eyed about what's looming. They shoot horses, don't they?

HEADLINE: In Bad Times, Moviegoers Turn to Singing and Sawing

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Bouncy teenagers and a psychotic killer -- in separate movies, thankfully -- packed multiplexes over the weekend, delivering a forceful message to Hollywood about what sells in difficult economic times. 
 The Walt Disney Company's feel-good ''High School Musical'' franchise made the transition from television to the big screen with a level of strength that surprised some veteran box-office analysts. ''High School Musical 3: Senior Year'' sold an estimated $82 million in tickets around the globe, according to the studio. The well-reviewed movie, anchored by the budding young star Zac Efron, sold $42 million in tickets in North America.
 The movie's opening gross instantly made it one of the most profitable films of the decade, good news for Disney as it tries to navigate the buzz saw of a global economic downturn. ''High School Musical 3'' cost an estimated $13 million to produce, a tiny budget considering that the average studio production costs $70.8 million, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.
 ''People really seem to want to get out and have some fun that is relatively affordable,'' Mark Zoradi, president of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, said.
 The second surprise at the weekend box office was the strength of an escapist film at the opposite thematic extreme: ''Saw V'' sold an estimated $30.5 million in tickets at North American theaters, according to the tracking firm Media by Numbers. The horror thriller, built around a serial killer named Jigsaw, sold about $6 million in tickets in limited overseas release.
 Horror franchises typically crater in popularity once past their third installment. ''Friday the 13th'' and ''Halloween'' were limping considerably by their fifth sequels. But ''Saw'' has shown remarkable staying power, especially considering the harsh criticism the franchise has endured from advocacy groups concerned about its brand of exploitive graphic violence, or torture porn.
 ''It is clear that there is plenty of blood yet to give,'' said Tom Ortenberg, president of theatrical films for Lionsgate, the studio behind the ''Saw'' films.
 Mr. Ortenberg noted that the franchise had surpassed the cumulative domestic box-office tally for the nine ''Halloween'' movies and would surpass the cumulative take for the 11 ''Friday the 13th'' films in the coming days. Those statistics, however, are not adjusted for inflation.
 ''High School Musical 3'' and ''Saw V'' took first and second place at the weekend box office. ''Max Payne,'' a Fox action-thriller based on the video game, was No. 3 with $7.6 million (for a new total of $29.7 million), while Disney's ''Beverly Hills Chihuahua'' sold $6.9 million ($78.1 million). ''Pride and Glory,'' a Warner Brothers crime drama, opened in fifth place with $6.3 million.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Goes Far Afield to Study Emerging Markets

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
Some of Microsoft's top researchers spend their time thinking about complex software, algorithms and security systems. Others contemplate azolla -- an aquatic fern fed to cattle in the hopes of increasing milk production. 
 The azolla experts are part of a nine-person team at Microsoft Research India that approaches the technology of emerging markets in unconventional ways. These computer scientists say they have the freedom to forget about PCs and software altogether as they tackle problems. Most often, they rely on a mix of sociology and empirical testing to see whether quirky ideas can make technology useful to those who have heretofore lived without it. 
 A project called Digital Green, for instance, flourished only after Microsoft tried a ''Farmer Idol'' approach -- a rather rustic take on the ''American Idol'' singing contest featuring local farmers. 
 Digital Green researchers have been distributing training DVDs to farmers in a dozen Indian villages. Villagers respond well to seeing their peers in the training sessions and will view multiple showings of the detailed presentations if a new farmer they recognize appears in each video. The farmers have been competing to stand out as local stars. 
 ''The farmers love being on TV,'' said Kentaro Toyama, assistant managing director of Microsoft Research India and the head of the Technology for Emerging Markets research group. ''This gives us some core knowledge about what works in this particular environment.''
 Microsoft feared that the farmers, who live about two hours outside Bangalore, would ignore the training advice unless it could prove a quick, valuable return. And so, one set of videos centers on azolla, which can cover the top of a water tank in about a week and lead to much higher milk production from cows. 
 Within four months, Microsoft will spin off Digital Green as an independent nongovernmental organization. Rikin Gandhi, a computer scientist, plans to leave Microsoft to oversee the organization, which will champion the Digital Green methods throughout South Asia and Africa.
 Microsoft is also extending the Digital Green ideas through another effort called Featherweight Computing, in which it is experimenting with electronic posters and cards that can be sent to farmers. These products include pictures and audio to remind farmers about techniques learned through the videos. 
 A somewhat similar project, Warana Unwired, sought to give members of farming cooperatives fast, simple ways to update records and receive pricing data on crops. A network of about 55 villages had been relying on PCs to collect information about fertilizer purchases, water bills and inventory. The PCs, however, often broke down or were unavailable. To work around these issues, Microsoft turned one PC, which could be properly managed, into a hub for collecting short messages sent via cellphones. 
 ''If you want to register your land, a farmer just types in 'reg,' the identification number of the farm, the season and how large of a plot he wants,'' said Rajesh Veeraraghavan, who was a Microsoft researcher before he left to earn a doctorate in information communications for developing areas. The cellphone system proved cheaper to run and gave farmers near-instant access to their information. 
 Other Microsoft research products cater more toward the company's traditional strengths. Software that Microsoft calls MultiPoint lets numerous mice connect to a computer, allowing several students to interact with a machine at the same time. Children can play games where they hear a word and then compete to identify the text on a screen to the matching sound. 
 ''I have not yet seen a situation where there is one PC per child,'' Mr. Toyama said. ''Children are usually lined up three deep behind a computer and you see them crawling all over each other. This technology provides a different level of engagement.''
 Studies run by Microsoft have shown that students learn just as well through the shared approach as they do on their own machines. Although girls, who tend to cooperate to find the information, scored better than boys, who rushed to click without really learning. ''For the boys, we'll have to think more about how the software is designed,'' Mr. Toyama said.
 Mr. Toyama acknowledges his group is afforded a certain amount of luxury in dabbling in areas that are interesting ''purely because they extend the reach of technology.'' Whether or not the work results in a Microsoft product matters less than forming ties with governments and understanding various people and regions. ''In the very long term, what makes a difference to Microsoft's stock price is the global economy,'' he said. ''Continuing the growth of that overall economy helps out our business.''
 If technology like MultiPoint proves compelling, Microsoft's Unlimited Potential group, a more formal organization directing technology to poor people, will try to incorporate it in commercial products. 
 ''It's real easy for people to get a bunch of money and install a satellite link for schools,'' said James Utzschneider, general manager of Unlimited Potential, ''but unless you can find ways to pay bills on an ongoing basis, you just end up with this weird thing on top of a building.'' 
 Luis Anavitarte, an analyst at Gartner, credits Microsoft with taking the right approach to these markets by relying on its creativity. ''But, ultimately, the local governments have to be committed to these projects for them to work,'' he added.
 In the end, Microsoft's best intentions may not satisfy what locals want. The company surveyed 8,000 people in emerging markets and found their most pressing needs for technology often revolved around entertainment and surfing the Internet. 
 ''It reinforced for us that the emerging middle classes are sort of like the middle classes here except they don't have as much money,'' Mr. Toyama said. ''It's sometimes easy for us to get caught up in things and forget we are serving the needs of real people.''

HEADLINE: The New Face of High Technology

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
No one is ever going to call Cher Wang ''poor little rich girl.''
The daughter of one of the richest men in the world, she never made headlines as a profligate jet setter sponging off her father's wealth.
Indeed, she rarely makes headlines at all, although she started her own multibillion-dollar company and made her own fortune.
Ms. Wang is one of the most powerful female executives in technology whom you have never heard of. The company she founded, the HTC Corporation, makes one out of every six smartphones sold in the United States, most of which are marketed under brands like Palm and Verizon.
Last week the iPhone's most likely rival, the T-Mobile G1, designed by HTC and powered by Google's Android operating system, went on sale. The attention is something HTC has never sought. And the same can be said of Ms. Wang. 
''I kind of like it that way,'' she said in a rare interview last month as she tucked into a lunch of mahi mahi, spinach and mushrooms at the Faculty Club at the University of California, Berkeley, where she graduated in 1981. ''I don't need to be the center of attention.''
In her native Taiwan, though, where she is called Wang Hsiueh-Hong, Ms. Wang and her family are a technology dynasty. Her recently deceased father, Wang Yung-Ching, founded the plastics and petrochemicals conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group. According to Forbes magazine, he was the second richest man in Taiwan. Two of his daughters serve on Formosa's seven-member executive team.
Another daughter, Charlene Wang, helped found First International Computer in 1980, a maker of motherboards. And Cher Wang is chairwoman of not one, but two companies: HTC and VIA Technologies, a developer of silicon chip technology, where her husband, Wen Chi Chen, has been chief executive since 1992.
Forbes estimates the couple's wealth at $3.5 billion. HTC's revenue in 2007 reached 118.6 billion Taiwanese dollars, or about $3.7 billion. But Ms. Wang said she was not defined by wealth -- either her own or her parents'.
''My family was very strict,'' she said. Leisure time was spent playing tennis or basketball. And becoming a lady who lunches was not an option. ''My father thought we should experience different things.''
When she was a young girl, Ms. Wang said, her father would take her on monthly visits to a local hospital he helped finance. And at her father's behest, Ms. Wang and her siblings studied abroad instead of staying in Taipei.
That is how she ended up in Silicon Valley. Ms. Wang was born in Taipei in 1958, one of seven children raised by her father's second wife. (Altogether Mr. Wang had nine children by three wives.) While some of the other children went to private schools in London, the United States held more appeal for Ms. Wang.
In 1974 she attended the exclusive College Preparatory School in Oakland, Calif. (Her older sister Charlene was living in the Bay Area.) Ms. Wang lived with a local pediatrician and his family. After graduating from high school, she went to Berkeley, where she was admitted as a music major; she wanted to be a pianist. But after three weeks -- and a stern talk with her adviser -- she switched to economics, in which she later earned a master's degree.
''This is the building I ran away from,'' she said on a walk around campus, pointing to a second-story room at the music school where she had auditioned, playing a piece by Chopin. ''I had the dream, but I am also very realistic.''
After graduating from Berkeley, she took a job in 1982 at First International Computer, where she sold motherboards and later oversaw the personal computer division.
When HTC was founded in 1997, the company made notebook computers. Her husband recalled that a few years after the company started, Ms. Wang and her partners were forced to make a choice: focus on notebooks or shift gears to hand-held devices, a market that showed signs of promise. Ms. Wang urged they shift to cellphones.
''HTC had strong engineers developing notebooks,'' said Mr. Chen. ''But it was a volatile business with lots of competitors. She saw that clearly and pushed for the other instead.''
It was a smart decision. HTC's revenue tallied about $1 billion in the most recent quarter, a 29 percent increase from a year earlier. ''She is very demanding in one sense,'' said Mr. Chen. ''If she wants something changed, she'll speak up about it.''
In HTC's early days Ms. Wang's responsibility was to build relationships with customers, including wireless carriers, and vendors whose products HTC needed. She spent a lot of time in Silicon Valley. It was then she became close to executives at T-Mobile, which was critical in securing the right to make the first Android-supported phone.
She also managed HTC's relationship with Microsoft, a longtime partner whose operating system is installed on most HTC phones. Once a year, Ms. Wang said, she flies to Seattle and meets with Bill Gates and Steven A. Ballmer, the company's chief executive.
She keeps her life simple. On her 50th birthday last month, she stayed home and ate strawberry ice cream cake with her family. Despite her status as a member of technology's billionaire club, she eschews being ferried by private jet from her offices in Taipei to Silicon Valley. And instead of taking business associates out for a lavish dinner, she invites them to an early morning basketball game instead.
Stephen Zelencik, a retired head of sales and marketing for Advanced Micro Devices, has known Ms. Wang since she was a young executive working for First International Computer. But in his encounters with her at HTC, he learned how relentless she could be.
He recalled a particular exhausting negotiation, lasting more than a week in Taipei, when Ms. Wang was holding out for a lower price on a large order of microprocessors HTC wanted to buy from A.M.D.
The two had loosely agreed on a price. But Ms. Wang, sensing an opportunity on the last day, told him she wanted a lower price, tapped her watch and pointed out his plane was leaving at 2 p.m. ''She wanted me to relent,,'' he said.
Mr. Zelencik said he replied, '' 'We don't have to catch the plane.' Then she said, 'O.K. We'll negotiate.' '' Ultimately, the two agreed to keep the deal as is. ''It was negotiated in her favor,'' he said. ''But she would always give it one more try.''
Faith plays an important part in her life. A Christian (like her husband), she said she belongs to no specific denomination but attends church whenever she can. Spirituality informs how she lives. ''I feel everyone has their own faults,'' she said. ''We have to understand why people are like that -- is it the environment or the background.'' But it informs her work too. ''Jesus also tells us you have to work hard, not be sluggish,'' she said.
She shuttles mostly among three cities: she and her husband have a home in Mountain View, Calif. (where one of her two sons lives), a house in Taipei and an apartment in Beijing, which is used mostly for business. While Ms. Wang has stepped away from much of the day-to-day running of HTC, she is still active in the company by meeting clients and negotiating deals. And she remains an arbiter of HTC's style, a role she relishes.
''All these kids were into something,'' said Mr. Zelencik. ''They just didn't sit around and spend the money.''
And Ms. Wang would have it no other way. ''I always have this imagination, something I want to use,'' she said. ''I don't understand the idea of leisure time.''
Correction: October 30, 2008, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A caption on Monday with an article about Cher Wang, the founder and chairwoman of HTC Corporation, maker of smartphones, misidentified, in some editions, the site of the photograph. Ms. Wang was shown on the Berkeley campus of the University of California, not in Napa, Calif. (The university has no Napa campus.)

HEADLINE: Theodore Roosevelt, Pundit

BYLINE: By EDMUND MORRIS. 
Edmund Morris is working on the third and final volume of his biography of Theodore Roosevelt.

 BODY:
THE former president, born 150 years ago today, was interviewed in his childhood home at 28 East 20th Street. He has long been a ghostly presence there. The house is now the Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site. Due to Roosevelt's great age, it is difficult to tell how well he hears contemporary questions. But he is as forceful as ever in expressing himself. His statements below are drawn from the historic record and are uncut except when interrupted by his interviewer.
 Q. Happy birthday, Mr. President! Or do you prefer being called Colonel?
 ROOSEVELT I've had the title of president once -- having it twice means nothing except peril to whatever reputation I achieved the first time. 
 Q. ''Colonel,'' then. Do you think the Congress elected two years ago as a foil to the Bush administration has fulfilled its mandate? 
 A. I am heartsick over the delay, the blundering, the fatuous and complacent inefficiency and the effort to substitute glittering rhetoric for action.
 Q. Do you blame the House Democratic majority? 
 A. A goodly number of senators, even of my own party, have shown about as much backbone as so many angleworms.
 Q. I hope that doesn't include the pair running for the presidency! What do you think of Senator John McCain? He often cites you as a role model.
 A. He is evidently a man who takes color from his surroundings. 
 Q. Weren't you just as unpredictable in your time? 
 A.(laughing) They say that nothing is as independent as a hog on ice. If he doesn't want to stand up, he can lie down. 
 Q. Mr. McCain has always prided himself on his independence. At least, until he began to take direction from chief executives and retired generals --
 A. But the signs now are that these advisers have themselves awakened to the fact that they have almost ruined him.
 Q. Does his vow to give Joe the Plumber a tax break remind you of Reaganomics?
 A. This is merely the plan, already tested and found wanting, of giving prosperity to the big men on top, and trusting to their mercy to let something leak through to the mass of their countrymen below -- which, in effect, means that there shall be no attempt to regulate the ferocious scramble in which greed and cunning reap the largest rewards.
 Q. In Washington today, Colonel, you're increasingly seen as the father of centralized, executive, regulatory control.
 A. Great corporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions; and it is therefore our right and duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions.
 Q. Especially now that we've seen the end of another age of laissez-faire economics?
 A. These new conditions make it necessary to shackle cunning, as in the past we have shackled force. The vast individual and corporate fortunes, the vast combinations of capital -- 
 Q. Even vaster in your day! John D. Rockefeller was richer than Bill Gates, dollar for dollar.
 A. Quite right. (He dislikes being interrupted.) And please, let this now be as much of a monologue as possible. 
 Q. Excuse me, you were saying that vast combinations of capital ...
 A. ... create new conditions, and necessitate a change from the old attitude of the state and the nation toward the rules regulating the acquisition and untrammeled business use of property. 
 Q. So you approve of the federal bailout?
 A. I think we have got to face the fact that such an increase in governmental control is now necessary.
 Q. Should we condone the huge severance packages paid to executives of rescued corporations?
 A. There is need in business, as in most other forms of human activity, of the great guiding intelligences. Their places cannot be supplied by any number of lesser intelligences. It is a good thing that they should have ample recognition, ample reward. But we must not transfer our admiration to the reward instead of to the deed rewarded; and if what should be the reward exists without the service having been rendered, then admiration will come only from those who are mean of soul. 
 Q. So we should withhold our envy of Richard Fuld, the chairman of Lehman Brothers, for taking home half a billion before his company went down?
 A. Envy and arrogance are the two opposite sides of the same black crystal. 
 Q. Extraordinary image, Colonel. What's your impression of Barack Obama?
 A. Unless I am greatly mistaken, the people have made up their mind that they wish some new instrument. 
 Q. You're not afraid that he's primarily a man of words? Like Woodrow Wilson, whom you once called a ''Byzantine logothete''?
 A. It is highly desirable that a leader of opinion in a democracy should be able to state his views clearly and convincingly. 
 Q. Not Mr. McCain's strong point!
 A. Some excellent public servants have not the gift at all, and must rely upon their deeds to speak for them; and unless the oratory does represent genuine conviction, based on good common sense and able to be translated into efficient performance, then the better the oratory the greater the damage to the public it deceives. 
 Q. Mr. McCain might argue that his life of service and suffering is eloquence enough. Have you read his autobiography?
 A. I should like to have it circulated as a tract among an immense multitude of philanthropists, congressmen, newspaper editors, publicists, softheaded mothers and other people of sorts who think that life ought to consist of perpetual shrinking from effort, danger and pain.
 Q. Has Mr. Obama not suffered too? Not at the heroic level of Mr. McCain, but in transcending centuries of race prejudice to become a viable presidential candidate -- only to be nearly stopped by Hillary Clinton! 
 A. I think that he has learned some bitter lessons, and that independently of outside pressure he will try to act with greater firmness, and to look at things more from the standpoint of the interests of the people, and less from that of a technical lawyer --
 Q. ''Technical,'' Colonel? He took his law degree straight onto the streets of Chicago and applied it to social problems. 
 A. He may and probably will turn out to be a perfectly respectable president, whose achievements will be disheartening compared with what we had expected, but who nevertheless will have done well enough to justify us in renominating him -- for you must remember that to renominate him would be a very serious thing, only to be justified by really strong reasons. 
 Q. He doesn't have Mr. McCain's foreign policy experience. As president, how would he personify us around the world?
 A. It always pays for a nation to be a gentleman. 
 Q. There'll be Joe Biden to counsel him, of course. Assuming Mr. Obama can keep track of what he's saying. 
 A. (laughing) You can't nail marmalade against a wall.
 Q. Talking of foreign policy, what do you think of Mr. McCain's choice of a female running mate?
 A. Times have changed (sigh). It is entirely inexcusable, however, to try to combine the unready hand with the unbridled tongue. 
 Q. How will you feel if Sarah Palin is elected?
 A. I shall feel exactly the way a very small frog looks when it swallows a beetle the size of itself, with extremely stiff legs. 
 Q. What's your impression of President Bush these days? 
 A. (suddenly serious) He looks like Judas, but unlike that gentleman has no capacity for remorse. 
 Q. Is that the best you can say of him? 
 A. I wish him well, but I wish him well at a good distance from me. 
 Q. One last question, Colonel. If you were campaigning now, would you still call yourself a Republican?
 A. (aftera long pause) No.

HEADLINE: Credit Crisis Slows Poland, and Other Economies That Once Galloped

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Reporting was contributed by Sabrina Tavernise and Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul, Celia W. Dugger from Johannesburg, Alexei Barrionuevo from Rio de Janeiro, Andrew Downie from Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Michal Piotrowski from Warsaw.

DATELINE: WARSAW 

 BODY:
Poles were jolted last week by the sudden discovery that they were not immune to the financial crisis contagion rippling across the globe. The plunging stock market here and the drastic weakening of the Polish currency proved, as in so many corners of the fast-growing developing world, how wrong they were.
 The go-go atmosphere in Poland has abruptly stilled to a cautious wait-and-see. Developers across the country have halted building projects for thousands of apartments as banks have grown stingy with lending. The boomtown energy here has been replaced by nervous eyeing of the once powerful zloty, as it retreats in value against the dollar and the euro. 
 The daily newspaper Dziennik summed up the mood on Friday with a front-page headline, ''Welcome to the Tough Times.'' In a country that seemed to be on the fast track to full membership in the Western club, the question on everyone's lips is, ''Why us?'' 
 Emerging markets that seemed healthy, even thriving, barely a month ago are beginning to find themselves caught in the worldwide panic. This sharp turn has caught even the local financial guardians and experts by surprise, as they have clung to their indicators of fundamental economic soundness while forgetting that capital stampedes rarely tarry for fine distinctions. 
 From Europe's former Communist bloc to South America, fear and disbelief mingled with frustration that a breakdown in the United States mortgage market -- one that most investors and institutions in emerging markets had avoided -- was beginning to lead once again to their punishment at the indiscriminate hands of the capital markets. 
 ''Everything is going down,'' said Lukasz Tync, 28, an information technology consultant in Warsaw, who said he owned shares in 10 companies and several mutual funds and had been hit hard by five consecutive days of falling stocks at the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The country's leading index was down 12.6 percent for the week and more than 50 percent for the year. 
 ''The thing is that there is no fundamental basis for such moves,'' Mr. Tync said. ''It's just panic.''
 Adding to the pain, the zloty has fallen around 17 percent against the dollar over the past week, and more than 10 percent against the euro. The currency has fallen roughly 30 percent against the dollar in October. Economic experts are cutting growth forecasts. 
 Poland is still considered relatively healthy compared with Hungary and Ukraine, which have been among the hardest hit. On Sunday, the two reached tentative agreements with the International Monetary Fund for loans and other assistance aimed at preventing their financial systems from collapsing. Ukraine will get a loan of at least $16.5 billion. The value of Hungary's rescue package has not been specified. Still, alarm about Hungary and Ukraine has infected Poland. 
 ''A week ago, people would have told you that this is an oasis of calm and stability,'' said Marek Matraszek, founding partner and managing director at CEC Government Relations in Warsaw, a political consulting firm for foreign investors. ''They didn't expect that the lack of confidence in Central Europe would bleed over from Hungary and Ukraine.''
 The bleeding has extended much farther. In South Africa, the price of platinum, a major earner of foreign exchange, has cratered, from more than $2,000 an ounce in June to less than $800 now, contributing to a sharp depreciation in that country's currency. Brazil's currency has fallen by more than 40 percent against the dollar since August. The Turkish lira has fallen by more than 30 percent against the dollar in recent weeks and almost 20 percent against the euro. 
 Fuat Karatas, 41, a dental technician in Istanbul, buys some imported materials priced in euros but cannot pass on the rising price to customers, who pay in lira, he said. ''Now with the euro going crazy, I have no idea how things are going to work out for me,'' he said. ''I just want to be able to keep my lab open, nothing more.''
 During more prosperous times the risks in emerging market countries were strongly underestimated, said Marek Dabrowski, president of the Center for Social and Economic Research in Warsaw. ''Naturally, the global credit crunch and economic slowdown caused overshooting in the opposite direction,'' he said.
 Emerging-market countries are hardly a homogenous group, but they face similar challenges. The outflows of investor capital driving down their stock markets and pressuring their currencies have occurred just as the demand abroad for their products, whether commodities like oil or manufactured goods like automobiles, has begun to weaken. 
 But the crisis has not hit the streets right away, buttressing the confidence of many in affected countries that the problems are temporary and can be weathered. Some argue that the declining value of local currencies is even a plus, because it will help these countries sell more goods abroad by making them more affordable. 
 ''When the zloty was so strong, my import was profitable. Just now, I hope my exports will be improving,'' said Krzysztof Izydorczyk, 52, owner of Comexpol, an importer and exporter of stainless steel products based in Katowice. 
 In South Africa, Finance Minister Trevor A. Manuel gave a budget speech to Parliament last week, saying he had seen the warning signs of trouble and had taken appropriate action.
 But South Africa is not just facing unpredictable economic pressures. It is also at a perilous political moment, with a likely split in the governing African National Congress and a strong possibility that the unemployment rate will worsen. The economy had been weakening before the global crisis, according to Pieter Laubscher, chief economist at the Bureau for Economic Research at South Africa's Stellenbosch University.
 The commodities boom had drawn investment into the country and had helped drive economic growth, Mr. Laubscher said, but that boom has now fallen victim to the worldwide slowdown. 
 In Brazil, leaders took pains to save wisely during the commodity boom, reform the country's banking sector after a financial crisis in the late 1990s and diversify its trade partners. ''This country has never been so prepared to face up to adversity as it is now, economically, politically and, I'd say, ideologically,'' President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said early last week.
 But on Wednesday the government empowered state-controlled banks to buy stakes in private financial institutions. Although officials denied any private banks were in danger, the announcement fueled jitters that some could fail, helping send Brazil's stock market down more than 10 percent that day.
 Poles had good reason to believe that they had avoided the stigma that causes investors in emerging markets to flee at the first hint of financial panic. Poland had joined the European Union and NATO, it was a close ally of the United States, it was growing robustly and enjoying swiftly rising living standards unimaginable under Communism. 
 Experts say there was a consensus locally that Poland would not be affected by the crisis, and that membership in the European Union would buffer it from the worst of the shocks. That consensus has begun to break down.
 When the Central Bank of Hungary surprised markets last week by raising interest rates three percentage points to defend its currency, the vulnerability of Central and Eastern Europe received harsher scrutiny.
 Poland illustrates the illogic but also the relentless pressure this crisis has exerted, because in many ways it was in good shape. Compared with Hungary, Poland has higher growth, lower inflation, lower interest rates, less public debt relative to the size of its economy and a smaller share of foreign loans. Poland has stronger domestic demand than Hungary to prop up the economy as consumers among its Western trading partners cut spending.
 But Poland has not adopted the euro, which might have helped insulate it somewhat. Now the prime minister, Donald Tusk, says Poland hopes to by 2012.
 Government officials in Warsaw, including the prime minister, the central banker and the finance minister, have been saying that the Polish economy remains strong and that they expect markets to stabilize. 
 Indeed, the latest economic news out of Poland has been largely positive. Retail sales rose 11.6 percent in September, compared with the previous year, and the unemployment rate, which exceeded 20 percent just five years ago, fell 0.2 percentage points last month, to 8.9 percent.
 At Miedzy Nami, a restaurant in downtown Warsaw, the owner, Ewa Moisan, said she had not seen a slowdown. Yet some customers said they were beginning to feel the pinch. The monthly payment for the apartment mortgage of one customer, Jarek Wiewiorski, has gone up by a fifth, to 1,800 zloty, about $600. ''It's not catastrophic, but it's painful,'' Mr. Wiewiorski, 40, said. ''One minute it's America, the next it's Hungary, and then suddenly, it's here.''

HEADLINE: Going for the Gold in Gloom and Doom

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Could the Dow reach 7,000? 700? Seven? 
 Financial forecasters are in a race to call the bottom to the bear market. And just as on the way up, when analysts competed for attention with their forecasts of bigger and bigger gains, the financial pundit class now seems compelled to out-gloom the next guy. 
 ''To make a crazy forecast today is not crazy,'' said Owen Lamont, a former professor at Yale who has studied economic forecasting. ''It's not crazy to predict the Dow is going to 2,000. That's in the realm of possibility.'' 
 Indeed, in an era of 1,000-point daily swings in the Dow and 30 percent losses in the stock market, prescience is at a premium -- and the dividends of a high-profile correct call can be immense. 
 In 1987, a little-known strategist named Elaine Garzarelli found herself a newly minted celebrity after predicting the market would crash just days before Black Monday. This time around, longtime doomsayers like Nouriel Roubini of New York University have become media staples since many of their most apocalyptic predictions started coming true.
 Even in normal times, forecasters have a strong incentive to make extreme predictions, which is why those ''Dow 1,000!'' reports persist. ''It's eye-popping. It's relevant. It seems exciting,'' Mr. Lamont said. Such predictions attract publicity, name recognition and a bigger client base in a business where investors pay thousands, if not millions, for stock advice and investment guidance.
 And even if a forecast is off-base, there are few repercussions because they are almost always quickly forgotten. ''The reason that people do these games is because no one's really tracking accuracy,'' said Mr. Lamont, who now works at DKR Capital, a hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn. ''No one is carefully, prudently giving more business to the guy who is 2 percent more accurate than the next guy.''
 Some say this is a system that propagates ignorance and poor advice. 
 ''Anyone that invests 10 cents on the basis of someone's forecast of the Dow is desirous of losing a good portion of their 10 cents,'' said William A. Fleckenstein, president of Fleckenstein Capital, a money management firm in Issaquah, Wash. ''It is almost the height of arrogance to say this is where the Dow is going to trade.''
 ''These types of forecasts are wildly off-base,'' Mr. Fleckenstein said. ''What they're always about is extrapolation. People are always extrapolating recent trends. And you don't know how far the trend is going to really run.''
 But when markets are as jittery as they are now and 10-word headlines on a Bloomberg terminal can move indexes up or down hundreds of points, investors may not pause long enough to consider the details. 
 More than a few eyebrows were raised last week when news flew across trading desks that Peter Boockvar, who tracks equities at Miller Tabak, was predicting the Dow would crater to 5,000 by next year, a 40 percent decline from the current level.
 Among the shocked: Mr. Boockvar himself. ''It was mischaracterized!'' he said in a telephone interview on Friday, adding that he had no idea if the Dow would sink to 5,000.
 ''Based on my calculations, I said we can go from 5,000 to 7,000,'' he said. ''No one's smart enough to answer the question as to where we'll be a year from now. I think it's silly to pick a number, that's why I picked a wide range.''
 It had been an exasperating 24 hours for Mr. Boockvar. ''I had to deal with it half my day yesterday,'' he said. 
 Some financial pundits, however, are all too happy to broadcast their predictions to the public, no matter how apocalyptic. 
 Peter Schiff, the president of Euro Pacific Capital in Darien, Conn., and a prominent financial Cassandra, has seen some of his most dire forecasts confirmed amid this year's turmoil. On Friday, he predicted plenty more pain to come.
 ''We could decline about 90 percent from where we are today,'' he said.
 Mr. Schiff unreels his depressing outlook with a confidence appropriate for a man whose book, ''Crash Proof: How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse,'' was published in February 2007.
 ''Our economy is a complete disaster. I think the recession -- better to call it a depression -- we are going to experience is going to collapse corporate earnings,'' he said. ''The end is a long way off.''
 He declined to predict a specific end of the bear market, saying only that he expected the level of the Dow would eventually match the price of an ounce of gold. 
 ''I don't think the Dow would go all the way to 1,000. Could it be 4,000? That might be,'' he said.
 Still, forecasters who get too far ahead of themselves would do well to remember an instance of notoriously poor prognostication. One of the few times that a financial strategist has been widely taken to task came in 1999, when Kevin A. Hassett and James K. Glassman published ''Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market.'' 
 The book, which arrived just months before the technology bubble burst and stocks plummeted to earth, was actually an argument that bonds and stocks should be considered as equally risky investments. But the title -- cartoonish in hindsight and, in its authors' defense, proposed by the publisher -- has since become a popular punch line for jokes about irrational exuberance in turn-of-the-century Wall Street. (The Dow closed on Friday at 8,378.95).
 Still, while the reputation of its authors may have taken a hit, ''Dow 36,000'' has not seemed to hurt their careers. Mr. Hassett, who did not respond to a reporter's inquiry, works at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, and serves as the senior economic adviser to the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain. 
 According to his spokesman, Mr. Glassman prefers not to comment on the financial markets now that he has started in his new position: under secretary of state for public diplomacy in the Bush administration. Apparently, there is life after Dow 36,000. The jury is still out on life after Dow 8,378.

HEADLINE: Global Financial Troubles Reaching Into Gulf States

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
The global financial crisis extended its reach into the Persian Gulf states on Sunday, as Kuwait suspended trading in shares of a major bank and the Saudi authorities announced a plan to help citizens receive credit. 
 The Central Bank of Kuwait halted trading in Gulf Bank, one of the country's largest lenders, after a customer defaulted on a derivatives contract. The central bank said it would ''strongly support the bank's financial position'' and protect depositors, to assure the public that Gulf Bank's business would not be affected. 
 Major oil-producing countries had seemed to be insulated from the crisis shaking the foundations of the international financial system. Oil prices rose during the first half of 2008, giving such countries a thick cushion of cash. But a drastic drop in oil prices has left the gulf economies vulnerable. Many oil-rich governments became dependent on high prices. 
 After reaching a record of more than $147 a barrel in July, prices have collapsed. On Friday, oil futures settled in New York at $64.15 a barrel, falling $3.69 even after OPEC announced that it would reduce production by 1.5 million barrels a day.
 ''This shows the gulf countries are not immune to the overall problems in the financial system,'' Olivier Jakob, an oil analyst at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland, said during an interview Sunday. ''If we get below $60 a barrel, some of these countries will suffer.''
 Globally, banks have posted losses and write-downs totaling $681 billion since the start of the credit crisis, according to Bloomberg News. 
 So far the damage in the Middle East has been limited. But any large losses in the region could require governments to bail out their own lenders and dash hopes that so-called sovereign wealth funds from the region would be able to help rescue troubled institutions in the West. 
 In Saudi Arabia, always on guard against potential unrest, King Abdullah said that 10 billion riyals, or $2.7 billion, would be placed in an account in the Saudi Bank of Credit and Saving to enable the bank to help hundreds of thousands of citizens obtain loans for family needs, including marriages and home repairs.
 On Saturday, finance ministers from the Gulf Cooperation Council and central bankers met in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, to discuss a more coordinated response to the crisis. In a statement, officials ''underlined their confidence in the stability of the monetary system in their countries,'' and said their economies should continue to grow. In addition to Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and United Arab Emirates.
 In Kuwait, the central bank also said it was moving toward guaranteeing deposits at local banks. Many other countries have already taken that step, putting lenders in countries with no guarantee at a disadvantage.
 Gulf Bank's chief executive, Louis J. Myers, said the loss would have ''no major effects on the soundness of the bank's financial position, and will not affect its ability to continue business.''
 Fawzy al-Thunayan, a spokesman for Gulf Bank, said Sunday that the loss was incurred by a Kuwaiti company on a ''complicated currency derivative,'' essentially a bet on the euro. ''The position worsened in the last 10 days as the euro dived against the dollar,'' he added, but the customer had been unable or unwilling to make good its losses. 
 The bank will not comment on the amount of the loss ''until the position is completely closed,'' he said, and trading in Gulf Bank will remain suspended until the affair is settled. Ibrahim Dabdoub, chief executive of the rival National Bank of Kuwait, told Al Arabiya television that the losses were as much as 200 million dinars, or nearly $750 million.
 The crisis could hurt the gulf states in other ways. KPMG International, the accounting firm, warned last week that financial fraud in the region could run into the billions of dollars a year. Colin Lobo, a KPMG partner, said the financial crisis was creating an environment ''where the risk of fraud will increase as businesses come under pressure to show results. Likewise, individuals will also be tempted where costs are rising and income levels are flat.'' 
 Stocks in the region are off about 40 percent this year.

HEADLINE: Wilderness Within Reach

 BODY:
It looks increasingly likely that both the Senate and the House will return to Washington after the election to address the economy and, possibly, to pass a new stimulus bill. If they do, we urge them to find time for one other piece of business -- a public lands bill that, at modest expense, could add nearly two million acres to the nation's store of permanently protected wilderness. 
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, has promised to consider the bill. A similar commitment is now required from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose home state of California stands to benefit greatly.
 The bill consists of more than 140 separate public land proposals, including 15 wilderness measures that would forever protect wild lands in eight states -- including 517,000 acres in Idaho's Canyonlands, 470,000 acres in California's Eastern Sierra and San Gabriel Mountains, and 11,700 acres of Lake Superior shoreline in northern Michigan. 
 Wilderness areas are more strictly protected from commercial activities than any other public lands, including national parks. And all of these would be welcome additions to a wilderness system that now covers about 107 million acres.
 One novel feature of the bill is a provision aimed at raising the environmental consciousness of the Bureau of Land Management, which administers the bulk of the country's public lands for often contrary purposes, including conservation and oil and gas drilling. 
 The bill identifies 26 million acres of public lands and 850 sites of special natural, archeological and cultural value -- including a dozen or so national monuments -- and entrusts the bureau with restoring and protecting them for future generations. 
 The omnibus package is a bipartisan proposal and the product of years of negotiations among federal, state and local officials, conservation groups and private citizens. President Bush has indicated that he would sign it. Its only real enemy is time. Failure to approve it this year would require many of the negotiations to start all over again. Congress should not miss this chance.

HEADLINE: Democrats in Steel Country See Skin Color, and Beyond It

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

DATELINE: ALIQUIPPA, Pa. 

 BODY:
Voting for the black man does not come easy to Nick Piroli. He is the first to admit that. 
 To the sound of bowling balls smacking pins, as the bartender in the Fallout Shelter queues up more Buds, this retired steelworker wrestles with this election and his choice. A couple of friends, he says, will not vote for Senator Barack Obama.
 ''I'm no racist, but I'm not crazy about him either,'' said Mr. Piroli, 77. ''I don't know, maybe 'cause he's black.''
 He winces at himself. ''We was raised and worked with the black, the Serb,'' he said. ''It was a regular league of nations. And the economy now, it's terrible.'' 
 ''I've got to vote for him,'' he said finally.
 Him? ''The Democrat, Obama,'' Mr. Piroli replied. ''I can't be stupid.''
 Mr. Obama's Republican rival in the presidential campaign, Senator John McCain, has placed a sizable electoral bet that he can sweep predominantly white, working-class Beaver County and a dozen more Pennsylvania counties like it. Last week, Mr. McCain spoke before thousands in Moon Township, and two days later his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, drew more than 2,000 fans to a rally in Beaver.
 But to walk the back streets of the Beaver River mill cities -- the biggest mills were long ago shuttered -- and to visit rural hamlets like Economy and Hookstown is to hear more than a few Democrats saying they intend, however reluctantly, to support their party's standard-bearer, particularly as the world economy cracks and heaves. Many Democrats, and a few independents, wonder if Mr. McCain is too old and Ms. Palin too unsophisticated to take his place. 
 Such sentiments could bode ill for Mr. McCain, who hopes for a surprise victory in Pennsylvania to rescue his presidential bid. And they dovetail with poll findings that show a gravitation of white voters, female and male, toward Mr. Obama's camp. To try to stanch that flow and tap into doubts about Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain will return to the state on Monday for the second time in a week and then appear on Tuesday with Ms. Palin as they try to sway voters like Mr. Piroli.
 Mr. McCain may have an opening: 35 interviews over three days offer up a conversation about race and presidential choices, and that is where the greatest uncertainty lies for Mr. Obama. Sometimes race talk runs like a subterranean river. Sometimes it floats right on the surface.
 In Ambridge, a Beaver River factory town named after the company that gave it fame -- American Bridge -- Olga Permon, a 71-year-old steelworker's widow and a lifelong Democrat, climbs the stoop of her yellow-brick home. She considers the field: Mr. McCain? A grouchy old man. Ms. Palin? Please. No way. What about Mr. Obama?
 Her pause goes on and on. ''He scares me,'' Mrs. Permon said. ''The coloreds are excited, but my friends and I plan to write in Hillary's name.'' 
 These are not gentle lands for Mr. Obama. A visit here in August found even deeper suspicions of him in Beaver County, where Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton beat him by 40 percentage points in the Democratic primary. Democrats outnumber Republicans, but voters here tilt either way in presidential elections. 
 Still, a worsening economy has worked to the Democrats' advantage. Mr. Obama and his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., drew 8,000 to a rally in Beaver a month ago; John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, stumped on Saturday in Beaver; and many dozens of union members go door to door each weekend, rounding up votes. They remind their fellow workers that Mr. McCain had supported privatization of Social Security, a move they say could have left worker retirement accounts trapped in a plummeting stock market.
 ''This is McCain's Hail Mary; they looked at the huge margin here for Hillary Clinton in the primary and figured, 'Hmm, we have a shot,' '' said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, in Lancaster. ''But it's going to be very difficult here for him to get the margins needed to offset the cities and the eastern suburbs.''
 In Ambridge, Vince Pisano, 47, a union plumber, reflects that challenge. As he sits on his porch, he considers collapses -- of the economy and his retirement account. He is firm for Mr. Obama, but he is in a small club. 
 ''Close friends, real close, tell me they can't get past his race,'' said Mr. Pisano, flashing his give-me-a-break look. ''If Obama were white, this would be a landslide around here.'' 
 Beaver was known as the cake-eater's town. Steel management lived here, and its elegant Edwardian and Victorian homes, with oak and mahogany beams, lend a grace to the streets.
 Ms. Palin has taken a lead role in wooing culturally conservative counties like Beaver. She held a rally here and obtained the endorsement of the Beaver High School football coach, who paraded his players and cheerleaders onto the field for her, and the crowds cheered when she spoke of her opposition to abortion. This is a theologically conservative province -- Catholic churches vie with conservative Protestant and evangelical churches.
 ''She's what we need, a live one,'' said Steve Matoic, a 6-foot-6 truck driver in a camouflage jacket and with a flag bandana on his head. 
 ''The head of our ticket is good, but sometimes his energy ----'' he said, his voice trailing off.
 The Palin fires, however, show signs of banking. Over at Sheffield Lanes, mention of her name summons no glint from older bowlers, or from Jeremy and Joe Long, in their 20s, tipping Buds. They liked Mrs. Clinton but pass on Ms. Palin.
 ''She's always talking about the 'Average Joe,' '' Jeremy Long said. ''Average me! I don't want myself in the Oval Office. I want someone smarter.''
 The next day, just up the street on Linden Avenue, Grace Ruscitti, a retired schoolteacher, stood on her porch on a block of modest steel-worker bungalows. She was still upset about Mr. McCain's choice of Ms. Palin. ''That was an insult to our intelligence,'' Ms. Ruscitti said. ''This barracuda nonsense. Tell me, where'd they find her?''
 None of which is to suggest that Mr. McCain does not have deep reservoirs of support. The Rev. Chris Noyes, a Presbyterian minister in Beaver Falls, a city with broad avenues and storefronts that are more vacant than not, estimates that two-thirds of his congregation supports the Republican ticket. 
 Talk to Derek Wood, 28, as his Dalmatian tugs at a leash, and he says he is voting for Mr. McCain. He likes the tax cuts.
 People here have voted for Democrats since the 1930s, Mr. Wood said, and what is left? Ghosts hang from oaks and pumpkins sit on porches, but there are no children to demand trick or treat. If you are 28, you rent a U-Haul truck and leave.
 ''It's a great place to live from 45 and up,'' Mr. Wood said. 
 The Republicans have also poured money into advertising. Until early October, the McCain campaign had outspent the Obama campaign in Pennsylvania. And commercials and e-mail messages from unaffiliated groups have sown doubt: about Mr. Obama's ties to William Ayers, the former member of the 1960s-era Weather Underground radical group; about his connection to Acorn, an organizing group being accused of voter-registration fraud; about his religion. The rumors and charges form a subliminal closed loop.
 The white-haired Judy Miller, ''Miss Judy'' to customers, slaps together a turkey hoagie in Hookstown, near the West Virginia border. Mention of Mr. Obama brings a frown. ''Who is he? Who's behind him?'' she said. ''This radical at the university thing, the Muslim stuff.''
 A union distributes a leaflet here titled ''The Truth About Barack Obama,'' which says: ''Is he a Christian? Yes. Was he sworn in on a Bible? Yes. Was he born in America? Yes.'' 
 Still, doubts about Mr. Obama persist. Mrs. Permon, the steelworker's widow, plans to write in Mrs. Clinton's name. Rita Ratjer, another steel widow, plans to sit it out altogether. 
 But in between sits the housebound Peggy Doffin. Her knees are gone and she takes groceries, mail deliveries and interviews through her first-floor window. At 79, with her fat tabby cat in her arms, she has lived through the Great Depression and fears another coming. Once she was a confirmed ''Hillary woman'' and not a fan of Mr. Obama. Then she listened to his convention speech and, she said, ''chills ran down my back.'' 
 ''Race just don't matter to me any more,'' she said. ''But a lot of Democrats out there'' -- she shrugged -- ''we'll find out on Election Day, won't we?''

HEADLINE: After Nov. 4, Will the World See Us Differently?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Rebranding the U.S. With Obama'' (column, Oct. 23):
 Nicholas D. Kristof wisely notes that ''substance should always trump symbolism.'' But he also points out an obvious fact: the United States has, to say the least, a perception problem. 
 Part of this is a result of our strategically debilitating decision to invade Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But part also flows from the hubristic and unilateral approach to foreign policy adopted by the Bush administration.
 If Barack Obama is elected, that will not be a panacea -- it would be naive to think it could be. But he does represent our best chance to clearly and unmistakably break from the sins of the past and signal to the world that a black man can indeed ascend to the highest -- and most powerful -- office in the world. 
 This, more than anything else, would go a long way to undermine the erroneous and offensive belief that the United States is intolerant of minorities. It would also help us reclaim our status as the champion of liberty and equality for all.
 James P. Rudolph Washington, Oct. 23, 2008
 The writer served as a public affairs officer for the United States Agency for International Development, 1999-2001.
 To the Editor:
 I've lived abroad and witnessed anti-Americanism firsthand. 
 As Nicholas D. Kristof writes, ''Remember that the one thing countless millions of people around the world 'know' about the United States is that it is controlled by a cabal of white bankers and Jews who use police with fire hoses to repress blacks.'' While others are not so ham-handed in their prejudice, some do dislike our brashness, naivete or individualism. 
 I learned living abroad that America is a canvas onto which others project their fears and hatreds. We need not engage such prejudice. Those who dislike us in many cases won't be deterred by new realities, since their attitudes are not always rooted in reality anyway.
 Better to concentrate on making ourselves a better country, for our own sakes. When I vote for Barack Obama, it will be because I think he'll be best for the United States, not because I've been touched by the ''Obamamania'' overseas.

HEADLINE: Inventory Issues for Electronics

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Inventory Issues
 For Electronics 
 Economists and electronics industry experts are scrambling to figure out how the rough economy will affect the market for televisions, audio equipment and other gadgets. They might want to talk to Steven Caldero. 
 Mr. Caldero is the chief operating officer of Ken Cranes, a chain of 10 relatively high-end electronics stores in Los Angeles and the surrounding area. In an interview last week at a meeting of consumer electronics industry managers and executives in Las Vegas, Mr. Caldero talked about how the tumult of the last month was hurting his business -- and the larger consumer electronics ecosystem.
 A year ago, Ken Cranes had $8.5 million to $9 million in inventory on its shelves. This year, the company has cut that back to $6.5 million, a sharp reduction. Mr. Caldero said the company was also cutting back on specific products. For instance, it is stocking only one plasma TV brand, rather than two (he didn't specify which vendor was losing shelf space). 
 The pullback has led to tension with manufacturers. Mr. Caldero said that Samsung in the last two weeks had told the chain that it wanted the stores to take $1.4 million in plasma TV inventory to sell over the holidays. Mr. Caldero said that figure was three times what he realistically expected to sell.
 ''They're incredulous,'' he said of Samsung's reaction. He said they told him: ''What do you mean you're not buying that much?''
 Mr. Caldero said he might wind up not carrying Samsung at all, favoring Panasonic instead.
 Other manufacturers and retailers are probably facing similar issues. That holiday inventory -- built up when the economic downturn wasn't so severe -- has to go somewhere.

HEADLINE: Century Tel Is Said to Be Near Deal to Buy Rival

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
CenturyTel, a provider of local phone and Internet services, was near a deal Sunday night to buy Embarq, its larger competitor and a spinoff from Sprint Nextel, for about $5.76 billion in stock, excluding debt, people briefed on the matter said. The companies were hoping to announce the deal, as early as Monday morning, these people said. 
 If completed, the deal would mark the successful end of long efforts by Embarq to sell itself amid the tumult in the markets. It would also run counter to the deal-making drought that has afflicted the business world and would represent one of the largest deals in recent months; including debt, the deal is worth nearly $12 billion.
 Embarq, which runs the original landline services of Sprint Nextel, hired JPMorgan Chase and put itself up for sale at perhaps the worst possible time, September, amid the financial crisis.
 The ensuing upheaval rattled the stock prices of Embarq and its potential suitors, making it difficult to determine a deal price. It also nearly shut down the credit markets, making obtaining financing virtually impossible for bidders like CenturyTel.
 CenturyTel instead turned to an all-stock offer, bidding about 1.37 of its shares for each Embarq share, or about $40.42 a share based on CenturyTel's closing share price of $29.50 on Friday. Under the proposed terms, CenturyTel shareholders would own about 35 percent of the combined company.
 A deal would mark the latest instance of consolidation in the phone services sector, as industry executives and analysts agree that bigger is increasingly better. In June, Verizon Communications bought Alltel for $28.1 billion, the latest deal in a race by phone companies to expand.
 CenturyTel and Embarq may feel even more pressure to combine, as more customers cut off their landlines and as cable companies offer their own Internet access services. Embarq reported a 3.5 percent drop in its second-quarter revenue in July, and it said in August that it would seek to cut as many as 700 employees.
 Embarq, based in Overland Park, Kan., has publicly signaled its interest in industry consolidation. At a conference last month, Thomas Gerke, the company's chief executive, said, ''We'd certainly be, and have always been, open to looking at that.''
 As of Dec. 31, the company had about 18,000 employees and operated in 18 states. Its shares have fallen about 40 percent this year, closing on Friday at $29.74.
 CenturyTel, based in Monroe, La., provides services to small to midsize cities located mostly in the Midwest and South. As of Dec. 31, the company had about 6,600 employees and operated in 25 states. In August, it reported a 4.4 percent drop in revenue for its second quarter.
 The company has embarked on an acquisition spree over the last decade, buying phone lines from Verizon and others. In 2001, CenturyTel fought off an unsolicited bid from Alltel.

HEADLINE: The Widening Gyre

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Economic data rarely inspire poetic thoughts. But as I was contemplating the latest set of numbers, I realized that I had William Butler Yeats running through my head: ''Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.''
 The widening gyre, in this case, would be the feedback loops (so much for poetry) causing the financial crisis to spin ever further out of control. The hapless falconer would, I guess, be Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary. 
 And the gyre continues to widen in new and scary ways. Even as Mr. Paulson and his counterparts in other countries moved to rescue the banks, fresh disasters mounted on other fronts.
 Some of these disasters were more or less anticipated. Economists have wondered for some time why hedge funds weren't suffering more amid the financial carnage. They need wonder no longer: investors are pulling their money out of these funds, forcing fund managers to raise cash with fire sales of stocks and other assets. 
 The really shocking thing, however, is the way the crisis is spreading to emerging markets -- countries like Russia, Korea and Brazil. 
 These countries were at the core of the last global financial crisis, in the late 1990s (which seemed like a big deal at the time, but was a day at the beach compared with what we're going through now). They responded to that experience by building up huge war chests of dollars and euros, which were supposed to protect them in the event of any future emergency. And not long ago everyone was talking about ''decoupling,'' the supposed ability of emerging market economies to keep growing even if the United States fell into recession. ''Decoupling is no myth,'' The Economist assured its readers back in March. ''Indeed, it may yet save the world economy.''
 That was then. Now the emerging markets are in big trouble. In fact, says Stephen Jen, the chief currency economist at Morgan Stanley, the ''hard landing'' in emerging markets may become the ''second epicenter'' of the global crisis. (U.S. financial markets were the first.)
 What happened? In the 1990s, emerging market governments were vulnerable because they had made a habit of borrowing abroad; when the inflow of dollars dried up, they were pushed to the brink. Since then they have been careful to borrow mainly in domestic markets, while building up lots of dollar reserves. But all their caution was undone by the private sector's obliviousness to risk. 
 In Russia, for example, banks and corporations rushed to borrow abroad, because dollar interest rates were lower than ruble rates. So while the Russian government was accumulating an impressive hoard of foreign exchange, Russian corporations and banks were running up equally impressive foreign debts. Now their credit lines have been cut off, and they're in desperate straits.
 Needless to say, the existing troubles in the banking system, plus the new troubles at hedge funds and in emerging markets, are all mutually reinforcing. Bad news begets bad news, and the circle of pain just keeps getting wider.
 Meanwhile, U.S. policy makers are still balking when it comes to doing what's necessary to contain the crisis.
 It was good news when Mr. Paulson finally agreed to funnel capital into the banking system in return for partial ownership. But last week Joe Nocera of The Times pointed out a key weakness in the U.S. Treasury's bank rescue plan: it contains no safeguards against the possibility that banks will simply sit on the money. ''Unlike the British government, which is mandating lending requirements in return for capital injections, our government seems afraid to do anything except plead.'' And sure enough, the banks seem to be hoarding the cash.
 There's also bizarre stuff going on with regard to the mortgage market. I thought that the whole point of the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the lending agencies, was to remove fears about their solvency and thereby lower mortgage rates. But top officials have made a point of denying that Fannie and Freddie debt is backed by the ''full faith and credit'' of the U.S. government -- and as a result, markets are still treating the agencies' debt as a risky asset, driving mortgage rates up at a time when they should be going down.
 What's happening, I suspect, is that the Bush administration's anti-government ideology still stands in the way of effective action. Events have forced Mr. Paulson into a partial nationalization of the financial system -- but he refuses to use the power that comes with ownership.
 Whatever the reasons for the continuing weakness of policy, the situation is manifestly not coming under control. Things continue to fall apart.

HEADLINE: Rethinking the Notion Of Political Dominance

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
It would be remarkable, in any year, for a black Democratic candidate for president to be ahead in polls one week before Election Day. Even more remarkable is that it's happening this year.
 In 2004, after President Bush won re-election with expanded Republican majorities in Congress, academics, journalists and party strategists wondered whether his blend of free-market economics, cultural conservatism and hawkishness on national security might create long-lasting Republican rule. 
 ''Something fundamental and significant happened,'' said Ken Mehlman, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. On the eve of a second Bush term, he said, the Republican Party was ''in a stronger position than at any time since the Great Depression.'' 
 Today that Republican dream appears in shambles. The twin burdens of an economic crisis and an unpopular war have left Mr. Bush with, at 71 percent, the highest level of public disapproval for a president in the history of the Gallup Poll. Democrats see the chance on Nov. 4 to elect not just Senator Barack Obama but also House and Senate majorities large enough to enact his ambitious agenda.
 A Changing Electorate
 How did such a turnabout happen so fast?
 In part, the answer stems from developments so rare that, as the former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said of the financial crisis, they occur ''once in a century.'' Hurricane Katrina shattered the administration's reputation for competence in domestic affairs, just as problems in Iraq eroded its credibility on national security issues. Not even partisan critics of Republican policies anticipated how a burst housing bubble would devastate Wall Street and damage the entire economy.
 But another part of the explanation may lie in an underappreciated reality of 21st-century politics. Despite the nation's polarization along partisan and ideological lines, the number of swing voters remains large enough to rapidly undercut any Democratic or Republican coalition in reaction to shifting events.
 ''The map of 2004 was a delusion,'' said Bernadette Budde, a political strategist for the Republican-friendly Business Industry Political Action Committee in Washington. 
 A new generation of voters, consuming political information in different ways than their forebears, is ''very action-oriented, very issue-driven, very solutions-oriented,'' Ms. Budde said. ''It would be very foolhardy for either political party to think they could dominate the age politically.'' 
 Indeed, young voters have moved toward the Democrats. Those under 30, after backing Senator John Kerry by nine percentage points over Mr. Bush in 2004, now favor Mr. Obama by a 36-point margin in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 Yet their more tradition-minded elders have also moved that way, if in smaller numbers, reflecting the breadth of discontent with the country's direction and Washington's inability to act on persistent problems like health care and immigration policy. As long as these problems persist, any governing coalition remains at risk.
 ''There's a huge amount of instability that's built into the political system right now,'' said Walter Dean Burnham, a professor emeritus at the University of Texas and a leading scholar of American political alignments. ''Hegemony tends to erode pretty quickly.''
 Ruy Teixeira, an analyst of demographic trends at the Century Foundation, said a lasting Republican majority was always unrealistic in light of the continuing growth in Democratic-leaning constituencies, including Hispanic and Asian immigrants, working women and upscale professionals. Now Mr. Teixeira sees the combination of that growth and the broader political environment producing an ''emerging Democratic majority,'' the subject of a book he wrote with John B. Judis in 2002. 
 ''The demography is moving in their direction,'' Mr. Teixeira said, ''they're catching the wave.'' But he qualified that assessment in light of the economic and foreign policy challenges that Mr. Obama and his party would inherit if he defeats Senator John McCain next week. ''A lot of it depends on how they govern that pesky little thing,'' Mr. Teixeira said.
 New Paths to Victory
 Democrats' prospects have brightened as they improve their competitiveness in the South, where religious, military and anti-tax conservatives have been a bedrock of support for the Republican Party since the Nixon administration. Democrats also threaten to wrest parts of the Rocky Mountain West from Republican control.
 But Western Democrats acknowledge that enduring success will depend on the nomination of candidates with credibility among moderate voters, whom Republicans have lost in some recent elections while emphasizing social issues and opposition to government spending on education and infrastructure. 
 ''There's no brand loyalty here,'' said Laura Chapin, a Democratic strategist in Colorado. 
 Republicans have begun contemplating new political formulas that might restore their dream of dominance that so quickly faded. A major focus will be strategies for regaining the party's edge among working-class voters, whom Mr. Obama has courted with a tax cut plan that the McCain campaign has portrayed as socialist. 
 In their recent book, ''Grand New Party,'' Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam identify ''Sam's Club voters'' as the critical constituency for Republicans. ''Some combination of the populist left and the neoliberal center is likely to emerge as America's next political majority,'' they write, ''if the conservative movement can't find innovative ways to address the anxieties of working-class America.''
 The notion of durable political alignments has been a long-running fascination among political scientists and historians. They have classified a handful of presidential contests as ''critical elections'' producing extended dominance, including Abraham Lincoln's 1860 victory on the eve of the Civil War and Franklin D. Roosevelt's victory in 1932 amid the Great Depression. 
 Professor Burnham wonders whether this election might prove to be another such contest. But he cautions against expecting any political realignment to ''last as long as the old ones did.''
 ''It certainly smells like a critical election, but I can't say for sure,'' Professor Burnham said. ''It's hard to speculate even about 2010, much less anything else.''

HEADLINE: Businesses Wary of Details in Obama Health Plan

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: AGAWAM, Mass. 

 BODY:
Dave Ratner, owner of Dave's Soda and Pet City, is pretty sure he is about to get ''whacked'' by the new state law that requires employers to contribute to health care benefits for their workers or pay a $295-per-employee penalty. In order to avoid thousands of dollars in fines, Mr. Ratner is considering not adding part-time workers at his four pet supply stores in Western Massachusetts.
 But the penalty in Massachusetts is picayune compared with what some health experts believe Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, might impose as part of his plan to provide affordable coverage for the uninsured. Though Mr. Obama has not released details, economists believe he might require large and medium companies to contribute as much as 6 percent of their payrolls.
 That, Mr. Ratner said, would be catastrophic to a low-margin business like his, which has 90 employees, 29 of them full-time workers who are offered health benefits. 
 ''To all of a sudden whack 6 to 7 percent of payroll costs, forget it,'' he said. ''If they do that, prices go up and employment goes down because nobody can absorb that.''
 Writ large, that is one of the significant concerns about Mr. Obama's health plan, which like this state's landmark 2006 law would subsidize coverage for the uninsured by taxing employers who do not cover their workers. And it is a primary reason that so-called play-or-pay proposals have had an unsteady history for nearly two decades. 
 With Mr. Obama's plan, business leaders say, the devil will be in the unknown details.
 Mr. Obama would prohibit insurers from rejecting applicants because of medical conditions, require health insurance for children and create a new federal health plan to provide comprehensive coverage to the uninsured. Those beneath certain income levels would be granted tax credits to make premiums affordable, and small businesses would be offered tax credits to provide benefits.
 The tax credits are projected to cost at least $110 billion. Mr. Obama has said he would pay for it primarily by raising income taxes on those making more than $250,000 and by reducing health spending. But when he announced the plan in May 2007, he emphasized that employers would share in the cost.
 ''We will ask all but the smallest businesses who don't make a meaningful contribution today to the health coverage of their employees to do so by supporting this new plan,'' he said.
 Left undefined has been what size firms would be exempted, what constitutes a ''meaningful contribution,'' and how much noncompliant businesses would be required to pay. Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, badgered Mr. Obama in two of their debates to define the penalty, but Mr. Obama did not rise to the bait. 
 ''We made a decision even before the plan was rolled out not to decide,'' said David M. Cutler, a Harvard economist who speaks for the campaign on health care. ''It's not that there's a decision out there that we're not telling. It's literally that we've decided not to decide.''
 That may be smart politics. But it makes business groups nervous that Mr. Obama might impose an unmanageable burden. They also worry that any time his health plan faces a shortfall, businesses will be asked to up their ante, as has happened in Massachusetts.
 ''Play-or-pay can become a blank check to an already overcapitalized health care system,'' said Helen B. Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, which represents 300 companies. 
 Business groups also have concerns that Mr. McCain's plan to change the tax treatment of health benefits would erode employer-sponsored insurance.
 Mr. Cutler said the Obama campaign regarded play-or-pay less ''as a revenue raiser'' than as a way of ''leveling the playing field.'' It would hold accountable those employers whose uninsured workers might seek treatment in emergency rooms or enroll in government insurance plans, with costs subsidized by others through higher premiums and taxes. Mr. Cutler said the expense to businesses would be offset by savings from Mr. Obama's proposals to reduce health spending, though that is an uncertain prospect. 
 Several econometric models have assumed that Mr. Obama would have to set his penalty near 6 percent of payroll (Mercer, a benefits consulting firm says that large employers typically pay 15 percent). Recent play-or-pay proposals in California and Pennsylvania put the figure at 3 or 4 percent, and both failed in part because of business opposition. 
 Hawaii is the only state that requires employers to provide health benefits, while Vermont, like Massachusetts, gently fines those who do not. Several other states have enacted similar laws over the last two decades, but they have been repealed, rejected by voters or challenged in court. 
 Economists believe the cost of health benefits is ultimately shifted to employees through lower wages. When wages cannot be lowered, layoffs may result. Katherine Baicker of Harvard and Helen G. Levy of the University of Michigan have projected that play-or-pay might push 224,000 workers into that category.
 When negotiating their health plan, Massachusetts lawmakers rejected a payroll tax and instead set a ''fair share contribution'' that was low enough to appease businesses. The amount also was kept low to steer clear of the 1974 federal law prohibiting states from regulating multistate group insurance plans. Companies with 10 or fewer full-time equivalent employees were exempted.
 State officials hoped the penalty would generate a little revenue, but recognized it was not likely to prompt employers to start offering coverage. It raised only $7.7 million in its first year, well under projections. So when a substantial budget gap opened in the $869 million health plan this year, Gov. Deval Patrick asked businesses to help fill the hole.
 He compromised on a revised formula that is projected to bring in $30 million by increasing the number and average size of firms that will be penalized. The state expects 1,100 businesses to be fined, up from 855, or about 3 percent of eligible companies.
 The deal left business leaders satisfied for the moment. They recognize that the $295 penalty is a fraction of the $4,000 that Massachusetts employers spend to insure an individual worker.
 But businesses worry the state will raise their obligation each year. They argue they have already absorbed costs of insuring 159,000 workers with group coverage since the state began mandating insurance (a total of 439,000 have enrolled, giving the state the country's highest insurance rate).
 ''You want the system to work,'' said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. ''You just want to make sure there isn't more cost-shifting to businesses because they are paying their fair share.'' 
 State officials are gratified that -- contrary to national trends -- the share of employers offering health benefits has increased slightly. One fear about play-or-pay is that if the penalty is too low employers will stop offering coverage and pay the fines instead, shifting workers to government insurance programs. 
 But leaders here also are sensitive to the possibility that further increases in the penalty might stymie wage and job growth. 
 ''In this day and age,'' said Dr. JudyAnn Bigby, the state secretary of health and human services, ''it wouldn't take much of a change in policy to push some entities over the brink.''

HEADLINE: Officials Counter Online Rumors About Iranian President's Health

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran is suffering from exhaustion because of the strain of his job, the official news agency IRNA reported Sunday in an unusual disclosure about the health of the country's top elected leader. But the news agency quoted a political ally as saying Mr. Ahmadinejad would make a full recovery.
 State television also quoted Mr. Ahmadinejad himself as saying that he might be exhausted, but that it was nothing more serious. ''Of course, we are also human beings, and sometimes we catch a cold,'' he was quoted as saying. 
 The official news accounts apparently were meant to rebut rumors that Mr. Ahmadinejad, who is in his early 50s, may be ill and not up to running for re-election in June. Those rumors, on nongovernment Web sites including some associated with Mr. Ahmadinejad's political rivals, have suggested that his condition could be more serious, particularly since he has canceled several events in the past week. 
 The talk about his health comes at a time of increased pressure on Mr. Ahmadinejad, primarily for what critics call his mishandling of the economy in Iran, which has led to an inflation rate of 30 percent. His government faced one of its worst crises this month after street-bazaar merchants in major cities went on strike to protest enforcement of a new sales tax. Analysts have warned that the economy could worsen because of the tumbling price of oil, Iran's leading export, which could force severe budget cutbacks and rising unemployment.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad is also known for his unyielding position on Iran's uranium enrichment program, which the United States, Israel and the European Union suspect is meant for developing an atomic bomb, an accusation that Iran denies. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's refusal to halt uranium enrichment has led to United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran and contributed to its increased economic isolation. 
 ''The president will eventually recover and will continue his work,'' said Mohammad Esmail Kowsari, a member of Parliament and a close ally of Mr. Ahmadinejad, according to IRNA.
 IRNA also reported Sunday that Mr. Ahmadinejad had become fatigued because of the strain of his job. He has said that he works 20 hours a day.
 Mr. Kowsari said that the president's rivals were using a simple illness as ''psychological warfare,'' but that they were doomed to fail.
 On Saturday, state-run television showed Mr. Ahmadinejad receiving the credentials of three foreign ambassadors. 
 He met with governors general, leaders of Iran's regions, on Sunday, according to IRNA, and during that meeting he attacked his critics by saying they had ''tried maliciously'' to ignore the positive and constructive efforts of his government. 
 Shahab News, an unofficial Web site, reported that Mr. Ahmadinejad suffers from ''exhaustion and low blood pressure,'' the same problem that forced him to cancel many events for three consecutive weeks in May. It said that a close aide had said the president was suffering from ''weakness'' caused by ''the pressure of his work.''
 The Web site also said: ''Mr. Ahmadinejad's illness has led political circles to believe that he might not be able to run for re-election next year.'' 
 The news came as Parliament moved on Sunday to impeach Interior Minister Ali Kordan, a close ally of Mr. Ahmadinejad over claims of lying about his university degrees. A vote was set for Nov. 4.
 Mr. Kordan claimed that Oxford had given him an honorary doctorate, but investigations revealed that his degree was fake.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Panics Past Still Ache

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD

 BODY:
''I haven't forgotten history,'' says Gert Heinz, a tax adviser in Munich. ''If you depend on paper money you can lose everything. We've learned that the hard way after two world wars.''
 So when Chancellor Angela Merkel went on television recently to tell Germans that their bank accounts were safe, Mr. Heinz, who at 68 still remembers the rows of canned food that his mother hoarded in the attic, decided he would rather be safe than sorry. 
 He converted a chunk of his savings into gold, as he had done before, and stocked up on a six-month supply of rice, sugar, flour and a special brand of powdered milk that lasts 50 years.
 Mr. Heinz may be an extreme example, but he is not alone. As Europeans grasp for security in the face of a financial storm that -- at least so far -- has affected them much less directly than it has many Americans, they are reflecting the history of their tortured continent that has weathered wars, revolutions and financial crises over the centuries.
 In America, wealth and retirement savings are much more tied up in the stock market, with a majority of people owning at least a modest stake. By contrast, only 13 percent of German households and 24 percent of French ones own shares, according to 2006 figures compiled by the European Savings Institute. 
 Pensions are still largely state-dependent, not 401(k)-style investment accounts. Even when it comes to the British, who look more like Americans in terms of credit card debt and mortgage exposure, only about 20 percent of them have invested in the market.
 But history teaches Europeans that situations can go from bad to perilous in no time, and there is a long tradition of burying the family's treasures in troubled times. 
 Today, tales of people taking money out of banks to keep it somewhere else are circulating in Paris bistros and London pubs. Companies selling or renting safes are reporting an increase in demand, though hard numbers are difficult to establish.
 ''History matters. In times of crisis you really get to know a country and its people,'' said Toni Pierenkemper, a professor of economic history at the University of Cologne. ''Traumatic events are seared into the collective consciousness and often survive into the next generations.''
 Germany, where many people lost their savings twice in the 20th century, is one of the richest laboratories of European historical scars -- welts that help explain the country's fears of inflation and its interest in maintaining a complex public-private banking system.
 The network of 446 publicly owned savings banks, which have been guaranteeing their deposits for three decades, have proved popular in recent weeks as nervous Germans moved part of their savings onto their books.
 Even more striking, an overwhelming surge in the demand for gold has forced several Internet sites and gold vendors to temporarily shut down their sales operations.
 ''I've never seen anything like this. We're basically sold out until the end of the year,'' said Robert Hartmann, co-founder of ProAurum, a gold vendor based in Munich. 
 Despite the shortages, about 200 customers line up at his counter every day, he said, asking for coins and bars, not certificates. According to his estimates, ''only about 5 percent of German investors'' are interested in converting a small part of their savings to gold, ''but it's enough to put suppliers under strain.''
 Mr. Heinz, the financial adviser, started diversifying his investments in the run-up to the 1992 recession. He has bought land and gradually built up a stock of gold, which he buys in small units, suitable as emergency payment, and keeps in a safe at a specialized company.
 He still remembers the stories his grandfather told of a suitcase full of bank notes buying no more than a loaf of bread during hyperinflation in 1923 Germany. He also remembers the currency changes of 1948 that again wiped out savings.
 Some of his clients share his fears.
 He tells of one who dropped a vacuum-sealed sack filled with gold and silver to the bed of a lake, in case the government were to levy an additional tax on wealth or try to ban households from owning gold. Another has buried his riches in a forest. All of them think that it is just a matter of time until another wave of inflation erodes the value of money.
 In France, gold sales have also increased, but people are more trusting of the government.
 The entire French banking system was state-owned as recently as 1987, and the state has played a prominent role in the economy since the days of Louis XIV.
 In contrast to the unease and suspicion among most Americans about the government's taking stakes in distressed financial institutions, many people in France feel comforted -- even vindicated -- in their belief that the state has a responsibility to look after the economy.
 ''We nationalize, we denationalize and we re-nationalize. That's the way it goes in France,'' quipped Bernard Candiard, director-general of Credit Municipal de Paris, a 231-year-old pawnshop that is doing brisk business these days and is a state monopoly.
 ''Today we are again in the process of nationalizing banks,'' Mr. Candiard said. ''It's a sign to the people. The government wants to give them confidence. And confidence in France is the state. We have a different tradition from America.''
 In Eastern Europe, where people were hardened by modest living standards under communism, the trust in government is more limited.
 In Bulgaria, for example, more people are looking at moving their money to Western European banks that offer an unlimited deposit guarantee, said Adriana Alexandrova, a financial executive at the TV2 television station in Sofia.
 ''There is a great lack of confidence in the banks and in the government,'' said Ms. Alexandrova, whose parents had to close their pharmacy business after several Bulgarian banks collapsed in the mid-1990s. ''Several of my friends have moved their money to safes.''
 The phrase ''he likes gardening'' has a double meaning in Bulgaria, she added. ''Under communism it mainly meant people preparing jars of pickled vegetables to get them through the winter. These days, it mainly means someone is hiding money in their garden or under their pillow.''

HEADLINE: Atlantic City Suspends Casino Smoking Ban

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
Smoking will be permitted again in the city's 11 casinos for at least the next year, as the City Council voted Monday night to overturn a temporary smoking ban that took effect 12 days ago. 
 Mayor Scott K. Evans signed the measure minutes after the vote. It will take effect Nov. 16, when the casinos will revert to a previous arrangement permitting smoking on no more than 25 percent of a casino floor.
 Casino workers were divided over the smoking ban. Some at Monday's meeting chanted, ''Save our lives!'' while others shouted, ''Save our jobs!''
 The Council acted after casinos cited the worsening economy and revenue that had already been declining because of stiff competition from slot machine parlors in neighboring states. 
 Liz String, a dealer at Harrah's Resort Atlantic City, was one of those angered by the vote rescinding the ban. 
 ''We finally have clean air, which is our right, and they're taking it away from us,'' Ms. String said. ''I think we were betrayed.''
 Not all dealers favor the smoking ban. A few dozen workers wearing red T-shirts that read ''I Want to Work'' were among an overflow crowd that started arriving more than two hours before the meeting started.
 Robert McDevitt, president of Unite Here! Local 54, which represents casino hotel, food and beverage workers, pushed for the ban to be delayed, fearing that it could cost hundreds of union jobs.
 In the seven days that ended last Friday, at a time when the stock market was seeing major losses, casino winnings fell by 19.5 percent, Mr. McDevitt said. That figure was confirmed by the state's Casino Control Commission.
 Under the smoking ban that was approved by the Council in April, the casinos could set up enclosed, ventilated smoking lounges where gamblers could light up away from the slot machines and gambling tables. 
 Eight of the 11 casinos have done that. Of the others, the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa has climate-controlled outdoor lounges. The Atlantic City Hilton Casino Resort and its sister property, Resorts Atlantic City, made no provision for their smokers, who have to go outside to light up.
 Ms. String said she dreaded going back to work at smoke-filled gambling tables.
 ''You can't back away from the table because you're responsible for all those chips in front of you,'' she said. ''There's no way to escape. It's torture.''

HEADLINE: Dim Days for Luxury Hotels

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
Even as midprice hotels began losing business this past summer, luxury hotels continued to fill their rooms. Companies treated the hotels as perks for top executives and quality locations for high-level business meetings. And many leisure travelers considered a stay at a top hotel -- even for a couple of days -- to be worth the cost.
 Times have changed. 
 Since mid-September, almost in parallel with the stock market turmoil, demand for fancy hotel rooms has plummeted. Patrick Ford, the president of Lodging Econometrics, said that luxury hotel room revenue rates ''slowed in mid-September and really ratcheted downward during October.'' 
 Revenue per available room, the standard measure of performance, dropped 14 percent at upscale and luxury hotels in the week ending Oct. 18 over the comparable week last year, according to Smith Travel Research. For hotels in general, the decline was about 8 percent.
 Even in the best of economic times, most luxury hotels were not sustained by business from rich leisure travelers. Instead, those hotels depended on corporate travel, including meetings and conferences. 
 But with the economic downturn, companies have been cutting back on travel expenses. The hotels have also experienced a drop-off in business from affluent international leisure and business travelers, as economies around the globe slow and the value of the dollar rises. 
 At the same time, travelers have become more defensive about conspicuous consumption. 
 Public indignation over big paydays and the lavish expenses of top executives has also hurt the luxury hotel business. Companies are now concerned about perceptions -- worried about how it looks to others when employees stay in hotels whose very names evoke images of opulence. In part because of those concerns, there has been a sudden rash of cancellations of corporate meetings. 
 In this unsettled climate, some financial services and other companies have quietly advised employees against using luxury hotels. ''Don't stay in Four Seasons, Ritz-Carltons, Mandarin Orientals,'' said Bjorn Hanson, an associate professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University.
 ''It's a budgetary issue,'' Mr. Hanson said, ''but a more fundamental issue is, how does it look if you're laying off 10 percent of your work force and you have people staying at $500-a-night or $1,000-a-night hotels?''
 In interviews and in public remarks, several luxury hotel managers conceded that business was temporarily shaky and cancellation rates soaring. But they were loath to discuss the downturn on the record. 
 Largely because of what Mr. Hanson called the ''widespread creation of wealth,'' the number of domestic hotel rooms in the luxury segment almost doubled, to more than 80,000, in the last 10 years, according to Smith Travel Research. At the same time, luxury hotel companies were also planting their flags in every major city in the world. 
 Managers at luxury hotels point out that their corporate clients typically are lured less by lavish surroundings than by the impeccable customer service that distinguishes a top-tier hotel. Ritz-Carlton, for example, often cites its ''empowered'' work force, in which even desk clerks are authorized to unilaterally make decisions involving as much as $2,000 to address a customer problem.
 The decline in demand has put pressure on the relationship between the companies that manage the luxury hotels and the developers and hotel real estate investment companies that own the properties and, therefore, bear most of the debt and operating costs. The brands include Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, Le Meridien, Mandarin Oriental, Fairmont and others. 
 It is axiomatic among top-tier hotels -- as it is among top-tier department store and jewelry sellers -- that price discounting is detrimental to brand prestige. Holding sales in uncertain times means less ability to raise prices back to normal levels when good times return, hotel managers insist.
 But many owners, feeling the pinch from credit and mortgage debt, want more revenue now and are pushing for aggressive discounting. In past downturns, the luxury hotel companies -- whose books are generally free of huge debt (since they did not build the property or buy the real estate) -- have managed to resist owners' pleas for overt discounting.
 What does all of this mean for the traveler -- or at least the business or leisure traveler who is still able to stay at a top-tier hotel? Better bargaining power, hotel insiders say. 
 ''In the past, when we would approach a five-star hotel, they wouldn't be interested in discounting because that's going against their brand,'' said Noah Tratt, the vice president for supplier strategy at Egencia, the corporate travel management company of Expedia Inc.
 That intransigence is weakening in many markets where ''they are very willing to negotiate in the corporate channels on a private price that essentially doesn't undermine their published rates,'' he said.

PERSON: Tony Hillerman 

HEADLINE: Tony Hillerman, Mystery Novelist Who Explored the 'Navajo Way,' Dies at 83

BYLINE: By MARILYN STASIO

 BODY:
Tony Hillerman, a former newspaperman whose evocative mystery novels set among the Navajos of the Southwest took the American detective story in new directions and made him a best-selling author, died Sunday in Albuquerque, where he lived. He was 83.
 The cause was pulmonary failure, his family said. A daughter, Anne Hillerman, said her father had survived two heart attacks and operations for prostate and bladder cancer, The Associated Press reported. 
 In the world of mystery fiction, Mr. Hillerman was that rare figure: a best-selling author who was adored by fans, admired by fellow authors and respected by critics. Though the themes of his books were not overtly political, he wrote with an avowed purpose: to instill in his readers a respect for Native American culture.
 His stories, while steeped in contemporary crime, often describe people struggling to maintain ancient traditions in the modern world. The books are instructive about ancient tribal beliefs and customs, from purification rituals to incest taboos. 
 ''It's always troubled me that the American people are so ignorant of these rich Indian cultures,'' Mr. Hillerman once told Publishers Weekly. ''I think it's important to show that aspects of ancient Indian ways are still very much alive and are highly germane even to our ways.''
 Mr. Hillerman was not the first mystery writer to set a story on Indian land or to introduce a Native American detective to crime literature. (Manly Wade Wellman, for one, had done so.) But beginning with ''The Blessing Way'' in 1970, the 18 novels that Mr. Hillerman set on Southwest Indian reservations, featuring Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police, gave the traditional genre hero a new dimension.
 Joe Leaphorn, grizzled and a bit cynical, has a logical mind and a passion for order that reflects his upbringing in the Navajo Way. His code of behavior is dictated by a belief in the harmonious patterns of life that link man to the natural world. But he is not a religious fundamentalist; he is a skeptic who holds a master's degree in anthropology.
 Jim Chee, younger and more idealistic than Leaphorn, seeks a more spiritual connection to Navajo tradition. Over several books he studies to become a hataalii, or singing medicine man. This ambition creates friction between the religious faith he professes and the secular rules of criminal justice he is sworn to uphold. Chee first appears in ''People of Darkness'' (1980), Mr. Hillerman's fourth novel in the series.
 Leaphorn and Chee appear in separate novels in Mr. Hillerman's Navajo Tribal Police series. Each story challenges one or the other officer with a crime that seems to be entangled in the spirit world but that is also rooted in the reservation life that Mr. Hillerman knew so well.
 When murder is the crime, Native Americans find it easier to attribute the killing to witches, a superstition that horrifies the rational Leaphorn but one that makes sense to Chee. Chee sees witchcraft metaphorically, ''in people who had turned deliberately and with malice from the beauty of the Navajo Way'' -- ''in those who sold whisky to children, in those who bought videocassette recorders while their relatives were hungry, in the knife fights in a Gallup alley, in beaten wives and abandoned children.''
 Mr. Hillerman first brought Leaphorn and Chee together on the same case in ''Skinwalkers'' (1986), a novel that allows for illuminating interplay between these two different representatives of Navajo culture. 
 In the story the officers investigate three murders linked only by pellets of bone associated with the murder weapons. Is this an indication that the killings are the work of skinwalkers, witches who can fly and take the shapes of dogs, wolves or other animals? 
 Leaphorn hates witchcraft and holds superstition, unemployment and whisky responsible for much of his people's suffering. But Chee knows the power of forces that the science of the white man cannot explain. The detectives blend their disparate views of the world to solve the case.
 Mr. Hillerman wrote with intimate knowledge of the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni tribes; he grew up with people very much like them. ''I recognized kindred spirits'' in the Navajo, he wrote in an autobiographical essay in 1986. ''Country boys. Folks among whom I felt at ease.''
 Anthony Grove Hillerman was born on May 27, 1925, in Sacred Heart, Okla., to August Alfred Hillerman, a farmer and shopkeeper, and his wife, Lucy Grove. The town was in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl, and the family's circumstances were so mean that Mr. Hillerman would later joke that ''the Joads were the ones who had enough money to move to California.''
 ''In Sacred Heart, being a storyteller was a good thing to be,'' he said of his country village, which was 35 miles from the nearest library. Growing up on territorial lands of the Potawatomi Tribe, he went to St. Mary's Academy, a school for Indian girls run by the Sisters of Mercy, and attended high school with Potawatomi children. He said he owed much of the veracity of his stories to his friendships.
 ''I cross-examine my Navajo friends and shamelessly hang around trading posts, police substations, rodeos, rug auctions and sheep dippings,'' he wrote of his research methods.
 After attending Oklahoma A&M College, Mr. Hillerman enlisted in the Army in World War II. During two years of combat in Europe, he said, his company of 212 riflemen shrank to 8 as its members fought their way through France. In 1945, in a raid behind German lines, he stepped on a mine. His left leg was shattered, and he was severely burned. He never regained full vision in his left eye.
 He returned from Europe in 1945 with a Silver Star, a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart and enrolled at the University of Oklahoma, where he met and married Marie Unzner, a Phi Beta Kappa student in bacteriology, and took up journalism. He went on to find jobs as a crime reporter for The Borger News-Herald in the Texas Panhandle; city editor of The Morning Press-Constitution in Lawton, Okla.; a political reporter in Oklahoma City; bureau manager in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for United Press International; and executive editor of The Santa Fe New Mexican.
 By the mid-1960s Mr. Hillerman and his wife had one child and had adopted five more. He was almost 40 and had put in 17 years as a newspaperman. But he was becoming restless.
 ''The yen builds to work in something more malleable than hard fact, an urge grows to try to deal with the meaning of all this,'' he wrote.
 So with his wife's support he quit The New Mexican and took his family to Albuquerque, where he enrolled at the University of New Mexico. He earned his master's degree in 1966, joined the journalism faculty and later became chairman of the department. Fascinated with Native American culture, he also became something of an authority on the Southwest.
 In the late 1960s, he said, he began to ''practice'' writing by working on a mystery, drawing on an earlier encounter he had had with a group of Navajos on horseback and in face paint and feathers in Crownpoint, N.M. They had been holding a Navajo Enemy Way ceremony for a soldier, a curing ritual that exorcises all traces of the enemy from those returning from battle. Mr. Hillerman had himself just returned from the war after a long convalescence.
 He was so moved by the ceremony and so stirred by the rugged landscape that he resolved to live there. The experience became the basis for ''The Blessing Way'' (1970). 
 He spent three years writing the novel and sent the manuscript to Joan Kahn, a respected mystery editor at Harper & Row, now HarperCollins. She published it after he complied with her suggestion -- that he increase the role of a secondary character, the Navajo policeman Joe Leaphorn. 
 He departed from Indian themes for his second novel, ''The Fly on the Wall'' (1971), a political story of big-city corruption. But he was already yearning to get back to the country where all his other novels are set, the vast tribal lands that straddle northeast Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado.
 There he would ''collect'' sensory impressions -- ''the way the wind sounds down there,'' he wrote, ''the nature of echoes, the smell of sage and wet sand, how the sky looks atop a tunnel of stone, the booming of thunder bouncing from one cliff to another.''
 In a Hillerman mystery violent crime disrupts the harmonious Navajo world. ''Everything is connected,'' Jim Chee reflects in ''The Ghostway'' (1984). ''The wing of the corn beetle affects the direction of the wind, the way the sand drifts, the way the light reflects into the eye of man beholding his reality. All is part of totality, and in this totality man finds his hozro, his way of walking in harmony, with beauty all around him.'' 
 Some critics found Mr. Hillerman's writing humorless, moralizing and too reverential toward the Native American characters he favored. But even his detractors usually praised the ingenuity of his plots.
 His third book, ''Dance Hall of the Dead'' (1973), won the 1974 Edgar Allan Poe Award for best mystery novel, given by the Mystery Writers of America. In 1991 the group gave him its highest honor, its Grandmaster Award, after he had solidified the Navajo Tribal Police series with ''A Thief of Time'' (his own favorite novel), ''Talking God'' and ''Coyote Waits.'' His last book in the series, ''The Shape Shifter,'' was published by HarperCollins in 2006. Mr. Hillerman also wrote children's and nonfiction books, including a memoir. 
 Besides his daughter Anne, Mr. Hillerman is survived by his wife, Marie; their five other children, Dan, Tony Jr., Steve, Monica Atwell and Janet Grado; and 10 grandchildren. 
 For all the recognition he received, Mr. Hillerman once said, he was most gladdened by the status of Special Friend of the Dineh (the Navajo people) conferred on him in 1987 by the Navajo Nation. He was also proud that his books were taught at reservation schools and colleges.
 ''Good reviews delight me when I get them,'' he said. ''But I am far more delighted by being voted the most popular author by the students of St. Catherine Indian school, and even more by middle-aged Navajos who tell me that reading my mysteries revived their children's interest in the Navajo Way.''

HEADLINE: Sales Rose, but Prices Fell For New Homes in September

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Sales of new homes recorded an unexpected increase in September as median home prices dropped to the lowest level in four years.
 The Commerce Department reported Monday that sales of new single-family homes rose 2.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000 homes. Economists had expected sales would drop from the August level. 
 The median price of a new home sold in September declined 9.1 percent from a year ago to $218,400, the lowest price level since September 2004, a period when home prices were rising rapidly as the country experienced a five-year housing boom. 
 The surprising increase in September sales still left them 33.1 percent below the level of a year ago as the country is battered by the worst housing slump in decades.
 The report on a rise in new-home sales followed news last week that sales of existing homes rose in September by 5.5 percent, the largest monthly gain in more than five years.
 Analysts are not convinced that the sales increases are signaling a bottom for the housing market. They said that the September gains came before the latest upheavals in financial markets, which have raised new worries about the overall state of the economy.
 Many analysts believe the country has already entered a recession. They are forecasting significant increases in job losses that will make it even harder to mount a sustained rebound in housing.
 New-home sales fell 21.4 percent in the Northeast and were down 5.8 percent in the Midwest. But sales rose by 22.7 percent in the West, a region that has had some of the biggest declines in prices, a development that has spurred sales. Sales were up 0.7 percent in the South.
 The rise in sales left a total of 394,000 unsold new homes on the market at the end of September, down a record 25.4 percent from the number of unsold homes on the market at the end of September 2007.
 Builders have been sharply cutting back on production, trying to get inventories more in line with sales.
 Even with the latest drop in total unsold new homes, the inventory represents a 10.4 months supply at the September sales pace, still a historically high level.
 The inventory of unsold existing homes is also near historic highs as that market is having a record wave of foreclosures.
 The 2.7 percent rise in sales for September new-home sales followed a big 12.6 percent drop in August, which was revised sharply lower from the government's initial estimate. Sales in July rose 3.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Finding Ways to Dull The Glamour of Travel

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
author tag with dummy text.

 BODY:
IN terms of perspective, it helps to have been toiling at this particular workbench for a while.
 I remember the summer of 2000, when corporate travel departments were hyperventilating about soaring airfares and hotel costs. That was when Mark L. Walton, a travel policy consultant, gave a well-received talk during a seminar at the National Business Travel Association convention in Los Angeles.
 Mr. Walton read a parody memorandum supposedly announcing new rules from the corporate travel department. Air travel was to be severely limited, the joke memo said. Instead, it said, ''hitchhiking is strictly encouraged,'' though employees hitching rides would receive ''luminescent safety vests'' for nighttime travel. 
 Also, the memo said, ''All employees are encouraged to stay with relatives and friends while on company business.'' 
 Everybody thought this was a riot -- the hitchhiking and the idea that a proud, hard-charging road warrior might end up not in a nice Hilton but instead sleeping on a cousin's couch. The joke was on the corporate travel managers. 
 So I was a little startled last week during a telephone conference held by American Express Business Travel, the corporate travel management subsidiary of American Express, when Frank Schnur, a vice president of the company's Global Advisory Services, said that some corporate travel managers are actually making some of those suggestions. 
 ''Another one of the things we're seeing companies ask their employees to do is stay with friends and families when traveling,'' Mr. Schnur said. ''Or stay together, share hotel rooms, to avoid additional costs.'' He was listing some of the ways that corporate travel managers are now trimming costs by as much as 30 percent, while still having employees ''travel the same amount.''
 It has been a long time since I last spoke with Mr. Walton, a co-founder of Consulting Strategies, which advises multinational corporations on travel. 
 I called him to ask: Have we finally come to this, to begging for space on a couch?
 ''I honestly have not heard that, and obviously the social aspect would prohibit most companies from having that kind of change,'' he said. I thought immediately of the prospect of sharing a room on the road with the likes of Dwight Schrute, the repellent cubicle dweller played by Rainn Wilson in the television comedy ''The Office.''
 On the other hand, Mr. Walton said, staying with friends and relatives, if not actually willingly sharing a hotel room with a co-worker ''might be an option some people think of'' when left to their own discretion to decide how to reduce travel costs.
 This might sound counterintuitive, but Mr. Walton thinks that most people actually like to take the occasional business trip and want to remain in the corporate travel lineup.
 ''As much as people complain about traveling, who ever says that they really don't want to travel again? Nobody says that,'' Mr. Walton said. ''People want to get in an airplane once in a while. There is still some enjoyment in that, and people are going to figure out a way to still travel.''
 Hotel costs have risen so much in recent years that lodging exceeds air transportation at some companies as a percentage of overall travel spending, he said. 
 The American Express forecast, by the way, generally predicted slower growth and, in some cases, an actual reduction, in airfares and hotel rates next year. But there was no indication of an end to the proliferation of airline fees, which are not counted in the fare and which, American Express said, can add 15 percent to the cost of flying.
 Airlines are seeing at least a short-term ''bonanza'' from oil prices that have dropped below $70 a barrel, Mr. Walton said. 
 We can only speculate whether that, coupled with a decrease in travel caused by a poor economy, will translate into airfare reductions. 
 ''Both suppliers and buyers of travel and travel-related services are expected to face new operating challenges in the coming year,'' the American Express forecast said. 
 So reality imitates parody?
 ''It's all a function of the marketplace,'' Mr. Walton said.

How to Control
 A Currency Panic
 The financial crisis has ratcheted up a dangerous notch. The currency markets have gone topsy-turvy. The authorities now have to make some pretty big and delicate moves -- something like performing microsurgery in a plane in turbulent skies.
 The yen has risen by 40 percent against the euro since August, with most of that occurring in October. 
 This month, the Australian dollar has also fallen by 25 percent and the pound by 16 percent against the American dollar. Swings of this scale are alarming when they happen in the stock market . But they are petrifying in currency markets, because they make it virtually impossible to price exports or imports. 
 What's going on? 
 Mainly, the pace of financial de-leveraging is accelerating. In particular, so-called currency carry trades -- borrowing cheaply where interest rates are low, for example in Japan, and lending the funds where rates are high, such as in Australia or the euro zone -- are ending abruptly. 
 The unwinding of these trades has jerked currencies around enough to provoke more margin calls on traders, amplifying the pressures on them to sell. Then there is fear: Investors are selling currencies of countries that import foreign capital, precipitating currency crises in eastern Europe and Korea that further hurt their economies. 
 This combination of de-leveraging and fear has also pushed stock markets into something like a free fall. Japan's Nikkei index is at its lowest since 1982, the MSCI index of non-Japanese Asian stocks is down 33 percent in October and Western stock markets continue the downward spiral initiated by the credit crisis. 
 While corporate credit, currencies and stocks are in trouble, government bonds are still strong. That's a relief, since the markets are turning to the world's governments to do something to stabilize lending between banks and corporations and, now, international cash flows. 
 To stop the currency panic, the world's governments should work together to set and then defend target exchange rates. That will probably require countries with big reserves of foreign currency, like China or Japan, to deploy some of the cash for the greater global good, and overspending countries like the United States and Britain to accept devaluations and lower standards of living. 
 It won't be easy, but the alternative -- a breakdown in the global trade system -- would be far worse.
 Cut the Carry Trade
 The expansion of the crisis from credit to foreign exchange has made even clearer the dangers of some types of speculation. In particular, the currency carry trade has been shown up as most unhealthy. 
 The practice of borrowing in currencies made cheap by low interest rates, like the yen, and investing in high-yield currencies like emerging markets works wonderfully so long as times are good. Speculators don't just benefit from this difference in interest rates, they can also enjoy a capital gain as the assets they jump into rise in value. 
 But when the market turns and the herd stampedes for the exit, capital gains turn into losses. That's what is happening now. The sharp rise in the yen and, to a lesser extent the dollar, is forcing speculators to repay their hard-currency loans before the currency mismatch sinks them, with the effect of whipsawing emerging market economies. . 
 For speculators, this painful lesson is ultimately salutary. Once burned to a crisp, many times shy. But the collateral damage is more distressing. 
 The banks that lent to the carry traders suffer. Investors like pension funds and insurers who hold the assets now being dumped by carry traders find the value of these assets are falling dangerously close to their liabilities. Exporters who sell goods in rising currencies -- most obviously Japanese companies -- face a huge squeeze on profits. 
 The currency rebalance should lead to an economic catharsis. The rise in the yen could help rebalance world trade, although the rise in the dollar works in the opposite direction. Certainly, countries like Britain, with its yawning current account deficit, could benefit from a cheaper pound. 
 That said, this is hardly the moment for the global financial system to face more big losses, more runs on financial assets and, in response, more government capital injections for banks and perhaps insurers. 
 However this crisis pans out, one thing should be clear: Huge currency speculation of the kind that made the currency carry trade a cornerstone of global finance in recent years is highly destabilizing. When this crisis is over, the authorities should aim to reduce it.

HEADLINE: Bracing for Bad Days, Operas and Orchestras Batten Down Hatches

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
No clowns in Detroit, no pops in Pasadena.
 Michigan Opera Theater has canceled a production of Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci'' because of the economy's southward plunge. The Pasadena Symphony Orchestra has abandoned plans for three pops concerts. 
 As it has everywhere else these days, the economic crisis has hit classical music, a particularly fragile corner of the nonprofit world that depends as much on donations as on ticket sales. Most managers are only in the fretting stage, but the plunge in stock prices, the credit squeeze and feelings of diminished wealth among donors and ticket buyers have begun to have concrete effects in a few places.
 Orchestras and opera companies are cutting costs, eliminating rehearsals and keeping a tighter rein on overtime. New York City Opera, already walloped by a canceled season because of renovations to its house, gave employees two days off this month because of a payroll crunch. The Metropolitan Opera is making cutbacks in its health insurance for administrative staff. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra has been hit by increased borrowing costs. The Pasadena Symphony Orchestra has also canceled its next symphony concert, which was to have taken place next month. 
 ''It hurts a lot,'' said Tom O'Connor, the executive director of the Orchestras of Pasadena, which includes the symphony and the pops. ''But I've been in the business almost 40 years. You just have to think imaginatively: how can we make sure music is always available to people in one form or another?''
 In the opera world, some companies have reduced the draw on their endowment that helps pay for operations, said Marc A. Scorca, the president and chief executive of Opera America, an association of 114 companies. And at some houses, donors are asking for more time to fulfill multiyear pledges.
 ''These are facts which are just flowing in,'' Mr. Scorca said. ''Everyone is examining every expenditure to see if there's a more economical way to move forward. It's so hard to know how it's going to play out, because it's so early in season.''
 The situation is particularly dire in Detroit, where each season Michigan Opera usually presents five productions, with five or six performances each.
 In addition to canceling ''Pagliacci'' next spring, the company is letting three employees go, giving up on a big Wagner production next year in favor of the less financially taxing ''Don Giovanni'' and doing without the final performance in an April run of Donizetti's ''Elixir of Love.'' That performance had been scheduled to take place at the same time as a Final Four game of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, at nearby Ford Field. Management thinks it can make more money renting out its parking lot to fans.
 ''The community is hurting so badly, particularly the corporations, and also a lot of our individuals,'' said David DiChiera, the company's general director. ''They're not even quite sure of the value of their portfolio. It makes giving worrisome on their part.''
 Mr. DiChiera said that the only fiscally prudent thing to do to keep the budget balanced was to cancel next spring's ''Pagliacci,'' for a saving of up to $500,000. ''I'd rather just not do a production rather than jeopardize the standard and quality of the production itself,'' he said. That is the mantra of music administrators: Do not damage the musical product.
 Peter Gelb, the Metropolitan Opera's general manager, said in a memorandum to his staff that the company was looking at many ways to control costs ''without affecting the quality of productions.'' The measures could include cutting travel and entertainment expenses and overtime, he said. 
 For now, Mr. Gelb said, ticket sales are slightly up over last year. ''It is likely that ticket sales will be affected'' by the financial crisis, he said. ''We anticipate that our fund-raising will also suffer.''
 In an interview last week, Mr. Gelb said the Met was still expecting to break even this season, after an $11 million deficit last year. He said most of that deficit had been expected under a five-year-old economic plan.
 He added that the Met was trying to save money by scheduling rehearsals more efficiently and cutting production costs in ways unnoticeable to the audience, like using less expensive costume material or outsourcing the making of costumes.
 The full picture of the effects on fund-raising will become clearer toward the end of the year, when many donations are made for tax planning reasons and after bonuses are bestowed.
 In Pasadena, where there are about eight concerts a year, matters were all too clear this month. The orchestra's endowment had dipped below the original $5.8 million gift that established it, so according to its rules no money could be drawn off to finance operations, Mr. O'Connor of the Orchestras of Pasadena said. The endowment's high point a few years ago was $8.3 million. Several donors also said they could not give as much because of hits to their portfolios, he said. 
 Some of the larger orchestras are holding their own for now. The Philadelphia Orchestra recently said it had surpassed by $5 million its goal of raising $125 million for the endowment. But the endowment's overall market value dropped to $160 million at the end of September from a recent peak of $220 million, the orchestra said.
 Subscription sales are slightly down, but single-ticket sales remain strong, said the orchestra's president and chief executive, James Undercofler. He said the orchestra had reduced spending as much as possible. ''There are further cuts you can make, but they start to injure the mission of the organization,'' he said. 
 In July, Mr. Undercofler said the orchestra had canceled a European tour in the summer of 2009 because of high costs and weak corporate support. 
 The New York Philharmonic's endowment has also dropped, to $178 million on Sept. 30 from $205 million on June 30, the orchestra said. The endowment value that is used to calculate the draw is generally based on the average performance over three years, so the impact of the recent downturn is blunted. 
 Zarin Mehta, the Philharmonic's president, said on Monday that no concrete steps had yet been taken to deal with the crisis, which he said was sure to have an effect. ''We're looking to see how we're going to tighten our belts,'' he said.
 The Chicago Symphony last week disclosed its financial results for last season, reporting a modest surplus, strong fund- raising and increased ticket sales, but cited higher costs for outstanding bonds issued for the renovation of Symphony Center.
 In contrast to the grim economic times, the Chicago Symphony's news release had an exultant tone. It cited the orchestra's ''extraordinary artistic and financial successes,'' its ''remarkable achievements'' and a ''new era in the history of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.''

HEADLINE: Once the Star, Now the Stand-In

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

DATELINE: ASHBURN, Va. 

 BODY:
As Shaun Alexander entered the Redskins' locker room last week, the team announced that its star running back was available for interviews outside.
 Alexander turned left and headed for his locker, while a mad scramble of reporters rushed past him to talk to Clinton Portis. The procession provided a glimpse at Alexander's new reality: That used to be him, the in-demand superstar, the face of a team and a city.
 Not even three years ago, Alexander set the single-season N.F.L. record for touchdowns, won the league's Most Valuable Player award and helped lead the Seattle Seahawks to their first Super Bowl.
 He had everything, the fat contract and the Madden video-game cover and more touchdowns than room for footballs in his trophy case. Then everything fell apart. 
 Alexander remembers clearly the beginning of the end. Dropped for a loss midway through last season, en route to the huddle in the stadium that was not filled when he arrived in 2000 and was now sold out for every game, he heard an unfamiliar sound.
 ''Boooooo!'' Alexander recalled last week, cupping his hands over his mouth in imitation.
 The Seahawks dumped him in the spring, and he started this season unemployed. During the first month, while working out at the University of Washington, he remained certain that at least one team would offer him a second chance.
 When September ended without an offer, Alexander noticed people looking at him in a way no one had before. He has always been lauded for his vision, and when he looked into the eyes of total strangers in the weight room, he saw pity and confusion.
 Using a biblical analogy, he told his wife: ''Sweetie, I feel like Noah when he was building his ark. No one understands. Because, you know, in my life it has never rained. Deep down inside, I know I'm going to play again.''
 So here Shaun Alexander finds himself chasing his fellow backup Rock Cartwright for playing time instead of chasing Hall of Fame running backs in the record books. He is healthy for the first time since 2005, but shunned by the league he once dominated. He is neither mad at his former team nor desperate on his current one. He is perhaps in denial about the way things ended in Seattle, though he is far from bitter.
 Alexander is back in football, back in the familiarity of the locker room. But everything is different now, as evidenced by his first two games, in which he gained 19 yards on nine carries.
 ''It's crazy, only because people had such high expectations,'' he said. ''There was nothing else I could do except for rush for 2,000 yards and score 30 touchdowns. Otherwise, I was a failure.''
 It was Alexander who raised those expectations in the first place. His 2005 season was like a fairy tale, said Redskins Coach Jim Zorn.
 Zorn was in charge of Seattle's quarterbacks then, and he watched as the team's pass-happy head coach, Mike Holmgren, changed his offense for Alexander, who scored 28 touchdowns that season and gained 1,880 rushing yards.
 The Seahawks were in the middle of a run of four consecutive division championships. They won their first playoff game in 20 years. They went into Green Bay in January 2004 and nearly knocked off the Packers, losing in overtime. And after that game, Alexander said he thought to himself, ''We're going to the Super Bowl.''
 After they did, and after Alexander had won so many awards he lost track of them, something changed. He said it was the expectations. Zorn said that explanation was too simple.
 ''If you don't pay attention to your career, it can slip,'' he said. ''So did Shaun not pay attention? I don't know. But he did slip.''
 Nothing was ever simple with Alexander in Seattle. Some said he never ran hard enough, that he always went down too easily before contact. Teammates grumbled about his practice habits and the way he smiled after losses. Even when Alexander won the M.V.P. award, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and the best offensive line in football were mentioned as the reasons he excelled.
 Asked if Alexander took an unfair portion of the criticism, Stump Mitchell, his running backs coach then and now, said, ''Yeah, he did.''
 The end came quickly for the 31-year-old Alexander, the same as it does for so many running backs when they hit 30.
 He broke his left foot in 2006 and his left wrist in 2007. He played last season in ''agonizing'' pain, he said, as doctors realigned the wrist each week and wrapped it like a club.
 While showing the three-inch scar that runs across the wrist, Alexander said he ran the ball last season essentially with one hand, behind an injured line, in an offense that was pass-happy once again, while splitting carries for the first time since he had backed up Ricky Watters early in his career.
 ''It's one of those weird things,'' he said. ''If you complain about it, you're not a team player. If you let it go, then they think either you don't care or something's wrong with you.''
 Told of this theory, Zorn partly agreed but said: ''Repeating that '05 season would have been hard. And he just seemed to either not have the knack, or he seemed to take a view of, 'Hey, listen, when the hole's there, I'm going to run through, but if the hole's not there, you might as well go and call the next play.'
 ''Shaun didn't have a great work ethic in Seattle,'' Zorn added. ''He didn't. He said he felt practice was for everybody else.''
 The Seahawks acquired running backs Julius Jones and T. J. Duckett in the off-season, confirming their movement in another direction. Alexander said he held no ill feelings, that he did not get into ''war and paybacks and all that.''
 He spent the first six weeks of the season out of football. Workouts with Detroit, Cincinnati and New Orleans came and went. 
 The Redskins called after an injury to the backup Ladell Betts, reuniting Alexander with Zorn and Mitchell and left tackle Chris Samuels. A painting of Alexander and Samuels from their Alabama days hangs in Alexander's living room.
 ''He really has a lot of want-to right now,'' Zorn said. ''He's got some things he's trying to prove to himself.''
 The stay may be temporary; Betts is expected to return from injury this month. For now, it just feels strange. Alexander sometimes catches himself walking by a mirror, the red elbow pads and different colors stopping him cold. They remind him of his place.
 He has been a backup before, in high school and in college and even with the Seahawks. 
 ''People want to make it bigger than it is,'' he said. ''But really, it's just same old, same old. I go somewhere, there aren't high expectations, then I raise the bar. Usually, I graduate.''
 Even now, Alexander does not lack for confidence. The toothy grin remains, same as always, despite the fall and the boos and the harsh reality of the present. Asked for his plans should this stint with the Redskins end in the next few weeks, Alexander smiled wide.
 ''I think I'll probably run for president,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Denmark Is Rethinking Its Spurning of the Euro

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

 BODY:
Denmark may be a small, out-of-the-way European nation, but as the first country to guarantee the deposits and liabilities of all its banks, its experience is sobering. 
 Denmark has discovered that ice-cold credit markets cannot warm up without easing elsewhere in the global financial system. And the same may prove true not just of smaller nations, but even some of the largest ones, including the United States, Japan and Britain. 
 ''This is a global phenomenon,'' said Tonny Andersen, the chief financial officer of Danske Bank, which is based in Copenhagen. ''The unfreezing will be challenging.'' 
 The Danish Parliament approved a blanket guarantee for all bank deposits and other liabilities on Oct. 10, well before the United States and other European countries acted in bold, but somewhat more limited, ways. The intent in Copenhagen was to deliver an immediate lift to credit markets by demonstrating an ironclad consensus to support Danish banks. 
 Initially, it did not work. 
 The Danish experience has underscored what American and European governments achieved with monumental bailout packages for banks -- and what they did not. 
 Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, said in a report after the bailout packages were passed that the disintegration of the financial system had been avoided. Economies would not go off a ''credit cliff,'' but neither would bank lending resume quickly.
 Denmark, a sometimes skeptical member of the European Union that has so far refused to abandon its krone for the euro, is also finding out how difficult it can be to go it alone. 
 On Monday, the National Bank of Denmark and the European Central Bank cemented the latest in a string of global currency swap agreements, emergency measures aimed at replacing a currency market that has seized up. The European Central Bank in Frankfurt will provide Denmark 12 billion euros ''as long as needed,'' the two central banks said in a statement. 
 Denmark already has a swap line worth $15 billion with the Federal Reserve. 
 During the tumultuous week after the Dutch Parliament approved the bank deposit guarantee -- and in which European countries and the United States struggled to find their responses to the crisis -- Danish lending rates barely budged. 
 After the guarantee went into law, Danske Bank found things were marginally better, Mr. Andersen said. It attracted $1 billion in loans from American institutional investors, and sold $500 million in commercial paper, a form of short-term debt, in the United States. Mr. Andersen also hit the road to sell the Danish guarantee package. Giving in to the inevitable Shakespearean image, his presentation used a picture of a man peering at a skull and the caption, ''Something rotten in the state of Denmark?'' His answer was no. 
 His argument -- and that of Dutch authorities -- is that though property prices are falling, particularly around red-hot Copenhagen, strict underwriting standards have protected banks from the heavy losses of the sort linked to subprime lending in the United States. A 200-year-old system of standardizing and securitizing mortgages has kept the Danish market liquid, again in contrast to American mortgage-backed bonds. 
 The best explanation for the tight Danish credit market now, analysts said, is unreasonable fear. ''It's the lack of risk appetite,'' said Peter Lauridsen, head of foreign exchange in Copenhagen at SEB, the large Scandinavian bank, ''which sounds stupid, since there is simply no risk right now in Denmark.'' 
 With the bank guarantees, the only additional risk investors might fear is a depreciation of the krone against other currencies. 
 The globalization of financial markets, currency swap contracts -- which allow investors to exchange one denomination for another and match the transaction to the maturity of their loan -- has lubricated global lending among banks. 
 In the last five years, Danish banks have generally lent about $83.5 billion more than they have received in deposits, forcing them to go to international capital markets to meet their needs. Typically, markets have been happy to oblige the creditworthy Danes. 
 But the volatility in currency markets has led to a freeze on one ''leg'' -- whether euro or dollar -- of the Danish krone swap market. To unblock this conduit for interbank lending, the European Central Bank furnished euros to ensure that anyone who lends to Danish banks can convert their krone back into the world's second-most popular currency. 
 That the Danish central bank is firmly committed to keeping the country's currency in lockstep with the euro -- and has raised interest rates twice in a single month to prove the point -- matters little to panicky markets. 
 The current turmoil is playing into the hands of the Danish leaders who say they believe that the time has come to jettison the krone in favor of the euro. 
 Danish bankers said they would be among the first to vote yes. 
 A poll published by Danske showed that a bare majority of Danes -- 50.1 percent -- back euro adoption. A month ago, partisans of the krone had the upper hand. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 29, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about Denmark's rethinking of its decision to keep its own currency rather than adopt the euro attributed two government actions incorrectly. It was the Danish Parliament that approved a guarantee of bank deposits on Oct. 10, not the Dutch Parliament. And it was Danish authorities -- not Dutch authorities -- who argued that Denmark's strict underwriting standards had protected its banks from heavy losses.

HEADLINE: Martian Life Eats Parking Spaces

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ, NATE SCHWEBER and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
MARTIAN LIFE EATS PARKING SPACES
For some New Yorkers, the news that an American remake of an award-winning British television series was being shot in their neighborhood might be cause for celebration. But residents of the Amalgamated Houses, a sprawling cooperative in the northwest Bronx, are indignant about the loss of almost 400 on-street parking spaces on Monday and Tuesday, caused by the taping of ABC's ''Life on Mars'' in their otherwise quiet neighborhood. 
The Amalgamated is home to more than a few old-time lefties and activists, and the residents did not take the loss meekly. Upon learning of the shoot on Thursday, they began lobbying local politicians and officials for a quick fix and got permission to park on Goulden Avenue, a desolate stretch between the reservoir and DeWitt Clinton High School, with a security guard and a shuttle service provided by the co-op.
In a statement, 20th Century Fox Television, which produces the show with ABC, said: ''We apologize if our activities have had an adverse impact on any citizen's daily life.''
Joanna Jacker, 31, a location assistant for ''Life on Mars,'' said the show was taping a scene at a house on a block with several Amalgamated buildings and another in Van Cortlandt Park.
ABC applied for permission to close off the area to make it easier to move equipment between the sites and to provide more space for the '70s-era cars used to evoke that period. The show is about a homicide detective who finds himself transported back to the 1970s after a car accident.
''Actually, we're not taking up that much space,'' Ms. Jacker said. ''You should check out 'Ugly Betty' today.'' (That series, also produced by ABC, is taping in the Gramercy Park area.) She added, ''The problem is really that people don't have enough parking.''
Cecilia Greene, 75, a retired waitress who has lived in the co-op for 20 years, said she called 311 to complain.
''This is very undemocratic,'' she said. ''This is an imposition. We don't live on Mars.''

HEADLINE: Hunter School of Social Work Moving to Quarters in East Harlem

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
With the help of the largest gift ever to the City University of New York, the Hunter College School of Social Work is moving uptown. The school will trade its tower on East 79th Street for a new $135 million building 39 blocks to the north in East Harlem. 
 In a multiparty real estate deal of byzantine complexity, the school's current building will be sold, and $40 million of the proceeds, along with state construction funds, will be used for the larger, eight-story school building uptown. The graduate school, with 930 students, has occupied the building at 129 East 79th Street since 1969. 
 ''We had to move out of the physical structure that didn't work for us anymore,'' said Jennifer J. Raab, president of Hunter College. ''Now we'll have a building to match our vision for the 21st century.'' 
 The new school, to be called the Lois V. and Samuel J. Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College, after its benefactors, will be at Third Avenue from 118th Street to 119th Street, stretching west toward Lexington Avenue. The parcel now consists of a vacant lot and low-rise buildings; there are no residential tenants, Ms. Raab said. Small stores and restaurants on the site will be demolished. 
 Harlem is ''exactly the right place in the city to build the school,'' said Matthew Goldstein, the university chancellor. ''Many of our students live in the Harlem area, and our faculty members are connected with Harlem and will be working with organizations that reside there. It made a tremendous amount of sense.'' 
 As the city's only public school for graduate training in social work, Hunter, with its $7,500 tuition, ''will be very attractive to students in the community,'' Dr. Goldstein said. 
 The school's current building, leased by Hunter, was built and expanded with $5.675 million from the Lois and Samuel J. Silberman Fund. The Silbermans retained ownership of the land and tower in conjunction with the New York Community Trust, a nonprofit organization that oversees charitable gifts. 
 The trust and the Silbermans, after working out the plan in secrecy, have signed an agreement to sell the current school's land and building for $65 million to a private developer, Daniel Brodsky of the Brodsky Organization. They are to donate $40 million of that to help pay for construction of the new school; the university's largest previous gift was $30 million for its Honors College in 2006. 
 Under a separate agreement, Mr. Brodsky will build the social work school at the new property and deliver it at cost, though he will receive a lump-sum fee for administrative expenses. 
 The developer can then build on the 79th Street site, subject to approval by the New York City Planning Commission. Ms. Raab said that the deal was structured so the developer would have to complete the school before building on the 79th Street property, an incentive to rapid construction. 
 The remaining $95 million for the new building will come from state education funds appropriated last spring. The leftover $25 million paid to the Silberman fund for the current building will be used to establish a program of social work grants ''in perpetuity,'' said Lorie A. Slutsky, president of the community trust. 
 The developer and his brokers found the property for the new building in East Harlem, and the university bought it for $23.5 million, closing on the land earlier this month. All stakeholders in the deal -- the most complex the university has ever undertaken, according to Iris Weinshall, the school's vice chancellor for facilities planning, construction and management -- said it was not likely to be affected by the Wall Street crisis. Dr. Goldstein said he was confident that the project would go ahead because the $95 million from the state had already been appropriated. 
 And J. Dean Amro, a partner at the Brodsky Organization, said he did not foresee financing difficulties ''because we are good for the $65 million; we are not borrowing any money.''
 The Brodsky Organization has built, owns or manages 60 buildings in Manhattan, and has previously developed properties with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, the General Theological Seminary and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. 
 The community trust chose Mr. Brodsky because he was the highest bidder and ''he has a good reputation and is civic-minded,'' Ms. Slutsky said. Increasingly, Manhattan nonprofit groups have been involving developers in projects around the city. 
 On Tuesday, for example, St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan is to seek approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for a plan to build a $1.6-billion medical tower and condominium that would require the demolition of five buildings in the Greenwich Village Historic District.
 Mr. Brodsky is paying a premium price for the building on 79th Street -- nearly $650 a square foot, according to Mr. Amro, who added, ''We think that it is one of the great sites available on the Upper East Side.'' 
 The new school will be built to the specifications of the university by the architect Cooper, Robertson & Partners, designer of the 2004 Columbia University School of Social Work. 
 A dozen developers were informed about the project but only several made bids because of the stipulation that they could not build on the 79th Street property for about three years after buying it, when the new school was occupied. They would also have to accept state-mandated construction and bidding rules required by the university.
 The future building will devote about 10 percent of its space to the university's new School of Public Health, which will share a library and other resources with the School of Social Work. 
 The university, which will not seek any zoning variances to build the new school, expects construction to begin this summer and hopes for completion by June 2011. The 142,000-square-foot building will have five large floors topped by three smaller floors set back, and will exceed the size of the current school by more than 32,000 square feet. 
 Unlike the current building, with its massive gray stone front, the new school is to have a large glass exposure on Third Avenue as well as community spaces and a public cafe. ''The building will be physically welcoming,'' Ms. Raab said, praising the community trust and the Silbermans for being the catalyst for the deal. 
 The new school ''will be a bright spot for the city's future in what could be a difficult economic time,'' said Jayne M. Silberman, vice chairwoman of the Silberman fund. 
 As for the 79th Street site, Mr. Amro said that the Brodsky firm would most likely not have to seek zoning changes for a new residential building there -- probably a luxury condominium. The current 10-story school rises to a height equivalent to that of an 18-story apartment building.
 ''We want to build an old-world-style residential building that would fit into its surroundings,'' Mr. Amro said. 
 Mr. Silberman, a former president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York in the 1960s, died in 2000 at the age of 84. His wife, Lois, 87, termed the deal ''something he would have loved.'' 
 Mr. Silberman was a fixture at the school in his later years, spending time with students and faculty members. ''He had a passion,'' Ms. Slutsky said, ''to ensure that there would be a first-rate public social work school for the City of New York.'' 
 By law, the state attorney general and the State Supreme Court must approve the trust's sale of the current school, since the principal assets of the Silberman fund -- the building and land -- will be sold. ''We are confident it will be approved,'' said Jane L. Wilton, the general counsel of the community trust.

HEADLINE: Study Notes Fewer Loans To Hispanics And Blacks

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
The number of new mortgages to blacks and Hispanics fell sharply in New York City in 2007, while staying flat for white borrowers and -- surprisingly -- rising for Asian-Americans, according to an analysis of federal mortgage data released on Monday by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. 
 As a result, the racial breakdown of home buyers in New York City changed significantly during the period studied, which predated the financial turmoil in the markets this year. 
 The city as a whole saw a 14 percent decline in new mortgages from 2006 to 2007, compared with 25 percent for the country as a whole. And almost all of the decline in New York was due to a shutdown in subprime mortgages, which can come with higher interest rates, fees and penalties and which accounted for nearly a quarter of all new mortgages in the city in 2006. Prime mortgage borrowing rates barely dropped. 
 The reduction in new home loans was due largely to a drop in the number of applications, as the rate of denial both in New York City, 27 percent, and across the country, 19 percent, stayed more or less the same.
 An analysis last year found that predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods in New York City were more likely to get their mortgages in 2006 from a subprime lender than home buyers in white neighborhoods with similar income levels.
 As a result, they have been disproportionately hit by tightening subprime credit markets. Mortgages given to black borrowers in New York City saw a 44 percent drop, while those to Hispanics saw a 34 percent drop. In contrast, the number of white borrowers barely decreased in 2007, and the number of Asian-American borrowers increased by 6 percent.
 But even excluding subprime mortgages, the divergent race trends are reflected among prime loans. The number of prime home loans awarded to black and Hispanic borrowers fell by 23 percent and 15 percent, respectively, in 2007, while the number of prime loans issued to white borrowers rose by 4 percent and to Asians by 18 percent.
 ''Traditionally, homeownership has been the way to build wealth and to give the next generation a leg up,'' said Vicki L. Been, director of the Furman Center. ''The issue of the disparity in the racial and ethnic groups in homeownership has always been an issue of great concern. We had seen improvement and now are seeing reversals of those improvements.''
 Black and Hispanic homeownership in the city had increased sharply in the last decade. In 1996, only about one in four of all New York City home purchase loans were issued to black and Hispanic borrowers; by 2006, those loans accounted for nearly 40 percent, largely due to a disproportionate reliance on risky borrowing.
 As a result, the racial makeup of purchasers has changed. In 2007, whites accounted for half of all home purchases in New York City while Asians accounted for nearly a quarter. In contrast, blacks dropped to 12.9 percent of home purchases in 2007 from 19.7 percent in 2006. Hispanics dropped to 12.5 percent from 16.4 percent.
 ''We don't know what else is coming,'' Professor Been said. ''These were 2006, 2007 numbers. We could be in for a serious falls here, a serious backsliding.''
 Rates of subprime mortgage borrowing have varied nationwide, but they are also unusually concentrated in black and Hispanic neighborhoods. In 2006, blacks were 2.3 times more likely, and Hispanics twice as likely, to get high-cost loans as whites, after adjusting for loan amounts and the income of the borrowers, according to an analysis of loans reported under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 
 The popularity of subprime mortgages has varied among different city neighborhoods. Among the boroughs, the Bronx saw the steepest drop in the number of new loans, at 24.9, percent, followed by Queens at 21.5 percent; Brooklyn, 18.3 percent; Staten Island 11.3 percent; and Manhattan, 11.6 percent.

HEADLINE: In Afghanistan, the Loudest Sound Is the Clock Ticking

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
In early September Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the House Armed Services Committee on the difficulties American forces face in Afghanistan. ''It is my professional opinion that no amount of troops, in no amount of time, can ever achieve all the objectives we seek in Afghanistan,'' he said. ''Frankly, we're running out of time.'' 
 To watch ''The War Briefing,'' a ''Frontline'' documentary to be shown on Tuesday on most PBS stations, is to feel vividly the ticking of the clock. 
 Rigorously reported and somberly produced, ''The War Briefing'' is both a diagrammatic explanation of everything that has gone wrong over the past few years and a grim visual tour of a landscape that nature itself seems to have made impervious to the ambitions of outside occupiers. Factually the film reprises recent news reports (and includes commentary by journalists like Dexter Filkins of The New York Times) but at the same time it palpably delivers a sense of our narrowing options.
 The film begins with ''Frontline'' reporters embedded with the Bravo Company, an Army unit battling assaults nearly every day in the Korengal River valley in northeastern Afghanistan. The territory is so vast, rugged and labyrinthine that Churchill, traveling with the British Army as a reporter in 1897, wrote it off as unconquerable. Soldiers live the horror and frustration of the maze, often unable to see the enemy. 
 ''You can't really pinpoint them,'' one soldier says. ''You just got to keep on scanning, keep your head on a swivel.''
 The chilling effect of ''The War Briefing'' is to make American efforts in Afghanistan seem at once essential and futile, at least within the next few years. Military resources have been diverted from the war in Iraq -- a country smaller than Afghanistan with four times the number of troops -- but while both presidential candidates have committed to sending more forces to Afghanistan, commanders and analysts tell ''Frontline'' that extra support alone won't sufficiently reduce violence or curtail the growth of terrorist strongholds in the region. 
 The government of President Hamid Karzai has been weak and largely ineffectual in expanding infrastructure and economic opportunity, the documentary points out. The border with Pakistan is porous and unmanageable, and it is in the tribal regions of Pakistan where Al Qaeda sanctuaries are thriving. Footage of the tribal violence in the border territory is gruesome (the results of a beheading are in full view) and more harrowing still, given the absence of bloody images of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as regular features of the evening news.
 Moreover, the film makes it clear that seemingly sound tactical strategies in Afghanistan have only had the effect of belying larger goals. The terrain has made a heavy ground war next to impossible. But the air strikes mean heightened civilian casualties that, in turn, breed distrust, which makes necessary humanitarian efforts harder to achieve. ''I don't think that even the little kids like us,'' one American soldier says in the film. ''We try to help them out.''
 The past year has been the deadliest yet for coalition forces in Afghanistan since the American-led invasion in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Emboldened by a flourishing opium trade, Taliban fighters have regrouped with the aid of Arab, Chechen and Uzbek militants traveling to the Afghan-Pakistani border and guiding the Taliban in advanced command strategies. And suicide bombings and roadside killings have increased, making once reasonably safe parts of the country outside Kabul now unviable. 
 As Michael Scheuer, a news analyst formerly with the C.I.A., puts it in the film: ''We now have a country that's infested with everything from the Taliban and Al Qaeda on the insurgency side, to bandits and warlords and narcotics traffickers. So you're really fighting a beast with 100 heads.'' And apparently we are fighting it with fewer than a handful of swords.

HEADLINE: Another Donation For Oklahoma State

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The billionaire T. Boone Pickens will give another $63 million to Oklahoma State to finish athletic projects that were supposed to be paid for with a $165 million donation that took a hit during the economic downturn. Pickens's $165 million donation, announced in January 2006, was the largest gift to a college athletic program. He intended to increase it through his investments so it would pay for an estimated $420 million in renovations and new construction on the campus. That plan was going smoothly until Pickens's BP Capital energy encountered financial trouble in recent months.
 The university said last week that considerable funds remained despite reports that the money had been largely or entirely lost.

HEADLINE: A Scramble to Aid World Economies

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; Bettina Wassener and Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Policy makers around the world, unnerved by the relentless sell-off of shares, scrambled to support their economies on Monday. 
 In South Korea, the central bank, at an emergency meeting, slashed its key rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 4.25 percent. The bank also announced that it would further shore up local banks by buying their domestic bonds.
 The Australian central bank intervened in the currency markets for a second day by buying Australian dollars to prop up the exchange rate. The Bank of Israel lowered interest rates by a quarter of a point, and the Bank of Canada said that it would add 6 billion Canadian dollars, or $4.7 billion, in liquidity to that country's markets. 
 In Japan, Prime Minister Taro Aso said the government would expand a program that gave banks access to public funds and would strengthen regulation of the short-selling of shares. But that was not enough to head off another sharp slide in shares in Tokyo. 
 In Europe, with evidence mounting that the Continent is lurching into a recession, the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said it was possible that the bank would lower interest rates for a second time in as many months, after making its first move alongside other central banks on Oct. 8.
 ''It is not a certainty, it is a possibility,'' Mr. Trichet said.
 Despite the careful qualification, central bank watchers are now virtually certain that the bank will cut its benchmark rate, now at 3.75 percent, by half of a percentage point when it meets on Nov. 6.
 That move looks set to be part of a broad, global easing of interest rates over the next week, with the Federal Reserve this week and the Bank of England next also likely to lower borrowing costs.
 After worrying over the summer mainly about brisk inflation and rising commodity prices, central banks have shifted their focus to heading off a global economic slowdown. 
 In Germany, thus far one of the more resilient European economies, a closely watched gauge of business confidence skidded to its lowest level since the recession of the early 1990s. 
 German companies began the year hoping that thriving business in emerging markets like China and Russia would cushion the downturn in the United States, but are now finding there is nowhere to hide from shrinking sales.
 ''The German economy will be hit very hard by the deterioration in the global economy and worsening financial conditions,'' said Jacques Cailloux, chief Europe economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in London. 
 Japan also has been suffering from the recent surge of the yen against other leading currencies. That brought a statement by the Group of 7 industrialized countries that it was ''concerned about the recent excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen and its possible adverse implications for economic and financial stability.'' The group said it would ''monitor the markets closely and cooperate as appropriate.''
 The statement was a rare example of the group's singling out a currency for comment and was widely interpreted as an indication that policy makers might take stronger measures to halt the yen's rise. 
 The Japanese currency's gains have accelerated in the last week -- rising 10 percent against the dollar -- threatening to destabilize global financial markets.
 The yen's rise has hit the export industry, forcing corporate giants like Sony and Canon to slash their earnings forecasts as their goods become more expensive in the crucial markets in Europe and the United States.
 ''Many of the leading companies in the world's second-largest economy are getting slaughtered as a result,'' said Dwyfor Evans, strategist at State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong.
 Like Japan, South Korea is heavily dependent on exports and suffers from a slowdown in the United States. 
 The government of President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea has had limited success in containing what analysts have termed a ''crisis of trust.'' The government has stressed that South Korea has $240 billion of currency reserves, more than enough to pay all the country's short-term foreign debts, and that its companies and banks are more competitive than 10 years ago.
 ''The rate cut could help boost the domestic economy and ease the liquidity problem in a long term,'' Goh You-sun, a senior economist at Daewoo Securities in Seoul, said. 
 The stigma the country suffered when it received a bailout in 1997, as well as its recent current-account deficit, apparently have helped prompt foreign investors to flee the country's stock market, Mr. Goh said.

HEADLINE: Sense of Calm Is Swept Away in the Final Minutes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM. 
Carter Dougherty and David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At 3:50 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was nearly flat for the day, an encouraging end to a volatile session and, perhaps, a sign that some manner of relief had started to come to Wall Street.
 Ten minutes later, the Dow was down 203.18 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had dropped 3.2 percent. Stocks that had soared earlier were flashing red. And investors were left to ponder the remains of another lost day. 
 ''That was a little weird,'' Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P., said, moments after the market skidded at 20 points a minute. ''Usually, you get a sense of it in the last hour or half-hour, not the last 5 or 10 minutes.''
 But, he added, stocks may now be in a permanent state of anything goes.
 ''In some ways you can say, 'Are you really surprised?' '' Mr. Stovall said. ''It's been engaging in this kind of slithering pattern for a while.''
 The Dow spent the day reeling across a 450-point range, plunging at the open after sell-offs in Europe and Asia, recovering after an encouraging report on sales of new homes, and then falling again for reasons few analysts felt they could explain. The index finished at 8,175.77.
 Floating around the market were the usual fears about recession and corporate earnings. Volume was relatively light on Monday, which means big trades from a small group of investors could have swung the overall market. And some observers suggested that major players like mutual funds and hedge funds may have been forced to sell shares to meet redemption requests from skittish clients.
 ''None of us can prove it at the present time, but based on the behavior of the market and what you hear anecdotally from traders, you get the sense there are still margin calls and liquidations from funds that push this market to the downside,'' said David Kovacs, quantitative strategist at Turner Investment Partners. 
 Even so, as the sun began to set on Lower Manhattan on Monday, it had seemed as if investors would eke out a flat close. Instead, shares of regional banks, which had been bolstered by news of new capital injections from the Treasury Department, fell back. Energy shares dropped after oil fell by nearly $1 to $63.22 a barrel, the lowest price in 18 months. Twenty-seven of the Dow 30 declined.
 Analysts hoped that the sell-off did not reflect widespread sentiment, noting that many investors kept their cash out of the market on Monday as they awaited an important week of news on the financial front. Federal Reserve policy makers convene on Tuesday for a two-day meeting that will culminate in an interest rate decision Wednesday afternoon. Investors are betting that the Fed will lower rates. 
 On Thursday, the government will release its first estimate for economic growth from July to September, a number that many expect will be negative.
 On Tuesday the Case-Shiller home price index will be issued, a closely watched report on the state of the housing market. Its condition is considered crucial to the revival of the American economy.
 Some of that tension was momentarily eased by a Commerce Department report on sales of newly constructed homes, which rose 2.7 percent in September, rising to an annual rate of 464,000. The rise was more than economists had expected. All of the gains came in Southern and Western states.
 The supply of new homes on the market also fell from August, but economists warned that prices would have to drop further before inventories could be significantly improved.
 ''The supply of homes for sale is declining rapidly due to the combination of aggressive construction cutbacks and a pickup in sales prompted by price reductions,'' Mike Larson, a real estate analyst at Weiss Research, wrote. But he warned that the credit problems stemming from the financial crisis could have a chilling effect on the market in the near future.
 The sell-off continued in early trading Tuesday in most Asian markets. After falling 6.4 percent to its lowest level since October 1982 on Monday, the Nikkei index in Tokyo was down another percentage point on Tuesday.
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which lost more than 12 percent on Monday, rebounded and was up about 3 percent Tuesday.
 Stocks in Europe finished lower on Monday but pared early losses. The FTSE 100 index in London lost 0.8 percent; the CAC 40 in Paris was down 3.9 percent; and the DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.9 percent. 
 Borrowing rates among banks fell over the weekend. The Fed also began its new program to purchase commercial paper, one of the central bank's efforts to unlock the flow of credit. The Fed said it would charge relatively low rates to buy what amount to short-term i.o.u.'s used by businesses and banks. The actions are intended to add liquidity to a market that had been nearly frozen in the last few weeks. 
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bill fell 1/32, to 102-17/32, and the yield was at 3.69 percent, unchanged from late Friday.

HEADLINE: In Japan, a Robust Yen Undermines the Markets

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Tumbling stock markets and falling currencies are causing global concern, but the Japanese yen is generating high anxiety for rising too much. The yen surged as much as 10 percent against the dollar last week. In the last month, it has gained an astounding 34 percent against the euro. 
 One reason the yen is rising is investors' flight to quality. Another reason, many economists say, is the sudden end of one of the world's biggest easy-money schemes, the so-called yen-carry trade.
 The yen's rise helped hammer Tokyo's beleaguered stock market Monday. Share prices hit a 26-year low and are down 50 percent this year. A strong yen makes Japanese products more expensive during a recession in Europe and North America, hurting the profits of Japanese exporters. 
 Finance ministers from the world's seven wealthiest nations issued a joint statement as the Tokyo market sank, saying they were ''concerned about the recent excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen and its possible adverse implications for economic and financial stability.'' But the yen remained strong as investors signaled their doubt that governments would intervene to stop the yen's gains. 
 Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, confirmed as much in an interview with Bloomberg News. 
 The yen's rise is owed, in part, to its status as a safe haven -- in turbulent times, investors move money into the currency because Japan is the world's largest economy after the United States', and its banking system has limited exposure to the subprime crisis, even though it faces recession. 
 But currency analysts say most of the yen's recent gains are because of the abrupt end of the yen-carry trade.
 For much of this decade, Japanese and foreigners alike borrowed money in Japan, where interest rates were very low and money was therefore cheap. They invested that money in higher yielding assets across the world, from home loans in Budapest and Seoul to equities in Mumbai. 
 This turned Japan, with its $15 trillion in personal savings built up by the nation's chronic trade surpluses, into a provider of low-cost capital for the rest of the world. 
 No one knows for sure how large this outflow of yen was. 
 Much of the yen-carry trade took place beyond public scrutiny, in the form of currency options or other types of derivatives trading. Most analysts agree its size was in the hundreds of billions of dollars, with some estimating it reached well more than half a trillion dollars. As the yen-carry trade grew, currency analysts warned it was a bubble of cheap credit, which one day would burst. 
 Now that day has come, say currency analysts and economists. Investors have been unwinding their yen-based loans as part of a panicked flight from risky assets -- like Budapest home loans and Mumbai equities -- and into safer havens like the yen and the American dollar, which is also rising against the euro and British pound. 
 The prospect of global recession has also led central banks in many countries to cut interest rates, reducing the appeal of borrowing in Japan: South Korea cut interest rates by three-quarters of a point Monday, its biggest one-day move ever.
 The result has been a huge reversal in the flow of money, back into Japan and its currency. ''This is the end of the yen-carry trade, and the yen bubble,'' said Tohru Sasaki, chief exchange strategist in the Tokyo office of JPMorgan Chase Bank. ''The yen is coming back home.''
 As this money flows back into Japan, currency analysts expect the yen to keep gaining. Mr. Sasaki says his company's forecast is 87 yen to the dollar, but it could go as high as 80 yen.
 Mr. Sasaki said the size of the yen's rise in recent weeks suggested that at least several trillion yen, or tens of billion of dollars, had flowed back to Japan. He said the last time he had tried to calculate the size of the entire yen-carry trade was three years ago, when he estimated that it totaled 40 trillion yen, or $425 billion. He said it could have easily grown much larger than that in recent years.
 All this money from Japan added to an excessive abundance of cheap capital that many economists now blame for causing the current financial crisis. Some of the biggest players in the carry trade were American and European hedge funds and banks. But Japanese individuals also fed the outflow of yen by pouring their savings into overseas investments, like emerging markets funds, in search of higher returns. 
 Japan's normally conservative homemakers even got into the act by trading foreign currencies online, becoming a force in global foreign exchange markets, known collectively as the Mrs. Watanabes.
 One indicator of the recent return of money to Japan has been a surge of individuals here cashing out of mutual funds that invest overseas. A survey of Japan's 40 largest such funds showed individuals had withdrawn more than $3.5 billion since Sept. 12, Mr. Sasaki of JPMorgan said.
 The end of the yen-carry trade could have serious consequences, economists say. 
 In Japan, the higher yen has worsened the already darkening outlook for the nation's export-driven economy, hurting companies like Toyota and Sony. The yen, and the prospect of a recession in crucial overseas markets like the United States, have helped drive the benchmark Nikkei 225 index down some 50 percent so far this year.
 Globally, the carry trade's demise could contribute to an overall increase in borrowing costs, especially for developing countries and lesser-known companies in developed nations, by cutting off a major source of low-cost capital, economists say.
 ''The unwinding of the yen-carry trade is just one more way of taking excess credit out of the system,'' said John Richards, head of Asia research at the Royal Bank of Scotland's Tokyo office. ''Higher borrowing costs will go up disproportionately for riskier investments.''
 A major reason for the end of the yen-carry trade has been a narrowing in the gap in interest rates between Japan and other developed countries. For years, Japan's low interest rates -- the benchmark overnight rate is 0.5 percent -- were attractive enough to entice investors to borrow money here and invest it in countries with higher rates of return, despite the foreign exchange rate risks.
 Now, investors are unwinding those loans as interest rate differences between Japan and the rest of the world shrink, making yen borrowing less lucrative. When its board meets later this week, the United States Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its overnight rate again, from its current rate of 1.5 percent. That is already way down from 5.25 percent when the subprime problems first hit financial markets in July 2007. 
 Since that time, the yen has risen 24 percent against the dollar as investors have repaid their yen borrowings. Indeed, some currency analysts said this dissolution of the yen-carry trade may already be reaching its climax. 
 Koji Fukaya, senior currency strategist in the Tokyo office of Deutsche Bank, said he expected the yen's gains to continue into November, before settling down at a value of about 90 yen a dollar.
 ''The unwinding and liquidation will continue for a few more weeks,'' he said. ''Most of the yen-carry trades have already been unwound.''

HEADLINE: White House Explores Aid For Auto Deal

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and BILL VLASIC; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington, and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is examining a range of options for providing emergency financial help to spur a merger between General Motors and Chrysler, according to government officials.
 People familiar with the discussions said the administration wanted to provide financial assistance to the deeply troubled Big Three Detroit automakers, possibly by using the Treasury Department's wide-ranging authority under the $700 billion bailout program that Congress approved this month. 
 Another option under consideration is to tap a $25 billion loan program that Congress just created to help the auto companies modernize their plants. A third option would involve going back to Congress, immediately after the Nov. 4 election, for authority to spend funds aimed specifically at the auto industry. But officials have not yet decided how much assistance to provide or how to structure any aid program. 
 G.M. and the parent of Chrysler, Cerberus Capital Management, are in talks to possibly merge the two companies, which are losing sales and hemorrhaging cash. People close to the talks said G.M. needs between $5 billion and $10 billion in assistance, mainly to cover G.M.'s own needs between now and the time of the merger. 
 Any financial help from the government could help provide a level of confidence to investors in such a deal, and possibly cover some of the revamping costs of a merger, which would be substantial.
 The government's bailout program was originally created to rescue banks and other financial institutions, but the Treasury Department decided last week to allow some insurance companies to participate as well.
 A bailout for carmakers would be the latest in a series of government-financed rescue efforts for banks, Wall Street firms and an insurance conglomerate. While few experts dispute the car industry's troubles, rescuing them would also increase political pressure to help ailing industries like airlines and steel producers. 
 The automobile industry and lawmakers from Michigan are now arguing that the car companies should be included, because their financing subsidiaries, which have been starved for credit, represent an important channel for consumers to obtain loans to buy cars.
 Any federal help for the financing units could be used to provide car loans, which is seen as crucial to increasing car sales. Many dealers have had trouble closing sales with car buyers because of tighter lending standards.
 On Monday, White House officials said the car companies might well be eligible for some sort of help under the broader financial rescue program, known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP.
 ''It's clear that the automakers are dealing with a very serious situation, they have for some time,'' Dana Perino, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday.
 ''Automakers do have financing arms -- many of them do -- and it's possible that some of those financing arms could be a part of the rescue package,'' she continued. ''We're trying to work with them as much as we can. There are some things we may or may not be able to do.'' 
 A spokesman for G.M., Greg Martin, said Monday that the company had been asking the Treasury Department to extend aid to automakers as it had to other troubled industries. 
 ''We believe the federal government should consider using all the tools available to it, including some recently enacted, to support industries that are in distress and that are essential to the U.S. economy,'' Mr. Martin said.
 A spokeswoman for GMAC Financial Services, Gina Proia, said the auto finance operation was also seeking assistance from Treasury.
 ''At this point we are working with the government officials to understand the application process of TARP and other programs to determine any potential participation by GMAC,'' she said. 
 All three of the major American car companies were already struggling with slumping car sales, soaring gasoline prices and huge losses. But their financial conditions became much worse in the last two months as the credit markets became frozen, unemployment jumped sharply and the economy reached the brink of a recession.
 With only a week left before the presidential election, the political and economic stakes have increased. The Republican nominee, Senator John McCain, several weeks ago abandoned hope of winning in Michigan, which has the highest unemployment rate in the country. But the collapse of a major car manufacturer would send shock waves through Indiana, Ohio and potentially other crucial states with large auto plants or suppliers.
 The Treasury Department, which oversees the rescue program, warned on Monday that the car companies would not be eligible for the capital injections that the government was offering to banks and some insurance companies. Under that program, the government hopes to invest $250 billion in banks and would receive nonvoting preferred shares in exchange.
 ''The capital purchase program is available only to federally regulated banks and savings institutions,'' said Michele Davis, a spokesperson for the Treasury. 
 But Treasury officials did not rule out other forms of assistance. Under the law that Congress passed in early October, the Treasury Department has almost unlimited discretion to buy up any kind of assets from any kind of financial institution. 
 Ford and Chrysler both have financing units, mainly for the purpose of providing car loans, and those subsidiaries might qualify as financial institutions. 
 General Motors is in a more complicated situation, however, because it spun off 49 percent of its financing unit, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, to Cerberus, the same private-equity firm that acquired Chrysler after the breakup of DaimlerChrysler last year.
 Both G.M. and Chrysler are in desperate need of cash to stave off possible bankruptcy filings. G.M., the nation's largest automaker, lost $18.8 billion in the first six months of the year, and is burning through more than $1 billion in cash each month.
 The company had $21 billion in cash as of June, but is rapidly depleting its reserves to offset declining revenues. Analysts said that at its current cash-burn rate, G.M. would fall below its minimum operating requirements by sometime next year.
 A merger with Chrysler would give G.M. access to about $11.7 billion in cash that was on Chrysler's books as of June.
 Talks between G.M. and Cerberus are continuing, and the sides are said to be committed to reaching a deal soon, according to people close to the discussions.
 The failure of General Motors, the Ford Motor Company or Chrysler would have broad consequences for the economy. The companies combined employ more than 200,000 people in the United States, and indirectly support jobs for millions more Americans through their suppliers and dealerships. 
 If any of the three companies were to go bankrupt, it would probably leave behind huge liabilities for federal and state governments. Shortfalls in their pension plans would become the responsibility of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and its reserves are already stretched.
 G.M. has been in merger talks since September with Chrysler's majority owner, the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. But the two sides have been unable so far to secure new financing from banks and other lenders, according to people with knowledge of the talks.

At the time, the government said that it would invest an additional $125 billion in smaller banks. In the last few days, the names of 18 banks receiving investments have been disclosed.

 U.N. IN THE CONGO PELTED BY ROCKS
 As Peace Seems Ever Further Away
 A protest at the United Nations headquarters in Goma, Congo, turned violent when demonstrators began lobbing stones at the compound and nearby cars, United Nations officials said. Frustration and rage have been compounded by years of unrest and the recent displacement of tens of thousands, even as a peace accord between rebels and the government fell through. In the midst of the turmoil, the Spanish general leading the peacekeeping mission resigned, citing personal reasons. Page A6 
 NIGER GUILTY OF ALLOWING SLAVERY
 A West African regional court found that the government of Niger had permitted slavery. The verdict was based on the country's failure to protect a young woman, now 24, who was sold into slavery at the age of 12 for $500. The milestone ruling ordered the government to pay $19,000 in damages to the young woman. Page A6 
 TENSION IN IRAQ OVER OIL LAW
 Kurdish officials and the central government of Iraq continued to feud, albeit in very muted tones. Negotiators failed yet again to reach an accord on a new draft of an oil law, and Kurdish politicians denounced the government's attempts to create semitribal councils to counterbalance Kurdish political power in Kirkuk. Page A8 
 ALARMING NUCLEAR AGENCY REPORT
 The number of thefts of nuclear or radioactive material around the world was described as ''disturbingly high'' by Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency during his annual report to the General Assembly. But his staff and outside experts cautioned that the amount of material was relatively small and even combined would not be enough to create a nuclear device. Page A7 
 GEORGIAN PRIME MINISTER REPLACED
 President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia dismissed his prime minister, Lado Gurgenidze, who was in the position for less than a year and was seen as a voice to attract Western investment. His replacement is relative unknown, Grigol Mgaloblishvili. Mr. Saakashvili said that the shake-up was not over, and that he intended to propose a new cabinet for parliamentary approval. He said a new team was necessary to face the threat posed by Russia. Page A10 
 AFGHAN SUICIDE BOMBER KILL 2 G.I.S
 An 8-year-old boy and two American soldiers were killed in Baghlan Province in northern Afghanistan when a suicide bomber disguised as a police officer entered a police station and blew himself up, Afghan officials said. The blast wounded several others in the relatively peaceful province. The Taliban was quick to claim responsibility. Page A10

 BACK FROM WAR,
 And Into the Political Fray
 Young veterans are volunteering for the presidential campaigns and have become a growing, important part of the nation's political dynamic. Many of them are engaged for the first time. The Pentagon forbids partisan activity for active-duty troops, but politics has become an outlet for the same sense of duty that led those young veterans to enlist. PAGE A12
 JUDGE BLOCKS HALLOWEEN LAW
 A federal judge in Missouri temporarily blocked parts of a new state law that requires sexual offenders to remain in their homes on Halloween evening and to avoid contact with children. The judge said the law was unclear on whether sexual offenders could celebrate the holiday with their own children or grandchildren. The attorney general's office said it would appeal the order.

 RIVALS CLASH OVER TAXES
 As the presidential campaign entered its final days, Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain were making tours of two battleground states, criticizing each other for their tax plans. And with polls suggesting victory is in Mr. Obama's grasp, he is warning his supporters to avoid overconfidence. PAGE A15
 BODY OF ACTRESS'S NEPHEW FOUND
 The police found the body of Julian King, the 7-year-old nephew of the actress and singer Jennifer Hudson, in an abandoned sport-utility vehicle in Chicago, three days after her mother and brother were found dead in their home about 10 miles away. The child was found shot to death in the back of a white 1994 Chevrolet Suburban belonging to Ms. Hudson's brother that had been missing since Friday. The police said the motive for the killing was unknown. PAGE A20
 THREE HELD IN CAMPUS SHOOTING
 The authorities detained three men and were searching for another in connection with a shooting last weekend at the University of Central Arkansas, which left two students dead. The shooting at the university occurred just after 9 p.m. on Sunday, when a group of men drove onto the campus and opened fire near a dormitory. The bullets sent students scurrying for safety and prompted an alert that locked down the entire campus in Conway, about 30 miles north of Little Rock. PAGE A13

 THE HEIGHTENED PROFILE
 Of Joe Sixth-Sense
 The vestibular system is the Rodney Dangerfield of sensory systems, getting decidedly less attention than, say, the senses of vision or touch. It's made up of a pair of tiny organs on either side of the head near the inner ear, and it helps the brain distinguish between the movements of the viewer and the movements of the view. And lately, it's won a lot of fans among neuroscientists. PAGE D2

 BOX-OFFICE BLOCKBUSTERS PUSH INTO THE OSCAR ENVELOPE
 Welcome to the pop Oscars. After years of giving plenty of running room to independent film companies or studio art-house divisions that set the pace with critic-friendly but limited-audience films like last year's ''No Country for Old Men,'' this year the major studios are pushing some of their biggest crowd-pleasers into the thick of the awards race. The shift is coming about partly because shrinkage in the small-film business has left more room for big studios to play the Oscar game. PAGE C1 
 FRUGALITY HITS CLASSICAL MUSIC
 The New York City Opera sent employees home for two days this month because of a payroll crunch. The economic crisis has hit classical music. Most managers are in only the fretting stage, but orchestras and opera companies, a fragile corner of the nonprofit world, depend as much on donations as on ticket sales. The plunge in stock prices, the credit squeeze and feelings of shrinking wealth among patrons have begun to have concrete effects. PAGE C1 
 A PICASSO ON EVERY WALL
 The Grand Palais in Paris is home to ''Picasso and the Masters,'' and no show in Europe bids to be more spectacular, or ends up being more exasperating, Michael Kimmelman writes.

''Overkill'' doesn't adequately describe the effect, he says. PAGE C1 
 A MUSEUM OF THE MIND
 On the northwestern outskirts of Rome, a former psychiatric hospital is now home to an unusual museum. The Mind's Museum, which just re-opened after a high-tech overhaul by Studio Azzurro, seeks to overturn preconceptions about mental illness. Explaining the concept, Paolo Rosa, who founded Studio Azzurro, said: ''The spectator assumes madness and unconsciously adopts the guise of someone on the inside. We didn't want to dramatize but to include drama, and to let loose the imaginative dimension that madness elicits, which can be fertile even for those who think themselves as sane.'' PAGE C5 
 WHAT IRAN IS UP TO
 In his new book, ''The Devil We Know,'' Robert Baer, a former C.I.A. case officer turned author, paints a picture of Iran as a disciplined, strategic, monolithic ''police state'' and military power driven by imperial ambitions. ''At the bottom of Iran's soul is a newfound taste for empire,'' he states. But, in many instances, Elaine Sciolino writes, Mr. Baer seems to forget what he says himself toward the end of the book: ''At all levels Iran is never what it seems.'' And just because Iran thinks of itself as the pre-eminent power of the Persian Gulf doesn't mean that it is bent on establishing an empire. PAGE C7

HEADLINE: 21-Year Study Of Children Set to Begin

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
After nearly a decade of planning, researchers will begin recruiting pregnant women in January for an ambitious nationwide study that will follow more than 100,000 children from before birth until age 21. 
 The goal of the federally financed project, the National Children's Study, is to gain a better understanding of the effects of a wide array of factors on children's health.
 ''What we are doing is bold and needs to be bold in order to answer some pressing questions,'' said the study's director, Dr. Peter C. Scheidt, a pediatrician on the staff of the child-health division of the National Institutes of Health. 
 Investigators hope to find explanations for the rising rates of premature births, childhood obesity, cancer, autism, endocrine disorders and behavioral problems. To that end, they will examine factors like genetics and child rearing, geography, exposure to chemicals, nutrition and pollution.
 While few quarrel with the goal, some experts worry that the expansive project will take resources away from smaller and more focused perinatal and pediatric research, particularly when budgets are certain to be strained by the financial crisis. The total cost is estimated to be $2.7 billion.
 Participating mothers and children (fathers will be encouraged but not required to take part) will be given periodic interviews and questionnaires. They will further be asked to submit samples of blood, urine and hair. Air, water and dust from their environments will also be sampled and tested.
 ''Something like this has never been done in this country,'' said a principal investigator for the study, Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, professor and chairman of community and preventive medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan. ''It's past time for us to do this.'' 
 Studies of comparable size and scope are under way in Britain, Denmark and Norway.
 Conceived during the Clinton administration and authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000, the National Children's Study is being led by a group of federal agencies. Besides the health institutes, they are the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Education. 
 Since 2000, more than 2,400 health care, environmental and technology professionals have met in panels for hundreds of hours to work out such details as sampling methodology, data collection and privacy protection. 
 Subjects will be chosen from 105 counties to achieve a representative mix of racial, ethnic, religious, social, cultural and geographic characteristics. Forty regional centers will administer the study -- mostly well-known medical institutions like Mount Sinai, the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and the University of Texas Health Science Center-Houston. 
 Dr. Russ Hauser, a professor of environmental and occupational epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health who served on a National Academy of Sciences committee that reviewed the study's design, said the study would be ''worthy and feasible'' as long as it was properly financed. 
 But other experts questioned whether it was worth the cost. ''The question isn't whether the goals can be accomplished,'' said Dr. Arthur Reingold, professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. ''It's more a question of is this the best use of almost $3 billion, particularly when it will inevitably take funding from other research, especially with the economy falling to pieces.''
 Researchers involved in the study counter that it will more than pay for itself by leading researchers to the causes or contributing factors for so many childhood disorders. Dr. Landrigan said a ''dress rehearsal'' of the study, which began in 2001 with 1,500 subjects from New York and California, has already shown that pregnant women exposed to organophosphates in pesticides were more likely to have babies with small brains and impaired cognition. 
 Another concern is that the study's advisory board -- which is choosing the chemical exposures to be studied -- includes scientists from 3M and Pfizer, who have apparent conflicts of interest.
 But Richard Wiles, executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said that since there were only 2 such scientists among the board's 33 members, he hoped they would not have undue influence.

HEADLINE: Fractures in Iraq City as Kurds and Baghdad Vie

BYLINE: By SAM DAGHER; Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting from Baghdad.

DATELINE: MOSUL, Iraq 

 BODY:
A new Iraqi military offensive is under way in this still violent northern city, but the worry is not only the insurgents who remain strong here. American commanders are increasingly concerned that Mosul could degenerate into a larger battleground over the fragile Iraqi state itself.
 The problems are old but risk spilling out violently here and now. The central government in Baghdad has sent troops to quell the insurgency here, while also aiming at what it sees as a central obstacle to both nationhood and its own power: the semiautonomous Kurdish region in the north and the Kurds' larger ambitions to expand areas under their control.
 The Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is squeezing out Kurdish units of the Iraqi Army from Mosul, sending the national police and army from Baghdad and trying to forge alliances with Sunni Arab hard-liners in the province, who have deep-seated feuds with the Kurdistan Regional Government led by Massoud Barzani.
 The Kurds are resisting, underscoring yet again the depth of ethnic and sectarian divisions here and the difficulty of creating a united Iraq even when overall violence is down. Tension has risen to the point that last week American commanders held a series of emergency meetings with the Iraqi government and Kurdish officials, seeking to head off violence essentially between factions of the Iraqi government. 
 ''It's the perfect storm against the old festering background,'' warned Brig. Gen. Raymond A. Thomas III, who oversees Nineveh and Kirkuk Provinces and the Kurdish region.
 Worry is so high that the American military has already settled on a policy that may set a precedent, as the United States slowly withdraws to allow Iraqis to settle their own problems. If the Kurds and Iraqi government forces fight, the American military will ''step aside,'' General Thomas said, rather than ''have United States servicemen get killed trying to play peacemaker.''
 The competing agendas of the Kurds and central government have nearly provoked violence before, but each side eventually grasped the risks. That may be the case now. At the moment, the Americans are hoping to refocus each side on fighting the insurgency rather than each other.
 But the tensions underline that achieving basic security is only the first step toward deeper progress in Iraq -- and that much remains, bitterly, unresolved.
 Mosul falls outside the borders of the Kurdish region, but Mr. Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party came to control the provincial government after Sunni Arabs boycotted the provincial elections in 2005. The Kurds say, however, that they will not abandon the city until they reclaim five areas in Nineveh Province, putting them on a political collision course with the central government. 
 Tense personal relations between Mr. Maliki and Mr. Barzani worsened, officials on all sides say, after a standoff in September between the Iraqi Army and the Kurdish security forces, the pesh merga, in eastern Diyala Province. American forces helped contain that confrontation.
 More broadly, the two men do not see eye to eye on issues as fundamental as the sharing of oil resources, the resolution of disputed internal borders and the shape of the Iraqi nation. The Kurds want a loose federation, while Mr. Maliki, playing on nationalist sentiments, is increasingly pushing for a strong central government.
 Relations have deteriorated to the point that the Kurdish leadership has described Mr. Maliki as a new Saddam Hussein, recalling how Mr. Hussein ruthlessly crushed the Kurds in the 1980s. The borders of Iraqi Kurdistan were established as an internationally enforced security zone in 1991. 
 Testing Loyalties
 In this latest offensive against insurgents, Mr. Maliki has been pushing to lessen Kurdish military influence here, and that is testing loyalties at a delicate time.
 Mr. Maliki sent nearly 3,000 national policemen from Baghdad to Mosul to prop up the local force. The officers, almost all Shiites and Sunni Arabs, will be in charge of the overwhelmingly Sunni Arab west side of the city. 
 Predominantly Kurdish units of the army stationed in Nineveh are slowly being replaced by the mainly Sunni Arab and Shiite contingents.
 The Defense Ministry also recently appointed Maj. Gen. Abdullah Abdul-Karim, Mr. Maliki's brother-in-law, as the new commander of the Second Division on Mosul's east side. Mr. Barzani, sensing a plot to purge the Iraqi Army in the north of its Kurdish leadership, personally intervened recently to freeze a ministerial order to transfer 34 Kurdish officers, said Col. Hajji Abdullah, a battalion commander in the Second Division.
 ''If the Arabs do not change now, things will get worse and I see confrontation,'' Colonel Abdullah said.
 In the turmoil, he and another officer in the division, Brig. Gen. Nadheer Issam, say their loyalties are first and foremost to Kurdistan.
 ''If I were made to choose, I would not even think for a second -- I would leave the army,'' General Issam said. ''We have sacrificed too much fighting the Baathists,'' he added, referring to Mr. Hussein's political party.
 The United States has relied on Kurds from the very beginning in Mosul. Ignoring longtime enmities between the city and Mr. Barzani's party, American Special Forces units accompanied pesh merga fighters beholden to the party when they took Mosul in April 2003. The United States drafted more pesh merga units into the city in 2004 and 2005 when the whole provincial government and the police force collapsed at the hands of insurgents. 
 Although many of the pesh merga units in Nineveh were merged into the national army, an estimated 5,000 men remained from an elite Kurdistan corps in the province's north. All these actions have stoked anger in Mosul toward Americans and Kurds.
 Karam Qusay, who works in the Zuhoor neighborhood of Mosul, said he wanted the city to be free of the Kurdish military presence, both in the army and outside of it.
 ''We wish they would leave,'' he said. ''We despise them.''
 Mosul's allegiance to Mr. Hussein was so staunch that the city was known as the ''regime's pillow.'' Now Mr. Maliki appears to be trying to win over the city by playing on grievances toward the Kurds.
 ''The government wants to extend its authority, and this clashes with the will and ambitions of the Kurds,'' said Maj. Ali Naji, a Sunni Arab in one of the army units sent recently from Baghdad. ''I predict fighting between Iraqi forces and the pesh merga.''
 Sami al-Askari, one of Mr. Maliki's senior advisers, said he hoped that talks between his boss and Mr. Barzani would head off any such confrontation. 
 But he made the government's position clear: that the presence of Kurdish forces outside of the national army and beyond the borders of Kurdistan was ''unlawful.'' And he said the refusal of Kurdish officers in the Iraqi Army to obey their transfer orders from Nineveh was a ''mutiny that must be severely punished.''
 The repercussions of a face-off between Baghdad and the Kurds in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, would be far more serious than the recent tensions in eastern Diyala.
 Tenuous Security
 Nineveh, wedged between Iraqi Kurdistan and Syria and close to Turkey, remains a focal point for a number of Sunni insurgent groups linked to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the homegrown terrorist group that American officials say is led by foreigners, and to the Baath Party. Both are fighting the Americans, Mr. Maliki's government and the Kurds.
 Despite numerous offensives by American and Iraqi forces since the start of theyear, security remains tenuous at best. This was underscored this month when 2,270 Christian families, according to the Human Rights Ministry, fled Mosul after a number of killings and other attacks against Christians. 
 The overall level of violence has dropped in Mosul to 9 or 10 attacks a day from an average of 40 a day a year ago. 
 Yet killings continue, and fear is palpable. Judges are so intimidated or corrupt that the Iraqi government has flown in judges from Baghdad. Their main job is to issue arrest warrants for wanted suspects.
 People other than Christians are also being attacked. A senior provincial official was killed as he left a mosque last month. Even a man who makes tea in the provincial building was recently killed in what is probably the most secure part of the city, said an American official working with local authorities.
 In his push to subdue Mosul and marginalize the Kurds, Mr. Maliki is trying to curry favor with disaffected Sunnis. Last week he sent his deputy, Rafie al-Issawi, a Sunni, here with promises of a reconstruction and investment initiative that would be coordinated this time by respected Sunnis from Mosul. 
 More significant, Mr. Maliki is courting former army officers and tribal leaders like Sheik Abdullah al-Humaidi, who leads the powerful Shammar tribe in western Nineveh. All are strong nationalists who believe that Kurds must be confined to the borders of Kurdistan drawn after the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
 General Thomas said Mr. Maliki was promoting Riad al-Chakerji, a Sunni Arab who is a former army general, as the next governor of Nineveh. Mr. Chakerji acts as an adviser to a committee set up to carry out the central government's new economic initiatives for Mosul.
 ''The central government must be very strong, especially now,'' Mr. Chakerji said. 
 Mr. Chakerji, Sheik Humaidi and people like Hassan al-Luhaibi, a former Iraqi Army commander who led the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, have all joined a new political coalition known as Al Hadba, which will run in the coming provincial elections.
 The coalition is led by Atheel al-Nujaifi, a prominent businessman who owns a ranch in Mosul that once supplied purebred Arabian horses to Mr. Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay.
 A Call to Keep a Promise
 Mr. Nujaifi said the United States military ignored the province's enmity toward Mr. Barzani and turned itself into a party to the conflict when it relied on pesh merga forces upon arriving in Mosul.
 He said that for Mr. Maliki to assert his authority in Mosul he must first make good on his promise to drive out Kurdish forces.
 ''Many insurgent groups will become law-abiding after that,'' Mr. Nujaifi said.
 Mr. Nujaifi and his brother Osama, a member of Parliament in Baghdad, blame the Kurds for instigating a campaign against the Christians in Mosul to deflect the central government's pressure.
 One Kurdish leader called the accusations ''ludicrous,'' and the United States military said it was most likely the work of militants linked to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. 
 But a group of Christian leaders who met with General Thomas last week in the town of Qosh, outside Mosul, blamed the struggle between the central government and Kurdistan for the plight of their people. Sweeping out both sides, they said, may be the only way to restore calm and trust. 
 ''You have done a great job removing Saddam's regime,'' the Rev. Bashar Warda told the general. ''Continue with removing this regime, and start over again.''

HEADLINE: Obama vs. McCain: The Final Week

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Ceding the Center,'' by David Brooks (column, Oct. 26):
 It's not surprising to read that Mr. Brooks finds the final weeks of John McCain's campaign ''so unspeakably sad.''
 I like David Brooks. He is articulate, honest and fair. As a liberal Democrat, I even agree with him about some of the best of John McCain's qualities. But I do not agree that Mr. McCain would make a good president. Just look at the kind of campaign he has run and what it reveals about his judgment and ability to lead. 
 The campaign has been unfocused, impulsive and too often nasty. He has compromised himself to win the support of the most conservative base of the Republican Party. Just think about his choice of Sarah Palin and his signature positions, like immigration reform, that he no longer talks about. He's made a pact with that base, which will be an anchor on his ''maverick'' coattails if he's elected. 
 Remember, as Harry Truman said of the presidency, ''The buck stops here.'' John McCain has to take responsibility for the kind of campaign he has run. I think that it's a window into the kind of president he would be.

 To the Editor:
 What makes the final weeks of this campaign ''so unspeakably sad'' is not the fact that John McCain has conducted himself in a painfully weak, shallow, mean-spirited and clueless fashion. 
 It is the fact that millions of people have lost their life savings and/or homes and face a dismal future, and the fact that nobody in the modern Republican Party has anything to offer them but demagogy, moralizing or pseudo-philosophical blather.
 Geoff Grinstein
 New York, Oct. 26, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I agree with David Brooks when he writes that John McCain ''would be an outstanding president.'' But I thought that in 2000. Unfortunately, during the Republican primaries that year, he was pushed aside by the far right, which favored George W. Bush. 
 One can't help but wonder how much better off our country would be now if John McCain had gotten the nomination then. But now it's time for Barack Obama to clean up this mess.

 To the Editor: 
 Frank Rich (''In Defense of White Americans,'' column, Oct. 26) provides a compelling analysis of why racially divisive political tactics have failed in 2008, but when he says ''there are not and have never been enough racists in 2008 to flip this election,'' he misses an important point.
 Studies using the Implicit Association Test have amply demonstrated that most of us, regardless of our conscious views, harbor unconscious biases against other racial groups. 
 Racially charged tactics in the ''Willie Horton'' vein aim not to mobilize unrepentant racists, but to manipulate the rest of us -- decent people with a strong belief in racial equality -- by tapping into these unconscious attitudes.
 This is a far more insidious tactic, but fortunately, when the racial subtext of those messages is made explicit and our better angels are free to act, we recoil from the implicit racism.

 Re ''A Makeover With an Ugly Gloss'' (column, Oct. 26):
 Maureen Dowd was too kind to the Republican leadership. When it gets right down to it, it is the party of the ''Valentino'' dress set. The leaders of the Republican Party can't really think like the average working person because in their political world only the rich matter. 
 They couldn't conceive of buying a dress at J. C. Penney or Target. For the Republican leaders, the average working person is the person they have to fool with divisive issues, fear tactics, misleading comments about Democrats and outright lies to get their vote.

 Re ''No Ordinary Woman'' (column, Oct. 26):
 In using an argument from the feminist Bella Abzug, Judith Warner suggests that the nomination of Sarah Palin shows that women have arrived. A mediocre woman is doing ''just as well as the most mediocre of men.''
 To me, the most important legacy of Sarah Palin's nomination could be that conservatives, especially conservative men, have found it perfectly acceptable, indeed praiseworthy, for women with young children to combine motherhood and careers and for husbands to share child-rearing. 
 This acceptability is something that feminists have been struggling for since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Unfortunately, Ms. Palin has not embraced policies that would help the average Jane be able to successfully combine work and motherhood.

 Re ''The Party of Yesterday,'' by Timothy Egan (column, Oct. 26):
 Favorable taxes allowed my company to keep more money, so we recently hired seven people, bringing us to 12. Our employees professionally hone skills creating, servicing and deploying our inventions to global clients. 
 Demand for our products and services, not government programs, allowed us to create these jobs. Politicians make wild claims of creating jobs, but who among us doesn't understand that taxes, markets and customers mostly determine a company's future? 
 Taking money from our growing business will limit our ability to create jobs, as it will for others in America. Giving money away, to share the wealth, destroys initiative for lower skilled workers to become higher skilled and gain access to better jobs. 
 If The One is elected, won't this damage the very ones he claims to help by risking their American dream? While The One may be proud to do so, shouldn't we all be beyond such economic arrogance by now? Cliff Johns

 To the Editor:
 ''Blue State Blues,'' by Gail Collins (column, Oct. 26), resonated with me.
 Here in Sherman, Tex. (an hour north of Dallas), almost everyone will vote Republican, even the Democratic husband of my Republican hair-dresser, because he likes the fact that Sarah Palin hunts moose.
 While it was thrilling to have both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama visit Dallas during the primaries, all is quiet now, and the only excitement these days is the continuing theft of Obama-Biden yard signs by Republican rowdies no doubt hoping to intimidate the relatively few Democrats around here.
 So many local elections are uncontested that I've thought of running myself just to be a Democratic placeholder -- not that I would have to worry about winning or actually holding office. Now that Barack Obama is winning over formerly Republican states, perhaps he'd be willing to tackle Texas? We'd love to see him again! Marsha B. McCoy

HEADLINE: Coverage Of Election Now Lacks Suspense

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
News shows should probably come with a spoiler alert: the following program contains images and language that seem to jump to a foregone conclusion.
 Cable news and network anchors are not saying point-blank that the election is over. Instead they are saying, ''We're not saying it's over ...'' with a ''but'' that speaks volumes. One week away from the election news anchors and commentators have the taut, self-conscious demeanor they don on election nights when the exit polls are in, but when they are duty-bound not to declare a winner. 
 Sometimes, however, they can't quite stifle the blue-stained maps in their minds. 
 On ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday, Chuck Todd, NBC's political director, said there was something ''Shakespearean'' about the way Mr. McCain appears to be losing Hispanic voters in the West -- despite having challenged his party on the issue of immigration reform. ''You know, the S in John S. McCain is going to stand for Shakespeare, I think, when this campaign is over,'' Mr. Todd said. 
 It's not over, but terms like ''highly favored,'' ''touchdown favorite,'' ''comfortable lead'' and even ''a near-insurmountable lead'' are bouncing all over television these days. They fill many viewers, regardless of their party affiliation, with opposite but parallel forms of dread: inevitability, or the illusion of it, breeds complacency on one side, and defeatism on the other. 
 Gratifying as it may be, it's not really fair to blame the news media: there is a flood of predictive data available, and reporters cannot realistically dam it up. (If anything, they are to be commended for not trying to boost ratings by artificially prolonging suspense.) 
 For viewers who feel unnerved by so much suppressed certainty, it's an opportune time to check out the Fox News Channel. The election coverage there is not so much fair and balanced as it is a useful counterbalance.
 On Monday talk turned to Ohio, where Senator Barack Obama has a five-point lead in some polls. ''Yet at the same time, the polls in the last midterm election in 2006 -- they were sort of all over the place,'' the Fox anchor Jon Scott told a reporter from The Columbus Dispatch, with a glint of hope in his voice. ''We could be looking at poll numbers here that aren't exactly what everybody seems to think they are.'' 
 While CNN and MSNBC wallow in maps, charts and delegate counts, Fox is focused on the latest flare-ups that could still put a dent in Mr. Obama's lead. On Monday Fox bore down on a radio interview Mr. Obama gave in 2001 in which he lamented that the civil rights movement had focused on the courts and did not do enough to further ''redistributive change,'' or as Mr. Scott put it, ''the redistributive wealth thing.'' 
 Byron York, a writer at National Review, told the Fox anchor Megyn Kelly that in the interview Mr. Obama had used ''old lefty terms like economic justice'' to justify progressive taxation. Mr. York noted that any government relies on some form of wealth redistribution, and that Mr. Obama's remarks merely suggested that he wanted to take it further. 
 Ms. Kelly noted that the interview mostly ''reaffirmed'' what Mr. Obama told Joe the Plumber.
 Viewers may not agree with Joe the Plumber, or even understand exactly who he is, but the lavish attention paid to him -- and Mr. Obama's use of the words ''spread the wealth'' to explain his tax plan -- is a reliable indicator of where Fox senses vulnerability. 
 Fox is not exactly optimistic about Senator McCain's chances, however. Karl Rove, the Republican strategist and former adviser to President Bush who is now a Fox contributor, deplored the infighting within the McCain campaign about strategy and Sarah Palin as a bad omen. 
 ''This is, again, as you say, not the kind of thing you like to have happening in your campaign,'' Mr. Rove told Chris Wallace of Fox on Sunday. ''And it's generally a sign that people are throwing in the towel and thinking that they're going to lose.''
 Even on Fox, there are some signs of discord about the McCain campaign's tactics, most notably during a lively exchange on Saturday between two Fox stars, Geraldo Rivera and Sean Hannity, over Mr. Obama's ties to the former '60s radical William Ayers, whom Mr. Hannity describes as a ''domestic terrorist.''
 Mr. Rivera told Mr. Hannity that he was doing the McCain campaign a ''disservice'' by harping on Mr. Ayers at the expense of economic issues, calling the focus ''an unsavory fixation.'' Mr. Hannity disagreed, so Mr. Rivera took it further.
 ''I used to be friends with Yasir Arafat,'' Mr. Rivera said. ''Does that make me a terrorist?'' 
 They parted amicably and, most important, they didn't call the election.

HEADLINE: Studios Are Pushing Box Office Winners As Oscar Contenders

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Walt Disney is in. This week the studio will break new ground by starting a campaign that boldly offers its ''Wall-E'' as a contender for the best picture Oscar, an honor never yet won by an animated film.
 Warner Brothers is in, too. That studio recently telegraphed plans for a multifront Oscar campaign for its Batman blockbuster ''The Dark Knight'' by sending awards voters a query about their preferred format for promotional DVDs. 
 Not to be outdone, Paramount may join the party. Along with Marvel Enterprises, it is weighing an Oscar push for ''Iron Man'' and its lead actor, Robert Downey Jr., even while promoting Mr. Downey as best supporting actor for his role in the DreamWorks comedy hit ''Tropic Thunder.''
 Welcome to the pop Oscars. 
 After years of giving plenty of running room to independent film companies or studio art house divisions that set the pace with critic-friendly but limited-audience films like last year's ''No Country for Old Men'' and ''There Will Be Blood,'' this year the major studios are pushing some of their biggest crowd-pleasers into the thick of the awards race.
 Their approaching multimillion-dollar campaigns come at a time when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, whose 6,000-plus members award the Oscars, is planning to give its annual show a more commercially popular flavor. In part the academy's producers will do that by including glimpses of the year's box office favorites, whether or not they are nominated for prizes.
 The shift is coming about partly because companies in the last year have either folded specialty divisions like Warner Independent Films, which in 2006 had a best picture nominee in ''Good Night, and Good Luck,'' or downsized them, as Paramount did with Paramount Vantage, which in 2007 had a nominee in ''Babel.''
 Shrinkage in the small-film business has left more room for big studios to play the Oscar game. Awaiting awards pushes are films like Universal's ''Frost/Nixon,'' directed by Ron Howard; Paramount's ''Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'' a David Fincher film starring Brad Pitt; and 20th Century Fox's ''Australia,'' a Baz Luhrmann epic starring Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman.
 (''Australia,'' still unseen by critics, does not arrive until December but was screened in unfinished form for Oprah Winfrey, who is expected to feature it with star interviews on her show next week, kicking off the studio's campaign.)
 At the same time Hollywood's blockbusters, rich in effects and increasingly complex in their themes, appear to have become more award-worthy of late.
 ''Wall-E,'' from Disney's Pixar unit, emerged as a darling of the critics for its adult sensibility, in addition to its heavily detailed computer animation. The film, the story of a lovesick robot, tackles a serious topic (environmentalism) while taking huge risks (for instance, a 45-minute stretch with nearly no dialogue).
 As early as midsummer Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal's film critic, was arguing that ''Wall-E'' should be considered for best picture. ''The time to start the drumbeat is now,'' he wrote in a July 12 essay, noting the extreme difficulty animated films, while hugely popular, have faced in vying for the most prestigious Oscar. Only one, Disney's ''Beauty and the Beast,'' released in 1991, has ever been nominated for best picture.
 ''If we didn't do it, I don't think we'd be giving the movie its due,'' Richard Cook, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said of the decision to promote ''Wall-E'' for the top prize, even if that complicates the movie's simultaneous bid for the more easily won award as best animated feature. One problem is a presumed tendency to split votes. Academy members can vote for a film in both the best picture and best animated feature categories. But they may not be inclined to do that or even know that the rules permit it.
 In the past films more appealing than self-consciously artistic were routinely included in the Oscar mix. ''Ghost,'' the No. 1 movie at the box office in 1990, with $506 million in worldwide ticket sales, won five nominations, including one for best picture. ''There was much less campaigning back then, and the academy tended to go more with what moved them emotionally, even if it was a big commercial hit,'' said Lisa Weinstein, a producer of ''Ghost.''
 The last runaway hit to win a best picture Oscar was ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' in 2003. In the years since the prize has gone to ''Million Dollar Baby,'' ''Crash,'' ''The Departed'' and ''No Country for Old Men'' -- the combined domestic box office sales for which fell short of the $377 million taken in by ''The Return of the King.''
 The drift away from audience-oriented contenders has precipitated a sharp drop in viewers for the annual Oscar show. Last year's program, with Jon Stewart as host, was the least watched on record, with about 32 million viewers in the United States. The highest rating was 55.3 million in 1998, when the immensely popular ''Titanic'' won the big prize.
 Ultimately, of course, the academy's voting members will decide whether the year's more popular and mainstream offerings make the cut. They will have plenty of artier options, including ''Rachel Getting Married,''Jonathan Demme's intricate look at a family coping with a drug-addicted daughter played by Anne Hathaway, and ''Revolutionary Road,'' a period romance directed by Sam Mendes and starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' from the director Danny Boyle, and ''Milk,'' directed by Gus Van Sant with Sean Penn in the lead role, are also in the running -- all with backing from studio specialty divisions. 
 Studio Oscar campaigners are largely reluctant to discuss their reasoning and strategies publicly for fear of overreaching with the academy's finicky voters. However, several noted a belief that audiences -- weary of economic crisis and political strife -- are ready for a dose of fun from the entertainment industry. 
 ''People like to vote for winners, and this year there are box office winners that also exhibit incredible craft,'' said Amanda Lundberg, a partner at the New York publicity firm 42 West, an Oscar campaign powerhouse.
 In that spirit, Disney will open its ''Wall-E'' campaign with something of a wink, by taking an advertisement that transforms the logo of a famous industry trade paper to read ''Variet-E.'' Warner's campaign for ''The Dark Knight'' will get a boost from both a Dec. 9 DVD release and an expected rerelease, on both standard and Imax screens, as the awards season peaks in January.
 If, as expected, ''Iron Man'' comes into the awards mix, that will be partly because Paramount recently moved a more conventional prospect, a drama called ''The Soloist,'' into next year and out of contention. That film, which stars Mr. Downey alongside Jamie Foxx, had promised to complicate the studio's life at a time when it saw awards potential for the currently very hot Mr. Downey in three pictures at once.
 Meanwhile, those who create the Oscar ceremony -- to be shown on Feb. 22 on ABC -- are determined this time around to connect with the people, and lots of them.
 The academy has lifted a 50-year ban on commercials for coming movies during the Oscar telecast in the hope of creating more of a feeling of ''event'' television for movie fans by including more splashy ads. Organizers (and ABC's advertising sales staff) are hoping to take a page from the Super Bowl, at which movie studios have often shown exclusive footage of big-budget summer movies to start generating fan interest.
 And there will most certainly be superheroes and villains present on Oscar night, whether or not Mr. Downey receives a nomination for his role as Tony Stark in ''Iron Man,'' or Heath Ledger is nominated for his portrayal of the Joker in ''The Dark Knight.'' 
 ''Not only should the Oscar show celebrate excellence in the movies of the year; we believe it should also celebrate the movies,'' said Laurence Mark, the producer of the next ceremony, sounding what has become a theme for the year.
 ''We just need to figure out a way that is appropriate to do that.''

HEADLINE: Who's Who and Who's Not

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
On questions of economic policy, Senator John McCain tends to rely on a limited group of people with whom he feels comfortable, as perhaps should be expected of someone who acknowledges that the subject has never been his strong suit. So when Mr. McCain convened an ''economic roundtable'' in Cleveland on Monday, it was interesting to see who was present -- and who was not. 
 Most of those invited were business or political leaders rather than economists. From the first group, there was Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, and David Farr, her counterpart at Emerson Electric; from the second came Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who ran against Mr. McCain in the primaries on a platform that emphasized his business experience. 
 Notable for their absence were two close advisers from the early phases of Mr. McCain's campaign: former Senator Phil Gramm and Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. Both have been shunted to Siberia, not because of policy disagreements but as the result of gaffes that reflected badly on the Republican candidate. 
 Mr. Gramm, now a banker, was the co-chairman of Mr. McCain's campaign and an early favorite to be treasury secretary in a McCain administration until July, when he told The Washington Times that Americans were ''a nation of whiners'' and the country was experiencing a recession that was ''mental'' rather than real. 
 Ms. Fiorina got herself into hot water in September after saying that none of the four candidates on the two national tickets had the experience required to run a large company like hers.

HEADLINE: SENATOR IS GUILTY OVER HIS FAILURES TO DISCLOSE GIFTS

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS; William Yardley contributed reporting from Seattle, and Carl Hulse from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Ted Stevens, Alaska's dominant political figure for more than four decades, was found guilty on Monday by a jury of violating federal ethics laws for failing to report tens of thousands of dollars in gifts and services he had received from friends.
 The jury of District of Columbia residents convicted Mr. Stevens, 84, on all seven felony counts he faced in connection with charges that he knowingly failed to list on Senate disclosure forms the receipt of some $250,000 in gifts and services used to renovate his home in Girdwood, Alaska.
 Mr. Stevens, a consistently grim-faced figure, frowned more deeply as the verdict was delivered by the jury foreman, a worker at a drug counseling center. Mr. Stevens's wife and one of his daughters sat glumly behind him in the courtroom. 
 In a statement issued after he had left the courthouse, Mr. Stevens was defiant, urging Alaskans to re-elect him to a seventh full term next week. 
 He blamed what he called repeated misconduct by federal prosecutors for the verdict. ''I will fight this unjust verdict with every ounce of energy I have,'' he said. 
 ''I am innocent. This verdict is the result of the unconscionable manner in which the Justice Department lawyers conducted this trial,'' he said. ''I ask that Alaskans and my Senate colleagues stand with me as I pursue my rights. I remain a candidate for the United States Senate.''
 Nonetheless, the verdict is widely expected to write an end to Mr. Stevens's long political career, which has moved in tandem with his state's rough-and-tumble journey from a remote territory to an economic powerhouse.
 Mr. Stevens was instrumental in promoting statehood for Alaska when he was a young Interior Department official in the Eisenhower administration and then went on to represent the state in the Senate for 40 years. Over that time, he used his steadily accumulated influence over federal spending, notably using his membership on the Appropriations Committee, to steer millions, perhaps billions, of dollars in federal money to his home state.
 The verdict comes a week before a second jury of sorts, the voters of Alaska, will decide whether to return him to the Senate or elect his Democratic opponent, Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage. After Mr. Stevens's indictment in July, he asked for a quick trial so he might clear his name before Election Day.
 If Mr. Stevens loses his seat, the trial's implications could be felt on a broad political scale, helping Democrats in their drive to win enough seats in the Senate to give them a filibuster-proof majority of at least 60 votes. Within an hour of the verdict's becoming public, Democrats in Senate races around the country immediately sought to make the conviction an issue for their opponents, demanding that those who had received money from Mr. Stevens, who was generous with contributions to his colleagues, return it.
 If Mr. Stevens wins and insists on keeping his seat, his fate will be in the hands of his Senate colleagues. A senator can be expelled only by a two-thirds vote of the entire Senate, so a conviction does not automatically cost a lawmaker his seat. Since 1789, only 15 senators have been expelled, most for supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War, the Senate Web site states.
 In 1982, the Senate Ethics Committee recommended that Senator Harrison A. Williams, Democrat of New Jersey, be expelled because of his conviction on bribery, conspiracy and conflict of interest charges in the Abscam scandal, and in 1995 the committee recommended the expulsion of Senator Robert W. Packwood, Republican of Oregon, for sexual misconduct. Both men resigned before the full Senate could vote.
 Should Mr. Stevens be expelled or resign on his own, the Alaska governor, Sarah Palin, would most likely have to call a special election to fill the vacancy, according to state legal officials.
 Ms. Palin, the Republican nominee for vice president, issued a statement late Monday, saying she was ''confident that Senator Stevens will do what's right for the people of Alaska.'' 
 Governor Palin did not specify what that was. She did ask that the verdict be respected, saying that it ''shines a light on the corrupting influence of the big oil service company that was allowed to control too much of our state. It was part of the culture of corruption I was elected to fight. And that fight must always move forward regardless of party or seniority or even past service.''
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said: ''This verdict is a personal tragedy for our colleague Ted Stevens, but it is an important reminder that no man is above the law. Senator Stevens must now respect the outcome of the judicial process and the dignity of the United States Senate.''
 The Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, issued this statement after the verdict: ''Senator Stevens was found guilty by a jury of his peers, and now must face the consequences of those actions. As a result of his conviction, Senator Stevens will be held accountable so the public trust can be restored.''
 Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of Federal District Court delayed setting a date for sentencing until after a Feb. 25 hearing on motions from Mr. Stevens's lawyers.
 Under complicated guidelines that are no longer mandatory, Judge Sullivan has wide discretion in setting a sentence, although lawyers familiar with the subject said it was difficult to conceive of a situation in which Mr. Stevens would not be required to spend time in jail.
 In addition to his expected appeal, his supporters are also likely to explore the possibility of obtaining a pardon, or some form of executive clemency like a commutation of any sentence, from President Bush, a fellow Republican, before he leaves office.
 The verdict came after more than three weeks of testimony, the highlight of which was Mr. Stevens's taking the calculated risk of testifying in his own defense. 
 Government prosecutors used evidence and testimony to paint a picture of Alaska in which several of Mr. Stevens's wealthy friends, keenly aware of his political status, were eager to shower him with gifts. The indictment charged that he had received some $250,000 in gifts and services from a longtime friend, Bill Allen, the owner of a huge oil services construction company, and gifts from other friends like a sled dog and an expensive massage chair.
 Mr. Allen, who was convicted for his role in a scheme to bribe Alaska state lawmakers to help his oil exploration projects, agreed to cooperate with the government and have his telephone conversations with Mr. Stevens recorded.
 At one time, the two men were friends, thrown together by politics and oil money. Mr. Allen, who was the prosecution's chief witness, testified that Mr. Stevens knew he was receiving the goods and services free and even sent an emissary to ask that no bills be sent.
 Mr. Stevens's defense was largely built on the notion that he had not asked for, and had no use for, many of the goods and services he received. In the case of the massage chair, he said it had not been a gift from Bob Persons, a friend and restaurant owner who had bought it from a Brookstone store and sent it to the Stevenses' Washington home. It was a loan, Mr. Stevens testified, even though it had remained in his Washington home for more than seven years and he once wrote to Mr. Persons that he enjoyed using it and even fell asleep in it.
 Moreover, Mr. Stevens asserted that his wife of 28 years, Catherine, was assigned to oversee the remaking of the Alaska home from a simple A-frame cabin to a grander, two-story residence fitted with two decks, a new garage and amenities like a whirlpool, a steam room and an expensive gas grill.
 The verdict came relatively swiftly. The jury began deliberating last week. But it was obliged to start all over Monday morning when a juror was replaced by an alternate because of the death of a family member. In midafternoon, jurors sent a note saying they had finished their work.

HEADLINE: Rivals Clash Over Taxes As Contest Nears Climax

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and MICHAEL COOPER; Peter Baker reported from Pittsburgh, and Michael Cooper from Dayton, Ohio and Pottsville, Pa. Larry Rohter contributed reporting from Cleveland, and Jack Healy from New York.

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama, making what aides called the ''closing argument'' of his campaign, declared on Monday that it was time to ''get beyond the old ideological debates.'' And then Mr. Obama and his opponent, Senator John McCain, spent much of the day engaged in just such a debate.
 With polls suggesting victory is within his grasp next week, Mr. Obama tried to shift into a final stage, returning to the themes of unity and change that helped propel his unlikely candidacy to the verge of the presidency. He warned of complacency but sounded as if he were laying the ground not just for the election but for an aftermath when he may inherit stewardship of a troubled country. 
 ''We are one week away from changing America,'' Mr. Obama, the Democratic nominee for president, told 15,000 supporters in Mellon Arena here. ''In one week, you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election, that tries to pit region against region, city against town and Republican against Democrat, that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope. In one week's time, at this defining moment in history, you can give this country the change we need.'' 
 But even as Mr. Obama called for ''a new politics,'' at least some of his arguments sounded like old politics familiar to veterans of past class-warfare battles between liberals and conservatives. Mr. Obama castigated Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee, for ''embracing the same old Bush-McCain policies that have failed us for the last eight years'' and for wanting to ''give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.'' 
 Mr. McCain offered the other side of that historic divide, accusing Mr. Obama of wanting to take money from those who have it and give it to those who do not. Mr. McCain seized on a radio interview Mr. Obama gave seven years ago to reinforce the argument that Mr. Obama wants to ''spread the wealth,'' as the Democrat put it on the campaign trail recently. 
 Mr. McCain read aloud part of the radio interview in Dayton, Ohio, in a speech to supporters, who booed the notion of ''redistributive change,'' as Mr. Obama put it. ''That's what change means for the Obama administration -- the Redistributor,'' Mr. McCain said. ''It means taking your money and giving it to someone else. He believes in redistributing wealth, not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs.'' 
 But Mr. McCain mangled his script in Ohio, garbling a line about ''Barack the Redistributor.'' Later, at a feisty rally in Pottsville, Pa., he suggested incorrectly that Mr. Obama's comments had come ''in a radio interview today,'' though they were actually made in 2001. But he nailed his new applause line: ''Senator Obama is running to be redistributionist in chief. I'm running to be commander in chief.'' 
 The two candidates virtually shadowed each other throughout the day as both focused on the contested states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, where the race may be decided. They started their campaign days about 50 miles apart, with Mr. McCain meeting economic advisers in Cleveland and Mr. Obama unveiling his ''closing argument'' speech in Canton, Ohio. 
 From Canton, Mr. Obama headed to Pittsburgh for an early evening rally and ended the day outside Philadelphia. Mr. McCain traveled from Cleveland to Dayton, Ohio, and then later in the day to Pottsville, about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia. 
 Ohio is considered a must-win for any Republican who hopes to capture the White House, while Pennsylvania is vital for a Democrat seeking the presidency. Mr. Obama lost both to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries; Mr. McCain's campaign had hoped to make inroads among working-class voters here skeptical of Mr. Obama. But polls in Pennsylvania show Mr. Obama with a healthy lead there, while the two candidates were running close in Ohio. 
 At the McCain events, supporters dismissed prognostications of defeat and held out hope that the Republicans could turn the situation around. ''This campaign is so doable,'' Jack F. Kemp, the former housing secretary and vice-presidential candidate in 1996, told the crowd in Dayton as he warmed them up for Mr. McCain's speech. 
 For the Obama campaign, the polls are greeted with a mixture of confidence and nervousness, and the candidate made a point, as he often does these days, of warning against overconfidence. ''We cannot let up for one day or one minute or one second in this last week,'' Mr. Obama said here. ''Not now. Not when so much is at stake. One week.'' 
 At the same time, the sense that victory is within reach has grown so powerful for Obama supporters in recent days that the campaign dubbed the new speech ''One Week'' and the candidate's mere uttering of those two words became an applause line Monday. 
 The so-called closing argument sounded much like the opening one, encapsulating the message of change Mr. Obama plans to send throughout his final days of travel and television.
 ''The question in this election is not, 'Are you better off than you were four years ago?' '' Mr. Obama said. ''We know the answer to that. The real question is, 'Will this country be better off four years from now?' ''

HEADLINE: Begging White House For Help

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
Is General Motors too big to fail? 
 Rick Wagoner would sure like us to think so. Mr. Wagoner, the chief executive of the ailing automotive giant, spent most of Friday down in Washington, pressing his case for a government rescue. 
 Yes, G.M. wants our tax dollars too. Banks are getting billions. Insurance companies are getting billions. Why not G.M.? 
 The answer to that question depends on a few crucial points that few people seem willing to talk about, at least publicly: jobs, wages and the United Auto Workers. 
 Mr. Wagoner hopes that one way or another that Washington will help finance a merger of G.M. and Chrysler, salvaging the companies, their employees' livelihoods and his own legacy. He is painting G.M. as too big, too important and too interconnected to fail without dire consequences for the entire economy. 
 G.M., the line goes, is sort of an automotive Lehman Brothers -- and we all know what happened when the government let Lehman go. Mr. Wagoner seems to be trying to whip up enough panic to make government intervention politically palatable.
 G.M. and Chrysler need about $10 billion to make a deal work, and Mr. Wagoner would like the government either to inject capital into the company directly, give it a loan or let G.M. sell troubled financial assets to the Treasury. 
 Or, frankly, a combination of all those things.
 Now, in a Darwinian world, where only the fittest survived, G.M. or Chrysler, maybe even both of them, would be out of business already. G.M.'s share price has plunged 78 percent this year, and is plumbing depths not seen since the 1950s.
 It is a minor miracle that Mr. Wagoner has a job.
 Chrysler has become a major worry for its owner, the buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management, which also owns 49 percent of GMAC, G.M.'s financing arm. Shoring up GMAC and Chrysler Financial, Chrysler's financing unit, would be vital to getting any deal. GMAC might push to become a bank holding company, enabling it to partake in the government's bank rescue. 
 Combining G.M. and Chrysler makes some sense. The savings would amount to as much as $9 billion annually -- almost three times G.M.'s market value now. Without a deal of some sort, one or both will almost certainly go bankrupt. 
 Down in Washington the other day, Mr. Wagoner was tugging on the old heart strings. Americans, he said, take pride in Detroit, according to people briefed on the meetings. Apparently no one pointed out that Detroit has been swallowing its pride for some time now. In any case, on Monday, Mr. Wagoner was still waiting to hear back from the Treasury. 
 The collapse of one of the Big Three might not send losses cascading through the economy, but it would hurt -- a lot. 
 If G.M. or Chrysler were to go under, tens of thousands of people would be thrown out of work. Pensions would be in danger, potentially putting taxpayers on the hook for the bill. Auto suppliers would start defaulting on their debts. Dealers would close. But if General Motors and Chrysler were to merge, with some sort of government assistance, the story might end pretty much the same. The combined company would probably limp along, laying off thousands of people every few years. Then -- bet on it -- G.M.-Chrysler would come back and ask for another bailout. It has happened before: Chrysler was rescued by the government over two decades ago. Now here it is again, cup in hand.
 To make a combined General Motors-Chrysler work -- let alone flourish -- the company would need to do everything that is impolitic. It would have to virtually win big concessions from the U.A.W., cut salaries and benefits, and lay off a lot of people, fast. 
 Oh: and it would also have to make cars that people actually want to buy. Washington cannot help there.
 But unless and until the government is willing to let Detroit make the hard choices that are required -- and change the fundamentals of the industry -- any investment would just be a Band-Aid. The sad thing is that if the companies could've done all of this years ago, they wouldn't need a bailout now. Today, G.M., Chrysler and Ford have the capacity -- workers and plants -- to make about 17 million cars a year, but they sell far fewer. The Big Three are losing about $2 billion a month. 
 Mr. Wagoner has been telling G.M. employees to call Washington to rally support for other industry bailouts. 
 ''The current financial crisis goes far beyond any one industry,'' Mr. Wagoner wrote in an e-mail message to employees earlier this month. ''With each passing day without a solution, the credit markets continue to freeze up, denying consumers and businesses the needed cash for home loans, car loans, small business loans and the critical investments that grow the economy and create jobs.''
 ''Call your respective representative and senators today,'' Mr. Wagoner wrote. He could send the same e-mail message today, this time urging his troops to support a rescue of their own company.

HEADLINE: A Choice And An Echo

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It seems to have taken forever (the seasons have changed, and changed and changed again), but this long presidential campaign is finally coming to an end. In January, with snow blanketing the trail in Iowa and New Hampshire, I wrote of the Barack Obama phenomenon: ''Shake hands with tomorrow. It's here.''
 I didn't mean that Senator Obama would win the election. He still seemed like a long shot to me. But it was clear that the message, style and strategy of his campaign pointed to a new direction for American politics, and that a new generation of voters -- younger, smarter, more diverse, more open-minded -- was anxious to follow his lead. 
 I remember talking with a voter named Debra Gable, who had driven from central Vermont to attend an Obama rally in Derry, N.H. ''I dislike politics,'' she told me, ''because we focus on our differences even though we have so many more commonalities. That's what I think I'm hearing from Obama, so I want to see how he is in person.''
 Ms. Gable had not made up her mind, and the other candidate she was seriously considering -- in a Republican field that was still wide open -- was John McCain.
 This election is hardly over, despite the impulse of the pundits to write the McCain campaign's obituary. But Senator McCain has diminished his chances of winning the presidency in many ways, the most important of which was his failure to grasp the most significant new trend in American politics.
 With the country facing enormous problems (even before the meltdown of the credit and financial markets in recent months), the voters wanted more substance from their candidates. They wanted a greater sense of maturity and a more civil approach to campaigning. They were tired of the politics of personal destruction and the playbook that counseled ''attack, attack, attack.''
 Senator Obama was perfectly suited to this new approach. He told the crowd that trekked through the cold and snow to hear his victory speech at the Iowa caucuses:
 ''You said the time has come to move beyond the bitterness and pettiness and anger that's consumed Washington. To end the political strategy that's been all about division, and instead make it about addition. To build a coalition for change that stretches through red states and blue states.''
 John McCain didn't get it. He seemed as baffled by the new politics as an Al Jolson aficionado trying to make sense of the Beatles. 
 He answered the desire for a higher tone in politics with ads that likened Senator Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton and with attacks that questioned Mr. Obama's patriotism, blamed him for high gasoline prices and all-but-accused him of being a socialist.
 Mr. Obama, said Mr. McCain, would convert the Internal Revenue Service into ''a giant welfare agency.''
 Get it?
 Whether this is admirable or honorable is not the question here. In the current political and economic atmosphere, it seems very much like a roadmap to defeat.
 The heyday of Lee Atwater and Karl Rove is over. Yet Senator McCain handed the reins of his campaign to Rove's worshipful acolytes. With the nation in a high state of anxiety over the conflagration in the credit and financial markets, Senator McCain traveled the country ranting Rovelike about Bill Ayers, trying to instill a bogus belief that the onetime '60s radical and Senator Obama were good buddies and perhaps involved in some nefarious doings together. Senator Obama was about 8 years old when Mr. Ayers was engaged in his nefarious doings.
 It was the classic fear card that the Republicans have played to such brilliant effect for years. But times have changed. (Lately Senator McCain has been obsessively invoking the name of ''Joe the Plumber'' at his campaign appearances, as if that might be the phrase that finally sways the electorate in a way that the Bill Ayers mantra did not.)
 Senator Hillary Clinton helped define the new political atmosphere with her own historic run for the White House. Senator McCain, demonstrating again his tone-deafness to the new reality, tried to capitalize on Mrs. Clinton's remarkable achievement by cynically selecting Sarah Palin, the anti-Hillary, as his running mate.
 Mr. McCain must never have noticed that the public turned overwhelmingly against the Bush administration because of its repeatedly demonstrated incompetence. Now here is Senator McCain, in the midst of a national crisis, with a running mate who is demonstrably incompetent to serve the nation as its president.
 Ms. Palin is a walking affront to the many Republican women (not to mention women in general) who are, in fact, qualified to hold the highest office in the land.
 John McCain could have traveled a higher road. He chose not to. He bet instead on one last gasping triumph of the politics of the past.

HEADLINE: CenturyTel to Buy Embarq For $5.76 Billion in Stock

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
CenturyTel, a provider of local phone and Internet services, agreed on Monday to buy Embarq, its larger rival and a spinoff from Sprint Nextel, for about $5.76 billion in stock, in one of the first significant nonfinancial mergers since the onset of the recent market turbulence. 
 The deal successfully ends efforts by Embarq to sell itself. CenturyTel's offer of 1.37 shares for each Embarq share represented a 36 percent premium over Friday's closing price of $40.42, the companies said.
 ''We expect that bringing Embarq and CenturyTel together will accelerate both companies' strategic plans, diversify our revenues and provide us with the expanded networks, expertise and financial resources to build long-term value for shareholders,'' Glen F. Post III, CenturyTel's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement Monday.
 Embarq, which runs the original landline services of Sprint Nextel, hired JPMorgan Chase and put itself up for sale at perhaps the worst possible time, September, amid the financial crisis. Faced with the shriveling of the debt markets, which made deal financing virtually unobtainable, CenturyTel decided to make an all-stock bid. 
 Shares in CenturyTel fell 13.2 percent to $25.62 on Monday, making the deal worth about $5 billion at the closing price. Including Embarq's $5.8 billion in debt, the merger is valued at nearly $11 billion.
 Shares in Embarq rose about 2 percent to $30.38.
 Both companies have also sought to combine amid a growing wave of consolidation, as industry executives and analysts agree that bigger is increasingly better. Local phone companies have faced increasing pressure as more subscribers drop their landlines and as cable companies offer their own Internet access services.
 That was reflected in the earnings of both companies, also announced on Monday. CenturyTel reported $82.8 million in third-quarter profit, a 23.5 percent drop from the period a year ago that the company attributed in part to the loss of local phone service customers. 
 Embarq reported $160 million in third-quarter profit, a slight gain from a year ago. While it also lost local phone service customers, its gains in high-speed Internet subscribers offset those losses.
 The new corporation, whose name has not yet been determined, will have its headquarters in Monroe, La., where CenturyTel is based, though both companies said they would maintain a ''significant presence'' in Embarq's home of Overland Park, Kan. 
 Mr. Post will be chief executive of the merged company, while his counterpart at Embarq, Thomas A. Gerke, will be executive vice chairman. The board will include eight CenturyTel directors and seven Embarq directors.
 CenturyTel said it would refinance Embarq's bank debt through commitments from Bank of America, Barclays, Morgan Stanley and SunTrust. 
 Among the advisers are several former Lehman Brothers bankers, working for the first time under the Barclays Capital name since the investment bank collapsed in September. Barclays Capital acquired Lehman's capital markets operations out of bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Idealists and a Green Agenda

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Google, the Internet search and advertising giant, is increasingly looking to the energy sector as a potential business opportunity. 
 From its beginning, the company has invested millions of dollars in making its own power-hungry data centers more efficient. Its philanthropic arm has made small investments in clean energy technologies. 
 But in recent weeks, Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, has hinted at the company's broad interest in the energy business. He also joined Jeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric's chief executive, to announce that they would collaborate on policies and technologies aimed at improving the electricity grid. The effort could include offering tools for consumers. 
 Meanwhile, engineers at Google are hoping to unveil soon tools that could help consumers make better decisions about their energy use. 
 And while the company's philanthropic unit, Google.org, has invested in clean energy start-ups like one that uses kites to harness wind power, Google is now considering large investments in projects that generate electricity from renewable sources. 
 ''We want to make money, and we want to have impact,'' said Dan W. Reicher, director for climate change and energy initiatives at Google.org. 
 The timing could be off. With a recession looming and oil prices dropping, investors might pressure Google to curtail its clean energy ambitions. 
 Google's shares have lost more than half their value in the last year, and some analysts complain that the company has a long history of dabbling in new initiatives with mixed results. It still relies on one business -- small text ads that appear next to search results and on other sites -- for the bulk of its earnings. 
 And Google's online success does not guarantee success in the energy business.
 But none of this has deterred Google from going deeper into the alternative energy business. To support its efforts, it has hired a growing number of engineers who are conducting research in renewable energy, former government energy officials, scientists and even a former NASA astronaut, whose hands-on experience with all sorts of electronic gadgets is being put to use to develop energy tools for consumers.
 ''They are a high-profile actor in the energy field,'' said Daniel M. Kammen, a professor in the energy and resources group at the University of California, Berkeley, and an adviser on energy to the Obama campaign. ''Google is in the lead in terms of human resources as well as money.''
 Last year, Google unveiled an ambitious initiative called RE C, denoting its goal to develop renewable energy that is cheaper than coal. Since then, much of the public focus on the initiative has been in the approximately $45 million in investments that Google.org has made in wind, solar and geothermal energy start-ups. 
 That effort now also includes a small but growing group of engineers at Google who are conducting their own research and development in those technologies, which Google said it might commercialize in the future. 
 Google.org also announced a project last year to develop plug-in hybrids. To make them widely available, the electrical grid would have to be upgraded so that cars could be plugged in at multiple locations, where they could be recharged and consumers billed. 
 Google now says it is interested in developing technologies to support some of those upgrades, as well as other tools at the intersection of energy and information technology, like ''smart'' electrical meters. The partnership with G.E. is aimed in part at exploring some of those opportunities. 
 Google has also increased its lobbying in Washington on energy issues. And the company is looking at larger investments in renewable energy projects that would be primarily motivated by their profit potential, not their environmental promise. 
 How far Google plans to go with its energy efforts, the company does not yet know, or at least is not willing to say.
 ''We have been debating, 'What are the business opportunities for Google in this area,' '' Mr. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, said recently. ''And I think right now, we would answer the question that our primary mission is one of information.'' 
 Mr. Schmidt said that Google would be active in ''information businesses or communications businesses'' related to energy. Speaking more broadly about the energy sector, he added, ''As to whether we will be in these other businesses, we will see.''
 Google is known for stealth. The search engine company kept its advertising ambitions under wraps for years, a strategy that helped it become the dominant tech company in Silicon Valley. And with $14.5 billion in cash in the company's coffers, it has plenty of resources to keep making further investments in new energy ventures.
 Google's efforts in the energy area remain relatively modest. The company has long said it assigns 70 percent of its resources to its core search and advertising business, another 20 percent to related business, like various Internet applications, and 10 percent to long-term, strategic projects. Its energy work falls in the last group.
 But even that may be too much for some investors. 
 ''With the stock cut in half and shareholders becoming increasingly frustrated, a lot of these initiatives are going to be called into question,'' said Ross Sandler, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ''Google is a search and advertising company. We are in a belt-tightening period. They should focus on the core business.''
 And others still are raising questions about some of the company's goals. 
 ''The Silicon Valley guys have this idea that we are going to make solar cheaper than coal,'' said John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. ''To me that's the wrong idea. I don't think it needs to be cheaper than coal to be successful. The focus needs to be on the investment and deployment of the technology.''
 Google's commercial and philanthropic interest in energy emerged, in large part, from the intersection of its idealism and its business goals. 
 ''The issue globally, and particularly in the U.S., is that renewable energy is hard to come by and is expensive,'' said William E. Weihl, Google's green energy director. ''But as a competitive business, we can't afford, anymore than anyone else, to say we are going to pay more.''
 Google has gone to great lengths to conceal how much electricity it uses in its data centers. For instance, Google agreed to build a $600 million data center in Oklahoma only after the State Legislature passed a law exempting public utilities from disclosing the energy use of their largest customers. Google has also vowed to be carbon neutral, but unlike its rival Yahoo, for instance, it has refused to reveal its overall carbon emissions. 
 Google said that its power use was information that could be used by rivals to learn secrets of its operations, which it considered a competitive advantage.
 Still, a picture of the scale of its data center operations has emerged through various reports. The company is believed to have about two dozen data centers around the world of various sizes. Some, like the one it built in The Dalles, Ore., which is largely powered by hydroelectricity, are among the largest in the industry. Two people familiar with that facility, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that it was operating at about 50 megawatts -- enough to power 37,500 homes -- but was built to handle even more capacity. 
 Google's desire to better align its idealism and business interests helped motivate the REC project. 
 ''For us to clean our energy supply, we need renewable energy available more broadly and more cheaply than it is today,'' Mr. Weihl said. 
 Google does not maintain a strict divide between the energy work of the corporation and Google.org. A recent status meeting included employees from both sides. Google.org was set up not as a traditional philanthropy, but rather as a Google unit that could profit from its investments and that, unlike traditional nonprofit organizations and foundations, was allowed to lobby. 
 Google's business development executives, as well as some company engineers specializing in energy, work with Google.org to make investment decisions. Mr. Reicher, a former assistant secretary of energy for conservation and renewable energy in the Clinton administration, said that Google.org investments were primarily aimed at pushing an environmental agenda. But Google itself is eyeing more capital-intensive projects, including some to generate renewable energy on a commercial scale. 
 ''If we make those investments,'' Mr. Reicher said, ''it would be largely from a profit motive rather than an impact motive.''

HEADLINE: New to Campaigning, but No Longer a Novice

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio 

 BODY:
On a visit to her husband's campaign office here the other day, Michelle Obama was handed a phone and a script of talking points and made calls to a few undecided voters. Mrs. Obama mixed policy on taxes and health care with chitchat about Ohio, laughter about her life in politics and tidbits about her family.
 After a couple of calls, she realized that she had not been following the typewritten notes. ''I didn't look at the script,'' she said, speaking more to herself than to the volunteers on the phones next to her.
 But no matter. While some of Senator Barack Obama's advisers once viewed Mrs. Obama as an unpredictable force who sometimes spoke her mind a little too much, she is now regarded within the campaign as a disciplined and effective advocate for her husband. She has also, advisers believe, gone a long way toward addressing her greatest unstated challenge: making more voters comfortable with the idea of a black first lady. 
 Mrs. Obama and her aides have carefully chosen her appearances on the national stage this fall, mostly selecting high-profile venues that are politically safe. Joking Monday night with Jay Leno on ''The Tonight Show,'' she told of her older daughter's ordering Mr. Obama not to ''mess with my TV'' regarding his 30-minute commercial on Wednesday night, which will pre-empt some shows. She also expressed some sympathy for Gov. Sarah Palin over the recent wardrobe controversy, while noting that the Obamas bought their own clothes.
 By the standards of a national political campaign, Mrs. Obama does maintain a somewhat limited schedule. (She has stumped outside Chicago on 20 of the 57 days since Labor Day, the traditional start of the fall election season.) Most of the time she is at home taking care of the couple's 10- and 7-year-old daughters, a choice that advisers hope will pay dividends among women of all races who can relate to her priorities.
 But when she is at political events -- occasionally with Mr. Obama, though much more often on her own -- she is drawing large crowds, speaking with new confidence and generally avoiding gaffes as she confronts one of the trickiest tasks in the campaign. Many voters view first families as symbols of the nation, and Mrs. Obama is selling a package that for large numbers of Americans poses a real change.
 Addressing a raucous rally in a gym here on Friday, Mrs. Obama had the crowd -- a mix of a few thousand black and white voters -- laughing and cheering throughout.
 ''So many precious little babies like that one!'' she said after noticing one infant near the stage. ''Just completely delicious!'' 
 The audience roared with delight. And many clapped, too, when she said: ''I also come here as a mother; that is my primary title, mom in chief. My girls are the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I think about when I go to bed. When people ask me how I'm doing, I say, 'I'm only as good as my most sad child.' ''
 In one sign of the campaign's confidence in her, Mrs. Obama is being deployed where it matters most. Since Labor Day, she has spent three days campaigning in Florida and two days each in Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as days in other swing states (sometimes two in a day).
 She usually holds rallies (her biggest was with 11,000 people in Gainesville, Fla., last week) or small round tables on the needs of working women and military families, the two groups she speaks about the most. On Saturday, she delivered the Democratic Party's weekly radio address, urging her husband's supporters to turn out on Election Day.
 As first lady, Obama advisers say, Mrs. Obama would focus first on her family and then on the issues facing women and military spouses as those groups deal with the economic crisis and the return of troops from Iraq. She also plans to take up national service as an issue, aides say. She will not have a major policy role, they say, and does not plan to have an office in the West Wing.
 Advisers to the spouses of past Democratic nominees -- Teresa Heinz Kerry in 2004, Tipper Gore in 2000, Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1992 -- say they spent more time campaigning in the fall than has Mrs. Obama. All their children were older, however, and Mrs. Kerry and Mrs. Clinton were often sent to secondary media markets, because they were unpopular with some undecided voters and independents.
 Chris Lehane, an adviser and spokesman for the Gore campaign, said Mrs. Gore traveled constantly in the fall of 2000, and he described a somewhat larger traveling retinue than Mrs. Obama has. (She is accompanied by a handful of aides and a Secret Service contingent, but there is no press corps on her plane.)
 Echoing private comments of some Obama advisers, Mr. Lehane said he believed that the Obama campaign had been unsure at first about Mrs. Obama's potential appeal, in part because of some early missteps and in part because of the novelty of a black woman's auditioning for the role of first lady.
 ''My sense,'' Mr. Lehane said, ''is that the campaign was initially apprehensive, because they recognized that she was going to be treated unfairly and held to a hard-to-meet standard.''
 Indeed, for months Mrs. Obama was a political target. A Fox News anchor referred to an affectionate fist bump between the Obamas as a ''terrorist fist jab.'' Republicans, including Cindy McCain, criticized her for saying in February that ''for the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.'' (They omitted the words that followed: ''And not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change.'') A blogger supporting Senator Clinton spread an unfounded rumor that Mrs. Obama had once used the word ''whitey.''
 The Obamas' need to deal with race as a factor in the campaign came to the fore this spring as Mr. Obama confronted incendiary remarks by his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., who had married the couple and baptized their children. As the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya, Mr. Obama has often drawn on his biracial experience to help bridge racial divides. Mrs. Obama does not have that background to draw on, making her political challenge that much more complex.
 David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist, said in an interview that Mrs. Obama, not being a politician, had gone through a period of ''getting comfortable'' with campaigning. She learned a great deal on her own, Mr. Axelrod said, noting that aides had not had to tell her to avoid fist bumps or remarks like ''proud of my country'' in the future.
 ''I didn't think she needed to be told,'' he said. ''She is very, very smart and sensitive, and I think she learned from experience that in this business, you have to be very precise with your words so people don't misinterpret them. That's part of the learning experience. There's no question that she's learned.''
 Still, the Obama campaign has limited interviews that would entail tough questions from national newspapers and cable news programs. ''There is not one vote she will get from doing Wolf Blitzer,'' an aide said. 
 Instead, she has appeared several times on the morning network programs and on entertainment shows like ''The View,'' ''Ellen,'' ''The Daily Show,'' ''Rachael Ray'' and, twice each, ''Access Hollywood'' and ''Entertainment Tonight.''
 If Mrs. Obama is not as blunt as she once was (in describing some of her husband's habits, for instance), she is by no means hiding herpersonality, either. On ''The Tonight Show,'' she noted that she and her husband still sparred privately like the lawyers they are, and added: ''You want to know how Barack prepares for a debate? He hangs out with me, and he's ready.''
 At the Akron rally, she drew appreciative laughter from many in the audience when, her voice at once growing hushed and yet rising in pitch, she referred to her husband as ''baby'' while sharing an anecdote. 
 ''My assumption,'' she said, ''is that Barack Obama is going to be the underdog until he is sitting in the Oval Office. At the start of this, I said to him, 'Look, baby, you can do a lot of things.' He believes he can do a whole lot. If he works hard, he can change the world.''
 But, she added, if he is to win, he needs for his supporters to be sure to vote. The audience erupted in applause.

HEADLINE: McCain Campaign Cites Comments in 2001 on Courts in Attack on Obama

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FALCONE

 BODY:
The McCain campaign and Republicans on Monday seized on a seven-year-old interview that Senator Barack Obama gave about the courts and civil rights, contending it provided further evidence of Mr. Obama's extremist economic positions. 
 Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee, pounced on the interview, which Mr. Obama gave on Chicago Public Radio in 2001.
 At a rally in Dayton, Ohio, Mr. McCain said the interview showed that Mr. Obama ''believes in redistributing wealth, not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs.'' In doing so, Mr. McCain continued to strike a campaign theme that began with an exchange that Mr. Obama had with ''Joe the Plumber'' on Oct. 12 about taxes.
 The interview with Mr. Obama, which made the rounds on conservative Web sites in an edited form on Monday and was posted on YouTube, probed his views on the civil rights-era Supreme Court. At the time, Mr. Obama was a state senator and professor at the University of Chicago Law School. He said the Warren Court, as it was known, ''never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth.'' 
 Further into the interview, Mr. Obama seemed to lament that the civil rights movement became intensively battled in the courts and never took the grassroots steps to achieve ''redistributive change.'' 
 ''One of the, I think, the tragedies of the civil rights movement was because the civil rights movement became so court-focused, I think there was a tendency to lose track of the political and community organizing and activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributive change,'' he said. ''And in some ways we still suffer from that.''
 Mr. Obama did not express regret that the courts did not take steps to spread wealth, as Republicans contended. But neither did he speak dismissively in the interview about the concept, according to the edited tape. 
 ''Any three of us sitting here could come up with a rationale for bringing about economic change through the courts,'' Mr. Obama added, ''I think that as a practical matter that our institutions are just poorly equipped to do it.''
 His spokesman Bill Burton emphasized that point in a statement on Monday.
 ''This is a fake news controversy drummed up by the all-too-common alliance of Fox News, the Drudge Report and John McCain, who apparently decided to close out his campaign with the same false, desperate attacks that have failed for months,'' Mr. Burton said. ''In this seven-year-old interview, Senator Obama did not say that the courts should get into the business of redistributing wealth at all.''
 David E. Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University who has been critical of Mr. Obama in the past, noted that Mr. Obama's comments amounted to a criticism of ''the strategy pursued by the elite lawyers of the 1960s to constitutionalize welfare rights.'' However, he said it was typical of Mr. Obama to be so vague as to leave open to interpretation whether the critique was philosophical or pragmatic.

HEADLINE: Rate of Nuclear Thefts 'Disturbingly High,' Monitoring Chief Says

BYLINE: By NEIL MACFARQUHAR

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a speech on Monday that the number of reports of nuclear or radioactive material stolen around the world last year was ''disturbingly high.'' 
 Dr. ElBaradei, in his annual report to the General Assembly, said nearly 250 such thefts were reported in the year ending in June. 
 ''The possibility of terrorists obtaining nuclear or other radioactive material remains a grave threat,'' he said. ''Equally troubling is the fact that much of this material is not subsequently recovered.''
 Members of Dr. ElBaradei's staff and outside experts cautioned that the amount of missing material remained relatively small. If all the stolen material were lumped together, it would not be enough to build even one nuclear device, they said. 
 It is also unclear if the rising number of reports of stolen material stems from a growing market for radioactive goods or more vigilant reporting of thefts by member states. 
 However, the idea that there might be a new market for such material is of concern, they said, especially if some of it were to end up in a dirty bomb.
 The threat from such a bomb is less a health risk from radiation than from the panic an attack would probably cause, said Cristina Hansell, a professor at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, in Monterey, Calif. 
 Most of the concern about thefts centers on the countries of the former Soviet Union, where nuclear programs were widespread, but they occur everywhere. 
 In a typical case, Ms. Hansell said, an oil company reported last May that a device containing radioactive material that was used in exploration in Sudan was missing.
 It would take long exposure to the device to create any health risk, she said. ''What will kill you from a dirty bomb is the immediate explosion, not the radioactivity,'' she said, noting that the main concern was that despite the attention devoted to trying to police such material, the amount disappearing keeps rising. ''There still seems to be quite a big problem.''
 Aside from the issue of thefts, Dr. ElBaradei said he hoped that North Korea, which left the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003, would return, and he criticized Iran for impeding the agency's attempts to verify whether it was developing nuclear weapons. 
 Sin Sang-chol, a North Korean representative to the United Nations, accused the monitoring agency of spying on his country at the behest of Washington and called its position ''prejudiced and unfair.''
 The Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Khazaee, defended his country's nuclear development program as peaceful while lashing out at Israel for its creating a weapons program outside the nonproliferation treaty framework. 
 It is widely assumed that Israel has nuclear weapons, but the Israeli government has never acknowledged it.
 Mr. Khazaee called the policy of trying to force Iran to stop nuclear enrichment before starting negotiations on economic and other incentives ''an irrational and failed policy.''

MEANEST STREETS
 For Those on Foot
 Queens Boulevard, once nicknamed Boulevard of Death because 72 pedestrians died in accidents there from 1993 to 2001, has gotten much safer -- in part because of traffic safety improvements announced in 2004. That's the good news. 
 The bad news: Third Avenue and Broadway in Manhattan are now the city's deadliest streets for pedestrians, according to an analysis released on Tuesday by the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a policy watchdog organization. 
 From 2005 to 2007, Third Avenue and Broadway were each the site of 10 fatal accidents to pedestrians.
 The study found that the deadliest route in the New York metropolitan region was on Long Island: Hempstead Turnpike (Route 24) in Nassau County, particularly where the road passes through Elmont, Franklin Square and Hempstead. Fifteen pedestrians were killed along a 15-mile stretch of the turnpike from 2005 to 2007. 
 The second-deadliest road was Sunrise Highway (Route 27/39), in Suffolk County, with 12 fatalities, followed by Third Avenue and Broadway in Manhattan.
 Four roads in the region had nine fatalities each: Grand Central Parkway in Queens; Hylan Boulevard on Staten Island; Whitehorse Pike (Route 30) in Atlantic County, N.J.; and Route 130, Burlington County, N.J.
 ''The most dangerous roads are either extremely busy urban roads, such as Third Avenue in Manhattan, that handle many pedestrians and cars,'' said Michelle Ernst, a staff analyst with the transportation group.

HEADLINE: Climate of Confusion in Other Series

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
As with financial crises and crucial elections, it is tempting to view the current World Series rain mayhem as particularly historic. But the Series has been down roads far more wet -- and bumpy -- than this, complete with accusations of cheating, television posturing and, almost 100 years ago, labor strife.
 The granddaddy of all World Series rainouts took place in 1911 in Philadelphia, naturally. Weather delayed Game 4 for an entire week. And the rest of the series was not nearly as eventful as the gameless break. 
 Hostilities were already high as the Philadelphia Athletics and the New York Giants traveled back to Philadelphia's Shibe Park with the A's leading, two games to one. Christy Mathewson, the Giants' otherwise gentlemanly ace, had accused A's groundskeepers of wetting the infield in Game 2 to slow down New York's famous running game. In what was perhaps a related incident, the Giants' Fred Snodgrass spiked the popular A's third baseman Frank Baker and left him a bloody mess.
 When Game 4 was called twice by rain so hard that one person suggested covering the field with oil and setting it afire -- Connie Mack, the A's manager and owner, demurred because he did not want to hurt the grass -- Snodgrass found himself trapped in a less-than-friendly city of Philadelphia. Furious Baker fans gathered outside the Giants' hotel and threatened him whenever he emerged; Giants Manager John McGraw finally told Snodgrass to take the train back to New York until play resumed.
 ''The absence of Snodgrass from the Majestic Hotel, the Giants' headquarters, set a wild rumor afloat this afternoon that an irate fan had attempted to shoot Snodgrass,'' The New York Times reported. Another false rumor centered around whether Baker's spike wounds had become infected and caused blood poisoning.
 This was not even the last controversy of the week, during which Giants players grumbled about McGraw's interrupting billiards and card games by making them work out to stay sharp. During the delay, the National Commission, the era's version of Major League Baseball, ordered players on both clubs to pose for a motion-picture company that would distribute the film to theaters over the winter. Several Giants refused to participate without any cut of the profits.
 ''Baseball with them is a business, they say, and they don't propose to furnish pictorial entertainment for the whole country just for the love of having their pictures taken,'' The Times reported. The dispute was apparently resolved, and the A's finally won the series in six games.
 The next lengthy delay in a World Series came in 1962, after Game 5 between the San Francisco Giants and the Yankees was postponed in New York for a day. (One teenage Yankees fan complained that by attending four previous World Series games at the Stadium, he had run out of grandparent-funeral excuses for missing school.) Game 5 was played the next day, and the Yankees took a three-games-to-two lead, but a torrential set of storms greeted the two teams after they flew back to San Francisco.
 Yankees Manager Ralph Houk was able to move Whitey Ford up to Game 6 because of the first day's delay. 
 ''Ford will pitch this upcoming sixth game come hell or high water,'' Houk said, looking out on increasingly high water as the weather did not let up.
 Trapped in their hotel rooms for another day because of strong rain and 40-mile-per-hour winds, players complained that they might as well have been on Alcatraz. When the game was postponed for a third day -- in bright sunshine -- because Candlestick Park was too waterlogged, both teams drove 80 miles east to Modesto to work out.
 Ford actually lost Game 6, 5-2, setting up a climactic Game 7. That turned out to be one of baseball's most exciting games, with the Yankees' Ralph Terry beating the Giants, 1-0, and the game ending with Willie McCovey's lineout to Bobby Richardson.
 Coincidentally, another of baseball's greatest games had soggy roots in the rain: Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, won by the Boston Red Sox in the bottom of the 12th on Carlton Fisk's home run.
 The Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds arrived in Boston to a nor'easter and waited as Friday's scheduled Game 6 was postponed two days in a row. On Sunday, when clearing seemed imminent but Fenway Park remained drenched, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn had to decide whether to try playing the next night -- squarely against ''All in the Family'' on CBS and a new sensation called ''Monday Night Football'' on ABC -- or postpone Game 6 all the way to Tuesday.
 When Kuhn told the Times columnist Red Smith that he preferred night games ''to better accommodate the fans,'' Smith accused M.L.B. of kowtowing to the networks.
 ''Exposing cash customers to raw night cold is a novel way of accommodating them,'' Smith said. ''Accommodating TV sponsors at prime time is something else again.''
 Meanwhile, with Fisk still just a good catcher and not yet a New England icon, the Reds decided to try to stay sharp by working out inside Dussault Cage at Cousens Gymnasium on the campus of Tufts University. While pitchers worked off a portable mound plopped down on the running track, Pete Rose and Joe Morgan bashed line drives into fishnets hung from the ceiling.
 Why Tufts? Reds Manager Sparky Anderson was asked.
 ''I think Harvard would be a little over my head,'' he replied.
 The sky over everyone's heads soon cleared, and the Series played on.

HEADLINE: Whirlpool, Its Earnings Down, Plans More Job Cuts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- The Whirlpool Corporation, the home appliance maker, said Tuesday that it would cut about 5,000 jobs by the end of 2009 because of the global credit crisis and its expectation for continued reductions in demand in North America and Europe. 
 The company also reported that its earnings fell 7 percent in the third quarter on lower unit volumes and higher material costs. Whirlpool lowered its earnings outlook for the year.
 ''The global credit crisis has had a profound negative impact on what was already a weakening and very fragile global economy,'' Jeffrey M. Fettig, the chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ''Declining home values, rising unemployment and very low consumer confidence levels will likely prolong a negative demand environment at least through the middle of 2009.''
 The company, based in Benton Harbor, Mich., earned $163 million, or $2.15 a share, for the quarter, compared with $175 million, or $2.20, in the period a year earlier.
 Revenue rose 1 percent, to $4.9 billion, from $4.8 billion.
 Analysts surveyed by ThomsonReuters expected, on average, earnings of $1.69 a share on revenue of $5 billion.
 Whirlpool said it expected a profit of $5.75 to $6 a share for 2008, compared with its previous estimate of $7 to $7.50 a share.
 The job cuts include positions being eliminated from plant closings that the company already announced this year along with new reductions taking place now and through the end of next year. Whirlpool, whose brands include Maytag, KitchenAid and Jenn-Air, said it had 73,000 employees worldwide.
 Since January, Whirlpool has announced the shutdown of plants in LaVergne, Tenn.; Oxford, Miss.; Puebla, Mexico; and Reynosa, Mexico, for a loss of about 2,000 jobs.
 The company said it also would shutter its plant in Jackson, Tenn., and shift production from there to its plant in Findlay, Ohio, eliminating about 500 positions.
 It also will cut approximately 500 salaried jobs throughout North America, including both full-time and contractor positions.
 Another 1,900 jobs will be cut overseas, mostly in Europe.
 The cuts are expected to produce annual savings of $275 million, Whirlpool said. It now anticipates reorganization expenses of about $170 million in 2008, compared with its previous estimate of $100 million.

HEADLINE: Ex-Militia Chief From Haiti Is Sentenced to Up to 37 Years for Fraud

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
A former Haitian paramilitary leader accused by human rights groups of committing murder and torture in Haiti was sentenced on Tuesday to as many as 37 years in prison for his role in a mortgage fraud scheme in Brooklyn that bilked lenders out of more than $1 million. 
In his sentencing remarks, Justice Abraham G. Gerges of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn linked the defendant, Emmanuel Constant, to the American foreclosure crisis and the current global economic turmoil.
''This case, while serious in and of itself, takes on an added resonance given the current global financial crisis,'' the judge said. ''While the defendant and his confederates cannot be held accountable for the nationwide economic meltdown and the foreclosure crisis, this scheme, and others like it, have played a role in the situation.''
In the fraud, Mr. Constant and his collaborators used straw home buyers, falsified information on loan applications and inflated appraisals to cheat lenders.
The ''defendant was a full and active participant in this scheme,'' Justice Gerges said, adding that he found it interesting that Mr. Constant showed no remorse for the crimes he committed.
The sentence calls for a prison term of 12 1/3 to 37 years.
Mr. Constant's lawyer, Samuel Karliner, said he planned to file a notice of appeal on Wednesday.
Human rights groups have accused Mr. Constant, known as Toto, of running a paramilitary group in the early 1990s that raped, tortured or killed thousands of people in Haiti in an effort to silence loyalists of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was toppled in a coup in 1991.
When Mr. Aristide returned to power in 1994, Mr. Constant fled Haiti and surfaced in the United States, where he lived in Queens and worked as a real estate agent until 2006, when he was jailed in the fraud case.
He was convicted in July on six counts of fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records.
Mr. Constant pleaded guilty in 2007 to involvement in a similar scheme on Long Island. He was sentenced to one to three years in that case.
In a statement prior to the sentencing on Tuesday, the prosecutor, Thomas Schellhammer, an assistant deputy attorney general, urged the judge to consider Mr. Constant's ''past criminal conduct'' in Haiti in determining the penalty. ''Those were extraordinary evils,'' Mr. Schellhammer said.
In response, Mr. Karliner implored the judge to base his sentence only on the crimes at issue in the New York case. ''We punish people for what they have done on our soil,'' he said.
Mr. Constant also addressed the judge, saying that his role in the mortgage fraud scheme was ''completely minimal.'' He said that he had been unfairly accused of crimes in Haiti. ''No one ever witnessed Emmanuel Constant promoting violence,'' he said. ''I've always promoted reconciliation and peace.''
Justice Gerges said he hoped that Mr. Constant would remain in the State of New York to serve out his sentence but that federal officials may move to deport him.
While the judge mentioned Mr. Constant's past in Haiti, noting his ''truly heinous record of violence, murder, torture and intimidation,'' he did not explicitly say he had weighed this history in his evaluation of a sentence.

HEADLINE: Helping the Homeless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Crises on Many Fronts,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Oct. 25): 
 During these fragile and uncertain economic times, we'll certainly be seeing thousands upon thousands more people teetering on the precipice, falling into homelessness. Just think back to the days of the 2001 economic slump when homelessness in New York City dramatically increased.
 By the fall of 2002, more than 16,000 children were living in city homeless shelters, setting an all-time record. So Bob Herbert is absolutely correct. We also need to be deeply concerned about how this financial turmoil will affect the most vulnerable among us -- people who were barely getting by before. 
 The shrinking economy will undoubtedly mean less public and private financing for critical services and fewer jobs for our neighbors in need. But deep budget cuts -- which may appear on their face prudent -- have historically proved to be fiscally unwise. 
 The loss of services only manages to push people further into poverty and homelessness, costing taxpayers millions more. Arnold S. Cohen

HEADLINE: Making Secular Art Out of Religious Imagery

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Somewhere between Pollock and Pop, new art developed an allergy to the word spiritual unless it was attached to ethnicity. It was O.K. to make altars in galleries if you were Mexican-American -- in fact, you were sort of required to -- but if you were plain old American, no.
 Yet on the fringes, where the most together thinking tends to take place, there was resistance to this bias. In the late 1960s the American poet Ishmael Reed coined the term Neo-HooDoo to describe an aesthetic that was devotional without being dogmatically religious, ritual-related without having prescribed forms, and rooted both outside and inside the Western mainstream. 
 Mr. Reed's concept, which riffed on African religious practices transmitted to the New World, embraced incantatory poetry, hypnotic popular music and art that was activist in an emotional, political and formal sense. Now it lends its name to a quiet, meditative, spare-to-the-point-of-thin-looking exhibition, ''NeoHooDoo: Art for a Forgotten Faith,'' at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Queens. 
 The 30 artists in the show cover three generations and a wide swath of the Americas, from Brazil to Canada. Most are familiar from other shows on similar themes; more fresh faces would have been welcome. And although all the work is secular, some of it draws heavily on religious imagery. 
 Amalia Mesa-Bains, a Chicana artist living in California, has assembled a room-size altar adorned with family photographs, fragrant herbs, bottled elixirs and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe, on an art-as-healing model that she has been developing for years. 
 Jose Bedia, a practitioner of the Afro-Cuban religion Palo Monte, contributes a different kind of altar, ''Things That Drag Me Along.'' An elaborated version of a piece he first created years ago, it has two parts. A painting of a double-headed deity fills a wall. Iron chains extend from its chest to a wooden boat sitting on the gallery floor and packed with symbolic objects -- African, Christian and American Indian -- as if for a journey.
 Michael Tracy's ''Cross of the Sacred Peace'' (1980) is also a carrier of spiritual matter. A bulky wooden cruciform on a gilded base, it is encrusted with Mexican votive charms and pierced, like an African power figure, with energy-releasing spikes and swords. 
 Mr. Tracy, who lives in Texas near the Mexican border and whose work comes straight from a Roman Catholic upbringing, had a retrospective at P.S. 1 in the late 1980s. A lot of people had no idea how to deal with his operatically devotional art at the time, and it has been little seen in New York since. It's good to have him back.
 Black Atlantic culture, the vital, nurturing, agitated link between Africa and the Americas, plays a significant role in the show. It is explicit in Radcliffe Bailey's ''Storm at Sea'' (2006), with its wavelike crescent of piano keys anchored at one end by a miniature black ship sparkling with glitter and at the other by a sculpture of the Yoruba god of war. 
 This bond is the subtext of Terry Adkins's feather-headdress homage to Bessie Smith and of Sanford Biggers's ''Ghetto Bird Tunic,'' a plumed North Face-style parka fit for a danced masquerade. And it is the essence of Betye Saar's talismanic little sorcerer's shrine from 1972, the earliest piece here, and George Smith's black steel wall sculpture, hanging high on a wall, its circular, spiraling shape a reference to Dogon cosmology.
 There are lots of circles in the show, from James Lee Byars's large gilded-brass ''Halo'' (1985) to ''Haloes,'' a bracelet-shaped floor sculpture of circular fluorescent lights by the Brazilian artist Marcos Reis Peixoto, who goes by the name Marepe. David Hammons's wheel-shaped sculpture made from wine bottles speaks as much about cycles of compulsion as of elevation. 
 The same mixed message comes from Nari Ward's ''Liquorsoul,'' a neon shop sign ornamented with plastic flowers and sliced-up shoes. It's like a memorial to lives lost. So, in another way, is Jimmie Durham's ''Street Level Treatise on Money and Work,'' a display of found scraps of paper -- receipts, notes, labels -- neatly framed and hung on a wall with the kind of ritualistic care we give to the perishable junk we call art.
 The most startling and moving work, though, involves ritualistic performances captured in photographs or on film. In three short videos made in response to specific incidents of political violence, the Guatemalan artist Regina Jose Galindo submits herself to waterboarding, stun-gun assault and attack by a fire hose. Rebecca Belmore, a Canadian artist of Native American descent, used digital manipulation to mark the bare back of a female model with ritual scarring in the form of a decorative fringe associated with Indian clothing.
 In another video the American artist Michael Joo undergoes a self-imposed endurance test that leaves his body caked with salt. But the ordeal comes to a benign resolution: as the artist sits motionless in an alpine meadow, wild deer approach and lick the salt from his skin. 
 It is hard not to see Mr. Joo's Franciscan tableau in a sacramental light: after we've watched him crawl and scrape his way across salt-covered earth, it comes as a natural benediction. Such a reading might have sprung even more readily to mind in the show's original location at the Menil Collection in Houston, where it was installed in close proximity to the Menil's holdings in African sculpture. 
 At P.S. 1 -- where the idea for the exhibition originated when the show's organizer, Franklin Sirmans, now at the Menil, developed it as part of a curatorial advisory program -- the situation is different. This is a purely contemporary art context, and a largely white, mainstream and secular one at that. 
 What is more, the show arrives at a time when multiculturalism, which reopened the door to spirituality in art, is out of fashion and the constricting aspects of art built on ethnic identity are under scrutiny. It is not for nothing that Mr. Sirmans has subtitled his exhibition ''Art for a Forgotten Faith.''
 Except the faith may not be so forgotten after all. There is little question that contemporary art is changing yet again, and in ways that have little directly to do with the current economic crisis. After several years of submersion in lightweight post-Pop painting, clever design and quip-driven soft politics, we seem to be ready for something with a little more depth, breadth and soul. 
 I'm not saying NeoHooDoo is the answer; it's not forceful enough to be an answering sort of show. But it asks old questions about unanswerables -- who are we, who were we, where are we going, what can we be -- in slightly new ways, and that's a start. 
 ''NeoHooDoo: Art for a Forgotten Faith'' runs through Jan. 26 at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.

HEADLINE: Gannett to Cut 10% of Workers as Its Profit Slips

BYLINE: BY RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The Gannett Company, the nation's largest newspaper chain, will lay off about 10 percent of its work force by early December, company executives said on Tuesday, a few days after Gannett disclosed another sharp drop in revenue and earnings. 
 The layoffs will not apply to the company's flagship paper, USA Today, but to the company's 84 other daily newspapers in the United States, and more than 800 small, nondaily local papers. The announcement does not include Gannett's hundreds of small papers in Britain.
 Gannett declined to say how many people would lose their jobs. The 10 percent figure translates to roughly 3,000 people, but Tara O'Connell, the corporate vice president in charge of communications, said the calculation was not as simple as laying off one-tenth of those people. 
 ''It's really a target amount of money each paper has to cut,'' which the company will not discuss, and there are multiple ways of arriving at it, she said. Each paper has until mid-November to arrive at a plan, and until then, ''we don't know how it's going to play out,'' she said. 
 Even so, it appears to be the single largest example of the industry's recent wave of downsizing.
 In a memo to sent to employees on Tuesday, Robert J. Dickey, president of the company's United States community publishing division, wrote that ''while this is more bad news, it is a sign of Gannett's determination to remain healthy and viable as a company during these turbulent economic times.'' 
 On Friday, Gannett reported a 32.5 percent decline in third-quarter income from the previous year, to $158 million. More troubling was the 17.7 percent drop in newspaper advertising revenue, the company's primary source of revenue.
 Through the first three quarters of the year, advertising revenue is down 13.8 percent, and most of the industry has seen similar declines, or worse.
 In announcing those results, Gannett executives said the company would re-evaluate its quarterly dividend.
 Gannett, known for running a lean operation, is in markedly better financial shape than most newspaper companies and has not resorted to cuts as deep, proportionally, as those at some of its peers. But it has steadily pared its work force through layoffs and voluntary buyouts -- more than 3,500 in 2007 and an undisclosed number this year.
 Most of those reductions took place in small increments, until the layoffs of 1,000 newspaper employees last summer, so they drew little attention in a business where layoffs and buyouts have become commonplace.
 Gannett publishes some major papers, like USA Today, The Arizona Republic and The Detroit Free Press, but most of its publications are small.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about job cuts at the Gannett Company misspelled the surname of its corporate vice president for communications. She is Tara Connell, not O'Connell.

HEADLINE: A London Brand Is Coming to New York's Skyline

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
The Manhattan skyline will lose a bit of New York and gain a touch of London in coming months.
 Next March, Burberry, the British luxury goods brand, will move its United States headquarters to 444 Madison Avenue, between 49th and 50th Streets, and will top off the 42-story tower with three glowing Burberry signs, which will also show the time and temperature.
 The new displays will replace signs for New York magazine. Illuminated signs are prohibited on new skyscrapers in Manhattan, but 444 Madison's displays are permitted under a grandfather clause. 
 ''Being able to have a building that's going to say 'Burberry' in lights is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said Eugenia Ulasewicz, Burberry's president for the Americas. ''Remember, Thomas Burberry founded gabardine fabric, and outerwear is a cornerstone of our brand, so to have it say 'Burberry' and, by the way, here's the temperature -- that's very unique.''
 Burberry's new lease is for 68,348 square feet on floors 13 through 16 at 444 Madison for 15 years. The fashion company, which currently occupies about 61,000 square feet on five noncontiguous floors at 1350 Avenue of the Americas, between 54th and 55th Streets, needed to expand and to renovate, so it decided to move, Ms. Ulasewicz said.
 The space at 444 Madison, with four floors connected by staircases, open floor plans and terraces on two floors, was perfect for Burberry, she said. New York magazine departed more than a year ago to 1 Hudson Square in the Midtown South area.
 ''We have wholesale clients coming to our office space,'' Ms. Ulasewicz said. ''We're expanding our showroom space from 8,500 to 14,000 square feet. The floor with the showrooms has a wraparound terrace. Christopher Bailey, our creative head, is going to be doing some special English garden outdoor furniture just for the terraces.''
 Burberry may also open a retail store in the building, ''but nothing's been finalized,'' Ms. Ulasewicz said. Currently, Burberry has two stores in Manhattan: one on 57th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, and the other in SoHo.
 Ms. Ulasewicz would not reveal Burberry's office rent, but annual asking rents at 444 Madison are $75 to $95 a square foot. 
 The building, which was built in 1931, was acquired by Westbrook Partners, a global real estate investment management company with New York offices, in June 2007. It has been undergoing $20 million in improvements.
 Besides upgrading the 16,000 square feet of storefront spaces and doing facade work, Westbrook is renovating the lobby and overhauling the elevators and mechanical and electrical services, said Frank Marino, a spokesman for Westbrook.
 Paul Amrich, an executive vice president at the commercial brokerage CB Richard Ellis, which is representing the landlord, Westbrook, said higher-paying tenants are gravitating toward 444 Madison.
 They include the small financial firms Rogge Global Partners, the Amherst Securities Group, MAG Automation Systems and Gallatin Capital. The landlord hopes similarly to upgrade the retail tenants to include purveyors of luxury goods, like Burberry, and banks, he said.
 Westbrook approached Burberry, as opposed to a bank, eight months ago about the opportunity to be 444 Madison's anchor tenant. Mr. Marino said more than one tenant had been interested in the space, but the landlord wanted a well-known company.
 ''You'd prefer to have a name up there that people are going to recognize,'' he said. ''Down the road a bit, probably we'll find some people saying, 'Take me to the Burberry Building.' ''
 The value of that branding power clinched the deal for Burberry. ''Without the sign, it's questionable whether or not the transaction would have taken place,'' said David J. Goldstein, an executive vice president and director at the commercial brokerage Studley, which represented Burberry. He wouldn't reveal how much Burberry is paying for the signs.
 In general, the cost of such signs depends on the situation, brokers not involved in the Burberry deal said. ''It's a negotiable scenario,'' said Michael R. Laginestra, a vice chairman at CB Richard Ellis. ''It runs from some landlords obtaining monetary consideration for it to situations where it was done as an enhancement for a tenant.''
 In a market where tenants have more bargaining power, landlords might throw it in for nothing to capture a desirable tenant, he said.
 Robert L. Sammons, the director of research at the commercial brokerage Colliers ABR, which is not involved in this deal, said the signs would be valuable for Burberry primarily if the company opened a retail store.
 Still, 444 Madison is an odd location, he said. ''Madison in that stretch is certainly not known for its high-end retail,'' he said.
 Madison Avenue does have expensive retail stores farther south. Charles Tyrwhitt has a shop at 46th Street, and Brooks Brothers has a store at 44th Street. ''Maybe Burberry is stretching a bit, thinking they'll bring that kind of high-end retail a bit further up Madison,'' Mr. Sammons said.
 As for setting up its headquarters at 444 Madison, that would seem to be a good move, Mr. Sammons said, though it's a tricky time because the economy has turned downward and the real estate market faces uncertainty, which make it hard to value space. Many tenants are renewing or extending leases because of the uncertainty.
 Indeed, Burberry's lease at 1350 Avenue of the Americas does not expire until 2011, so there was no urgency to move. But Westbrook gave Burberry a tenant-improvement allowance and is working with the company to get it out of the lease early.
 Westbrook ''did agree to a partial takeover of that space'' at 1350 Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Marino said. ''So they'll take responsibility for it, and probably work with the current landlord to sublet it or do something else with it.'' The landlord of 1350 Avenue of the Americas is SL Green Realty, one of the city's largest landlords.
 Research analysts at Deutsche Bank are predicting that 2009 will be a very difficult year in the luxury retailing sector, but Ms. Ulasewicz said Burberry believed the move to 444 Madison would be a strategic one for the fashion house. ''We're a brand, and how often does it come along that you have a building you can brand with your name on it?'' she asked.

HEADLINE: Netherlands Gives Aegon a $3.7 Billion Bailout

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
AMSTERDAM (AP) -- The insurance company Aegon said Tuesday that it had taken an investment of 3 billion euros or $3.7 billion from the Dutch government, acting to shore up its cash position in the face of the continuing financial crisis. 
 The company also said it expected to post a loss of around 350 million euros ($436 million) in the third quarter and canceled dividends and executive bonuses for the rest of the year.
 ''We welcome this additional capital buffer that the Dutch state has provided in this time of uncertainty and unprecedented economic turmoil,'' the chief executive, Alex Wynaendts, said in a statement. 
 As recently as Oct. 9, Mr. Wynaendts said Aegon could maintain its credit ratings without raising fresh capital.
 The government aid is the latest of many such interventions in the United States and Europe. In Aegon's case the question appeared to be when and how, rather than if, it would need support.
 Aegon's shares closed 11 percent lower Monday on speculation a deal was imminent. They fell 4.1 percent to 3.24 euros ($4.04) in Amsterdam on Tuesday and have now fallen almost 75 percent since January.
 The company had been regarded as one of Europe's most vulnerable because two-thirds of its operations are in the United States, where it runs the insurer Transamerica. It is also well represented in Britain, the hardest hit among European economies.
 Of the major Dutch financial companies, ABN Amro and Fortis have been nationalized, and the ING Groep and now Aegon have both taken state support.
 Aegon's deal is structured on terms similar to a larger package the government gave ING last week: the company has sold a special class of shares that pay interest of at least 8.5 percent a year. But Aegon has the right to buy them back at a premium -- for 4.5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) -- if markets recover. That limits dilution to current shareholders.
 If the 750 million new shares, issued at 4 euros ($4.99) each, were converted to common shares, they would represent around a 47 percent stake in the company. The shares are nonvoting, but the government will name two members of Aegon's supervisory board.
 The company said after the move that it would have 5 billion euros ($6.2 billion) in surplus cash, and 300 million euros ($373 million) more than it needed to maintain an AA rating from Standard & Poor's -- the highest corporate rating.

 REPORT DETAILS WIDE USE 
 Of Security Contractors in Iraq
 According to a report by a federal oversight agency, at least 310 private security companies from around the world have received contracts from United States agencies to protect American and Iraqi officials, installations, convoys and other entities in Iraq since 2003. The roster is vastly more extensive than any that has previously been disclosed, and contains hundreds of obscure companies from places as far-flung as Uganda, the Philippines, Cyprus, Romania and the Czech Republic.

 CRISIS REVERBERATES IN GULF REGION
 The global financial crisis is fraying some of the lifelines that have normally helped provide economic stability for nations in the Persian Gulf. The mighty real estate market in Dubai has cooled down as credit has become harder to obtain, and energy-rich nations find themselves battling declining oil prices. Governments across the region have had to intervene. Above, a Kuwaiti trader followed fresh drops in stock prices at the Stock Exchange in Kuwait City. PAGE A5 
 IRAQI CONVICTED IN SOLDIERS' DEATHS
 An Iraqi criminal court sentenced to death a man accused of abducting, torturing and murdering three American soldiers in 2006, but acquitted his two co-defendants. It was the first case in which an Iraqi court tried and found guilty an Iraqi in the murder of an American. The case provided a window into the working of militant groups in one of the most troubled areas of Iraq and showed the nascent acceptance of forensic evidence by the Iraqi courts. PAGE A12
 IRAN OPENS NAVAL BASE
 Iran said it had opened a naval base in the Gulf of Oman to counter any hostile forces, a reference to American naval forces patrolling nearby. An Iranian admiral said Iran created the base because of the presence of ''nonregional forces'' around the Gulf of Oman, which is the gateway to the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf, through which 20 percent of the world's oil is shipped. PAGE A12
 TRADING OIL FOR LOANS
 Russian oil companies have been unable to tap into credit streams from troubled Western banks, so they have turned to the Chinese government for multibillion-dollar loans. Under a proposed loans-for-oil deal, Beijing would lend Russian oil companies $20 billion to $30 billion in exchange for two billion barrels of oil over the next 20 years. PAGE A10

 It was a rare instance of a national leader speculating publicly about the health of Kim Jong-il, the leader of North Korea.

 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES REFINE STANCES ON IMMIGRATION, QUIETLY
 On the stump, Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain rarely talk about immigration. Yet, the two candidates continue to tinker with their approaches to it. Mr. Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, has hardened his tone on how to deal with illegal immigrants, while Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee, has made border enforcement a priority, a position in line with the Bush administration's.

 DETROIT MAYOR BEGINS JAIL TERM
 For the next four months, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, former mayor of Detroit, must spend 23 hours of each day alone, in cell 14J-4 l of the Wayne County Jail. Mr. Kilpatrick became Detroit's youngest mayor at age 31, but is now serving a sentence for obstruction of justice and assaulting a police officer. Mr. Kilpatrick, who resigned and agreed to the jail time as part of a plea deal, was jailed more than nine months after the eruption of a scandal that heaped misery and embarrassment upon his economically depressed city and state.

 1977 KENTUCKY FIRE INVESTIGATED
 More than three decades after a fire at the Beverly Hills Supper Club in Southgate, Ky., killed 165 people, Gov.

Still, how a laboratory where scientists plan to study the most deadly diseases in the world ended up on a barrier island where hurricanes regularly wreak havoc puzzles some environmentalists and community leaders.

 PUTTING THE EXPERIENCE
 Of Israeli Arabs on Film
 Carole Zabar's Other Israel Film Festival is not to be confused with the Israel Film Festival, which begins Wednesday. Her festival focuses specifically on the lives of Israeli Arabs, which makes it a much harder sell to New York Jews, its core audience. ''I want people to see Israeli Arabs as human beings,'' she said. ''Not just as human beings -- as citizens that contribute to the vibrancy, the cultural life of Israel.'' PAGE C3

 Under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's mullahs have gone on a domestic subsidy binge -- using oil money to cushion the prices of food, gasoline, mortgages and to create jobs -- to buy off the Iranian people. But as oil prices fall from $147 a barrel to $60, there is a good chance Iran will be open to negotiating over its nuclear program with the next United States president. PAGE A31

 India has sent an unmanned spacecraft to the moon, writes Tunku Varadarajan, a professor of business at New York University, in an Op-Ed article. That a lunar mission has been undertaken by a country whose people regard the moon as a god is a sure sign that science and faith can co-exist. PAGE A31

HEADLINE: Biodefense Lab Worries Some in Galveston

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY JR

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex. 

 BODY:
Much of the University of Texas medical school on this island suffered flood damage during Hurricane Ike, except for one gleaming new building, a national biological defense laboratory that will soon house some of the most deadly diseases in the world.
 How a laboratory where scientists plan to study viruses like Ebola and Marburg ended up on a barrier island where hurricanes regularly wreak havoc puzzles some environmentalists and community leaders.
 ''It's crazy, in my mind,'' said Jim Blackburn, an environmental lawyer in Houston. ''I just find an amazing willingness among the people on the Texas coast to accept risks that a lot of people in the country would not accept.''
 Officials at the laboratory and at the National Institutes of Health, which along with the university is helping to pay for the $174 million building, say it can withstand any storm the Atlantic hurls at it. 
 Built atop concrete pylons driven 120 feet into the ground, the seven-floor laboratory was designed to stand up to 140-mile-an-hour winds. Its backup generators and high-security laboratories are 30 feet above sea level.
 ''The entire island can wash away and this is still going to be here,'' Dr. James W. LeDuc, the deputy director of the laboratory, said. ''With Hurricane Ike, we had no damage. The only evidence the hurricane occurred was water that was blown under one of the doors and a puddle in the lobby.''
 The project enjoyed the strong support of three influential Texas Republicans: President Bush, a former Texas governor; Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison; and the former House majority leader, Tom DeLay, whose district includes part of Galveston County. Officials at the National Institutes of Health, however, say the decision to put the lab here was based purely on the merits. It is to open Nov. 11.
 Dr. LeDuc acknowledged that hurricanes would disrupt research. Each time a hurricane approaches the island, scientists will have to stop their experiments and exterminate many of the viruses and bacteria they are studying.
 And Hurricane Ike did not provide the worst-case test the laboratory will someday face, some critics say. Ike's 100-m.p.h. winds were on the low side for a hurricane, yet it still flooded most of the island's buildings. The university's teaching hospital, on the same campus as the lab, has been shut down for more than a month.
 ''The University of Texas should consider locating its biohazards lab away from Galveston Island and out of harm's way,'' Ken Kramer, director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, said. ''As destructive as it was, Hurricane Ike was only a Category 2 storm. A more powerful storm would pose an even greater threat of a biohazards release.''
 The laboratory is one of two the Bush administration pushed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The second is being built at Boston University Medical Center, where it met stiff community resistance.
 Not so in Texas, where there was hardly a whimper of protest. For starters, the University of Texas Medical Branch is one of the largest employers on the island of 57,000 people.
 In addition, the leaders of the medical school skillfully sold community leaders and politicians on the high-tech safety measures at the lab and on the economic boon to Galveston, an impoverished town in need of the 300 jobs the laboratory would bring.
 University leaders met twice a month with community leaders for several years to dispel fears of pathogens escaping. Then they created a permanent advisory committee of residents that included some of their critics.
 The campaign to win over residents was effective. In 2004, the university built a small laboratory and won federal approval to study extremely lethal pathogens there. The smaller laboratory -- named for Dr. Robert E. Shope, a virus expert -- helped persuade federal officials it was feasible to erect the national laboratory next to it.
 Nonetheless, some community members remain skeptical about the safety measures.
 ''It is not a geographically good location, and the safety measures are only as good as the people who work there,'' said Jackie Cole, a former City Council member who now serves on a citizen's advisory board for the laboratory.
 Other environmentalists who might have fought the project were bogged down in a battle against a liquid natural gas plant that was to be built in Texas City, a refinery town across a narrow channel from the island.
 ''It kind of went under the radar,'' said Bob Stokes, who heads the Galveston Bay Foundation, a group dedicated to cleaning up water pollution.
 Dr. LeDuc and other scientists at the laboratory say it is almost impossible for diseases to escape. The air pressure in the laboratories is kept lower than in surrounding hallways. Even if the double doors into the laboratories are opened accidentally, air rushes in, carrying pathogens up and away through vents to special filters, which are periodically sterilized with formaldehyde and then incinerated.
 All the laboratory tables have hoods that suck contaminated air through the vents to the filters, as do the rooms themselves. Liquid waste, feces and urine go to tanks on the first floor, where it is heated to a temperature at which nothing can survive before being put into the sewage system.
 Other waste -- carcasses of laboratory animals and disposable lab equipment -- is sterilized in autoclaves, giant steam-pressure cookers, before being incinerated off site, Dr. LeDuc said.
 When hurricanes threaten the island, researchers will shut down their experiments at least 24 hours before landfall, decontaminate the labs and then move the stocks of deadly pathogens into freezers on upper floors, where they are kept at 70 below zero, Dr. Joan Nichols, an associate director of research, said.
 Even if the emergency power system were to fail, the freezers can keep the samples of killer diseases dormant for about four days, she said.
 The precautions are necessary. The laboratory will do research into some of the nastiest diseases on the planet, among them Ebola, anthrax, tularemia, West Nile virus, drug-resistant tuberculosis, bubonic plague, avian influenza and typhus.
 In the top-level secure laboratories, where deadly filoviruses like Ebola are studied, the scientists work in pressurized spacesuits inside rooms with airtight steel doors. Before leaving the secured area, they take a chemical shower for eight minutes in their suits, then a conventional shower, Dr. LeDuc said.
 The university's bid for the laboratory benefited from friends in Washington. Mr. DeLay, who resigned from Congress in 2006, pushed hard to bring the project to his district, as did Mrs. Hutchison, who sits on the Appropriations Committee.
 On a visit to Galveston with Mr. Delay in 2005, Mr. Bush said: ''This hospital is going to be the Texas center for bioshield research, to help us make sure that our country is well prepared as we engage in the war on terror. No better place, by the way, to do substantial research than right here at the University of Texas.''
 Galveston's medical school has long had a top-notch faculty in infectious diseases; the school's proposal beat out bids from the University of California, Davis, the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Wadsworth Center in Albany, among others.
 Dr. Rona Hirschberg, a senior program officer at the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, an agency of the National Institutes of Health, said politics played no role in the decision to build the lab here. The threat of hurricanes was outweighed, she said, by the presence of some of the best virologists in the country, she said.
 ''You could put it out in the middle of nowhere and it would be a safe, secure facility,'' Dr. Hirschberg, a molecular biologist, said. ''But the research wouldn't get done.''

HEADLINE: For Those Not Running, Training Can Be Just as Taxing

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL LORGE

 BODY:
In response to the recent financial crisis, Caren and Jon Cohen, parents of two children and residents of the Upper East Side, enacted a family policy of increasing awareness of household spending -- ''taking a second look every time you make a purchase and making sure that it's O.K.,'' as Caren put it.
 So it was with incredulity that she recently watched her distance-running-obsessed husband, deep in his preparations for the New York City Marathon, unbox a new electronic muscle stimulator, a gadget he had purchased for $900 to help aid his recovery from long training runs. 
 ''I really need this,'' he told his befuddled wife.
 As the accommodating Caren Cohen is well aware, marathon fatigue can be punishing this time of year, as tens of thousands of distance runners around the world are training for fall races like Sunday's New York City Marathon, which will have a field of more than 39,000. And sometimes the fatigue has nothing to do with sore muscles or tired legs. The weight of the impending 26.2-mile race is often borne by the families, friends and co-workers of amateur marathoners-in-training -- innocent bystanders who sustain the collateral damage. 
 Less amused by her husband's passion for the marathon is Rebecca, a 30-something Manhattan resident who asked that her surname not be published for fear of further marathon-related domestic strife. Her ambivalence about her husband's marathon and triathlon training moves closer to resentment when she considers the effect it has had on their apartment, their social life and even their conversations.
 ''I miss my guestroom, which has become the garage and smells like a locker room,'' she said in an e-mail message. ''I miss talking about things other than Harlem hill repeats, and I wish we had put a down payment on an apartment with the money he spent on his stupid custom bike.''
 Rebecca, who says her husband talks about his training ''incessantly,'' could be in for a long winter if her husband meets his goal of attaining a qualifying time for the Boston Marathon. 
 ''Usually after that first weekend in November, I think, O.K., now we have our Friday nights and Saturday mornings back,'' she said in an interview. ''But he's not the kind of guy who will just say, 'Great, I qualified -- now I can take it easy.' He'll want to do really well next spring. So it's not going to end for me.''
 The all-consumed runner can make his co-workers feel as if they, too, are in an endurance event. Sunday mornings are popular for long training runs, sometimes 20 miles or more; Monday mornings can be grueling for the colleague in the neighboring cubicle who hears the stride-by-stride retelling of that run. And no one knows the true agony of blisters on the feet until he has heard his co-worker describe the arc of their progression -- from development to drainage -- in excruciating detail.
 The colleagues of Jaime Sperling, the communications manager at the World Monuments Fund in Manhattan, are continually reminded that there is a marathoner in their midst. 
 ''I know I was a nightmare training for my first marathon, in 2004,'' Sperling said in an e-mail message. ''Icing my knees at work, worrying out loud about my mileage, bragging about my long runs. I think I even brought my finisher's medal to work the next day (or the day after, since I made a big deal about taking off the day after since I'd be 'too sore to walk').''
 Now, Sperling is training to run the New York City Marathon for the fourth time, and her colleagues are well aware that she frequently commutes to work by running the five miles from her home in Queens to her office in Manhattan, where she keeps several outfits hanging in her cubicle.
 ''Of course there are no showers at work, so she says she mops herself up,'' Ben Haley said. ''It's pretty funny, because she comes in drenched in sweat, freshens herself up and starts working.''
 The 40-year-old Jon Cohen, who is training to run the New York City Marathon for the fifth consecutive year, says he hopes to qualify for the Boston Marathon by running faster than 3 hours 20 minutes, the standard for his age group. In his bid to meet that time, Cohen has logged as many as 80 miles in a week, sometimes running twice a day or doing back-to-back long runs on the weekend. 
 He acknowledges that it is a demanding regimen for someone who is not a professional runner. 
 ''There are times when you think, what am I doing this for? I'm not trying to qualify for the Olympics, and I don't make my living doing this,'' he said. ''But there's something inside that makes me strive for these goals.''
 Cohen's training routine extends beyond Central Park. At home, to the amusement and occasional disdain of his family, he behaves like many a fanatical long-distance runner: taking ice baths, mixing energy drinks, exhibiting an excessive germophobia and, as his largely unfazed wife put it, ''rolling around the living room on his foam roller.''
 For an obsessive marathoner-to-be, these are small sacrifices to make in the interest of performing well on race day, which is never far from mind. Whenever Jon Cohen drives his family over the Willis Avenue Bridge, he delivers a spiel that his wife and children know by heart. 
 ''This is the toughest part of the marathon right here,'' he lectures his eye-rolling but otherwise indulgent children, ages 12 and 8. ''When you hit the bridge, it's the 20-mile mark, and from here, you have the toughest six miles to go.'' 
 But while marathoners like Cohen prepare to count down the miles and minutes on Sunday, many spectators already have the finish line in sight.
 As the beleaguered but good-natured Haley said last week in reference to Sperling's marathon: ''I'll be pretty relieved once it's over.''

HEADLINE: City Tries to Curtail Cigarette Sales From Reservation

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
Bootleg cigarette traffic from Long Island's tiny Poospatuck reservation to New York City is brisk, so much so that some cigarette dealers on the reservation don't even bother to set up storefronts, according to a motion filed in federal court on Tuesday. 
 Instead, the dealers take telephone orders for bulk shipments of untaxed cigarettes. Millions of them are delivered to the city by van and distributed through an underground network that dramatically undercuts tax collection, the city alleged. 
 The Bloomberg administration asked a federal judge in Brooklyn to bar the reservation's eight largest dealers from selling untaxed cigarettes to the public. Those dealers, named as defendants in a federal lawsuit filed by the city last month, control 95 percent of the sales on the reservation, the city said.
 Officials estimate that untaxed cigarette sales by the eight dealers have cut city revenues by nearly $195 million a year, an amount the city can ill afford during a financial crisis. In addition, bootleg cigarette traffic undermines a Bloomberg administration anti-smoking campaign.
 ''In making off-reservation sales, including bulk transactions in which defendants sell vanloads of cigarettes on a daily basis, which are then trafficked into New York City for resale, defendants grow rich at the expense of tax-paying retailers and city and state taxpayers,'' lawyers for the city said in the 43-page memorandum requesting a preliminary injunction against the tribal dealers. 
 State and city taxes of $4.25 a pack push cigarettes to more than $9 a pack in the city, but the bootleg cigarettes are often sold for $5 by street peddlers, known as $5 men. 
 The city corporation counsel, Michael A. Cardozo, described the burgeoning cigarette businesses on the reservation in the papers filed in United States District Court in Brooklyn. 
 The State Department of Taxation and Finance said that the Poospatuck cigarette trade grew to 11.3 million cartons last year, up from 406,000 cartons in 1996. The court papers said that 24 million cartons of cigarettes had been sold by the Poospatuck reservation's eight largest businesses since 2004. 
 The cigarette dealers claim they are within their rights because Indian sales are exempt from state taxation. ''It's just interfering and trying to interfere with the lawful retail trade on our land,'' said Harry Wallace, chief of the Poospatuck tribe, who attended a hearing Monday on the issue.
 But the exemption, city lawyers argue, does not apply to sales to the public, only to reservation residents. Moreover, they say that many of the proprietors are not members of the tribe.
 Noting that only 279 Poospatucks live on the reservation, Eric Proshansky, a lawyer for the city, argued in an affidavit filed with the memorandum that, ''If defendants' 2007 purchases of 9,780,469 cartons were disposed of in reservation sales, every man, woman and child on the reservation would have had to consume approximately 960 packs of cigarettes a day, a patent absurdity.'' 
 In the past 10 months, 49 new entities had been established to sell cigarettes from the reservation, the court papers said.
 Some of the businesses are owned by the same people, and investigators have suggested that the new businesses were set up to thwart limits on sales established by cigarette manufacturers to allow for age verification.
 The court papers detailed several specific shipments from reservation dealers that were observed by either confidential informants or state investigators working with the city. 
 One of them occurred on July 17, when the Nassau County police intercepted a van containing 1,200 cartons of unstamped cigarettes, apparently on its way to the city. A state investigator saw the van driver pick up the shipment at Smoking Arrow Smoke Shop, one of the larger businesses on the reservation and a defendant in the lawsuit. The owner of Smoking Arrow was not immediately available to respond to the allegations. 
 Another defendant, TDM Discount Cigarettes, does not maintain a storefront, a fact that indicates that TDM ''engaged entirely in bulk sales,'' the court papers said. A confidential informant said that TDM made deliveries to a storage location in Queens owned by cigarette resellers in the city, according to the court papers. A lawyer for TDM could not be reached for comment. 
 In addition to supplying cigarettes, some of the reservation cigarette dealers gave drivers tips for eluding police and, in other cases, provided escorts to help get the distributors off the reservation, the papers say.

HEADLINE: Big Marathons, Already Packed, May Still Grow

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

 BODY:
Having run the New York City Marathon 32 years in a row, Dave Obelkevich has a simple approach to navigating the increasingly clogged course.
''I just pray,'' he said, ''and hope not to get mowed down.''
Such is the experience for many participants in the sport's glamour races, like the marathons in New York, London, Chicago, Berlin and Boston. Bursting with runners, those races appear to be at their saturation point, with several fields hosting more than 35,000 competitors. Some of those events have doubled in size from a decade ago.
Still, race directors are looking for ways to make their 26.2-mile races even bigger, while somehow maintaining a safe and enjoyable experience for runners.
To ease congestion on its five-borough course, New York is implementing a new starting system this year, when more than 39,000 are expected to compete. Recreational runners will begin the race in three intervals, 20 minutes apart. 
The race director, Mary Wittenberg, and New York's deputy mayor for economic development, Robert C. Lieber, have discussed expanding the field. More than two-thirds of the runners come from outside the tristate area, bringing the city more than $220 million, organizers say.
Lieber said he could envision at least 50,000 runners in New York's marathon.
For the 57,665 people who applied to run in last year's New York City Marathon but were denied entry, that may seem like great news. It would be a disappointing turn, however, for many runners who already find big-city marathons unmanageable.
Liam Mycroft, a 50-year-old tax auditor from Dublin, is a veteran of 22 marathons, including the Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Boston, Winnipeg and Rotterdam races. He ran the London Marathon twice, the last time in 1998. But never again, he said, because of the crowds.
Some streets in big-city marathons, like London's aptly named Narrow Street, were clearly not fashioned to handle a sea of 70,000 sneaker-clad feet and the 35,000 runners attached to them, Mycroft said.
''You're running in some places that there are some really tight bends, so you're almost walking the first three miles and you don't really get going until six or seven miles in,'' he said. ''It's a fantastic, brilliant experience to run toward Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, closer to the end of the race. But when you're still weaving around people, it's annoying and not very much fun.''
Bigger fields mean more challenges for race organizers. As the number of entrants increases, so does the number of volunteers, police and medical workers, said Carey Pinkowski, the executive race director for the Chicago Marathon, which caps its registration at 45,000.
''Could we take 60,000 participants? Sure,'' he said. ''But that's not a simple process. Right now we're at a number we feel very comfortable with.''
Race directors in Boston and London say it would be impossible to add more runners to their already crammed courses.
In 2002, the Boston Marathon had 16,939 entrants. It then relaxed its race standards for runners 45 and older, and the field grew to 25,283 this year. And that, apparently, is the maximum the course could handle as it winds through eight cities and towns, the race director Guy Morse said. The field size for 2009 will be limited to 25,000.
''You are a victim of what you accomplish,'' Morse said. ''We want to be as big as we can be without compromising the integrity of the event. There's a breaking point, and you may not know what that is until you get there. We don't want to find out.''
Mary Pardi, 38, from Falmouth, Me., competed in the Boston Marathon in April, and said she ran shoulder-to-shoulder with other runners through Mile 18. She said she was ''up on lawns, weaving in and out of people and wasting a lot of energy,'' because the course was so packed. She failed to reach her goal of finishing in under three hours, crossing the line in 3 hours 3 minutes 44 seconds.
''I think they should make the standards a little harder because people are getting in better and better shape,'' Pardi said. ''But, no matter how hard it is to qualify, I think there will always be 20,000 people running it. Everyone wants to run in Boston because it means you are the best of the best.''
The attraction of running in a big-city marathon, where the course passes famous landmarks and goes through boisterous neighborhoods, has increased the demand for spots in races like the London Marathon. It already has 118,500 applicants for the 2009 event in April. About a third of them will be accepted.
David Bedford, the race director, said in an e-mail message that London was considered a marathon that many ''want to do at least once in their lifetime.'' He added that participants simply find ways ''to cope'' as they made their way through gridlocked parts of the course.
Although London organizers feel as if their race has reached its limit, New York officials are looking for their race to grow.
The wave start being used Sunday in the New York City Marathon is intended to ease crowding at particularly jammed points, like near the Brooklyn Academy of Music (Mile 8) and the Willis Avenue Bridge (Mile 20), said Wittenberg, the race director.
She said that she and other organizers have studied video, photographs and data from computerized timing chips on the runners' sneakers to assess bottlenecks on the course. The start is an obvious point of congestion, but the finish area is also a problem because runners gather to reunite with friends and families.
Race organizers and city officials have discussed altering those two areas to expand the field.
''The No. 1 driver to get bigger is that more people can run the race and there is more economic impact,'' Wittenberg said. ''We think it makes sense just as long as the quality of the experience remains high.''
Pointing out that New York had more finishers than any other marathon last year, she added, ''We want to be the biggest marathon, but never at the cost of being the best.''
Lieber, the deputy mayor, said he would not mind if the race was both. He scoffed at those who said the race was too crowded.
''That's baloney,'' he said. ''It's all about how you set it up.
''We're not going to go from 39,000 to 50,000 in one year. It will happen over time.''
Obelkevich, who has competed in the race every year since 1976, finished his first New York City Marathon in 1974, when there were 527 entrants. He shudders at the thought of the race growing any larger than it is right now. Even so, he said he would not turn his back on it.
''I'd never think of skipping it,'' said Obelkevich, 65, a retired music teacher from Manhattan. ''What other race do you run with hundreds of other people helping you through the tough miles? Where else will you hear 26 bands along the course playing the theme song from 'Rocky'?
''Now that I've got this streak going, I just can't skip a year. Even if I broke my leg, I'd do it on crutches.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence, Battered by Market Setbacks, Sags to a 40-Year Low

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in at least 40 years, a survey said Tuesday, as falling home prices and steep declines in the stock market took a sharp toll on the faith of Americans in the economy.
 A widely watched survey by the private Conference Board, which dates back four decades, plunged to its lowest reading on record in October as Americans reported fewer jobs and smaller incomes and curtailed plans for major purchases like cars and appliances.
 Americans also say they believe the economy will worsen before it improves -- a sign of deeply engrained pessimism that reflects a year of painful declines in stocks, jobs and home values. Some have lost thousands in retirement money. Others are fearful of losing their source of income, and a record number of outstanding mortgages are in foreclosure. 
 ''A consumer-led recession is upon us, and it promises to be a serious one,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief domestic economist at MFR, a research firm, wrote Tuesday in a note. 
 The survey's confidence index fell to 38 in October, down from 61.4 in September, on a scale where a reading of 100 represents the consumer outlook on the economy in 1985. Expectations for the future also reached a record low. The survey dates to 1967.
 ''There may be something of a shock effect here -- barring today's gains -- from the declines we had seen in the market that were unlike anything we had seen before,'' Lynn Franco, who directs the survey, said, soon after the Dow Jones industrial average ended 889 points higher on Tuesday. 
 Even discounting the sudden plunge, she said, ''the confidence readings in June, July, and September are really indicative of a very, very weak economy.'' 
 The increasing pessimism sent confidence below its previous low, set in December 1974. 
 Nearly half of the 5,000 surveyed households said they expected the job market to deteriorate further, and many appeared worried about their ability to make purchases over the next few months. 
 The report did not bode well for retailers during the December shopping season. 
 ''These moves are likely to have at least partially been driven by the worrying news flow on the U.S. financial system, but it appears to be the labor market that is the source of the bulk of the worries,'' James Knightley, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note.
 The American economy lost 159,000 jobs in September, the worst month of retrenchment in five years. Payrolls have fallen every month this year, eliminating 760,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department.
 Economists said they expected sentiment to improve as cheaper gas prices eased the strains on consumers' pocketbooks. But housing troubles will likely weigh on Americans for many more months, eroding home equity lines and possibly creating another wave of foreclosures.
 There was little relief for the beleaguered housing market in August as home prices across the country dropped at yet another record pace, according to a closely watched survey released Tuesday. 
 Home prices in 20 cities fell 16.6 percent in August compared with a year earlier, the biggest annual drop in the history of the Case-Shiller home price index, released by Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency. 
 Every city included in the survey experienced a drop in prices from a year earlier, a trend that has extended for five months. Phoenix and Las Vegas were hit hardest, with prices down 31 percent in both cities. Prices declined more than 25 percent in Los Angeles, Miami, San Diego and San Francisco.
 Prices dropped a percentage point from July to August, a sign that the pace of decline may be slowing slightly. Prices rose in only two cities, Cleveland and Boston, during the month, compared with six in July. Prices were unchanged in Chicago and Denver. A 10-city index fell 17.7 percent year over year.
 The housing slump has continued unabated for months, and its consequences can be felt throughout the economy. It has led to the erosion of jobs, pain in a number of housing-related industries, and, in part, the credit crisis that caused the collapse of several Wall Street banks.
 Lower prices, however, are in some sense the key to recovery, economists said, although prices may need to fall further to lure buyers back into a market sagging with unsold inventory. 
 Sales also appeared to pick up slightly in September for both previously owned and newly constructed homes, but inventories remained elevated.

HEADLINE: Armored Against Turmoil, Lebanon's Banks Show Stable Growth, Luring Investors

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH; Souad Mekhennet contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon 

 BODY:
As financial panic spreads across the globe, some investors are moving their money to an unlikely place: Lebanon. 
 This small country, chronically battered by war, turns out to have a banking sector that has so far been a beacon of stability and growth. Its banks are posting record profits, aided by conservative central bank policies, skillful management and money from Lebanese expatriates. 
 Lebanon's very instability -- its 15-year civil war and frequent political crises -- appears to have bred the banking sector's fiscal prudence, analysts say.
 Three years ago the central bank here barred investments in derivatives and other structured financial products, giving banks virtual immunity to the widening financial contagion. The banks here have done little borrowing on international markets. Deposits account for about 83 percent of their assets, making them among the most liquid in the world. 
 ''The banks here are used to turmoil,'' said Nassib Ghobril, the head of economic research and analysis for Byblos Bank, the country's third largest. ''Since the end of the civil war in 1990, there has been no loss of deposits, and there's great confidence in the sector.'' 
 As of August, the money flowing into deposits grew 16 percent over 2007 -- itself a record year. Lebanon had no working government for most of that period, and at times seemed to be on the verge of civil war. 
 Those inflows appear to be rising further. The central bank released statistics showing that it increased its foreign assets by $572 million in the first two weeks of October, possibly a sign that foreign deposits are growing. 
 Lebanon has also attracted the hedge fund industry, which has until now focused more on Persian Gulf markets. ''We consider the well-capitalized Lebanese banks as safe as the safer banks in the gulf,'' said Florence Eid, the regional managing director for Passport Capital, a hedge fund based in San Francisco. 
 An added asset is Lebanon's often wealthy expatriates. About 4 million Lebanese live in the country, but an estimated 12 million live abroad, and many send money home and invest in real estate. The total of such remittances is expected to top last year's, $5.5 billion, one of the world's highest per capita rates. 
 Partly for that reason, banks here have grown so large that they dwarf the national economy. Lebanese bank assets are about $100 billion, in a country with a $25 billion gross domestic product, said Marwan Barakat, in charge of research at Bank Audi, the country's largest lender. 
 This growth has allowed the banks to expand internationally. Bank Audi, for example, now has branches in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Qatar and Sudan.
 The continued growth here is probably also related to some modest good news in politics. In May, after 18 months of deadlock, Lebanon's warring factions agreed to a compromise. So far, the deal seems to be holding. But the banks are also doing their part, holding much of Lebanon's $45.4 billion public debt. 
 ''In this crisis, governments in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have been stepping in to rescue their banking sectors,'' Mr. Ghobril said. ''Whereas in Lebanon the sector is so large it has been supporting the state for years.''

HEADLINE: 126 New Yorkers Arrested In Unemployment Fraud

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
State law enforcement officials announced on Tuesday that a crackdown on unemployment fraud has led to the arrests of 126 New York City residents who received $930,000 from the state's unemployment insurance trust fund in the last year. 
 The arrests are the result of a stepped-up enforcement effort, using data-matching and more coordination among agencies, to identify New Yorkers who collect jobless benefits even though they are still working.
 The state's unemployment insurance program pays more than $2 billion a year in jobless benefits, which go to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Those who qualify for unemployment can currently receive as much as $405 in weekly benefits for up to 39 weeks.
 ''Unemployment insurance is a lifeline that keeps thousands of families afloat across New York State during difficult times,'' said M. Patricia Smith, the state labor commissioner. ''As New Yorkers continue to reel from the effects of a nationwide downturn in the economy, it is nothing short of shameful to think that people would steal from a fund designed to help families put food on the table, gas in their cars and clothes on the backs of their children.''
 The investigations were conducted by the State Labor Department in conjunction with the State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the district attorneys of the five boroughs of New York City and other law enforcement agencies.
 Labor Department officials said that unemployment fraud hurts the state's businesses by forcing them to pay higher taxes. A company's unemployment tax rate is based in part on how many of its former employees receive jobless benefits. A New York business with 15 employees would have to pay about $1,000 a year in additional unemployment taxes for each new claim, fraudulent or not. If a fraudulent claim is detected, the tax for that claim would not be charged, department officials said.
 State officials say that their investigators uncover more than 600 cases of unemployment insurance fraud per year, including some in which recipients submit multiple claims using different Social Security numbers. They said that since January, $17.5 million had been returned to the unemployment insurance trust fund as a result of Labor Department investigations.

HEADLINE: Grand Plans for Manhattan Hotels Are Stalling

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Manhattan hotel rooms have been so sought-after in recent years that many developers, even some with no experience in the lodging industry, clamored to be part of the action. With the room occupancy rate averaging a record 85.6 percent in 2007, a host of projects were announced, raising fears of a glut of hotel rooms. 
 But to the benefit of the city's lodging sector, which is already suffering the effects of the economic downturn, many of these new hotels are unlikely to materialize anytime soon. 
 As many as 8,000 hotel rooms are under construction, but most of the other hotel projects will be canceled or delayed, said Bradley Burwell, a senior associate at CB Richard Ellis Hotels. Just before Lehman Brothers collapsed in September, Mr. Burwell had predicted that an additional 2,000 rooms would be completed by the end of 2010, but he lowered his projections as the economic crisis deepened. Manhattan currently has about 66,000 hotel rooms. 
 ''Any hotel that is not under construction now, or does not have financing in place, will be delayed at least 12 to 18 months,'' Mr. Burwell said. ''Getting new construction financing is not impossible, but it's very close to impossible.''
 The stalled projects include two proposed high-end hotels with construction loans from Lehman Brothers: the Shangri-La on Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street, with 206 rooms; and the Nobu Hotel and Residences, on Broad Street in Lower Manhattan, with 128 rooms.
 Among the other delayed or canceled projects, hotel professionals said, are the Hotel Indigo near Union Square, with 92 rooms, and several other hotels planned for Lower Manhattan, including Larry Silverstein's 175-room Four Seasons Hotel at 99 Church Street. (Mr. Silverstein's spokesman said his plans have not changed.). 
 The Lam Group, a prolific hotel developer that recently opened a Hampton Inn with 160 rooms near the entrance of the Holland Tunnel -- run by Jeffrey Lam, the son of the chairman, John Lam -- has abandoned plans for a $200 million 670-room full-service hotel on Pearl Street, but hopes eventually to build two or more smaller hotels on the site. These days, lenders are more likely to finance a hotel that costs $50 million or so, John Lam said. ''You can't do one huge project,'' he said. 
 First-time hotel developers are expected to have an even tougher time getting loans. One such group, PLC Partners of New York, paid $31 million for a site on West 33rd Street, near Pennsylvania Station, in order to build Manhattan's first Cambria Suites hotel, with 250 rooms. But PLC is unlikely to get a construction loan, said a hotel specialist who did not want to be quoted on individual projects. (A spokesman for Choice Hotels, owner of the Cambria Suites brand, said developers expect to complete the hotel in two years.)
 Even with many projects in abeyance, New York is creating hotel rooms at a faster pace than the country as a whole. About 135,000 rooms will be added nationwide this year, a growth rate of 2.8 percent, and 159,000 are expected next year, a 3.3 percent increase, according to Lodging Econometrics, a research company in Portsmouth, N.H. But fewer projects are being announced, and those in the pipeline are taking longer to get started, said Patrick Ford, the company's president. 
 ''What we are finding nationally is that the larger projects are canceling first,'' Mr. Ford said. ''Those that don't have commitments for a brand are finding it extremely difficult to get loans.''
 Average hotel occupancy nationwide is 60.6 percent (compared with 64.5 percent last year), according to Smith Travel Research, and the rate is expected to fall as business travel is curtailed and airfares remain high. Group meetings are being canceled and independent travelers are cutting back, said David Loeb, a managing director at Baird & Company, a financial services firm based in Milwaukee. 
 Most public hotel companies are trading below $10 a share. Hotel asset values have declined by 25 percent, Mr. Loeb said. ''The reason investors aren't jumping on these stocks today is that you don't know where the bottom is,'' Mr. Loeb said. Investors are also nervous when highly leveraged companies have little equity in their portfolio, he said. Even in Manhattan, where hotel occupancy has dipped below 80 percent only three times in the last decade, the industry faces challenging times. As of September, the average occupancy for the year had already slipped to 81 percent, Smith Travel reported.
 ''Typically, the fourth quarter is the strongest quarter,'' said Bjorn Hanson, who teaches hospitality and tourism management at New York University. ''This year, the fourth quarter will be the weakest. I have not been able to find one hotel that is not struggling.''
 In New York, the hotel boom has been driven by international tourism, which is softening because of the strengthening dollar and the banking crisis. 
 Hotels opening now are likely to have a tough time meeting their projections, several brokers said. The Horizen Group is transforming a 1930s printing house on 11th Avenue and 48th Street into the 222-room Vu Hotel, but is struggling to find an additional $5 million needed to complete it. Rates at the hotel, which is to be managed by Kimpton Hotels, were planned to begin at $425 a night -- a level that might be hard to achieve in this economy. 
 The glassy Cooper Square Hotel near Astor Place will initially charge $275 a night when it opens next month with 85 of its 146 rooms completed -- a steep discount from the $425 rate it had projected for the finished hotel. 
 One of the developers, Matt Moss, said he can afford to wait out the downturn because less than 60 percent of the cost was financed. ''We have made a long-term commitment to this project, this neighborhood,'' he said. ''We plan on being here for a long time. The cycle will come back.'' 
 When the market was hot, developers and lenders believed that even hotels in untested locations could fetch top dollar. ''Every deal since 2005 was projecting room rates of $500 a night,'' said Alan P. Miller, a senior director at Eastern Consolidated, a New York real estate brokerage firm. ''The banks were believing the story. The money was flowing.'' 
 Mr. Burwell said that hotel financing in the last few years was probably the easiest it has been in two decades. ''That allowed many projects to get financed, not just in New York City but across the country at high leverage rates, including some that might not be fundamentally sound,'' he said. 
 Undeterred by the economic crisis, the GFI Development Company, the owner of several independent hotels across the country, announced plans this month to transform a 1903 office building at Broadway and 28th Street into the NoMad, a boutique hotel with 171 rooms. Room rates will be relatively modest because of incentives available for converting old buildings, said Andrew Zobler, the chief executive.
 ''We still think the market in New York City will be reasonably good,'' he said. ''There is an undersupply of quality hotel rooms.''
 Mr. Hanson of N.Y.U. noted that while many luxury hotels have been converted to condominiums in recent years, new chain hotels without restaurants have taken their place. The city should be adding hotels of all types, ''but instead we're growing the limited-service supply,'' he said. ''It's unfortunate for the city, but the economics of those projects are more favorable.''

HEADLINE: Intelligence Spending Rises, but Restraint Is in the Air

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The steep buildup in government spending on intelligence programs continued over the past year, according to figures made public on Tuesday, but American intelligence agencies are also bracing for a new era of austerity. 
 Spending on intelligence operations increased by some 9 percent last year, to $47.5 billion, Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, said Tuesday. That figure includes most intelligence spending, including the budget for the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the operation of spy satellites, but it does not include several billions that the military services spend annually on intelligence operations.
 When the military spending is included, the new figure confirms that the American intelligence budget has doubled over the past decade, primarily to meet the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a worldwide campaign against Al Qaeda. In 1998, the last time the intelligence budget was publicly disclosed before a 2007 law made it mandatory, it stood at $26.7 billion, and there were more F.B.I. agents working in New York City than C.I.A. officers operating around the world. 
 The size of the 2009 budget, under which the intelligence agencies are currently operating, remains classified.
 Yet current and former intelligence officials said that some belt-tightening had already begun because of the economic crisis, and that further large increases in the budget were unlikely, no matter who became the next president. They said discussions under way to determine the 2010 budget reflected White House demands for greater spending restraint. 
 ''Everyone senses we're reaching the end of growth for the intelligence budget,'' said Mark M. Lowenthal, a former top C.I.A. official and Congressional intelligence staff member. 
 Mr. Lowenthal said the intelligence budget might be vulnerable to cuts in future years, and could be more politically vulnerable than the budget for domestic security, which contains dozens of pork-barrel projects that lawmakers are loath to part with.
 The Bush administration for years refused to disclose the amount that the United States spent annually to run C.I.A. stations overseas, operate satellites and conduct other intelligence activities, saying that revealing the budget would give too much information to America's enemies. But members of Congress, acting on a recommendation by the Sept. 11 commission, passed a law in 2007 requiring that the director of national intelligence disclose the intelligence budget within 30 days of the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. 
 Besides the C.I.A.'s hugely expensive operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, where in Baghdad the agency is operating its largest overseas outpost since the Vietnam War, the C.I.A. is also trying to follow through on a presidential order to expand the ranks of its analysts and its clandestine service by 50 percent each. 
 The C.I.A. expects to meet the goal for analysts this year, but expanding the clandestine branch requires recruiting and training new officers and building up the C.I.A.'s infrastructure abroad. So the agency, intelligence officials said, was still several years from meeting the second goal set by the White House.

PERSON: Herbert Mitchell 

HEADLINE: Herbert Mitchell, 83, Collector of Images

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Herbert Mitchell, a Columbia University librarian who filled his high-ceilinged Morningside Heights apartment with rare stereographs, seductive daguerreotypes, Majolica ceramics, Parian statuary and cabinets full of 19th-century architectural books, a unique collection that became a treasure trove for scholars seeking the physical dimensions of a lost culture, died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 83.
 The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said his attorney, George L. Carson. 
 At the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia, where he worked from 1960 to 1991, and in his own sequestered apartment, he assembled something extraordinary, if slightly beyond description. 
 ''His was the most eclectic collection of the valuable, the semi-valuable and the somewhat-not-valuable,'' Mr. Carson said. Much of it is to be given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he added.
 The Met has already added to its photography collection the 3,866 stereographic views of New York City from the 19th and early 20th centuries that Mr. Mitchell donated in 2007. Most show Central Park not long after its construction. Some of these were published in the Winter 2008 issue of the museum bulletin, ''Creating Central Park,'' by Morrison H. Heckscher.
 Mr. Heckscher, the Lawrence A. Fleischman chairman of the American Wing at the Met, knew -- as other curators and researchers did -- that if their quest for historical images or artifacts crossed Mr. Mitchell's many areas of interest, he would make his holdings (or hoardings) available for books and exhibitions.
 Jeff L. Rosenheim, curator in the department of photographs at the Met, who first met Mr. Mitchell 20 years ago prowling flea markets in the West 20s, said, ''The eclectic nature of this collector and his essential values were astounding to me.''
 ''It is a treasure trove of material awaiting public scholars,'' Mr. Rosenheim said.
 Rives Herbert Mitchell was born in Bangor, Me., on Nov. 18, 1924. He would later say, in his economical way, ''It's a good place to come from.'' He is survived by a sister, Dorothy Mitchell of Seattle.
 Mr. Mitchell received a bachelor's degree from the University of Maine in 1946 and a bachelor of science degree from the Columbia University School of Library Service in 1949. After working at the Art Institute of Chicago and Cornell University, he returned to Columbia in 1960.
 He is credited by Columbia with the spectacular growth of Avery's classics collection, including presentation drawings of the church of San Giovanni in Laterano by Giovanni Battista Piranesi and a copy of a 1775 book, ''A Collection of Designs in Architecture,'' one of the first books on architecture published in North America. 
 But he was equally avid in acquiring ordinary trade catalogues, showing architectural hardware, flooring materials, paints, wallpapers, plumbing fixtures and the like -- now an invaluable resource for anyone restoring or researching historical interiors.
 ''One of his real interests was ephemera -- that part of history that disappears,'' said Kitty Chibnik, the associate director of Avery.
 Among Mr. Mitchell's first gifts to the Met was a daguerreotype of a costumed theatrical character known as the ''wily Yankee,'' a midcentury forerunner of Uncle Sam. He is depicted as a dandy in a stovepipe hat whittling a stick of wood that he holds in a most provocative fashion. Mr. Rosenheim called it a stunning work. Another daguerreotype from the 1850s shows two men seated closely together. One man's leg is draped tenderly over the other's. 
 Mr. Mitchell once referred to his collections as his children, Mr. Carson said. He had no others.
 ''If he liked it, he bought it,'' Mr. Carson said. ''And he bought everything. That's why he ended up with no money. He said, 'I just like having beautiful things around me.' ''

HEADLINE: U.S. Vouchers to Be Used for 8,400 Public Apartments

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Thousands of apartments at nearly two dozen public housing complexes will be rented out to tenants with federal Section 8 vouchers under a new plan by the New York City Housing Authority that has drawn criticism for reducing the city's already dwindling supply of privately owned subsidized housing.
 The Housing Authority's plan will remove 8,400 units at 21 of its complexes from the public housing inventory and make them available to Section 8 voucher holders. The move is intended to help the agency stem its financial crisis by pumping money from the federally financed vouchers into 21 cash-poor developments. 
 Those 21 developments were built by the city and state but receive no continuing financial assistance from either, one of the reasons why the Housing Authority is facing a $177 million shortfall in its operating budget in fiscal year 2009. 
 But critics of the plan, including elected officials and advocates for low-income housing, said the agency was using Section 8 vouchers in a way they were never intended: to subsidize public housing.
 The Section 8 program was adopted by Congress in 1974 as an alternative to conventional public housing, giving tenants the freedom to choose where they wanted to live in the private market by paying a large portion of the rent with a federal subsidy known as a voucher.
 Under the Housing Authority plan, tenants with vouchers will be able to move into public housing projects, with money from the vouchers going to the Housing Authority, not a private landlord. The use of 8,400 vouchers by tenants living in public housing means there will be that many fewer vouchers available for tenants seeking housing in the private market, the critics say, since the 8,400 vouchers will come from the same pool of federally allotted vouchers.
 ''Section 8 vouchers are in such short supply and so many people need them, that this is robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a statement. 
 Critics of the plan say the real problem is that the city and state have stopped supporting the housing developments that they built years ago, causing the agency to turn to a plan that hurts one group of low-income tenants to benefit another.
 The agency's plan comes at a difficult time for the Section 8 program and the city's pool of subsidized housing. The Community Service Society, a nonprofit antipoverty group, issued a report this month that found that the city lost 3,600 units of subsidized, privately owned rental housing in 2007. And as once-struggling neighborhoods have gentrified, voucher holders have reported having an increasingly difficult time finding landlords to take their vouchers.
 The plan, which received final approval from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development in September and has already started to take effect, will draw in $75 million of additional revenue by 2011, when it will be fully in effect, Housing Authority officials said.
 The Housing Authority runs the city's 343 public housing developments, but it also administers the largest Section 8 voucher program in the country, which serves about 280,000 New Yorkers in 90,000 private apartments. 
 Housing Authority officials maintain that the plan will not affect their ability to help voucher holders find private market rentals. An agency spokesman said they expect the Section 8 program to continue its current pace of 12,000 private rentals a year.
 Poor, elderly and disabled tenants who receive Section 8 vouchers pay about 30 percent of their income toward rent, and the vouchers, financed by HUD, cover the rest. The Housing Authority receives hundreds of millions of dollars a year from HUD for both the public housing and Section 8 programs, but until now it had never been allowed to combine the two revenue streams.
 Victor Bach, a senior housing policy analyst for the Community Service Society said those with the most to lose in the plan are the 130,000 families on the agency's public housing waiting list. Those families are not eligible for any of the 8,400 units being used for the Section 8 program. 
 ''What it does is it reduces the number of housing opportunities that families on the waiting list have here in New York City,'' Mr. Bach said.
 In addition, the agency's plan gives current residents at the 21 complexes an unusual variety of options, including exchanging one subsidy for another.
 Tenants at the 21 sites can apply for a Section 8 voucher and use that voucher to remain in their apartment. Or they can use the voucher to move out and rent a private apartment anywhere in the city or even the country.
 Current residents can also apply for a transfer to move to another one of the Housing Authority's complexes, at the agency's expense, thereby freeing up units for Section 8 voucher holders. The agency is reimbursing moving fees up to $1,150 for an eight-room apartment, no small amount for an institution that has eliminated hundreds of jobs and shut community centers to contend with its budget deficit.
 Tenants at two of the 21 complexes -- Castle Hill Houses in the Bronx and Williams Plaza in Brooklyn -- said they had decided to remain in their apartments and not take part in the plan, another option available to them. At Williams Plaza, in the Williamsburg neighborhood, where 315 of 577 apartments will be converted to Section 8, several tenants seemed skeptical of the agency's plan and the voucher program.
 Others said they had no intention of moving out, with or without a voucher. ''I've been here 32 years, and I guess they'll take me out in a box,'' said Jacina Jimenez, 62. ''I'm not going. I'm safe here.''
 The agency, which first proposed the plan in 2006, is the first public housing authority in the country authorized by HUD to convert units to Section 8. Housing Authority leaders, including the agency's chairman, Tino Hernandez, have tried to be more creative about finding ways to increase government aid.
 For instance, private landlords for years were paid more by the state than public housing authorities for families on public assistance. So in 2007, the Housing Authority and public housing advocates persuaded the State Legislature and the governor to raise the so-called shelter allowance.
 Most of the Housing Authority's 343 developments were built by the federal government. But 21 sites were built by the city or the state, and in recent years those sites have become public housing's financial orphans.
 Though it costs the Housing Authority about $93 million a year to maintain the 21 developments, which contain a total of 20,170 units, the agency receives no continual operating money for them from the federal, state or city governments. 
 Housing Authority officials say that in 2003, the city stopped financing the six developments it built and that the state cut off money for its 15 complexes in 1998. In 2007, the agency asked state officials for $62 million for the state-built sites, but received only $3.4 million.
 The 21 developments rely on the federal operating subsidy from HUD to stay afloat, though that subsidy is allotted based on the costs of running 322 federal complexes in New York City -- not the agency's 343 total. Worsening the pressure on the Housing Authority, a gap of $611 million has opened since 2001 between the money HUD said the agency was eligible for and what the federal government actually gave it.
 Housing Authority officials said their struggles to maintain the 21 developments without any direct government aid threatened the financial stability of all their complexes, and they said their Section 8 transition plan would put the 21 sites on a better footing.
 ''This is a great victory for the more than 35,000 residentsof these 21 developments that ensures that they have affordable homes for the long term,'' Mr. Hernandez said in a statement.

HEADLINE: East Germany Had Its Charms, Crushed by Capitalism

BYLINE: By RICHARD EDER

 BODY:
NEW LIVES 
 By Ingo Schulze 
 Translated by John E. Woods. 573 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $28.95. 
 Whether or not a picture is worth a thousand words, a reproduction in the November issue of ARTnews is an example of the kind of thing it takes the German novelist Ingo Schulze 573 pages to protest.
 The magazine's ad shows a work by the artist Robert Indiana, offered by the Heritage Auction Galleries in Dallas. Titled ''Love/Wall,'' the piece is a variation of Mr. Indiana's celebrated tilted-O ''Love'' series, painted on a three-foot-by-three-foot chunk of the Berlin Wall. Well over a hundred East Germans paid with their lives trying to cross the wall; to acquire the chunk, a collector would pay rather less: an estimated $500,000 to $700,000. 
 Mr. Schulze's coldly satirical novel ''New Lives'' was published in Germany three years before the ad; otherwise he might have wanted it for the cover of his book. 
 Born and educated in East Germany, where he began to write, he has directed his fire at two targets. One is the harsh and (almost worse) stultifying Communist regime. The other is the capitalist tide that flooded in from the West once the wall came down, overpowering a ravaged and demoralized society and buying up quite a bit of it. 
 In two brilliant collections, ''33 Moments of Happiness'' and ''Simple Stories,'' Mr. Schulze artfully sketched the humanity as well as the shaming distortions of life under an inhuman system. Anger is there, delivered on shafts of wit, yet there is also a forbearance that only makes the anger more telling. This is not words hurled at a target; it is the target speaking, both with wry insouciance and as confession, though a confession devoid of self-pity.
 For the post-wall West German ascendancy, on the other hand, he has only anger. To Mr. Schulze what happened was not reunification but something closer to colonization. Bad as things were in the East, he has suggested, there were certain values that grew up against the distortions, like plants sprouting, marred but tenacious, through rubble. The Western bulldozer crushed them with a mix of exploitation and incentive.
 A minor character in ''New Lives,'' a die-hard leftist holdout in the reunified nation, makes an argument for the old Communist states: ''We, in the East, had been the guarantors that capitalism in the West had worn a human face. But that was all over now.''
 Odd, seemingly. Yet this very long novel describes a moral, social and economic plundering by an invading capitalism -- unrestrained in the absence of any countervailing force. Unlike Mr. Schulze's earlier work, the book has a tone of unalloyed bleakness. This bleakness colors not just the new situation but also the prewall society that he had previously treated with a measure of human complexity. ''New Lives'' is all scorn, for the old as well as the new.
 The protagonist, Enrico Turmer, tells his story through two sets of letters. One, relating his life under Communism, is addressed to a woman he had met only once but decided he was in love with. The other, to an old school friend, tells of his present-day life in 1990 as a budding capitalist in Altenburg, a picturesque former East German town.
 The letters reveal Enrico as two species of worm. Until the wall fell, he was a pretentious intellectual and would-be writer, state-subsidized, as intellectuals were in the weakening Iron Curtain days, so long as their mild dissidence did not threaten the necessary compliance. He dabbled with a comfortable do-nothing job as dramaturge for the Altenburg theater.
 The letters to the school friend describe his giving up art to work at a reformist weekly newspaper during the early reunification days. Before long he is accepting the blandishments and money of Baron Clemens von Barrista, a West German business consultant, to turn the paper from its crusader mandate into a daily ad-rich giveaway. At one point during the seduction, the baron, a blithe, infinitely indulgent source of Champagne and bouquets, shows his claws.
 ''Do you or do you not want to get rich?'' he demands suddenly, and when Enrico laughs nervously, adds: ''Take your time. Don't choose too hastily! It implies far far more than you may perhaps expect.'' 
 Indeed it does. Enrico ends up as the baron's pet poodle (but no longer petted). His wife, an actress and a revolutionary firebrand during the wall days, leaves him for the baron, who last appears hosting the ancient and decrepit Hereditary Prince of Sachsen-Altenburg. The onetime Communist followers of Altenburg line up to pay him hommage and confide their stories. Why stop at capitalism when you can regress to feudalism?
 It is mordant comedy. ''New Lives'' has other such scenes, along with passages vividly portraying the daily Leipzig demonstrations that, together with the spreading effects of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's glasnost, helped bring down the system.
 Largely, though, the novel is a failure. Its unrelieved bitterness is part of the problem, particularly because it extends through so fat a book. Purging should not go on too long.
 The narrator's voice, contained in the letters, is of an unvaried chill. That he strips himself bare while he is stripping others is no help: confession demands penance, and here it is the reader who makes it. Frequent footnotes by an unseen commentator provide, instead of elucidation, a steady, scornful disputing of the text; this metafictional device distances us even further.
 Virginia Woolf once wrote that even an experimental novel requires a thread running through it for the reader to take hold of. Here the thread is a chain, a heavy one.

HEADLINE: Slowdown in Persian Gulf Reverberates in Middle East

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona el-Naggar contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
For many of the financially strapped nations of the Middle East, the oil-rich countries of the Persian Gulf have served for years as an economic lifeline, providing jobs for their citizens, who in turn sent millions of dollars back home; tourists, who filled their hotels when Westerners were reluctant to visit; direct investment; and the kind of checkbook diplomacy that has helped stabilize an often volatile region.
 Suddenly, that lifeline appears frayed, dangerously so for countries like Egypt and Jordan, as the energy-rich nations find themselves pulled into the global financial crisis and undermined by dropping oil prices. Across the Persian Gulf, stock markets are down, causing panic among investors. Even in the boomtown of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the once-mighty real estate market has cooled as access to credit has tightened. 
 Governments across the region have intervened. 
 The United Arab Emirates injected $32 billion into its banking system and guaranteed bank deposits. Saudi Arabia has offered billions of dollars to make loans available to its citizens. And Kuwait, which had already cut its benchmark rate, this week moved to prop up its second largest bank.
 But the era of sky-high oil prices, while now a memory, left most of the region's capitals with enough cash reserves to cushion the blow, economists and financial experts in the region said. And as long as oil sells for more than $55 a barrel, most of the governments will take in more than they have allocated in their budgets, regional analysts said. 
 ''We are not calling for a recession in the gulf,'' said Marios Maratheftis, regional head of research for Standard Chartered Bank in Dubai. ''We are looking at a slowdown.''
 But a slowdown in the Persian Gulf might feel like a crash landing in places like Egypt, Jordan and Syria, where gulf money has helped prop up strained economies. 
 ''When there is growth in the gulf, there will be growth in the whole Arab world,'' said Rashad Abdou, a professor of economics and international finance at Cairo University. ''There would be more tourism, more money in the stock market, more investments. And the opposite is true. With a shrinking or recession, they will not come for tourism, they will not put their money in the stock market, they will not invest and they will not be able to hire Egyptian workers.'' 
 Egypt receives about half of its $6 billion in annual remittances from more than two million citizens living and working in the Persian Gulf area, while about 60 percent of its tourists come from that region, Egyptian economists estimated. Syria has benefited from gulf investments in large real estate projects, helping offset some of the isolation imposed by United States sanctions. Jordan receives about $2 billion annually in remittances from workers in the Persian Gulf and takes in about $500 million in financial aid from Saudi Arabia alone.
 ''I expect investments from the gulf to slow down or stop because they have to deal with their own problems before they invest in other countries,'' said Nabil Samman, an economist who runs the Damascus-based Center for Research and Documentation. ''Syria will be affected in terms of the Syrian people who send money from the gulf. There are close to a million Syrians in the gulf area.''
 Extravagant oil wealth has helped transform not only the Persian Gulf nations on which it was bestowed but also the greater Arab world. Egypt, once the cultural and political capital of a region that stretched from Morocco to Iraq, has taken a back seat to the petro-fueled economies and politics of places like Qatar and Saudi Arabia. 
 The Persian Gulf states took on an aura of invincibility, especially as oil prices crested this summer near $150 a barrel. And even as the financial crisis spread from the United States to Europe and into Asia, there was a feeling in the Middle East that oil-rich nations would be spared. But then the price of oil began to drop, precipitously, revealing a financial anatomy in many nations that was far from invincible.
 Sparkling Dubai was powered by the greatest construction boom in Middle Eastern history. But it was a dream built on a promissory note. Debt increased 49 percent from 2007 to 2008, so when the credit crisis came it hit Dubai hard, financial experts there said.
 Dubai had to turn to the government of the United Arab Emirates for an injection of capital to keep its banks afloat. Optimists are hoping that the cooling of Dubai's overheated real estate market will ultimately have a positive effect on the emirate, though they recognized it would not be without pain.
 ''The subprime crisis, which started in the U.S. in 2007, has developed into a full-blown international crisis with potentially severe consequences for the G.C.C. countries and their growth models,'' Eckart Woertz, an economist at the Gulf Research Center, wrote in a report issued this month. The G.C.C., or Gulf Cooperation Council, is a regional association that includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain.
 On Sunday, Kuwait suspended trading in shares of its second largest bank, Gulf Bank, after a customer defaulted on a derivatives contract costing the bank hundreds of millions of dollars. That further spooked the equities market in Kuwait, where the main index has dropped 19 percent for the year. 
 ''Every single person who has $100,000, which is to say, 20,000 dinars, is really involved in this,'' Suleiman al-Mutawa, a former planning minister in Kuwait, said of those invested in stocks. ''It adds up to family budgets, to family expenditures, to vacations, hence people are upset.''
 But Kuwait has done well compared with Saudi Arabia, where the main stock index has lost half its value since the start of the year.
 While the G.C.C. wrestles with its growing problems, its neighbors anxiously await the potential fallout from next door. There are signs that the pain is spreading.
 In Cairo, Karim Hussein, 27, has worked for the last three years in offices that arrange work visas for Egyptians looking for employment in the Emirates. He said in the past they would get requests for up to 70 visas a month. Now they get 10, he said, ''if we get anything at all.''
 In Amman, Jordan, Manal Saleh, 35, works for a company that sends skilled workers to the Persian Gulf. She said opportunities there have dropped by about half since the start of the year. ''In light of the financial situation, demand has shrunk,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Lively Reds, a Bargain for Hard Times

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
YOU say you don't want to spend a lot of money? Well, you are in luck. You're going to see a lot of articles in the coming days recommending inexpensive wines. Plunging economies bring out lists of wine bargains the way car accidents draw lawyers. 
 Yeah, I know, that was a cheap shot. But I can't afford the other kind (rim shot, please).
 Now, here's something that's no joke: montepulciano d'Abruzzo. The craving for cheap wines may be surging, but merely cheap is no bargain. What's needed are wines that obey the dictates of the dwindling bank account while satisfying the craving for reliable refreshment and restoration, and even piquing the interest a bit. That's where montepulciano d'Abruzzo comes in.
 This lively, juicy red wine comes from the rugged Abruzzi hills above the Adriatic coast of central Italy, a region long known for its tidal wave of mass-produced reds. Abruzzi is dominated by giant cooperatives pumping out adequately palatable wine, but it is evolving and improving, like much of southern Italy, with more and more serious producers taking the lead in seeking higher quality. And these serious producers have raised the bar for everybody. 
 To check in on the current wave of montepulcianos d'Abruzzo, the wine panel recently tasted 25 bottles, mostly from the vintages of 2004 through 2007. Florence Fabricant and I were joined for the tasting by Gabrio Tosti di Valminuta, proprietor of De-Vino, a largely Italian wine shop on the Lower East Side.
 The tasting confirmed our expectations. The montepulcianos were solid and enjoyable, bursting with tart cherry and earth flavors, sometimes augmented by herbal and floral aromas and, in the best, a minerally complexity. 
 Our No. 1 wine, the 2005 Valle Reale, combined all these qualities. Its lively pleasures made it far and away our favorite, and its $18 price was not too onerous.
 Still, we tasted quite a few cheaper wines. Of the 25 bottles, 7 were under $10 -- 8, really, if you consider that our best value, the 2007 Zonin, was a 1.5 liter bottle for $11. The Zonin is a great deal -- balanced and endlessly pleasing with spicy cherry flavors and floral aromas. Six more were $15 and under, and all told, 22 of our 25 bottles were $21 and under.
 Allow me to pause momentarily to offer the obligatory distinction between montepulciano, the grape, which is grown in the Abruzzi region and northward into Le Marche, and Montepulciano, a town in Tuscany and the source of a very different wine known as vino nobile di Montepulciano, made from the sangiovese grape. Furthermore, neither montepulciano nor Montepulciano should be confused with Montalcino, another Tuscan town famous for its brunello.
 Whew, I'm glad that's over. Now, back to business. Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is the kind of wine that I'm happy to find shoring up the bottom of any decent wine list, and not just Italian lists. It is resolutely dry, with enough soft fruit to be drinkable when young, yet tannic enough to keep it trim and energetic. While it pairs naturally with any dish that has tomato sauce, it's as versatile as barbera or good Beaujolais. 
 What you won't find with montepulciano is much variation in flavors. The least expensive wines among our favorites were straightforward. Aside from the Zonin, we liked four bottles that were $8 apiece. The 2004 Masciarelli offered bright cherry flavors tempered by a refreshing astringency, while the 2006 Vallevo and the 2006 Villadoro were a little less lively but had more floral and spice flavors. The 2006 Lilla was the simplest of these wines, but direct and enjoyable nonetheless.
 Our top three were a little more expensive but a definite step up in terms of dimension and intensity. I've already mentioned our favorite, the 2004 Valle Reale. Our No. 2, the 2005 Ciavolich Divus, had a lovely clarity to its sour cherry flavors, while the balance of cherry, herb and floral flavors in the 2006 Riparosso from Dino Illuminati offered intrigue and kept me coming back for more.
 What makes these wines more expensive? It's hard to say for sure, but when growers commit themselves to quality among the first things they do is to reduce their vines' yield. This requires work, but generally produces grapes with more interesting and intense flavors. It also means less wine, and thus, higher prices. 
 Winemakers can go too far, as well. They can invest in small barrels of new French oak and all sorts of technology to produce powerful, concentrated wines. These ambitious wines always cost more. One wine done in this more modern, international style, the 2005 from Antonio and Elio Monti, made our list at No. 9. It wasn't really to my taste, but it was well made and its modern touches did not so much dominate as accent the wine.
 Of the three most expensive bottles in our tasting, none made our list, which is not surprising if you have followed our reports on emerging wine regions. Often, the more expensive and ambitious a bottle is, the more it sacrifices the character of its region. Sure enough, the three most costly bottles, at $30, $39 and $44, each suffered from heavy oak treatment and overblown fruit flavors. While this style is popular with many people, it is often soulless and apparently can be achieved anywhere in the world.
 Does this mean that montepulciano d'Abruzzo is destined only to be an inexpensive guzzling wine? Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course, but the answer is no, emphatically. Two idiosyncratic Abruzzi producers, Edoardo Valentini and Emidio Pepe, have demonstrated that with singular vision, meticulous care and spare-no-expense viticulture and winemaking, montepulciano can produce magnificently deep, complex wines. These bottles are also extremely expensive, difficult to find and require long aging, so we did not include them in the tasting.
 Nonetheless, they prove that montepulciano can make world-class wines. For the most part, though, consider montepulciano d'Abruzzo a world-class bargain.

 Recipe: Eggplant alla Parmigiana Adapted from Antonio Guida, Il Pellicano Time: 1 1/2 hours
 Eggplant alla parmigiana has a lot in common with montepulciano d'Abruzzo. Both the dish and the wine are staples in low- to middle-tier Italian restaurants. They are rarely worth raves. 
 Usually, there is more to recommend about the wine than the dish. Eggplant alla parmigiana (eggplant Parmesan, as most people know it) all too often amounts to punishing the handsome and versatile vegetable by submerging it beneath breading, tomato sauce and oozing cheese. 
 But an eggplant alla parmigiana that is flavorful yet light and fresh is a great match for a good montepulciano d'Abruzzo, or even a better wine. 
 I had such a dish this summer in Italy, prepared by Antonio Guida at Il Pellicano on the Tuscan coast. His recipe takes advantage of the good plum tomatoes that are still in markets here. And unlike most eggplant alla parmigiana, it is even delicious when not piping hot. 
 Adapted from Antonio Guida, Il Pellicano
 Time: 1 1/2 hours
 4 small eggplants, each 6 to 8 ounces
 Salt
 1 cup extra virgin olive oil
 1 large clove garlic, chopped
 Freshly ground black pepper

 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
 Leaves from 8 sprigs fresh basil or 1/2 bunch fresh oregano, more for garnish.
 1. Trim eggplants and slice across 1/4-inch thick. Sprinkle with salt and place on one or more racks (cooling racks for baking) on a rimmed baking sheet. Set aside 30 minutes.
 2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet on medium, add garlic and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. When garlic is golden, add tomatoes and cook down a few minutes. Season to taste. Transfer to a food processor and pulse briefly until nearly pureed.
 3. Rinse and dry eggplant slices. Heat half the remaining oil in a skillet on medium-high. Fry as many as fit comfortably until golden, adding more oil and eggplant in shifts. Transfer fried eggplant to paper towels to drain. 
 4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread a little tomato sauce in a 9-inch casserole. Add a layer of eggplant, then half the cheese, half the basil and half the remaining sauce. Repeat layers. Top with a layer of eggplant. Bake 20 minutes. Remove and allow to sit 5 minutes. Garnish with fresh basil and serve hot or at room temperature.
 Yield: 6 to 8 first-course servings, 4 main courses. 
 Recipe: Eggplant alla Parmigiana Adapted from Antonio Guida, Il Pellicano Time: 1 1/2 hours
 Eggplant alla parmigiana has a lot in common with montepulciano d'Abruzzo. Both the dish and the wine are staples in low- to middle-tier Italian restaurants. They are rarely worth raves. 
 Usually, there is more to recommend about the wine than the dish. Eggplant alla parmigiana (eggplant Parmesan, as most people know it) all too often amounts to punishing the handsome and versatile vegetable by submerging it beneath breading, tomato sauce and oozing cheese. 
 But an eggplant alla parmigiana that is flavorful yet light and fresh is a great match for a good montepulciano d'Abruzzo, or even a better wine. 
 I had such a dish this summer in Italy, prepared by Antonio Guida at Il Pellicano on the Tuscan coast. His recipe takes advantage of the good plum tomatoes that are still in markets here. And unlike most eggplant alla parmigiana, it is even delicious when not piping hot.

HEADLINE: Ex-Detroit Mayor Begins Prison Term

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
As mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick traveled around town in a black Cadillac Escalade, relished his ever-present entourage of admirers and surrounded himself with as many as 21 bodyguards. But for the next four months, Mr. Kilpatrick must spend 23 hours of each day alone, in Cell 14J-4 of the Wayne County Jail.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Kilpatrick, a former middle school teacher who became Detroit's youngest mayor at age 31, was formally sentenced and began serving a sentence for obstruction of justice and assaulting a police officer. In September, Mr. Kilpatrick resigned and agreed to the jail time as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. 
 ''You were defiant, sometimes arrogant and oftentimes accusatory to people you blamed for your situation,'' Judge David A. Groner of Wayne County Circuit Court told Mr. Kilpatrick, who did not speak at his sentencing hearing but shook his head in disagreement as the judge admonished him. ''At a time when this city needed transparency, accountability and responsibility, you exhibited hubris and privilege at the expense of this city.''
 A lawyer for Mr. Kilpatrick, Gerald Evelyn, admitted that the former mayor ''has been downed by his own conduct'' but argued that ''he has done a lot of good for the city of Detroit, and people have chosen to ignore that.''
 Mr. Kilpatrick was jailed more than nine months after the eruption of a scandal that heaped more misery and embarrassment upon this economically depressed city and state. Text messages published by The Detroit Free Press showed that Mr. Kilpatrick had lied under oath when he denied having an extramarital affair with his chief of staff, Christine Beatty, and that he conspired with Ms. Beatty to fire police officers who might have revealed their indiscretions. The city settled a lawsuit by those officers for $8.4 million.
 A judge last week released hundreds more pages of text messages containing more romantic and sexually explicit exchanges between Mr. Kilpatrick and Ms. Beatty and from Mr. Kilpatrick to other, unidentified women. The messages suggest that Mr. Kilpatrick and Ms. Beatty paid for a weekend together in Colorado with money from a tax-exempt nonprofit group.
 In some exchanges, Mr. Kilpatrick and Ms. Beatty remind one another to erase the messages from their city-issued pagers. The messages, from 2002 through 2004, his first years in office, were archived by the service provider, SkyTel of Clinton, Miss., and obtained by prosecutors.
 Ms. Beatty, who resigned after the scandal broke and is charged with seven felonies including perjury, has declined to settle with prosecutors and is preparing for trial in January.
 Mr. Kilpatrick, 38, is scheduled for release in late February, when residents who twice elected him will vote in a special primary to determine who will finish his term. Until then, his home will be a sparse, 150-square-foot cell whose past inhabitants include Jack Kevorkian, the so-called suicide doctor. The cell is separated from others and reserved for high-profile inmates; it is the same cell where Mr. Kilpatrick spent a night in August for violating his bond. He will be given an hour a day for solitary recreation outside his cell.
 The jail is overseen by Sheriff Warren Evans of Wayne County, one of 18 people now running for mayor. Other candidates include the city's interim mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr.; Dave Bing, a former Detroit Pistons star who runs an automotive supplier in Detroit; State Representative Coleman A. Young II, whose father was the Detroit mayor from 1974 to 1993; Freman Hendrix, who narrowly lost to Mr. Kilpatrick in 2005; and Sharon McPhail, who was one of Mr. Kilpatrick's lawyers.
 The top two finishers in February's nonpartisan primary will face off in May. The winner will have just three months to settle in before the regularly scheduled primary in August, which determines the candidates for an election in November. 
 Mr. Kilpatrick, who must pay $1 million restitution to the city, will be on probation for five years, during which he is barred from seeking elected office.

HEADLINE: CONSUMERS FEEL THE NEXT CRISIS: IT'S CREDIT CARDS

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
First came the mortgage crisis. Now comes the credit card crisis. 
 After years of flooding Americans with credit card offers and sky-high credit lines, lenders are sharply curtailing both, just as an eroding economy squeezes consumers. 
 The pullback is affecting even creditworthy consumers and threatens an already beleaguered banking industry with another wave of heavy losses after an era in which it reaped near record gains from the business of easy credit that it helped create. 
 Lenders wrote off an estimated $21 billion in bad credit card loans in the first half of 2008 as more borrowers defaulted on their payments. With companies laying off tens of thousands of workers, the industry stands to lose at least another $55 billion over the next year and a half, analysts say. Currently, the total losses amount to 5.5 percent of credit card debt outstanding, and could surpass the 7.9 percent level reached after the technology bubble burst in 2001.
 ''If unemployment continues to increase, credit card net charge-offs could exceed historical norms,'' Gary L. Crittenden, Citigroup's chief financial officer, said. 
 Faced with sobering conditions, companies that issue MasterCard, Visa and other cards are rushing to stanch the bleeding, even as options once easily tapped by borrowers to pay off credit card obligations, like home equity lines or the ability to transfer balances to a new card, dry up.
 Big lenders -- like American Express, Bank of America, Citigroup and even the retailer Target -- have begun tightening standards for applicants and are culling their portfolios of the riskiest customers. Capital One, another big issuer, for example, has aggressively shut down inactive accounts and reduced customer credit lines by 4.5 percent in the second quarter from the previous period, according to regulatory filings. 
 Lenders are shunning consumers already in debt and cutting credit limits for existing cardholders, especially those who live in areas ravaged by the housing crisis or who work in troubled industries. In some cases, lenders are even reining in credit lines after monitoring cardholders who shop at the same stores as other risky borrowers or who have mortgages from certain companies. 
 While such changes protect lenders, some can come back to haunt consumers. The result can be a lower credit score, which forces a borrower to pay higher interest rates and makes it harder to obtain loans. A reduced line of credit can also make it harder for consumers to manage their budgets, because lenders have 30 days to notify their customers, and they often wait to do so after taking action.
 The depth of the financial crisis has shocked a credit-hooked nation into rethinking its habits. Many families once content to buy now and pay later are eager to trim their reliance on credit cards. The Treasury Department, which is spending billions of dollars in taxpayer money to clean up an economic mess brought on in part by all sorts of easy credit, recently started an advertising campaign inviting consumers to check into the ''Bad Credit Hotel,'' an online game that teaches the basics of maintaining good credit. 
 At the same time, the fear factor among lenders has deepened just as the crisis makes it harder for some financially stretched consumers to wean themselves from credit cards for even basic needs, like gas and food. 
 ''We are not going to say, 'Yahoo, this is over,' and extend credit like we did without fear,'' Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, said in a recent conference call. ''If you're not fearful, you're crazy.'' 
 Even those with good credit ratings are not excepted. American Express, which traditionally catered to more upscale cardholders, said it would be increasing effective interest rates by 2 or 3 percentage points for some of its credit card holders -- a move that could, for example, push a 15 percent rate up to 18 percent. 
 ''We think it's prudent given the nature of those products and the economic environment we face,'' Daniel Henry, its chief financial officer, said in a recent conference call.
 Some reward programs have also gotten stingier as lenders cut corners to save money. Card companies, for example, have taken to substituting cheaper brands for a Sony big-screen television as a way of lowering the cost of their redemption prizes.
 For less creditworthy customers, issuers are pulling back on promotional offers that allowed borrowers to pay no interest for months as they try to get ahead of stiffer lending rules that have been proposed by federal banking regulators and Congress. 
 The regulations, while beneficial to consumers, will curb profits on card issuers' riskiest customers. JPMorgan said that it was withdrawing some teaser-rate loans that were only marginally profitable. Discover Financial shortened the duration of its zero-balance offers. 
 And lenders, over all, are slowing the flood of mail offers to a trickle with moves that would translate for the average American household into about 13 fewer pieces of credit card junk mail a year than its peak in 2005. Mail offers to new and existing customers are on pace to drop below 8.4 billion pieces, the lowest level since 2004, according to Mintel Comperemedia, a direct marketing research firm. 
 Online credit card applications have fallen for the first time in five quarters, in part because customers are receiving fewer mail offers that drive them to the Web, according to data from comScore, an Internet marketing research firm.
 ''We used to get a couple of offers a week, but I haven't seen a credit card offer in over a year,'' said Brett Barry, who owns a real estate agency outside Phoenix and described his credit record as strong. ''What blows me away is these companies are in the business of extending credit, but they don't want to do it for me.'' 
 Mr. Barry said that, without any notice, American Express had reduced the credit limit on his business and personal credit card at least four times in the last year, which he said had lowered his credit score. The moves have also made it difficult for him to manage his payroll and budget, he said. 
 ''Credit card issuers have realized their market is shrinking and that there is no room for extra credit cards, so they have to scale back,'' said Lisa Hronek, a research analyst at Mintel. ''People are completely maxed out with mortgages, home equity lines and credit card debt.''
 At the same time, credit card profit margins have been narrowing, largely because lenders' own financing costs remain elevated as investors spurn credit card bonds, just as they did mortgages. Another factor is that the interest rates banks charge even creditworthy borrowers have come down after the emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve to ease the credit crisis. 
 Meanwhile, bank executives say consumers are starting to curb their spending, to an extent that may become clearer Wednesday when Visa reports its third-quarter results. 
 In previous downturns, banks could make up the missing profits by raising fees. This time, there may be less room to maneuver. 
 ''The last time credit costs spiked, the late fees were much lower, so card issuers could turn to that and reprice more nimbly,'' a Morgan Stanley analyst, Betsy Graseck, said. ''There is just more scrutiny now, and coming after the subprime mortgage crisis, the world is more sensitive to the way lenders behave.''

HEADLINE: New Orleans Rising, by Hammer and Art

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Over the last few weeks more than a few locals have stopped by to inform a small construction crew in the Lower Ninth Ward here that it obviously does not know what it is doing. 
 ''The whole time we've been here, people have been like, 'You know, that's not the way to build a house,' '' said Karen Del Aguila, laughing. ''They'd be like, 'Are you guys licensed?' ''
 Ms. Del Aguila, an assistant to the artist Wangechi Mutu, and her crew have been building the frame of a traditional shotgun house, not as a permanent dwelling but as part of Prospect.1 New Orleans, an ambitious new art biennial that is to open here on Saturday and continue through Jan. 18. 
 Billed as the largest exhibition of contemporary art ever held on American soil, the biennial is intended to help restore the cultural vibrancy of a city that remains on its knees three years after Hurricane Katrina. 
 With a star-filled roster of 81 artists and a projected 50,000 visitors from out of town, it may indeed bring benefits to New Orleans. But it is already clear that the arrangement has not been one-sided, and the New Orleans contribution has been rich. With its history of destruction and rebirth, artistic triumph and economic struggle, this crumpled crescent of a city provides a singular interpretive context that acts as a resonance chamber. 
 Some of the art refers directly to Hurricane Katrina, like Ms. Mutu's ''ghost house,'' which sits on the property of an elderly woman whose attempts to rebuild were stymied by a vanishing contractor. But most of it does not have to. 
 In a shedlike community center a few blocks from the ghost house, the New York artist Janine Antoni has deposited a ''soft wrecking ball'' made of lead and scarred by the act of demolition. Nearby, the Chilean artist Sebastian Preece has excavated the foundation of a Lower Ninth Ward house and transplanted it elsewhere. 
 Adam Cvijanovic, another New York artist, has taken a page from traditional New Orleans style and, in an unused house, installed a custom wallpaper that presents a lavish scene of a waterlogged swamp with no humans in sight. At the United States Mint in the French Quarter, Stephen G. Rhodes, from Los Angeles, is building a Hall of Presidents in which the presidents themselves are largely absent. 
 Other pieces mine the city and its history. The Thai artist Navin Rawanchaikul will present the jazz funeral that was never held for Narvin Kimball, the banjo player for the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, who died in March 2006 in Charleston, S.C., where he went after the storm. Skylar Fein has recreated a French Quarter gay lounge that burned in a suspicious fire in 1973, killing about half the patrons. 
 Miguel Palma, a Portuguese artist, is building a modified Higgins boat, a World War II vessel manufactured in New Orleans that, in Mr. Palma's version, contains a mini-tsunami. ''Instead of war games, you have rescue games,'' he said. 
 In this way New Orleans has become a collaborator, instigator and subject. Residents have volunteered by the hundreds to act as docents, provide exhibition sites (admission to all events is free) and assist the artists. Dan Cameron, the impresario behind Prospect.1 and a former senior curator at the New Museum in New York, said that as he was planning the biennial, a friend frequently reminded him of a quotation from Bob Dylan's ''Chronicles'': ''Everything in New Orleans is a good idea.''
 Prospect.1, Mr. Cameron said, is ''just 81 people running around with good ideas, and basically everyone they meet goes, 'Oh yeah, sure, I'll help.' '' 
 ''It is American,'' he continued, ''but it's no longer what we think of as American -- it's drop what you're doing and go do what your neighbor's doing.'' 
 This is, after all, the city of spontaneous parades. 
 Mr. Cameron said he was careful to select artists for the first Prospect who would attract critics and collectors but were not divas whose expectations might exceed the abilities of a first-time exhibition on a shoestring budget of $3.2 million. 
 ''I would have liked to have taken a few more risks,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''Curatorially, I like high-risk situations.''
 Almost every artist, even those whose work is not site-specific, visited New Orleans last year to get a feel for the city and the more than 20 biennial sites, which include the Edgar Degas Foundation; the New Orleans African American Museum of Art, Culture and History; the Battle Ground Church; and the Ideal Auto repair shop. 
 Some artists were inspired to depart from routine practice. Ms. Mutu, who created the ghost house, is best known for works on paper. The painter Mark Bradford built a three-story ark in a part of the Lower Ninth Ward that had some of the worst flooding after the hurricane. 
 Mr. Bradford's project gathered momentum after he met Keith Calhoun and Chandra McCormick, well-known local photographers who lost thousands of negatives to Katrina. (Hundreds of them are still awaiting salvage in a freezer that reeks of rot and floodwater.) Mr. Bradford met the couple as they were fixing up an old duplex they call the L9 Center for the Arts, and introduced them to Mr. Cameron. They in turn connected Mr. Bradford to people who could help him build. 
 Mr. Bradford auctioned one of his paintings, raising $65,000 to help renovate L9, Mr. Calhoun said. The space has become a biennial site, and recently Anne Deleporte, a French artist who lives in New York, was there finishing an ''anti-collage'' of selectively painted-over newspaper.
 She said New Orleans had eagerly watched the piece take shape, with some regularly checking on her progress. ''There are people, at the end of the day, they just walk by and say, 'Thank you,' '' she said. ''That's something I've never seen anywhere else in the art world.''
 Nine of the 81 artists taking part in the biennial live in Louisiana. Still, Mr. Calhoun said he would reserve judgment on Prospect.1's impact on the city. ''We have so many talented local artists, I'm hoping there will be some kickback for them too,'' he said.
 Although there is no telling how much attention will flow to the local museums and galleries, they are putting their best faces forward. And the biennial has already changed the arts environment in New Orleans. The Contemporary Arts Center New Orleans, where Mr. Cameron is the visual arts director, will open its top two floors to the public for the first time in years. Four artists are installing work at the Charles J. Colton Junior High School, which fell into disuse after the storm but is now, under the auspices of the Creative Alliance of New Orleans, offering free space to artists who agree to work with public school students. 
 Courtny Hopen, 23, a local artist who creates graphic novels and recently moved to New Orleans after graduating from Princeton, said she hoped that the biennial would upend some stereotypes about what constitutes art in New Orleans.
 ''I hope it draws in a lot more tourists, or at least a different crowd of tourists who will take a look at some of the more experimental and less mainstream New Orleans art,'' Ms. Hopen said. ''I hope it will bring attention to people doing something other than that fleur-de-lis and jazz.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 29 about the new art biennial Prospect.1 New Orleans, using information provided by the organizers, omitted an artist who helped present a jazz funeral for a musician who died in South Carolina after fleeing Hurricane Katrina. In addition to Navin Rawanchaikul, Tyler Russell also presented the project.

HEADLINE: Castros Fading as Issue in Miami Races

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
This tropical city's three Democratic Congressional candidates came to the heart of Little Havana last week and did not once mention Fidel or Raul Castro. Their audience was Cuban and old, but the message was new and economic. 
 ''Many people today are failing to get their medicine or they are in a house they can't pay for,'' said Raul Martinez, the Cuban-American former mayor of Hialeah who is running against the Republican incumbent, Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart. ''That is not the America we came to.'' 
 The audience cheered; he shouted louder. 
 It has become an increasingly common exchange across South Florida, where the economy trumps every other issue, and a sign of why the area's Cuban-American Republican incumbents may be in jeopardy after years of dominance. 
 With just a week to go, the races are tight. The Cook Political Report lists the state's 21st Congressional District, which includes central Miami, as a toss-up between Mr. Martinez and Mr. Diaz-Balart. Just south and west, in the 25th Congressional District, Joe Garcia is running about five points behind Mr. Diaz-Balart's brother, Mario Diaz-Balart, according to the trend estimate at Pollster.com.
 Annette Taddeo, a Colombian-American businesswoman and the only non-Cuban of the six candidates, appears to have a tougher climb against Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in the 18th Congressional District, which includes Miami Beach, but the gap has also narrowed. The Cook Political Report shifted the district last week to ''likely Republican'' from ''solid Republican.''
 A victory by any of the Democrats could bring to Washington a new approach to Latin America, which has been dominated by the Republicans' combativeness with Cuba. It would also highlight the demographic shifts of the last decade in Florida, defined by growth among non-Cuban Hispanics and younger Cubans who are more likely to vote Democratic. 
 Fernand Amandi, executive vice president of Bendixen & Associates, a local polling company that has done work this fall for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has identified the trend. ''It would be the first sign of turning Florida from a purple state to one that's blue,'' he said.
 Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and the Diaz-Balarts declined repeated requests for interviews. At a forum in Miami this summer, Mario Diaz-Balart said he would never talk to The New York Times because ''it's a biased newspaper.'' 
 But in debates and in advertisements, their response to the Democrats has been clear. For the Diaz-Balarts, it combines a focus on their Congressional records with attacks on their opponents' character. 
 Mr. Garcia, a former chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, has come under fire for taking campaign money from Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who is embroiled in a real estate scandal.
 Mr. Martinez, meanwhile, has been labeled a criminal. 
 He was, in fact, convicted in 1991 of extorting money from developers while he was mayor of Hialeah. The conviction was overturned on appeal, and two retrials ended with hung juries. But Lincoln Diaz-Balart has made sure the cases are not forgotten. At a debate this month, he said, ''I've never embarrassed our community with a corruption scandal, and I think that's a very important ingredient to keep in mind.'' 
 One of his campaign's television advertisements also calls Mr. Martinez ''horrifying,'' with quotes from testimony in the trials and grainy video of a man who appears to be Mr. Martinez punching someone. Mr. Martinez has run attack advertisements too, including one that accuses his opponent of accepting a suitcase of cash from an indicted Puerto Rican politician. Mr. Diaz-Balart's Web site calls it ''a proven LIE,'' after telling The Miami Herald that he received only $400 from the politician's family in 2006. In an interview, Mr. Martinez said the nastiness was driven by Republicans in an effort to distract voters from the economy. 
 But Ken Spain, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which has spent $600,000 or so on its own advertisements attacking Mr. Martinez, said the tactics were legitimate. ''The facts speak for themselves,'' Mr. Spain said. ''Character is going to be, and should be, a very important issue in these campaigns.'' 
 So far, the race between Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Ms. Taddeo has been cleaner. Until recently, Ms. Taddeo had been considered a long shot because she is relatively unknown and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen has a reputation for being attentive to constituents. But with the Republican brand beaten down nationwide, Ms. Taddeo has been gaining. One recent poll put her down by just seven points, a 24-point swing from a few months ago. 
 The rally last Thursday at the Little Havana Activities Center was in her district, and in a sign of how serious the races have become, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, introduced the candidates. It was her eighth trip to the area during this election cycle.
