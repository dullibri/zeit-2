Stealth Anti-Environmentalism

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
George W. Bush was a man with a serious environmental problem throughout his campaign for the presidency. And shortly after he took office, environmental groups successfully managed to cast him as "pro arsenic," for his administration's attempts to change water safety standards. 
 Then came Sept. 11, after which the biggest environmental groups fell silent, fearful that attacking the president would make them appear unpatriotic. 
 In response, the administration pressed ahead as quietly as possible -- largely through the regulatory process -- to allow road-building in national forests, reverse the phase-out of snowmobiles in national parks, make it easier for mining companies to dig for gold, copper and zinc on public lands, relax energy-efficiency standards for air conditioners, bar the reintroduction of grizzly bears in the Northwest and make it easier for developers to eliminate wetlands. Most recently, the administration approved the largest timber salvage operation in the nation's history in the Bitterroot National Forest, openly skirting the public appeals process, a move that has been halted by the courts.
The administration also pushed for drilling for oil in a wildlife refuge in Alaska as an attempt to bolster national security. And the fog of war has obscured, too, the administration's policy on global warming. Last summer, after President Bush rejected the international Kyoto treaty on global warming, he pledged to start research programs to study climate shifts and find new technologies to cut emissions without harming the economy. But government scientists say that administration officials are now telling agencies not to expect additional money to pay for new efforts. 
Many of these actions would have received front-page coverage as part of the evolving "pro-business" tilt of the Bush White House.

HEADLINE: On Film as in Life, You Are What You Forget 

BYLINE:  By JOHN LELAND 

 BODY:
IF you had your choice this season, what would you forget? How about everything?
 In the new movie "The Majestic," a screenwriter played by Jim Carrey drives his car off a bridge and emerges with a rumpled shirt and a near-complete loss of memory. As he wanders around making doe eyes at people he cannot recognize, he is in good company. If the movies are any indication, this is shaping up as the season for convenient forgetting. 
 In "Memento," Guy Pearce plays a former insurance investigator who cannot form short-term memories. He knows who he is, but has to write notes on his body to remember what he is doing from one moment to the next. In David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive," a starlet played by Laura Harring survives a car accident with a case of total amnesia, then embarks on a Nancy Drew quest to discover her missing identity. 
Tom Cruise in "Vanilla Sky" draws a blank on the most important event in his life (hint: it's also the last). And in Woody Allen's "Curse of the Jade Scorpion," a hypnotist forces the lead character to commit crimes, then forget them immediately.
The movies play out a forgetfulness that has permeated the culture in recent years. The stock market, the Internet and even history departments have all yielded their own versions of amnesia. Though it is a conventional plot device, this forgetting offers a window on broader fantasies and anxieties. 
"These films crop up in multiples for a reason," said Denise Mann, a chairwoman of the producers program at the school of theater, film and television at the University of California at Los Angeles. "There's a sense of social unease that's coming out in the movies." 
Books play along as well. In "The Corrections," the celebrated novel by Jonathan Franzen, a drug company is developing a formula that wipes out past personality.
There have been waves of amnesia movies in the past. Robert Sklar, a professor of cinema studies at New York University, points to a similar spate after World War II, including "Spellbound," "The Blue Dahlia," "Somewhere in the Night," "Deadline at Dawn" and "Love Letters." The films used amnesia to address the social dislocations of the war, Mr. Sklar said. "So many of the men or their families were trying to reconstruct their pasts. Amnesia was a metaphor for gaps in time that the war created."
The current amnesia movies play with a new set of dislocations. 
Though it may be tempting to relate them to Sept. 11, the movies were all conceived years before, during the economic boom, which produced waves of collective amnesia. Dot-com diehards crowed that the business cycle no longer existed, and the exuberance of the market allowed anyone to believe the past was irrelevant. No matter that you flunked out of college, you could still be an Internet zillionaire. 
Wealth was similarly wrenched from its connection with the past, tied not to your salary history but to your stock options, whose worth lay wholly in years to come. There was little need to remember the past; security lay in your purchase, however abstract, on the future. 
Identity became fluid, as anyone who has ever gone into a chat room knows. Memory could be erased with the stroke of a computer key. 
It was a period for ahistoric thinking, and as you might expect, history suffered, falling into its own version of willful amnesia. The past, it seemed, could be rewritten. Joseph J. Ellis, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, lied to his Mount Holyoke students that he had fought in Vietnam. Edmund Morris reinvented himself as a historical figure in his 1999 book, "Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan," concocting various encounters with Reagan over the years. 
Most recently, critics have accused Michael A. Bellesiles, whose 2000 book, "Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture," presented evidence that gun ownership was rare in our history, of fabricating some of his research. (Mr. Bellesiles has promised a rebuttal.) 
The movies play off this greater amnesia, creating stories around it. Amnesia is the flip side of nostalgia. Instead of wallowing in an idealized past, the movies present the past as forever out of reach, beyond the power to recollect. It has to be reconstructed. 
In "The Majestic," after Carrey's auto accident, he has to reinvent his identity from clues around him. Drawing on the memories of the local townspeople, who mistake him for a missing war hero, he creates a nobler self than the one he left behind. Losing his past was the nicest thing that could happen to him. This may seem like a boomer's-eye view of death -- with the convenient bonus that no one has to die. But Frank Darabont, the film's director and producer, said: "It's really a way to experience one's rebirth. It's a story about somebody finding his better self. What better way to get there than to empty the vessel?"
But in most of these movies, this metaphorical rebirth has a darker side. In a culture obsessed with individuality, what could be more horrifying than to lose one's identity?
The consequences are often dire. In "Memento," for example, the lead character uses his loss of memory to behave without conscience, knowing he will not remember his actions. 
In this way, amnesia in today's culture taps a far bleaker fantasy than nostalgia, said Ms. Mann of U.C.L.A. "We want to return to the affluence and calm of the Eisenhower era, but we can't get back there because of inexplicable events of random violence," she said, citing the school shootings of recent years as one example of violent disruption. In the movies, similarly, characters lose access to their past after violent trauma. 
Slavoj Zizek, a psychoanalyst who has written extensively about the movies, ties the vogue for amnesia to a much broader disruption, stemming from shifts in global politics. "Until the collapse of communism we had large stories to tell," he said. But it became impossible to understand the events after 1990 in simple terms such as East versus West. "If we take any political event today, it explodes into a thousand narratives," he said. 
For all this, the traumas of the season have exposed the limits of amnesia. It's easy to wish to forget the events of Sept. 11. But this is a trap; memory is probably what everyone needs right now. However painful the associations, a knowledge of the past -- of history and language -- became more valuable than ever.

Hussein and bin Laden: How Opposites Attract

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AS the United States ponders whether to expand the war on terrorism to Iraq, various officials and ex-officials have tried to connect the dots between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Administration officials debate the credibility of claims by Czech officials of a meeting in Prague between an Iraqi intelligence officer and Mr. bin Laden's leading suicide operative in the Sept. 11 attacks. R. James Woolsey, the former director of central intelligence, has tried to link Mr. Hussein to the anthrax attacks in America.
 But what, if anything, connects Mr. bin Laden, the religious extremist master of terror, with Mr. Hussein, the secular president of Iraq? 
 Clearly, the two men share a hatred of the United States and its military presence in the Persian Gulf, and a conviction that the international community was using economic sanctions to starve the Iraqi people. 
And both are skillful mythmakers. Mr. bin Laden has portrayed himself as a modern-day prophet, reciting poetry and posing in front of caves, bathed in sunlight, like Muhammad. Mr. Hussein has been even more creative. He never served in the army, but in 1990 he promoted himself to field marshal. In the 20-foot-high paintings that dominate Iraq's landscape, he has been a desert horseman, a wheat-cutting peasant and a cement-carrying construction worker.
But that's where the similarity ends. Mr. bin Laden preaches an extremist, militant version of Islam and claims loyalty only to God. He has attacked the Saudi royals as "infidels" for allowing American troops to be based near the holiest shrines in Islam. 
Indeed, after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, Mr. bin Laden, fresh from the war against Soviet invaders of Afghanistan, came calling on Prince Sultan, Saudi Arabia's defense minister. According to an oft-told story in official Saudi circles, Mr. bin Laden said Saudi Arabia didn't need a foreign infidel army to defeat Iraq; he and his followers could do it. "There are no caves in Kuwait," Prince Sultan then said. "What will you do when he lobs missiles at you with chemical and biological weapons?" Mr. bin Laden replied, "We will fight him with faith." 
Mr. Hussein, by contrast, is a secular state builder whose loyalty is to himself. In his modernization campaign, he has allowed drinking of alcohol in public and freedom in women's dress. He has used ruthlessness, cunning and expansionism to exterminate his enemies in his quest to physically and intellectually homogenize a diverse population and mold Iraq into the most powerful nation-state in the Arab world. 
That includes repression of Iraq's Shiite community, roughly 55 percent of the population. In the 1970's, the country's most respected Shiite leader, Ayatollah Mohammad Bakr al-Sadr, supported an underground religious movement that preached a return to Islamic principles in government and social justice for all. Antigovernment riots in the name of Islam were crushed.
In 1979, after the ayatollah led a procession lauding the Islamic revolution in Iran, Shiites staged massive riots against the Iraqi regime. The following year, the ayatollah, his sister and their followers were executed. When Shiites in the south revolted after the 1991 gulf war, Mr. Hussein sent in his elite Republican Guards, who strafed crowds, doused the wounded with gasoline and set them on fire and publicly hanged captives as a lesson to would-be plotters.
"Not only is Saddam not an Islamic fundamentalist, he has been at war with the fundamentalists," said Judith Yaphe, a senior research fellow at the National Defense University. "The only loyalty he trusts is loyalty to himself. So God is a rival."
Yet Mr. Hussein, like Mr. bin Laden, understands the power of religion and has used its imagery to reinvent himself. In what many Muslims regarded as heresy, Mr. Hussein, a Sunni Muslim, had a family tree done that traced his ancestry to Mohammad's daughter Fatima, his son-in-law Ali and their son Hussein, the spiritual patrons of Shiites. During the war against Iran, Mr. Hussein denounced Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's claims to the leadership of the Islamic world. The Persians, he said, could not lead the Muslim world. 
In the late 1980's, Mr. Hussein made the pilgrimage to Mecca that every good Muslim must do at least once. Photographs of Mr. Hussein draped in the white shroud of a pilgrim, kissing the Black Stone at the Grand Mosque have been hung in the courtyards of Shiite mosques across the country. 
Recently, Mr. Hussein has taken his use of religion to a level not even Mr. bin Laden aspires to. In a mosque outside Baghdad sits a handwritten copy of the Koran. Officials claim that in the last 3 years Mr. Hussein gave 50 pints of blood to produce the ink for the 600-page book.

HEADLINE: After Backing Bloomberg, Latinos' Hopes Are High 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
Latino New Yorkers voted Republican in significant numbers for the first time in this year's mayoral election, becoming a significant factor in Michael R. Bloomberg's victory. Now they want results.
 From average voters to political, business and grass-roots leaders, many said they expected the new administration to appoint Latinos to high-ranking positions and increase their numbers in city government to a share more reflective of their population in the city. Currently, Latinos make up about 27 percent of the population, and about 15 percent of the city government's employees. 
 "Numbers count," said State Senator Olga A. Mendez, a Democrat and one of the few Puerto Rican elected officials who endorsed Mr. Bloomberg in the mayoral race. She said she has lobbied for her own preferences, including Tino Hernandez, who was just reappointed chairman of the city Housing Authority.
Another priority is shielding schools, hospitals and public housing from budget cuts.
"I can't see any more cuts than we've suffered in the past eight years," said Luis Garden-Acosta, a Brooklyn community leader who is on the mayor-elect's transition committee. "That would be unconscionable."
Mr. Garden-Acosta said the mayor should reward Hispanic voters by spending on services, even if that means Police Department cutbacks or tax increases, which Mr. Bloomberg ruled out during his campaign. Mr. Garden-Acosta said the police could save money by reducing waste and duplication and altering its use of some personnel. And he said Mr. Bloomberg should expand after-school programs, even if doing so required a surcharge on taxpayers.
But Ms. Mendez said she trusted that Mr. Bloomberg would use his business skills to creatively address problems without extra spending -- by attracting private money, for example, or striking favorable deals with state and federal officials -- as he tackles rebuilding the city's economy after the trade center attack.
"We have to look for reasonable solutions because there's no money," she said. "The budget deficit is going to be terrible. I have faith that he'll come up with new ideas."
In neighborhoods like Corona, Queens, where up to half of the mostly Democratic Latino electorate defected to Mr. Bloomberg's camp, voters did not have to think hard when asked what the new mayor should do: fix public schools with crumbling buildings and inadequate teaching, do something about six-week waits for doctors' appointments and household budgets squeezed by jumps in rent of $350 or more.
In political circles, meanwhile, the initial focus has been on trying to turn the Hispanic Bloomberg vote into real gains by getting Latinos appointed to commissions and high-level posts. 
Those interviewed were hesitant to give specific numbers, but said they expected more representation in decision-making positions, and more diversity in agencies that need it.
"We need people at Bill Cunningham's level if the constituency is going to get its due," said Juan Figueroa, president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, referring to William Cunningham, a top aide of Mr. Bloomberg's.
Expectations among Latinos range from high to nil. Political leaders like Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic Party leader who supported Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer's mayoral bid, said he had never spoken to Mr. Bloomberg nor shaken his hand and personally expected nothing from him.
Some Latino supporters of Mr. Bloomberg's said that the mayor-elect did not really owe them anything, that he never made any promises beyond building an administration of "the best and the brightest" to reflect the city's demographics.
To that end, some members of the mayor-elect's transition committee said they had made sure to offer the names of qualified Latinos for consideration for every available position, and to give their opinion of other candidates being considered for important agencies, like the Human Resources Administration.
"We were as concerned about Latinos being in the mix as we were that other candidates were Latino-friendly," one committee member said.
Angelo Falcon, a senior policy executive with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the onus was on the Latino leadership to push its agenda.
"We got people's attention," Mr. Falcon said. "The question is what do we do now with that attention? That's not real political power."
He added: "It's not like he's going to repay us and we can sit on our hands. If we don't put the issues in front of his face, he's not going to deal with them."
So far Mr. Bloomberg seems to be off to a good start with his Latino constituency. Symbolic gestures, like traveling to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and holding a breakfast meeting with Mr. Ferrer, the Democrat who lost to Mark Green in the party primary, right after his election, have signaled a new, more inclusive style of leadership than that of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, some Latino political leaders said.
Many also praised him for the high number -- 10 -- and diversity of Latinos in his transition committee, from Mr. Garden-Acosta and Susana Torruella Leval, president of El Museo del Barrio, to the labor leader Dennis Rivera and Andy Unanue, chief operating officer of Goya Foods. 
Mr. Bloomberg also appointed a Puerto Rican woman, Carol A. Robles-Roman, his deputy mayor for legal affairs.
"He has shown he's putting aside electoral politics and wants to work with all the sectors," said Miguel Martinez, a newly elected member of the City Council who was born in the Dominican Republic and whom Mr. Bloomberg asked to accompany him to the Caribbean last month, even though Mr. Martinez had endorsed Mr. Green in the election.
The Rev. Ruben Diaz, a councilman who also supported Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy, said, "We're getting access to City Hall." He said he expected the mayor's commissioners and deputy mayors to be reachable as well.
Mr. Bloomberg won 47 percent of the Hispanic vote, voter surveys showed, even though most Latino voters are registered Democrats and their turnout in the Democratic primary was a record high of about 28 percent, prompted by a viable Latino candidate.
But that candidate, Mr. Ferrer, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, narrowly lost the primary runoff to Mr. Green, who offended many Ferrer supporters with his negative advertisements.
Hispanic voters struck back by either staying home or splitting the vote between Mr. Green and Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Green won 49 percent of the Hispanic vote, voter surveys showed.
Now many Hispanic New Yorkers are optimistic that Mr. Bloomberg will come through for them.
"People's expectations are higher and rightly so," Mr. Figueroa said. "We haven't been at the table and we're barely touching it, but we're touching it."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: TRANSFER OF POWER; 
Afghan Leader Is Sworn In, Asking for Help to Rebuild

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Appealing for help from God, his fellow citizens and the outside world to unify and rebuild his war-ravaged nation, Hamid Karzai, an Afghan tribal leader with a regal bearing and an aristocratic lineage, was sworn in today as chairman of an interim government that replaces the defeated Taliban.
 Resplendent in a purple and green traditional robe, Mr. Karzai bowed his head five times as a diverse array of Afghan leaders and 2,000 spectators applauded his inauguration. 
 In the audience was Gen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of the United States-led campaign that brought down the Taliban and routed Osama bin Laden's terrorism network, which is blamed for the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. 
Adding to the optimism and calm that pervaded the capital today was the show of unity by two Afghan military commanders who had been expected to snub the ceremony: Gen. Rashid Dostum, the dominant commander in northern Afghanistan, and Gen. Ismail Khan, a powerful leader in the west. Both arrived in Kabul this morning. General Khan entered the packed hall during Mr. Karzai's speech.
In that speech, in which he struck a plain-spoken, humble tone, Mr. Karzai called on Afghans here and around the world to join in the challenge of reconstructing a nation brought down by decades of conflict.
"In this critical time, when our motherland is watching our actions, let us come together and be brothers and sisters," he said. "Let us be good to each other and be compassionate and share our grief. Let us forget the sad past."
Dozens of foreign ministers, ambassadors and foreign military officers looked on as Mr. Karzai spoke. General Franks and James F. Dobbins, the United States special envoy, were in the front row. Nearby were the foreign ministers of Iran, Pakistan and India and the Russian special envoy to Afghanistan.
Mr. Karzai then swore in the 29 members of his cabinet, who are to administer the country for six months, the first phase of a political transition intended to lead to elections within two and a half years.
The new government faces a staggering task.
Afghanistan is a desolate, drought-stricken landscape of bombed-out factories and graveyards where the prime economic activities are smuggling and primitive farming. Vast swaths of its south remain ruled by tribal councils and bandits. Eighty percent of the population is illiterate. One out of four children die before the age of 5. 
The new government will be tested in other ways. Mr. Karzai and the three Northern Alliance leaders who are expected to dominate the cabinet are from a generation of younger moderates who say they are different from the generation of older warlords who ravaged the country in the early 1990's. 
The four men put the blame for Afghanistan's internal strife on outside countries that have backed and armed different factions, rather than on Afghans themselves. With nations in the region and the United States now pressing for unity, Afghans will have to show whether that is true.
Yunus Qanooni, the new interior minister and one of the senior Northern Alliance leaders, said the ceremony was the first time in Afghan history that power had been peacefully transferred between two parties.
Burhanuddin Rabbani, head of the Northern Alliance and the internationally recognized president of Afghanistan even after the Taliban gained control of most of the country, handed power over to Mr. Karzai under a United Nations-brokered accord reached by Afghan parties near Bonn three weeks ago.
"It is privilege for the Afghan nation that we are all under this roof," Mr. Qanooni said, referring to the array of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras and other ethnic groups that filled the stage. "Afghans have decided not to hear a single gunshot. Instead they want to listen to the music of peace."
The ceremony culminated in Mr. Karzai's taking a new Afghan oath of office, in which he pledged to protect the rules and laws of Islam and also to defend human rights.
As the oath was administered by the acting head of the Afghan Supreme Court, members of the audience leaned forward in their chairs and craned their necks to see the stage. As Mr. Karzai uttered the final words of the oath, Mr. Rabbani stepped forward, and the new and former Afghan leaders embraced.
At a news conference after the ceremony, Mr. Karzai said the government would be measured by its achievements, or lack of them. The line in his speech that had received especially loud applause was a call to end the corruption that plagues the country and could threaten the efficient use of an estimated $16 billion in reconstruction and development aid.
"The significance of this day in Afghan history really depends on what happens in the future," Mr. Karzai said in fluent English. "If we deliver, this will be a great day. If we don't deliver, this will go into oblivion." 
But hints of potential political division lingered in the cavernous, Soviet-style assembly hall in the Interior Ministry where the ceremony was held. An enormous banner depicting Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Northern Alliance military leader who was assassinated in September, hung from the stage.
The loudest shouts and applause were prompted by mentions of Mr. Massoud's death. Troops and commanders from the often-fractious alliance, which is dominated by Tajik, Uzbek, Hazaras and other northern minorities, clearly dominated the audience.
Mr. Karzai, a Pashtun and former deputy foreign minister, is from the southern city of Kandahar, and he was once a rival of the Northern Alliance. He is a supporter and relative of the exiled former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, whom many Pashtuns support. 
The new government itself emerged from a political compromise. Many of its members were chosen because they filled ethnic or gender quotas that made the Bonn agreement acceptable to the country's factions. 
Eleven departments will be run by Pashtuns, eight by Tajiks, five by Hazaras, three by Uzbeks and three by other minorities. 
Various officials, including General Dostum, an Uzbek, have complained that the three most powerful departments -- interior, defense and foreign -- went to the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance. 
But for today at least, unity appears to have prevailed. General Dostum, during his appearance here, issued a statement of support for the new government. Pashtuns and Hazaras said they felt comfortable in Kabul, which is being run by police officers drawn from the Northern Alliance.
The arrival of General Franks this morning momentarily ended the festive atmosphere outside the hall, where martial music played and the police welcomed dignitaries. 
Reporters shouted questions about reports that American warplanes had attacked a convoy of tribal leaders headed for the ceremony, mistakenly thinking that they were fleeing Taliban or members of Mr. bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.
Today, residents of Asmani Kilai in eastern Paktia Province told the Reuters news agency that airstrikes Thursday night and Friday morning destroyed houses and a mosque and killed civilians in the village as well as people in the convoy. One villager suggested that a rival commander might have deliberately misinformed American forces about the identity of the people in the convoy in order to settle a score.
But General Franks said he had received reports that the convoy had fired on American aircraft before it was bombed. "We'll take a hard, firm look at it," he said. "It looks like it was a good target at this point."
Amid continuing questions about Mr. bin Laden's whereabouts, Reuters said today that Pakistan's military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, told Beijing state television that there was a strong possibility that Mr. bin Laden was killed in the bombing of the Tora Bora mountains. He added that Pakistan was still keeping a strong watch at the border for him.
"He is not in Pakistan, that we are reasonably sure, but we can't be 100 percent sure," General Musharraf said. "And if he does enter, if we identify him, he will be handed over."
 Near Kandahar, engineers worked Saturday to expand a temporary prison camp at the Marine base in expectation of receiving 100 to 300 more Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees. The camp currently holds 16 inmates. 
Inside the hall in Kabul, the talk was of victory over the Taliban and hope for the future. The line that seemed to draw the most emotion in the audience was not from an Afghan speaker, but from the Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel. He made a reference to Mr. Massoud, the slain alliance commander, that captured the combination of grief, exhaustion and aching hope. 
"I am sure," Mr. Michel said, "that Mr. Massoud is proud of his nation today." That single sentence sent tears rolling down scores of weathered, wrinkled and scarred cheeks in the audience.

B2) Chart: "A Tumultuous Century for Afghan Leaders"Turnover in Afghan leadership was high in the 20th century, frequently as a result of violent overthrow. A brief look at who ruled and for how long. 1901: Habibullah Khan tries to modernize Afghanistan with the West as a model. 1919: Habibullah Khan is assassinated (CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF ASSASSINATION OR EXECUTION) and his son, Amanullah Khan, becomes king. Amanullah enters a war with Britain, and Afghanistan gains the right to conduct its own foreign affairs. 1928: Civil war breaks out, and Kabul is wrested from Amanullah in January 1929 by Bache Saqaw, the first Tajik to rule the region in centuries. 1929: Saqaw is driven out and later executed (CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF ASSASSINATION OR EXECUTION) as Mohammad Nadir Shah comes to power. He produces a new constitution, emphasizing religious principles. 1933: Mohammad Nadir Shah is assassinated, (CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF ASSASSINATION OR EXECUTION) and his 19-year-old son, Mohammad Zahir becomes Afghanistan's last king. In 1934, Afghanistan joins the League of Nations, and is officially recognized by the United States. Zahir Shah's prime minister, Shah Mahmud, experiments with political tolerance and liberalization by tolerating opposition groups, but when the groups become too vocal, the brief experiment ends quickly. 1953: The king's Western-educated cousin, Mohammad Daoud Khan, becomes prime minister, and he turns to the Soviet Union and the United States for economic and military assistance, but the Soviets end up being the major benefactor. 1963: Mohammad Daoud Khan resigns, and a king-appointed commission drafts a new, liberal constitution that promotes individual rights over tribal rights, and it provides for a constitutional monarchy with two legislative chambers, but most of the power remains with the king. 1973: Almost bloodlessly, the former prime minister Mohammad Daoud Khan seizes power while the king is away for medical treatment. He proclaims that Afghanistan is a republic and that he is president. As he consolidates power, leftist parties unite against him. 1978: Mohammad Daoud Khan and his family are assassinated, (CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF ASSASSINATION OR EXECUTION) and Noor Mohammed Taraki becomes president of the renamed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The government issues decrees on land reform, atheism, imprisonment and execution that are seen by some conservatives as opposing Islam. 1979: Noor Mohammed Taraki is assassinated (CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF ASSASSINATION OR EXECUTION) on orders from his prime minister, Hafizullah Amin, and in December, the Soviets begin their invasion of Afghanistan. Within a couple days, they secure Kabul, Amin is killed, (CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF ASSASSINATION OR EXECUTION) and Babrak Karmal becomes the head of state. Opposition to the Soviets and Karmal spreads quickly. 1986: Karmal is replaced by Mohammed Najibullah, who remains in power even after the Soviet troops withdraw in1988 and 1989. 1992: Najibullah yields to the mujahedeen, leaders of the anti-Soviet resistance. Power changes hands more than once, finally resting with Burhanuddin Rabbani, a former professor at Kabul University and an active fundamentalist. His regime largely collapses in 1996. 1996: The Taliban march into Kabul, and they begin to impose their strict interpretation of Islamic law. Their spiritual leader is Mullah Muhammad Omar, a former resistance fighter against the Soviets who studied in a religious school in Pakistan. Najibullah is hanged. The Taliban provide haven for Osama bin Laden. 2001: Hamid Karzai, an Afghan nationalist and a Pashtun who made his name by opposing the Taliban, is installed as interim leader of Afghanistan.(Sources: Dr. Alam Payind, Middle East Studies Center at Ohio State University; Library of Congress)(pg.

To the Editor:
 Since the economic stimulus package is being held up as a whole ("Congress Gives Up on Deal This Year to Help Economy," front page, Dec. 20), why doesn't Congress, after it returns, pass bills for some individual pieces? 
 Specifically, both parties agree that unemployment benefits should be extended by 13 weeks and that this is a real emergency. Why aren't our representatives looking after our unemployed?

HEADLINE: ARTS ONLINE; 
Driven by a Higher Calling, Not Dot-Com Dollars

BYLINE:  By Matthew Mirapaul 

 BODY:
Romance without finance, as the jazz musician Tiny Grimes once sang, is a nuisance. Art without money, on the other hand, is such a familiar refrain that it is almost expected.
 And so it was in 2001 for the online arts, which flourished despite a dearth of dollars. The collapse of countless e-commerce ventures may have prompted many to dismiss the Internet as a viable economic platform, but it certainly remains vital as a creative medium. 
 "The dot-com bust has cleared out the carpetbaggers and left the Internet to those who really care about it," said Jon Ippolito, a digital artist and new-media curator at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
The sheer volume of work produced in 2001 indicates that enthusiasm for the medium is still high among artists, even if their interest was fueled by the realization that they were not going to get rich designing Web pages for Sow-Ear.com. Perhaps they were motivated by the recognition that making digital art might yield greater, if less tangible, rewards.
There was good art, too, including works that helped define the emerging genre. "Feed," by the New York artist Mark Napier, is the most refined example yet of an artist's browser, displaying Web pages as though they were tiny, animated Abstract Expressionist paintings. "The Apartment," by Marek Walczak and Martin Wattenberg, New York artists, converted a viewer's typed words into a virtual 3-D space, its walls made from images culled from the Net. And "life_sharing," by the Italian duo known as 0100101110101101.org, made all of their computing activities public in an effort to show that art imitates one's hard drive.
Mr. Napier said Net art met the real world in 2001. "We're past the initial glow of excitement about a new medium," he said. "Now the challenge is to take this beyond a small group of intrepid explorers and the gee-whiz of a new technology and into an art form that can engage a larger audience and sustain itself in the long run." As the year opened, museums were primed to supply that audience. "Feed," at feed.projects.sfmoma.org, and "The Apartment," at turbulence.org/ Works/apartment, were shown during high-profile digital-art exhibitions at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. 
Institutional support seemed to fade along with the technology sector's prospects, though. The oft-postponed opening of the Guggenheim Virtual Museum was delayed again while the museum built its dot-com site and now must be considered "vaporware," which is the computer industry's term for promised products that never arrive. The Museum of Modern Art in New York, which had planned to commission a series of online works in 2001, has put up only one, an indecipherable piece by the video artist Tony Oursler, and has none scheduled yet for next year. The San Francisco Modern's $50,000 competition for digital art has been postponed while the museum searches for a new director.
High-tech companies were in no position to pick up the slack. The financially ailing Lucent Technologies pulled the plug on its sponsorship of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's new-media program. Intel, which had mounted a series of online exhibitions at its ArtMuseum.net site, is donating the venture to a nonprofit organization, people familiar with the deal said. The site may be reborn next year as part of ArtAndCulture .org. An Intel spokesman said the site's status had not changed, and he declined to comment on plans for it. 
"It's a really hard time for funding right now," said Beau Takahara, director of ZeroOne, a Silicon Valley nonprofit organization that supports tech-art initiatives. She continued: "For two months after Sept. 11, it was virtually impossible to ask anyone for a gift. Now the asking seems possible -- the holiday spirit seems to be kicking in -- but the companies are still really hurting."
Yet online artwork continues to be made. An example of this might be found in etoy, a group of anonymous artists who use the Internet to mimic -- and thus comment on -- corporate behavior. Two years ago the online retailer eToys.com sued the artists over their longstanding etoy.com Web address, claiming it confused their customers. This year eToys.com is bankrupt, but the etoy artists are as active as ever.
The etoy and "life_sharing" projects illustrate how the genre is evolving away from the computer screen and its interactive graphics. The Internet is increasingly being used as an element in larger, conceptually oriented pieces that spill over into the physical as performances or installations. 
As wireless technology becomes more pervasive, digital artists are adapting it to their own devices. For instance the artist Patrick Lichty has organized an online exhibition, at voyd.com/ia, of works made for handheld computers. In 2002 the public-art presenters Creative Time are planning a series of wireless-based projects, including one that will transform a segment of SoHo sidewalk into a computer screen that displays text messages sent from cellular telephones.
Christiane Paul, the Whitney's new-media curator, has selected a wireless work, "Tap" by James Buckhouse, for the museum's 2002 Biennial exhibition, and she expects to see more made. "Information networks should be nomadic and flexible," she said, "and our current setup of the static computer hooked up to a network somehow contradicts that concept."
Digital artists have not abandoned the screen completely. They continue to explore the aesthetics of computer games. Interactive-sound projects, which are programmed to produce music in response to a visitor's actions, are becoming more sophisticated. Doo-wop fans will adore Jim Andrews's "Nio," at vispo.com. An intriguing new musical poem, "Story Problem," by the author Terri Ford and the multimedia designer Erik Loyer, will go online officially on Jan. 1 but can be previewed now at bornmag.org/projects/sp.
How is all this work being produced if there is no financial support for it? It is often simply a labor of love. Some institutions do appear willing to support the nascent genre in other ways. The Guggenheim has begun a preservation initiative, and the Whitney is home to an online-art history project, "Idea Line," at whitney.org/artport, that traces themes in the genre's growth.
For Tilman Baumgartel of Berlin, the author of "net.art 2.0" (Verlag fur Moderne Kunst Nurnberg, 2001), there is more to online art than money. "In the middle of the 90's, people treated me like I was crazy because I didn't found a start-up to become a millionaire," he said. "Now all the people that wanted to become millionaires with the Net have disappeared. But, hey, the Net art scene is still exciting."
As a Gershwin-loving Santa might sing, "Ho, ho, ho, who's got the last laugh now?"

HEADLINE: Drama and Pragmatism Drive Fight Over aHiring 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
The news release last Friday by SANgate Systems did not tell the half of it.
 SANgate, a privately held data storage start-up company based in Southborough, Mass., announced that Patrick Courtin had joined the company as chairman and chief executive. 
 Mr. Courtin, whose most recent stop on a 20-year career in technology companies was at a software company called Gensym, was quoted as being "thrilled" with SANgate's potential. Thomas Crotty, a board member whose venture capital firm, Battery Ventures, is a major SANgate shareholder, was said to be "extremely pleased" to have someone with Mr. Courtin's experience and track record on board. 
What SANgate did not mention was that Mr. Courtin was hired less than a month after EMC, the data storage giant, got a Massachusetts court to quash SANgate's previous choice for chief, Doron Kempel. Until SANgate tapped him in September, Mr. Kempel had been general manager of an EMC division developing products for storing and retrieving multimedia data. 
EMC argued that Mr. Kempel's contract barred him from moving to a potential competitor within 12 months of leaving EMC. As part of SANgate's legal response, Mr. Crotty submitted an affidavit asserting that the company would need six months to find a replacement for Mr. Kempel if he could not come aboard and that it faced "irreparable financial damage."
Asked on Friday to square the court testimony with the sudden appearance of Mr. Courtin, Mr. Crotty said that presenting a dire outlook in defense of Mr. Kempel had been simply "part of the process." Battery Ventures was in fact prepared to move quickly to provide a successor because it has a partner, Cornel Faucher, whose sole job is maintaining a list of suitable candidates to lead the companies in which Battery invests. 
"SANgate's board moved into interview mode the day after the ruling," Mr. Crotty said. "Also, this happens to be a good time to be looking because of the economy. A normal search can take six months."
Is SANgate, which has no products yet, really a threat to EMC, which will finish 2001 with revenues of about $6.8 billion? That was probably not the point to EMC, which has a reputation for strictly enforcing provisions in its employment contracts that restrict who can hire its workers. By EMC's philosophy, it is better to be paranoid than sorry.
"Does it make people think twice about hiring EMC employees?" said Mr. Crotty. "Absolutely. It's a business strategy that, much as I hate to admit it, is working for them."

A mother dreams up a way forchildren to study while they eat breakfast.

BYLINE:  By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
DIANE ZEGARRA, a pastor and entrepreneur in Hermon, Me., says her moment of inventive insight was divinely inspired.
 "My daughter was 7 years old at the time, going to a private Christian school, and she was very slow in her reading class," Mrs. Zegarra said. "She was really discouraged with school to the point where she wanted me to home-school her. So I just prayed and I asked the Lord to give me an idea." 
 First, Mrs. Zegarra had a dream. "I saw a big, thick book with pages turning and I saw these drawings on these pages," she said. "In my heart I knew that these were all the inventions that had not been invented yet."
Two weeks later, Mrs. Zegarra had a "vision."
"I was praying at about 5 o'clock in the morning and this idea, it just flashed through my head," she said. "I saw my daughter sitting at the kitchen table, staring at a cereal box."
But it wasn't an ordinary cereal box. "This cereal box was inside a beautiful cover and her papers were in there," she said. Mrs. Zegarra said she saw her daughter reading blissfully -- not the back of the cereal box but rather, her homework, which had been tucked inside the special, clear cover.
"I told this girl that cuts my hair about it," Mrs. Zegarra said. "I knew this was an awesome idea but I can't sew. She said, 'I can make you one.' "
So Mrs. Zegarra, who was operating a second-hand store out of the side of her house at the time, brought some materials to her beautician. 
They fashioned a prototype of Mrs. Zegarra's idea out of clear polyvinyl. The result was something like a see-through tote bag that a cereal box sits inside. It had an 8-by-10-inch pocket into which homework sheets could be inserted, and other pockets for things like erasable markers.
Mrs. Zegarra said her daughter, Christina, was so excited by the box cover that she spent every morning at breakfast working on her homework, and soon she was reading at grade level.
"As a study aid, it changed her life," Mrs. Zegarra said.
So Mrs. Zegarra decided to bring her invention -- for which she recently received United States patent 6,279,747 -- to the marketplace. That is when her tribulations began.
To pay for patent fees and prototypes, Mrs. Zegarra said, she and her husband sold their car and van.
Finding manufacturing costs too high in the United States, they went to her husband's home country, Peru, where they had a company in Lima make 200 of the study aids, she said.
"I've probably got $30,000-plus into this bag," Mrs. Zegarra said.
Once back in Maine, Mrs. Zegarra started marketing her study aid, selling it locally for $20 to $25.
She said she was approached by a doctor who promised her a licensing deal, but then reneged. "I had patent pending but he copied my whole invention." Mrs. Zegarra said. "When I found that out, I just cried." 
This fall, she and her husband were laid off as youth pastors at the Abundant Life Church, a nondenominational church, leaving her with few resources to promote her invention. "I didn't want to go on the government," she said. "My husband could have collected unemployment, but we wanted to trust in God."
Then another idea came to Mrs. Zegarra, who said she had been increasingly worried about money. "We have a huge garden out back," she said. "So I made three loaves of zucchini bread and sliced them up and went out to sell them. My husband started laughing at me. But I was home in 20 minutes and I had $14 in my hand."
So she began selling breakfast and lunch to car mechanics and office workers on a regular basis.
Mrs. Zegarra still hasn't licensed her study aid, though her ambition is to have it featured on QVC, the television shopping network. But, she noted, the Lord works in mysterious ways. She and her husband recently started their own ministry, which meets weekly in their converted two-car garage. And Mrs. Zegarra's food business is prospering. "I sell more than 100 brownies and cakes a day," she said. "I never intended it to be so successful."

HEADLINE: Shoplifting Is Adding to Retailing Difficulties 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
As a guard at the new Toys "R" Us flagship store in Times Square, Alvin Foote has seen plenty of bold thieves this season. There are the children who stuff video games under their shirts. There was the man who wheeled a shopping cart into the store with a large gift box in it and then tried to wheel it out again full of toys without passing the registers.
 Then there was the man who tried to steal the giant stuffed giraffe. "The head was coming out of the jacket, so we caught him," Mr. Foote explained. 
 In a year of shopping woes that include plunging profit margins and unseasonably warm weather, add a rising tide of shoplifters to the threats that retailers must combat.
The number of people on the make for the proverbial five-fingered discount always surges during holiday times as stores grow more crowded and thieves find it easier to blend in without detection. This year, however, loss prevention experts see a convergence of factors, including a weakening economy, psychological stress from the Sept. 11 attacks and the trend toward longer store hours with smaller staffs, that may swell the ranks of shoplifters much more than usual.
Not until retailers do their final inventories in January will the damage done this season really be known, if ever. Major retailers are reluctant to discuss crime in their stores. "We hate to talk about anything negative this time of year," said a Bloomingdale's spokeswoman, Anne Keating. Several chains including Best Buys and Wilson's: The Leather Experts say they have seen no recent increase in shopper theft.
Losses from shoplifting gradually rose over recent years to about $13 billion in 2000, the most recent figure available, according to the University of Florida Retail Security Survey. More current statistics are difficult to come by because most large cities -- including Los Angeles and New York -- do not track shoplifting as a separate category but include it in petty larceny. The Chicago police say retail theft is down 10 percent for all 2001, but have no numbers available for the last three months alone -- the period in which retailers noticed more shoplifting. 
Still, there is evidence that it is a tough season out there. The Denver Police Department, one of the few large metropolitan forces that has a separate citywide shoplifting unit, says that for October and November cases were up 12 percent from last year. December is not over, but already complaints appear to be higher than they were in the 2000 holiday season. "We've seen a big rise this year," said Diane Stark, a detective, who says electronic items and DVD's are particularly popular among crooks. "We think it is because the economy is bad and a lot of people are being laid off." Moreover, the toll has been heavy enough in recent months that some retailers have had to speak up. The CVS Corporation, one of the nation's largest drugstore chains, says shrinkage, the industry term for unexplained inventory losses, started to rise noticeably at the beginning of the third quarter with thieves going after items like batteries and disposable cameras. "Clearly I believe the weak economy is certainly a factor in increased shrinkage," Tom Ryan, chief executive of CVS, told stock analysts during a call a month and a half ago to report the company's third-quarter earnings. Mr. Ryan said he expected the problem to continue into the first half of 2002.
Convenience stores are also expecting a rise in theft on goods with high resale value. "The general sense is that with a down economy some items like batteries, razors and phone cards are seeing more organized theft," said Jeff Leonard, spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores.
If there is any clear factor motivating the fleet of hand it is the slowdown of the national economy, which has led to job loss and fear of job loss. During the boom years of the late 1990's shoplifting losses rose less than $1 billion in five years. Losses from employee theft rose much more swiftly.
The current economic downturn will increase shoplifting by $1 billion in 2002 alone, according to a study commissioned by Checkpoint Systems, which manufactures security tags for retail products, from Retail Forward, Inc., a retail research and consulting firm. 
"Looking at the past 30 years, there is a significant correlation between shoplifting and variables that change significantly in an economic downturn such as unemployment claims, the savings rate and retail prices," said Frank Badillo, the senior retail economist who designed the study for Retail Forward .
Retail crimes demand not just motive, of course, but also opportunity, and this season retailers are providing plenty of the latter. To cut costs, stores have dramatically scaled back their staffs. Seasonally adjusted employment at department stores plunged by 45,000 this October and November, according to the Department of Labor. 
Not all of those employees would have been walking the floors and deterring theft. But the labor cuts come when everyone from Kmart to Saks Fifth Avenue is suddenly adding extra hours in a last-ditch effort to save a dismal season.
"Retailers are running extended hours without hiring extra employees or putting in overtime hours," said Burt Flickinger III, the managing director of Reach Marketing, a consulting firm in Westport, Conn. "Executives are now running scared that when they do inventories at the end of the fiscal year, they will pay a record price in missing inventories."
There are roughly two kinds of shoplifting. Shoplifting by professional gangs represents a minority of offenders, but a disproportionate amount of financial damage. The more common type is the impulse shoplifter. This person is motivated not by need but by anger. Over the years, various rich and famous people have been caught in the act. 
Earlier this month, for example, the actress Winona Ryder was arrested on charges of shoplifting at the Saks Fifth Avenue boutiques in Beverly Hills after she was found removing the security tags from some $4,760 in clothing.
Since impulse shoplifting has been linked to such psychological factors as stress and depression, several shoplifting counselors also think the attacks of Sept. 11 and the aftermath could greatly increase the ranks of this type of thief.
"Shoplifting is not about financial problems. It is about getting something for nothing," said Peter Berlin, executive director of Shoplifter's Alternative, a national nonprofit group that treats shoplifters. "Many people do as a substitute for loss: the loss of health, a loved one, a job, or a stock market loss. It is a kind of payback."
Mr. Berlin said he has polled his shoplifter support groups, which treat some 30,000 people, to see how Sept. 11 would effect their behavior. "Everyone said the compulsion was the same or greater," he said. "No one said it was less."

HEADLINE: Christmas Dinner For 1,000 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The soup kitchen at the Church of the Holy Apostles on Ninth Avenue in Chelsea is the largest in New York. And the operators of the kitchen will try to make today, Christmas Eve, a little special for the people in tough circumstances who show up for a meal.
 The ranks of the hungry and the homeless are swelling in New York. And it's not easy to have a merry Christmas when your wallet is empty, your stomach is tightening from hunger, and you haven't a place to stay. 
 Holy Apostles sees some of the hardest cases -- the men who aren't working, who may be abusers of drugs or alcohol, who may be mentally ill or H.I.V. positive, or may have spent time in prison. They don't get a lot of sympathy. But they are human. And today they will be able to sit down in a warm and clean environment with more than 1,000 other hungry and homeless New Yorkers, and feast on a traditional holiday dinner. They'll have roast turkey with giblet gravy, mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, ice cream -- the works.
But those are just a few of the homeless New Yorkers. Between 25,000 and 30,000 people are showing up at the homeless shelters each night, and many others are sleeping in the subways, in the parks or on the street.
It wasn't that long ago that we were crowing about the economy, patting ourselves on the back and telling anyone who would listen that it was the best of times. And, yet, across the country hundreds of thousands of people were struggling with the desperate and demoralizing experience of homelessness. That population has only grown as a result of the economic downturn of the past several months and, especially in New York, the devastating economic effects of the Sept. 11 tragedy.
"Before it was announced that we were in a recession we knew it," said the Rev. William Greenlaw, the soup kitchen's director, in a reference to the increased demand at Holy Apostles. "Now we're getting the ripple effect from 9/11."
The evidence of increased homelessness can be seen across the city this holiday season, and the problem is likely to get substantially worse before it improves.
The homeless population served by the shelter system consists primarily of families with children. For them, unsure of where they will be staying on any given night, the quest for a happy holiday is less than a top priority.
Annette Quinones and her 5-year-old daughter, Taylor, were among those who showed up to apply for shelter at the city's Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx. When she was asked what she would be doing for Christmas, Ms. Quinones said: "Nothing. Trying to get housing." She added, "It's a sad way to spend Christmas and there are lots of people in this situation."
Marcia Dristell was also at the assistance unit, with her two children, Arshad, 10, and Melicia, 9. Ms. Dristell said her son was hearing impaired and had not been to school in a month because the family has been bouncing from one temporary location to another. When Arshad was asked what he wanted for Christmas, he said, "All I want is a house to live in peace and to go to school."
One of the reasons so many people were homeless even before the economy tanked was the shortage of housing that could be afforded by people earning low wages. Try renting an apartment in New York on a hamburger-flipper's pay. When the downturn hit, individuals who were earning more than the minimum wage but still were barely making enough to stave off eviction notices were suddenly finding themselves out of work entirely. With no savings to fall back on, many ended up homeless.
Americans have been waging war on the poor for a long time. The late-90's boom shielded this shameful practice for awhile, but now, with unemployment rising and welfare time limits kicking in, the signs of distress are becoming more and more visible.
Homelessness is not an unsolvable problem. There are programs that are successfully housing previously homeless people, whether they were working families or individuals who simply could not afford housing, or people who were physically disabled, or who suffered from mental illness, or men and women addicted to alcohol or drugs. The blueprints for such programs are available. What has been lacking is a national commitment to address the myriad problems associated with poverty.
Homelessness is just one of them.

HEADLINE: Koizumi Calls for Vigilance After Japan Sinks Suspicious Boat 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
Japan's prime minister called for increased territorial vigilance today after a pitched naval battle in which the Japanese Coast Guard traded heavy fire with a vessel suspected of being a North Korean spy ship before it sank just inside an economic zone claimed by China. The ship's entire crew of 15 is believed to have drowned.
 "The situation is deplorable in that armed, suspicious boats are infesting waters around our country in this manner," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said today. "We need to consider countermeasures." 
 Since taking office last April, Mr. Koizumi, a nationalist, has raised the profile of Japan's military, sending ships to the Indian Ocean to help the United States in the war against terrorism and winning passage of a new law that allows Japanese military ships to use greater force in patrolling national waters.
Coast Guard officials briefed reporters in Tokyo today on the incident. They said that in waters midway between Shanghai and Japan's southernmost main island, two bodies of Asian men were recovered from the South China Sea today. Korean writing was found on one man's life preserver and on a bag of candy in the other's pocket. A third body sank before it could be recovered. Autopsies are planned for Monday to determine whether the men committed suicide to avoid capture, a characteristic of North Korean intelligence operations.
After the ship sank on Saturday night at 10:13 local time, the three Japanese Coast Guard vessels involved in the pursuit trained their search lights on the site, spotting about half a dozen crew members clinging to flotsam in the water. But the Japanese did not rescue the men, reportedly on orders from commanders in Tokyo, who feared that they were armed. Two hours after the sinking, no more crew members were seen alive.
Today, Naoto Kan, secretary general of Japan's opposition Democratic Party, called for an investigation of the battle, Japan's first naval engagement in almost half a century.
Although North Korea had not responded by this evening, the sinking and loss of life are a further blow to relations between two countries that last had direct talks on normalizing ties 14 months ago.
On Friday afternoon, just before sunset, a Japanese maritime patrol plane spotted a 100-ton vessel built like a fishing boat, but without fishing gear. The boat, about 90 miles northwest of Amami-Oshima Island, was well inside Japan's 200-mile exclusive fishing zone, according to the Coast Guard. It appeared identical to a fast-moving North Korean spy boat that eluded pursuing Coast Guard boats two years ago, officials said. 
On Saturday morning, a Coast Guard boat, the Inasa, caught up with the boat inside Japanese economic waters. Over two hours, crew members of another Coast Guard boat, the Mizuki, used a bullhorn to order the boat to stop. The Japanese boats fired a total of 13 warning shots across its bow, officials said. The boat, which had been zigzagging, bumped the Inasa. 
When the Japanese tried to board it, about 10 men on board brandished metal pipes. Just after sunset, the Mizuki fired several hundred rounds from its 20 millimeter machine gun into the fleeing boat. In a videotape supplied today by the Coast Guard, the ship could be seen bursting into flames.
But the crew managed to douse the fire, and the ship continued to flee due west, toward the Chinese mainland. By 9 p.m. the Japanese pursuit group had grown to four ships, and commanders decided to surround the vessel. As one of the Japanese ships, the Amami, came within 25 yards, two men emerged from blankets on the deck of the mystery boat and fired automatic weapons at the Japanese, wounding two sailors. Crew members in the wheelhouse also fired on the Japanese.
In response, the Inasa fired "186 rounds in self-defense," Shigehiro Sakamoto, a Coast Guard official, said. During the gun battle, a large explosion, apparently unrelated to the firing, was heard aboard the mystery ship, Japanese sailors reported. Shortly after the explosion, the ship sank and 15 crew members were seen jumping into the water.
"It is possible that crew members themselves sank the ship deliberately," Shinzo Abe, Japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary, said today.
In Beijing today, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the boat was not Chinese, but expressed "concern toward Japanese use of military force in the East China Sea."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ARMY BASE; 
In a Rugged Military Town, a Lonely Christmas

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: FORT DRUM, N.Y., Dec. 23 

 BODY:
The call came one Saturday night in October as the Santiago family sprawled on the living room couch watching television. The phone conversation lasted just a few seconds, but Stacy Santiago knew from her husband's stony expression what it meant.
 Two hours later, Sgt. Jose Santiago, a biochemical specialist with the Army's 10th Mountain Division, was gone, leaving her with their three children and persistent anxieties about his safety. He could not say where he was going, but the desert-style battle fatigues Sergeant Santiago donned gave away the destination. "I knew he was going to Afghanistan," she said. 
 Over the past two months, similar calls have cleaved hundreds of other families whose lives are tethered to Fort Drum, the northeast's biggest military installation and home to the 10th Mountain Division, the fabled quick-strike battalion whose members have been scouring Afghanistan's craggy terrain in search of Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda. Although a spokesman for the base would not discuss troop deployments, Army officials say at least 1,000 men and women from the division have been sent to Central Asia since October, with many others poised to join them. 
It is a particularly lonely and unnerving Christmas for families like the Santiagos, who have had little contact with those stationed in Afghanistan or neighboring Uzbekistan. "I've already broken down a few times," Mrs. Santiago, 31, said as she prepared Christmas dinner for five other women whose husbands are in Central Asia. "It's been rough, and it's going to be worse on Christmas when we're opening the presents."
While many families here are grappling with similar emotions, pride and patriotism are the reigning sentiments here in Watertown, population 25,700, where life is dominated by the military and nearly everyone knows someone who goes to work in fatigues. There are 10,500 military personnel and another 2,000 civilians employed at the base, whose main entrance begins about nine miles from Watertown's Victorian-era public square. Mary Corriveau, the assistant city manager, said, "We're always aware of what's going on in the world, aware that our soldiers are in harm's way, but we know they're out there protecting our freedom."
Spreading across 109,000 acres near the Canadian border, Fort Drum is one of the biggest employers in northern New York, a region best known for its punishing winters, numbing job losses and steadily declining population. But here in Watertown, that story had a different ending. Starting in the early 1980's, when the Pentagon designated Fort Drum home for the 10th Mountain Division, the military embarked on a $1.3 billion expansion. For the city, it was like a second chance at life. 
"Fort Drum has been very good to Watertown," said Karen Delmonico, president of the local chamber of commerce. "It's been our savior." Although downtown Watertown still has the down-and-out look of many upstate cities, the fringes of town are buzzing with so-called big box retailers, a new mall and fast-food outlets.
Still, with the base drained of soldiers and talk of recession in the air, many businesses were expecting a ruinous holiday season. But early Christmas sales and stunningly mild weather -- the first snow fell Friday -- have staved off disaster, merchants say. "So far we have no complaints," said Sheila Barney, 48, whose family-owned furniture store, Truesdell's, more than doubled its showroom space last year. The expansion, she said, has been largely fueled by young military families who generally stay two or three years before being transferred. 
But the pizzerias, video rental stores and military haberdashers that depend on an enlisted man's paycheck have seen much of their business dry up since the war on terror began. At Jefferson Community College, where a third of its 3,000 students work for the Army, enrollment has fallen sharply since September. "If the war goes on, we could be seriously impacted for the spring semester," said the registrar, Donna Eisele, whose son and husband work at the base. 
Besides the men and women now in Afghanistan, thousands of others are on peacekeeping missions in places like Kosovo, Bosnia and South Korea. Many of the remaining soldiers have been given leave for the holidays. "Right now, we're deader than a mackerel," said William G. McKinney, the owner of Bradley's Military Supply, just outside the main gate.
During October and November, Mr. McKinney's overworked staff embroidered 2,600 name tags, added pouches to hundreds of rucksacks and sewed 10th Mountain Division patches onto the shoulders of scores of tawny fatigues. (The division insignia is a pair of crossed swords that form the Roman numeral 10 inside a powder keg.)
"The guys would never say where they were going, but we had a good idea," he said, holding up the type of floppy hat that is indispensable in the desert sun. "This mission has been incredibly secretive."
As one of the nation's most active military bases, Fort Drum is accustomed to the vagaries of global unrest. Over the past decade, its troops have served in hot spots like Somalia, Haiti and the Sinai Peninsula, and many wives here say they have grown accustomed to long stretches sleeping alone. "It's rough but this is what you get when you marry a military man," said Tara DeButts, 33, whose husband has been stationed at Korea's demilitarized zone for the past year. "For us, Christmas is hoping your spouse will be here and hoping he'll be okay if he's not."
The hardship can be even more difficult for those with spouses in Afghanistan. To start with, the mission seems more perilous, the communication more sporadic and the end date still undetermined. For a month after he left, Mrs. Santiago did not hear from her husband, although the five-minute satellite phone calls have been coming every week or so since. "At 4 minutes and 20 seconds, an operator comes on to say the call is over," she said. "It's hard because he can't talk about where he is or what he's doing."
The Army offers counseling and financial assistance to the women, and there's always Diane Sykes, the unofficial den mother to lonely wives and single young men whose families live in faraway states. A 15-year Fort Drum veteran who works at the post bowling center, Mrs. Sykes drags them out five nights a week. "You can't let them hole up in their homes and say 'woe is me,' " said Mrs. Sykes, 47, whose husband and two sons have spent many a Christmas on foreign missions. (Michael, her oldest, will go to Korea next month.)
As slushy snow fell last Thursday, Mrs. Sykes held court at Seaway Lanes, her voluble laugh nearly drowning out the sound of crashing pins. All around her were soldiers or army wives, nearly all of them smoking, many of them clutching bottles of Miller Lite as they waited their turn to bowl. The mood was buoyant and at that moment, at least, no one was grumbling about the domestic toll of overseas military engagements. "It's hard at first, but we all learn to take care of ourselves," said Mrs. Sykes, her arm draped around the shoulder of Mrs. DeButts. "You miss them, but you just carry on. This is what the military is about. It's sink or swim for the guys and sink or swim for us."

 BODY:
 Flight Fraught with Danger

THE SUSPECT -- Laboratory tests confirmed that explosives packed with wires had been hidden in the sneakers of a man who was subdued by passengers and flight attendants aboard an American Airlines jet over the Atlantic. Investigators said they were not immediately able to establish any tie between the man and terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, and that his motives remained a mystery. A1

THE PASSENGERS -- Those aboard American Airlines Flight 63 said they sensed something was not right about the tall, unkempt man who was acting restless and appeared out of place. Once their suspicions proved justified, a number of them recalled, they acted quickly. Their resolve apparently averted what could have been a catastrophe. A1

THE INVESTIGATION -- The French border police opened an inquiry into how a man with no baggage, a possibly forged passport and sneakers loaded with plastic explosive boarded a flight from Paris to Miami unchallenged. Although the man carried a British passport, confusion remained about his real identity. B5

A Vale of Violence

KASHMIR -- Islamic guerrillas in Pakistan who challenge India's rule over the disputed territory of Kashmir appear unconcerned that they could be the next target in America's war on terror. The indifference reflects something common among Islamic militants -- a sense that God's will, and certainly not American power, is the ultimate driving force of mankind's affairs. A1

THE GOVERNMENT -- On his first day in power, Hamid Karzai, the leader of Afghanistan's interim government, convened a two-hour meeting of his ministers that began with a reading from the Koran before quickly turning to the country's continuing security problems and how to feed millions of displaced people. B1

Blind Marauders of the Sky

AIR POWER -- The swiftness and accuracy of the American air campaign in Afghanistan illustrated a new kind of air power, where high-technology precision weapons, guided by aircraft and ground commandos, enabled a ragtag opposition to rout the once-feared Taliban army. The implications loom large not only for the next phase of the war on terrorism, but also for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's vision of overhauling the armed forces to respond more quickly to emerging threats. A1

RAVAGED EARTH -- Near Tora Bora a few weeks ago, American air raids leveled a munitions dump belonging to Al Qaeda. In pitiful Afghanistan, this spot of scorched earth is now considered a place of plenty, attracting dozens of scavengers who come for the precious scrap metal, which, even if they are careful, is liable to explode in their hands and blow them to bits. B2

CLUSTER BOMBS -- Arms control experts from nearly 90 countries agreed Friday to set up a group that would consider ways to reduce civilian casualties caused by cluster bombs and other explosives long after conflicts end. B2

AT FORT DRUM -- It is a particularly lonely and unnerving Christmas for the families of at least 1,000 men and women from the Army's 10th Mountain Division who have been sent to Afghanistan or neighboring Uzbekistan in the last few weeks. The division is stationed at Fort Drum, the northeast's biggest military installation and one of the biggest employers in northern New York. B6

Washington's Ways

THE WHITE HOUSE -- Among the many differences between President Bush and former President Clinton is their style of lobbying, as became apparent last week in the way Mr. Bush handled the economic stimulus package that died in the final days of the congressional session. B2

The Islamic World

THE TELEVANGELIST -- Celebrity preachers are nothing new for the Muslim world. But Amr Khalid is in a class by himself. Thousands throng to a suburban Cairo mosque to hear his religious homilies, snap up tapes of his speeches and sit transfixed before their television sets to watch his live twice-weekly show. A4

Aftermath in New York

DEGREES OF NEED -- New York City's poorest people -- the homeless, the hungry and the sick -- voice complex and conflicting opinions about the millions of dollars being made available to the families of the terror attack victims. Instead of resentment, most express a knowing sympathy for those who suffered most keenly on Sept. 11. B1

DOWNTOWN -- The view outside Moran's bar, a block from the trade center site, has improved since those first few awful weeks. The view inside has gotten even better, now that the crowds have returned to eat, drink, talk and laugh. B1

WELCOME -- The Olympic torch made its way through the streets of New York City to Rockefeller Center, held by runners who had lost relatives in the Sept. 11 attack, police officers and Mayor Giuliani. F3

Business

TRAVEL INDUSTRY -- Even before Sept. 11, travel agencies had begun to feel the impact of cuts made by corporations in their travel and entertainment budgets. Now, with the recession and the November crash of Flight 587 in Queens scaring off even more potential passengers, some forecasters warn that waves of failures, bankruptcies and layoffs are about to sweep through the industry. F1

MAIL ATTACKS -- Some companies have been steaming their mail as a precaution since the anthrax scares began. But in destroying any bacteria, they often destroy the mail, which raises the question: Does anyone really need snail mail any more? C3

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: CHARITY; 
Among the Poor, Sympathy for the Families of Sept. 11

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
A man known as Brother Sanchez approached the men who sat, still in their coats and warm knit hats, at a long cafeteria table at the Help House Love Kitchen, inside the Manhattan Bible Church in Inwood. Very politely, Brother Sanchez, who works as a cook at the soup kitchen, asked for a moment of silence so that he could bless their supper. Part of what he said, in a rapid, almost guttural chant, went like this: "We pray for the tragedy of the trade center, Lord God, all those families who lost people, Lord God, and the plane crash that hurt so many families, Lord God."
 There were, in the room, some people whose problems were the same on Sept. 12 as they were on Sept. 10 -- disability, addiction, homelessness. There were others who simply had too thin a cushion between them and the hard times that have set in since: a man who could no longer find freelance work, a woman raising two children on her own. This holiday season, these people, the hungry and the sick, have been eclipsed by the families of firefighters and executives as icons of neediness. But among them, there is little resentment. 
 In interviews over the past few days, the city's poorest people voiced complex and conflicting opinions about money and who gets it. True, the lines they stand in for what might be the day's only meal are growing steadily longer. True, the average sum available to each family of a terrorist victim has mounted to well over $1 million, while soup kitchens whose annual budget is far less have begun to close their doors. 
But rising above the debate was a clarion sympathy, hard as metal and tempered by experience, for those who suffered most keenly on Sept. 11.
If anything, visits to meal programs provided yet another testament to how few people were left untouched by the terror. "My girlfriend is out of work and one of my friends died" in the attack, said a woman in a wheelchair, who gave her name as Carol, at a weekly lunch offered by the Momentum AIDS Project at St. Paul the Apostle Church near Columbus Circle . Over stew at St. John's Bread and Life soup kitchen in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Daphne Whidbee, 38, said that her 7-year-old son became withdrawn and fearful after Sept. 11, and is going to counseling at a nearby hospital once a week. Belinda Brown, 39, said that a woman she knows still cannot accept that her son is dead. Cherise Jones, 13, buttoned her baby sister's jacket and worried about "all those families who don't have anybody to have Christmas with."
At St. John's, responses to a routine appeal for funds are down by 50 percent this year over last. But in September and October, the kitchen served at least 100 meals more each day than it served during those months in 2000, and to more families with children. There is no meat. Instead of juice, there is water. "I can feel the cutting back already," said Jonathan Rivera, 34, who said he is unemployed and in a methadone program. "But the water, it's good quality."
When Sept. 11 is brought up, the state of charitable giving is not the first thing people talk about. And the subject of money does not prompt uniform indignation. Several people, sifting through garbage bags full of donated clothes at Part of the Solution, a pantry and kitchen in the Bronx, said they saw nothing wrong with families of World Trade Center victims receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars while people like themselves struggled to get by. "Those are different categories," said Anibal Gomez, 45, while a social worker processed his paperwork. "I think they should take care of those families. Before me."
Edward Kelly, 49, clutched a mystery novel and wore a baseball cap over his matted hair. "Their families deserve it," he said, after agreeing to come back later to have his food stamp allotment re-evaluated. "This, to me, is hopefully just a slump. My life's changed a little more gradually than in a couple of seconds."
But still, he described a widow whom he had seen on television -- she lived in a mansion, he said. He balked at the notion that families of victims could be supported at a level far above the average American income. "When my father died, we went through a lot of changes, too," he said. "It's called life."
Sally Young, 45, though, did not think anything more should change for the families. "I know, if you go to school for a number of years, you go for a reason. They were used to making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It's a lifestyle choice. If that's what they worked for, I think they should get it. If charity gave it for them, they should have it."
It galled Ms. Young to think that a white-collar widow might be brought down low enough to live in her neighborhood in the Bronx, near the soup kitchen. The widow would be unprepared. "I grew up there," Ms. Young said. "I know how to live there."
Later, the program director of Part of the Solution, John Hoffmann, recalled the talk over lunch in the days after Sept. 11. "Our folks live in violence," he said. "It was, 'What do you mean, the world has changed? Our world hasn't changed.' "
Ms. Young sat on a bench on a narrow landing, in line to get food for her three sons, one of whom is autistic. She sat near Joseph Figueroa, 57, who leaned close to join the conversation. "The system is so screwy," he announced, with some agitation. "I heard the kids in Afghanistan are getting Christmas presents. You have to take care of your home first," he said, to a chorus of agreements.
"I was out of work before this whole World Trade Center thing happened," concurred Tamar Watson, 35, who said she had been laid off from her job processing medical records. The families of victims should definitely receive help, she said. But when she heard the sums that some stand to receive, her eyebrows went up in surprise. "I think that's a little much," she said. Then she went in to collect her bag of canned food and cornflakes.
No one could suggest a way of determining how much was too much for the families of victims to receive. But the idea that life, even a luxurious life, should go on much the way it had before held some appeal for those struggling to maintain even the basest standard of living. 
On the other hand, a sizable portion of sympathy was reserved for the World Trade Center's deliverymen, secretaries and pastry makers. The firefighters' and stockbrokers' families would be taken care of, people at the soup kitchens were certain, even though surviving spouses have complained of onerous paperwork and the lack of help to pay bills due immediately. But what about the rest?
"I feel like, even in my church they've been neglected," said Linda Murphy, 45, a Mormon who cares for her daughter and granddaughter. "They have the nerve to say, 'For Christmas, Ms. Murphy, we're going to sing to the firefighters and the policemen.' More people got killed than the firemen and the policemen. Sing to the blue-collar workers."
Considering a hypothetical widow, Mr. Kelly said: "If her husband was a stock trader, they probably had some money tucked away. The poor busboy probably had nothing."
Ms. Murphy said that she herself is a victim of Sept. 11. She has received only two $350 paychecks from her job at a government-funded service center since the trade center collapsed, and has gone from an occasional visit to heavy reliance on Part of the Solution. She has been told not to report for work until after the holidays. 
But on a cold, rainy morning last week, on Webster Avenue and 198th Street in the Bronx, she seemed very far away from the grants and other help available for downtown workers. "Can I apply for public assistance, because my job was supplied by federal money and that money didn't come?" she asked.
Although no one said that the World Trade Center families were not deserving, many marveled at the sudden availability of money to aid them, particularly government money. "Funds came out of nowhere to help those people," said Ms. Whidbee, the mother of eight children, the two oldest in the armed forces. "My friend over there is homeless," she said, pointing across the table. "She can't get a place to live."
Ms. Whidbee was on her way to take her six younger children to a Christmas party at the hospital that provides their medical care. But first, they had stopped for lunch at St. John's Bread and Life. The children sat quietly, tray to tray, around a table in the basement cafeteria. "I tell them Christmas is not for toys. Don't be sad if you don't get nothing as long as you have a roof over your heads," Ms. Whidbee said.
People at the Momentum AIDS lunch program, which had to close two Monday meal programs last week because of city budget cuts and a decline in donations, also wondered about the distribution of government money. They said that AIDS has become almost invisible, particularly in contrast to terrorism. The media virtually ignored World AIDS Day, Dec. 1, said Dawn Bryan, the group's executive director.
A Momentum client from Kew Gardens, Queens, Warren Mitchell, 49, said: "First of all, you're talking about two tragedies. Everyone is not going to get a piece of the pie. There's no yin and yang to the two situations."
Still, in a season when many want for comfort both material and emotional, compassion has not flowed in only one direction. It is true, said the people who run Part of the Solution, that money for the hungry was siphoned off by the Sept. 11 tragedy. The charity depends, for much of its budget, on the Church of the Resurrection in Rye, N.Y., which lost seven parishioners at the trade center.
But, the church still held its October fund-raiser for the little food pantry and kitchen in the Bronx. The dinner, auction and yearbook sale raised $91,000 -- a record, said Sister Mary Alice Hannan, the executive director of the soup kitchen. "There were four people there who lost family members," she said. "Three of them were widows."

Argentina's New President Declares Default on Debt
Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, a moderate governor from a tiny rural province, was ratified by Congress as the caretaker president for Argentina after several days of civil disturbances. He immediately declared a default on the country's $132 billion debt, and promised to use the money saved to create jobs and fortify social programs. The default is the largest in history, but is not considered an imminent threat to other countries. A1

Arafat Pledges Bethlehem Visit
Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, defiantly vowed to attend Christmas Eve services in Bethlehem even though the Israeli government has barred him from traveling there, accusing him of failing to crack down on militant groups. The ban set off a flurry of diplomatic activity, with American and European officials pressing the Israelis to reconsider their decision. Some Israeli ministers criticized the ban, saying it hurt Israel's image. A11

Mr. Arafat, after intense backroom negotiations and quiet compromises with militant Palestinians, has achieved a partial cease-fire in each of the conflicts he confronts: one with Israel, the other with extremists in his own ranks. But the agreements are fragile, and trying to maintain one cease-fire may ultimately compel Mr. Arafat to violate the other. The Israeli government has rejected anything short of the destruction of extremist groups and leaders of the Islamic group Hamas emphasized that they had made only a short-term change in tactics. A11

Aftermath of Japan Navy Battle
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan called for increased territorial vigilance after a pitched naval battle in which the Japanese Coast Guard traded fire with a vessel suspected of being a North Korean spy ship. The ship sank just inside an economic zone claimed by China and the entire crew of 15 is believed to have drowned. Two bodies of Asian men were recovered from the South China Sea. Autopsies were planned for today to determine if the men committed suicide to avoid capture, a common tactic in North Korean intelligence operations. A9

Jail Terms in Falun Gong Case
Six people affiliated with Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University have been sentenced to long prison terms for downloading material from the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement from the Internet and distributing it in China, a human rights group said. The Beijing First Intermediate Court gave prison sentences ranging from 3 to 12 years. A9

Zimbabwe Neighbors' Lament
Poorer countries in the same region as Zimbabwe, with a food shortage unfolding there, are finding their own urgent needs overshadowed by their neighbor. Zambia and Malawi, like Zimbabwe, are desperately short of cornmeal, a staple in the region, where farming has been disrupted by both drought and flooding. A4

Internet Users Get Deluge Of Unwelcome Mail
E-mail users are more likely to find unsolicited solicitations flooding their in-boxes these days than ever before, researchers say. Such e-mail, best known by its pejorative appellation, spam, has been annoying Internet users for years. But in the last three months, spam has spiked. One company that specializes in blocking spam, BrightMail, said unsolicited e-mail accounted for 12.8 percent of the mail its corporate clients have received since September, nearly double the share of the previous quarter. A1

Horses at Center of Fight
A bitter battle has broken out between the mainly well-to-do local people who board their horses at the Will Rogers State Historic Park in Los Angeles and a volunteers' association that argues that the boarders are being accommodated at the expense of the rest of the park. Randy Young, above, leads the association that wants the horses removed. His opponents say that Will Rogers, whose widow deeded the park to the state, loved horses, and that evicting them will diminish his legacy. A12

Free Speech and Harassment
Two advocates for people with AIDS have been charged with more than 30 counts of harassing, stalking and threatening nearly a dozen San Francisco health officials, researchers, newspaper reporters and their families over the phone, in a case that tests the line between political expression and personal threats. If convicted, the advocates, David R. Pasquarelli and Michael A. Petrelis, would face more than 10 years in prison. A12

Scrutiny of Early Admissions
Research into colleges that rely on early decision admissions for a significant proportion of their incoming students documents that students who apply for early decision have a clear advantage over those who do not -- the equivalent of adding 100 points to an applicant's SAT scores overnight. And it suggests that the process is unfair because many students at less prestigious high schools do not understand how the system tilts the odds of acceptance. A12

Drag Racing Arrests
Troopers stopped about 350 cars, many of them juiced-up Hondas, Mustangs and Toyotas, and arrested 172 people in a sting against drag racers west of Miami. Early Saturday, troopers blocked off both ends of a mile-long stretch of highway west of Miami frequented by drag racers, then converged on the drivers. About 100 people got away, said a highway patrol spokesman, Ernesto Duarte. Most of the arrests were for reckless driving. (AP)

Pataki Rethinks Increase In Pay of Lawyers for Poor
Gov. George E. Pataki, who promised nearly a year ago to raise the pay of lawyers who represent the poor, is reconsidering that pledge because of new budget deficits projected for the state. Legislators had hoped to push through a pay raise in the fall, but were thrown off course by the financial impact of the Trade Center attacks. Now they say they do not know how they will resolve the growing problem of defending the indigent in New York, where fewer lawyers are willing to take cases. F1

The Shoplifting Threat
Retailers dealing with unseasonably warm weather and plunging profit margins also face a rising tide of shoplifters. Theft always increases during holiday times because of the crowds, but this year, experts see a convergence of factors, including a weak economy, psychological stress from the World Trade Center attacks and the trend toward longer store hours with smaller staffs, that may swell the ranks of shoplifters.

Hewlett's Print Ambitions
One of Hewlett-Packard's goals in an acquisition of Compaq is to extend the reach of its dominant printing and imaging division, which brings in 43 percent of its revenue. But even with the company's dominance as the world's largest vendor of desktop printers, only 4 percent of the trillions of pages printed in America and abroad each year are printed on desktop printers. So now the company has a bigger target: a piece of the other 96 percent, dominated by the traditional offset press. C1

HEADLINE: Placing a Value on a Priceless Life 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Victims' Fund Likely to Pay Average of $1.6 Million Each" (front page, Dec. 21):
 Everyone seems to be missing the flaw that will diminish the impact of the awards given. 
 Under the guidelines, for example, the widow of a 25-year-old man earning $25,000 a year with two children will be awarded more than $1.1 million. Given the circumstances of her life, it is likely that she will be unable to manage that money in a way that protects her and her children for their lifetimes.
Will the idea that she is now a "millionaire" cause her to believe that she can afford all of life's pleasures, only to find that she has run out of money after a few years? Or will she do the "conservative" thing and buy bonds at the worst time in decades only to watch the principal value of her investment plummet as the economy recovers and rates rise?
Even the wealthiest Americans need guidance to handle their finances. Providing these large sums to victims is a noble and wonderful gesture. But doing it without providing financial education is reckless folly.

HEADLINE: A Stay-at-Home Public Is Only the Latest Worry for Travel Agents 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
A little more than 20 years ago, Valerie Ann Wilson used family money to open a travel agency.
 It was a gamble for Ms. Wilson, now 59, who had two young daughters and had not been working. 
 The bet more than paid off. The agency, Valerie Wilson Travel, has grown into a New York business with nearly 300 employees, including Ms. Wilson's two daughters, Jennifer Wilson-Buttigieg, 34, and Kimberly Wilson Wetty, 31. Last year, the agency had $260 million in sales. And on Sept. 10, this was looking to be one of the agency's best years ever. 
Then, on Sept. 11, two planes smashed into the World Trade Center, another hit the Pentagon and another crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. Matters were made worse by the looming recession and the November crash of Flight 587 in Belle Harbor, Queens.
Now some forecasters are warning that waves of failures, bankruptcies and layoffs are about to sweep through the industry.
"There were definitely signs even before the government said that it was a recession, but we thought we would be fairly insulated," said Ms. Wilson-Buttigieg, the executive vice president who has been managing the agency since her mother had a heart attack earlier this year. "I don't think anyone realized the ramifications of how Sept. 11 would affect corporate and leisure travel and how long it might be before we recover."
Ms. Wilson-Buttigieg said it would be hard to pick a business that has been hit harder by the events of the last few months. The American Society of Travel Agents estimates that its members lost $1.36 billion just in the four weeks after the attack because of the drop in bookings for flights, hotel rooms, rental cars and cruises. 
But even before Sept. 11, agencies had begun to feel the effect of large cuts made by corporations in their travel and entertainment budgets because of the slowing economy.
In addition, the airline industry cut commissions to travel agencies in August to $20 per domestic flight, from $50.
After the attack, Wilson decided against trying to recoup that lost revenue immediately at the cost of the consumer.
There may be more people flying again, but business at most Manhattan agencies, which may well be the hardest hit in the country, is down anywhere from 40 to 65 percent, according to the agencies. Hundreds of employees have been laid off at Manhattan agencies alone, agency officials said, and many smaller operations, with high fixed costs and little room for revenue growth, seem on the verge of going out of business.
"Other parts of the country are rebounding a lot faster than big cities, and I think other big cities are coming back quicker than New York," said Andy Pesky, the president of ProTravel-Zenith Group. The high-end company is based on Madison Avenue and has offices in Milan, London, Beverly Hills, Calif., and elsewhere in the United States and Europe. "The phones are ringing," Mr. Pesky said, "but people are more likely to be calling to cancel a trip than make a reservation."
Sweeping changes in the airline business changed the lives of travel agents well before Sept. 11. 
The most fundamental shift came in the mid-1990's, when the airline industry decided it was going to gradually reduce the commissions it paid travel agents for bringing in customers. Before the most recent reductions -- to flat fees of $50 per ticket, then $20 per ticket -- commissions on domestic flights had dropped to 8 percent from 10 percent in 1995.
Another major change in the industry has been a wave of mergers of small companies. The Internet also undercut agents by offering discounted tickets that could be bought in bulk. 
Then came Sept. 11. Travel agents across the nation were hit hard, but those working in the New York area -- where business dropped more sharply than in many other places and where it is more expensive to do business -- had it particularly tough.
At Fischer Travel, which handles flights for celebrities and the rich, agents say a boom in private charter flights has not brought in enough money to make up for the sharp drop in bookings for standard commercial flights. At Tzell Travel, one of the largest privately owned agencies in New York, many agents found themselves advising reluctant travelers on airline safety and airport security instead of the fastest way to get somewhere on a business or personal trip, according to the firm's president, Barry Liben.
In September and October, usually two of the busiest months in the travel industry, business dropped 50 percent at Wilson compared with the same two months last year. By November, business was down 40 percent from the same period last year, where it remains today. Wilson has laid off 16 percent of its work force since Sept. 11. 
"We are family owned, there are no outside investors and we brought a lot of these employees in, watched their parents die, watched them have babies, watched them buy houses," Ms. Wilson-Buttigieg said.
Many agencies, like Wilson, are writing off the first quarter of 2002 and looking for recovery to come much later in the year. 
Ms. Wilson-Buttigieg said that currently, many people in the New York area do not want to go much farther than the Berkshires or the Catskills. "They want to stay close to home or next to family, somewhere they can drive or take a train back if things go wrong."
To stop the bleeding, top executives at Rosenbluth International, one of the largest travel agencies in the country, presented a plan to Congress that would provide the industry with low-interest or no-interest loans totaling as much as $4 billion. A bill has been introduced in the Senate, and is currently among the many measures that legislators are considering to help the ailing economy.
For the most part, the airlines are throwing their support behind the Senate measure. Their executives do not want travel agencies to crumble because agencies have been able to sell tickets faster and cheaper than airlines, which are hampered by union rules and salaries.
Ms. Wilson-Buttigieg is optimistic about the future of her business. Her mother, who is at home recuperating, will return to work after Jan. 1, and the cuts the agency has made appear to have guaranteed that it will increase its revenue this year.
But Ms. Wilson-Buttigieg says many other agencies will be badly hurt. 
"The real question in the long run is whether the role of the travel agent is the role of a consultant or an order taker," she said. "It's the consultant that will survive. And that's what we do."

HEADLINE: Hewlett Aims To Replace The Print Shop 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Hewlett-Packard has pitched its proposed acquisition of Compaq Computer as a bold move to build a portfolio of computing systems and services to take on I.B.M. and Dell Computer. It has argued that the $24 billion deal would strengthen the company's sales of personal computers, data-serving computers and technology consulting. 
 But behind the deal is another Hewlett-Packard ambition: to extend the reach of its dominant printing and imaging division, which rang up $20 billion in sales this year, 43 percent of the company's revenue. 
 In the last two decades, Hewlett-Packard built itself into the world's largest vendor of desktop printers. It had done so under the command of Richard A. Hackborn, now a Hewlett-Packard board member and a leading advocate of the merger. Today, at its 220-acre campus here in Boise, the company tests so many printers, inks and papers that, if one could stack up all the test sheets printed during an average month, the pile would reach 6,000 feet. 
Yet, even with the company's market dominance, only 4 percent of the trillions of pages printed across the world each year are printed on desktop printers. 
So now the company has a much bigger target: a piece of the other 96 percent, dominated today by the traditional offset press. The division's executives envision a world in which corporations print hundreds of thousands of customized catalogs and other reports on next-generation, high-speed digital presses from Hewlett.
The printer division is widely regarded as the company's crown jewel, but how Hewlett can best exploit it is a matter of dispute. Walter Hewlett, the oldest son of the company's co-founder, and other critics of the Compaq acquisition argue that the deal will dilute the printing business by burying it in an even larger, slower-moving computer company. The division's $2 billion in operating profits this year propped up Hewlett-Packard's sagging computer business, which lost $450 million.
Some analysts have advocated that instead of merging to become a larger company, Hewlett-Packard should pare down or sell off its other businesses and focus on selling more printers and imaging devices like digital cameras and scanners, which fuel sales of ink cartridges and paper.
The company, however, says it has no intention of narrowing its scope. Instead, proponents of the merger say the acquisition will fix Hewlett's computing business, freeing up more research and development money for the printing division to tackle new markets, like the $400-billion-a-year commercial printing business.
"With or without the merger, this is the direction we really have to go," said Vyomesh Joshi, president of the imaging and printing systems division. "The current profit pools are in hardware and supplies. We need new profit pools in services and solutions."
To succeed, the company must win over not only the commercial print shops that would buy the digital presses, which cost $200,000 to $1.2 million apiece, but also their corporate customers. Promising to reduce printing costs and improve customer response rates, Hewlett-Packard will try to persuade corporations to fully digitize production and printing of their marketing materials -- a process that, not coincidentally, requires new computers and services as well.
A hybrid of the corporate laser printer and the offset press, Hewlett-Packard's digital presses use technology developed by Indigo N.V., a Dutch press maker acquired for $629 million in stock and as much as $253 million in cash. Hewlett announced the purchase in early September, only three days after the Compaq deal was announced. The Indigo machine can quickly write, erase and rewrite an image on the film that transfers ink, all while the press spins.
By tying into broad computer systems, the Indigo press can link enormous databases of customer information with the printing process in ways that offset presses do not allow. While traditional presses are still best for large, uniform jobs, the Indigo press allows companies to print small-batch jobs without the start-up costs of offset presses, or large jobs in which each catalog is slightly different, tailored for a particular customer.
Hewlett-Packard wants to drive this transition to digital publishing, much as I.B.M., through a combination of products and services, helped businesses push into online sales in the late-1990's. If the strategy is successful, it would result in a surge in digital files that would stimulate sales of the powerful computing systems needed to create, store and move the files, as well the consulting and customer-service divisions that set up and maintain the printing systems.
To do that, Hewlett-Packard argues, it must become larger and stronger. The bigger it is, the more influence it will have on corporate technology managers.
"We can sit on the sidelines and let something like this happen, or we can be in the middle of it and move things forward," said Lee Caldwell, a former I.B.M. manager who is chief technology officer for Hewlett-Packard's printing and imaging division.
After two decades of working on laser and ink-jet printing, research and development engineers say they are excited to have a third printing technology to tinker with. Standing before an Indigo press recently at HP Labs in Palo Alto, Calif., several scientists pulled open panels on the machine, showing how they intended to incorporate existing Hewlett technology into it -- features like automated cleaning, a less expensive laser system, better ink canisters and an integrated computer.
But Hewlett-Packard faces major challenges in cracking the commercial publishing market. Companies like Xerox and the leading offset press maker, Heidelberger Druckmachinen, have created their own digital presses, and offset printing retains its technical advantages for large jobs.
Peter J. Grant, an analyst with the research firm Gartner Dataquest, called digital color printing very attractive to corporations, and he praised Indigo's technology as a powerful addition to Hewlett-Packard. But he questioned the ability of a newcomer -- even one as potent as Hewlett -- to lead the way.
"They may sell a few more printers, but nothing substantial," he said of the merger, predicting that it would create distractions across the printing and imaging division. "The downside is it takes resources away from the cash cow and funnels it toward less profitable or money-losing divisions of the company."
Hewlett-Packard executives acknowledge the risk but say they trust the team in charge of integrating the two companies if the deal goes through. Mr. Joshi, the printer division president, said the merger would help his division grow. First, he said, it will improve the company's chances of winning business customers with end-to-end computing systems, including printers. Second, Hewlett-Packard will displace its competitor, Lexmark International, as the preferred vendor for printers through Compaq. Finally, he said he wanted other businesses to become stronger so the company would depend less heavily on printers and ink for profits.
But he acknowledged that if the computing and services businesses were not strengthened by the merger, the printer division could be left struggling to support a heavier burden. In a recent letter to shareholders, Hewlett-Packard predicted that if the merger with Compaq went through, the printer division would account for 27 percent of the new company's revenue --a smaller piece of the overall company than the 43 percent of Hewlett's sales contributed by printers in 2001.
If the computing businesses fail to recover as the deal's proponents predict, the printer division would have to offset heavier losses. But the company says that is a risk that must be taken, and the letter faulted Mr. Hewlett for assuming "that Imaging and Printing results can continue to support other businesses while meeting its own competitive challenges and reinvesting for growth."
While eyeing new markets like commercial publishing, Hewlett-Packard is also working to preserve its lead in laser- and ink-jet printing. Since its laser-jet printer hit the market in 1984, the company has sold nearly 225 million printers. Sales of print cartridges, among its most profitable products, have reached 250 million a year.
Though it supported other divisions, the printer business could not avoid the economic downturn last year, as sales declined 5 percent and profits fell 25 percent from 2000.
In Boise, engineers are devising new ways to fuel printing growth: software that lets personal digital assistants send documents to printers anywhere in the world, networked printers that allow technology managers to monitor toner levels over the Web, programs that spread the large-batch printing of paychecks and other single-page jobs across several small, inexpensive printers. 
"We need to make sure we continue to shine our crown jewel," Mr. Joshi said.
But Andrew J. Neff, an analyst with Bear, Stearns, said that Hewlett had spun off its testing and measurement unit as a separate company, Agilent Technologies, because it did not receive the attention it deserved within the company. Expressing concern that the printer division might suffer the same lack of attention in a larger Hewlett-Packard, he said the company should pare down its computing businesses and work to extract more profits from printing.
"I don't know how acquiring Compaq helps the printer business," he said. "It seems to be a non sequitur."

HEADLINE: Demand Grows For Net Service At High Speed 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
It has been a tumultuous year for providers of high-speed Internet service. Three companies that offer it over phone lines filed for bankruptcy. So did the leading provider of high-speed Internet service over cable TV systems, Excite@Home. And the largest cable company, AT&T Broadband, spent much of the year trying to decide its future before finally falling into the arms of Comcast last week.
 While each of these events had some effect on customers, nothing has deterred an increasing number of Americans from signing up for high-speed -- or broadband -- Internet access. 
 "Despite the recession and the demise of many of the providers, broadband is one of the technologies that consumers continue to spend money on," said Jed Kolko, an analyst with Forrester Research. "Given the choice, they will upgrade to broadband before they buy a new PC."
Some 10.7 million of the nation's households now have broadband access, representing about 16 percent of all households online, according to the Yankee Group research firm. A year ago, 5.6 million homes had broadband access, or about 10 percent of online households.
And some research firms put the penetration of broadband even higher -- 20 percent, according to recent surveys by both Forrester and Nielsen//NetRatings.
 Cable companies continue to hold an edge over phone companies in the broadband market. The Yankee Group calculates that 68 percent of broadband users connect by cable, while only 31 percent use the phone-line variant, called digital subscriber line, or D.S.L. The rest use various satellite or wireless technologies that are far more expensive and of interest mainly to customers in rural areas that have not been wired for cable or D.S.L. service.
Cable service has had a head start in most areas, is available to more customers and generally has been less frustrating to install. Then again, none of the D.S.L. companies that are bankrupt -- Northpoint Communications, Covad and Rhythms -- inconvenienced as many people as the 850,000 AT&T customers who were cut off at least temporarily recently after a dispute between AT&T and Excite@Home.
AOL Time Warner, whose America Online service is the leading provider of dial-up Internet access over conventional phone lines, has been a laggard in offering high-speed service -- even though AOL Time Warner is also among the nation's largest operators of cable systems. America Online -- which provides content, e-mail and instant messaging -- offers a version of its service via D.S.L. in many areas, but analysts say this has had very little success in the market. This fall it started introducing a high-speed version over the systems of Time Warner Cable. 
David Burstein, an industry consultant and editor of the DSL Prime newsletter, estimates that America Online, which has about 30 million subscribers, has lost two million customers to cable and D.S.L. broadband providers. Once some customers start using a different provider for broadband Internet access, Mr. Burstein said, they may no longer see the need to continue paying for America Online's content and messaging services.
But Robert W. Pittman, co-chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, said AOL was satisfied with the adoption rate for its high-speed services. "AOL never aimed at the techie early adopter users," he said. "It took three or four years for more than half of our customers to start using 56K modems," he said, referring to modems with speeds of 56,000 bits a second, which replaced earlier models with slower speeds. (Broadband systems can transmit data at speeds of 500,000 bits a second or faster.)
Mr. Pittman said that just because a consumer signed up for a rival D.S.L. or cable broadband service did not necessarily mean that AOL would lose the customer. Some four million AOL members use AOL's software (which links to its e-mail system and content) even while using other companies' high-speed networks for basic Internet access. With a majority of those customers paying AOL's $23.90 monthly fee (and the rest paying a cheaper $9.95 plan), they are a very profitable clientele because such customers place little demand on AOL's network capacity.
Mr. Pittman declined to say how sales were going of AOL's fast service on Time Warner's cable markets, other than to say that adding AOL, as well as its rival, Earthlink, did not seem to slow down sales for Time Warner's existing high-speed brand, Road Runner. Mr. Pittman said demonstrating that multiple high-speed services did not necessarily cannibalize existing offerings would be critical to convincing AT&T Comcast and other cable companies to allow AOL onto their systems -- a key goal of AOL Time Warner, now that it has lost out in the bidding for AT&T's cable business. 
So far, however, Earthlink appears to be more aggressive and seemingly more successful in its broadband offerings than AOL has been. As of the end of the third quarter, Earthlink had about 200,000 D.S.L. customers, 90,000 cable customers through Charter Communications, and 116,000 customers through various broadband offerings from Sprint. 
Garry Betty, Earthlink's chief executive, said it was too soon to say how many customers it had attracted from its arrangement with Time Warner Cable. But the company has decided to promote cable over D.S.L. wherever it can, mainly because its agreement with Time Warner is more financially beneficial to Earthlink than its deals with most of the phone companies.
"Customers don't care if it's cable or D.S.L.," Mr. Betty said, "and I can make more money on cable."
But not everyone thinks that broadband of either sort is profitable. United Online, the parent company of the NetZero and Juno Internet services, has dropped its D.S.L. service and is moving only slowly to take advantage of an agreement to offer broadband Internet service on Time Warner Cable systems. United, instead, is emphasizing its $9.95-a-month dial-up, or so-called narrowband, service at 56,000 bits a second.
"Broadband is very expensive to operate, and no matter how big it gets, narrowband will still be the dominant medium for the next five to seven years," said Mark R. Goldston, United's chief executive. "As the big guys decide that narrowband is not sexy, I want to capture their users."
Cable companies and phone companies have been rewiring their networks to make high-speed service available to more of their customers. The Yankee Group estimates that 66 percent of homes with cable can now order high-speed service if they want to, while only 45 percent of the homes with phone service can order D.S.L.
But the growth in availability may be slowing, especially for D.S.L. The big phone companies are backing off plans to wire suburban and rural areas for D.S.L. because the service is generally more expensive to deliver to homes that are further away from phone company offices. 
The Yankee Group now predicts that over the next few years, only 50 to 55 percent of homes will be able to get D.S.L. service -- far less than the 70 percent that Yankee had been predicting earlier, said Imram Khan, an analyst at the firm. 
"The phone companies now want to increase penetration on the markets they are already in," Mr. Kahn said. "Companies had been rewarded on how fast they were getting their networks up. Now investors want them to make profits."
The press for profits and the demise of competing D.S.L. companies have encouraged cable and phone companies alike to raise prices over the last year. The most common price for D.S.L. service is now $50 a month, up from $40 a month last year. Cable service is now typically $45 instead of $40.
Price, by all accounts, turns out to be far more important to customers than the technology. In a Yankee Group survey, more than 50 percent of users said they had no preference between cable and D.S.L. But the survey found that interest dropped sharply as the potential price of either form of the service increased. 
Internet service providers and market researchers are still finding that signing up for and installing D.S.L. is more frustrating than is ordering broadband cable service.
"The phone companies discovered you couldn't train 10,000 installers or build a network to serve millions as quickly as they thought," Mr. Burstein said.
In general, though, once broadband service is up and running, customer satisfaction seems to be about the same for both sorts of service.
"A good cable company is better than a bad D.S.L. company, and a good D.S.L. service better than a bad cable service," Mr. Burstein said. "It's not the technology, but the company." 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 27, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about the growing demand for high-speed Internet lines included one company erroneously among bankrupt providers of D.S.L. service. Covad emerged from bankruptcy protection on Dec. 20.

CBS Scores Some Points, Even During a Tough Year

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
Yes, the television advertising market hit one of its deepest slumps in a decade. True, profits in September were ravaged when the networks were compelled by the coverage of the aftermath of the terrorist attacks to wipe out four full days of commercials. And sure, no new series introduced this fall has developed into a bona fide hit.
 None of that prevents Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, from looking over the industry at the end of 2001 and drawing a rather bright conclusion. "I'm guardedly optimistic; things are beginning to turn," Mr. Moonves said in a recent interview at his office on the 35th floor of Black Rock, the CBS headquarters building on 52nd Street in Manhattan. 
 Mr. Moonves, who has been in his job since 1995, has now presided over a network entertainment division longer than any other current executive. And he has expanded his power base at CBS by adding control over its other TV divisions, most recently over UPN, the other network owned by CBS's parent company, Viacom.
So he has motives for providing the rosiest possible analysis -- particularly at a time when one network, ABC, is in a deep tailspin and the near future for the networks is almost entirely dependent on how the national economy performs.
But he defends his general optimism by noting that three of the four networks will be profitable this year. He notes that the so-called scatter market, in which advertisers buy commercials that were not committed before the start of the television season, seems to be picking up. And he points out that prime-time's long-running hit shows, like "Friends" on NBC and his own "Everybody Loves Raymond," seem to be as popular or more popular than ever.
Even the old network nightmare of eroding audiences does not seem so terrifying to him. "Any erosion we're experiencing now is not going to the top 10 cable channels," he said. "It's going to channels 55 to 100, to the Chinese Cooking Channel. I think the major bleeding has stopped."
That is an important trend because when large numbers of viewers were flowing to the biggest cable competitors, it undermined the network argument that advertisers have to buy the big networks to get the best bang for their buck.
The most obvious reason that Mr. Moonves is selling the virtues of network TV, though, is simply that CBS, by almost any measure, is the network with the most positive story to tell.
Its overall lead in the category of total viewers is sometimes dismissed by competitors who say CBS is still stuck with too many older -- less salable -- viewers. But the statistics show that CBS is making more progress in almost every important audience category than any other network is.
In total viewers, for example, CBS is now averaging 12.8 million a week, up from 12.3 million last year. NBC is at 12.5 million, down from 12.7 million. Fox is at 10.2 million, barely up from 10.1 million (and this year its figures include a seven-game World Series). ABC, meanwhile, has seen its weekly audience shrink drastically --to 10.5 million compared with 13.3 million last year.
CBS is also the only network to have improved in the two most important advertiser sales categories of viewers: those aged 18 to 49, and those 25 to 54. Perhaps most significant for a network that has lived with jokes that its audience understood the term "hip" only when it was paired with "replacement," CBS has lowered its median age this season from 52 years to 50.6, a seismic shift in television terms.
"I think the rebuilding at CBS is going right according to plan," Mr. Moonves said.
Even Mel Karmazin, the formidable president of Viacom, famed for his high-pressure number crunching, is pleased, Mr. Moonves said. Mr. Karmazin even got along with Sumner M. Redstone, the Viacom chairman, Mr. Moonves said, trying to dismiss persistent rumors of friction between the two. "I was in a whole round of budget meetings with both of them," he said. "They were fine together."
One of the keys to CBS's recent turnaround has been its commitment to reality shows, an area that has taken something of a beating this TV season. Many television executives have called the genre all but dead, rejected by viewers who balked at its contrived realities in light of the tragic reality of Sept. 11.
But Mr. Moonves does not accept that argument. "The networks that are saying that are the ones that don't have 'Survivor,' " he said. Indeed, much of CBS's success this fall can be traced to the inclusion on its schedule of "Survivor," the biggest hit the reality tide has produced. But even that series has been cited as proving the reality trend is waning because ratings for its current edition have not been at the level achieved by the first two editions.
Then there is the collapse of ABC's "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," a series victimized by a network so hungry for the show's heady ratings that it pushed it to four editions a week and paid the price for the overexposure in plummeting ratings.
Mr. Moonves resists the comparisons of "Millionaire" to his reality hit. " 'Survivor' is the No. 4 or 5 show of the season," he said, noting that it is up against a resurgent "Friends," which is now television's top-rated show. "It's still the Rolls-Royce of reality shows." 
Mr. Moonves has high hopes for another reality series planned for February about fighter pilots in training. 
He said CBS Sports had been rejuvenated by the reacquisition of the National Football League five years ago. He noted that David Letterman has staged a significant comeback in late night. Even CBS News has made some positive strides he said, pointing to the newsmagazine "60 Minutes II."
CBS is still one of the two news organizations without a cable outlet, a situation that could be rectified by a partnership with CNN -- one that both CBS and ABC have been discussing with the cable network. "I don't really think we necessarily have to make that deal," he said, though he concluded that it might hurt CBS if ABC News joined with CNN instead.
"Over all, I feel pretty good," Mr. Moonves said. "If the economy starts to turn, I think we could explode."

Boss Tweed And Giuliani? Follow Closely

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
AN odd thing happened as I toured the spectacularly renovated Tweed Courthouse the other day.
 I entered the Taj Mahal of Chambers Street thinking about William M. Tweed, the boss of Tammany Hall. By the time I left, my thoughts had wandered to Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 With his second term coming to an end, Mr. Giuliani is on the collective mind. Journalists in particular are trying to assess the willful, stubborn, sometimes deliberately nasty man who found the reserves to sensitively lead New Yorkers through a mean season. 
What does the law-and-order Mr. Giuliani have to do with Tweed, the burly boss who used construction of the courthouse (among other things) to make himself and his notorious Tweed Ring rich with bribes, kickbacks and other malevolently lucrative schemes? If Rudy Giuliani had been around in Tweed's day, he would have prosecuted Tweed (who was ultimately convicted of forgery and larceny and died in prison in 1878); he would not have been compared to him. 
But there are parallels that are revealing not only of those two men, but of what it takes to run their impossible city.
The boss and the mayor each found a way to get what he wanted -- Tweed for self-gain, Mr. Giuliani for political gain and the civic good. But neither let anything, be it convention or the law, get in his way.
Tweed wanted money and power and got them -- the power from his political leadership, the money through corrupt deals like building a $15 million courthouse that was originally supposed to cost $250,000. The higher the cost, the greater the kickbacks. 
The three-year renovation of the courthouse has restored a palace of elaborate brickwork, grandiose courtrooms and brass chandeliers. There is even an etched-glass skylight. The wooden doors are more than a half-foot thick. The chandeliers hang from ceilings 24 feet high. And cast iron is everywhere: iron doors, iron staircases, columns painted to look like marble, even baseboards. Ubiquitous iron -- because the Tweed Ring, inflating its kickbacks, paid for iron by the pound.
Tweed, as a state senator, had to bow to the public to keep his power base, so he pushed successfully in Albany for more orphanages, almshouses and public baths and fought for greater independence for New York City. For the wrong reasons, he proved to be a fervent advocate for his city.
For different reasons, the same could be said for Mr. Giuliani. He would brook no interference. For instance (and we make no value judgments), he wanted to get rid of the squeegee guys and he did. He wanted to put welfare recipients to work and he did. He wanted to ignore the Rev. Al Sharpton? He did. He wanted to wanted to withhold money from the Brooklyn Museum because a painting offended him? He did. (Until a judge stopped him, citing the First Amendment.) He wanted a schools chancellor to quit? He pushed him out. He wanted businesses to invest in New York? He wooed them.
And of course, Mr. Giuliani wanted crime to come down and it did. It did most everywhere in the country in the 1990's, because of factors ranging from the booming economy to the end of the crack epidemic. But New York led the way, and Mr. Giuliani will always get the credit for changing the tone of the city. His fierce resolve makes it hard to think otherwise.
THE main point is that he realized that fractious, unruly New York can be led successfully only by someone who refuses to play by the rules, who writes his own. Fiorello H. La Guardia figured that out before him. So did Robert Moses, the master builder, Edward I. Koch in his first mayoral term -- and Boss Tweed, until he was arrested. They were large, loud, irritating figures who matched their large, loud, irritating city.
They were basically nonpartisan, too, except for Tweed. And surely his Democratic loyalties were more convenient than ideological. You get the feeling he could just as well have been a Whig, if Whigs had been in power in his day.
Mr. Giuliani is a Democrat turned Republican who in 1994 backed the Democratic candidate for governor, Mario M. Cuomo. La Guardia was a fusion candidate, Mr. Koch, a nominal Democrat, accepted support from several parties and was proudly fond of Ronald Reagan. Now the city is about to be led by Michael R. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat who became a Republican just to run for office. All realized there is no Democratic or Republican way to run a city, that effectiveness and personality count, not ideology.
Why all this was inspired by a walk through history on Friday I cannot tell you. Maybe because Tweed emerged as a three-dimensional character and a familiar one. The excesses of the Boss Tweeds are gone, but not the fundamentally bold, rash character that made him, unmistakably, a New Yorker.

An Unidentified Passenger, Governing in Kabul, Need in America

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. MCFADDEN 

 BODY:
An American Airlines jetliner with 197 people on board flying from Paris to Miami was safely diverted to Boston after a passenger tried to set off an explosive in his shoes. He was overpowered by crew and fellow passengers and was taken into custody. But questions swirled: Who was he? Had he acted alone? Was he part of a terrorist network? And how did he board a trans-Atlantic flight with explosives and no baggage?
 IDENTITY UNKNOWN -- The man's identity was part of the mystery. He told Boston officials he was Abdel Rahim, 28, a Muslim; French officials listed him as Tariq Raja, a Sri Lankan; and he was listed in federal court papers as Richard C. Reid, the name on a British passport issued in Belgium three weeks ago. Federal officials said he may be of Jamaican ancestry. Whoever he is, he faces a charge of assault or intimidation of a flight crew, punishable by 20 years in prison. 
 Federal officials said that he had no known connection to Al Qaeda or any other terrorist group. Still, his conduct had the outward appearance of a terrorist's suicide mission. Two functional explosive devices were found in his sneakers, a fuse snaked out, and he tried to light it. It was unclear what the explosive was, though it resembled putty-like C-4, used to blow a hole in the destroyer Cole in Yemen last year. If it was C-4, it could have blown up the jet, though it is hard to detonate.
AGITATED SUSPECT -- Other evidence suggested that the man was an unstable loner. In Miami, passengers from the diverted flight remembered him as tall, ponytailed, nervous and scruffy. When confronted by a flight attendant, he popped a lit match into his mouth. And witnesses said he been agitated and his behavior had been bizarre at the airport near Paris on Friday when he tried to board a flight to Miami without bags and was turned away. He was let aboard another flight on Saturday without bags. Some on the flight called airport security lax.
Federal officials have been warning about more terrorist attacks, and the incident raised anxieties among holiday travelers and other Americans, who have been dreading another calamity.
CABINET MEETS -- In Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, the leader of the new interim government, convened his first cabinet meeting in Kabul. Security was high on the agenda, and there was also talk about how to feed millions of refugees and rebuild a land devastated by war.
Mr. Karzai said American forces were welcome to stay until terrorists were ousted from his country, and he pledged again to turn over Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, if they are caught. It was still not clear if a convoy attacked by American planes last week carried Al Qaeda or Taliban leaders, as American officials said, or tribal elders heading to Kabul, as some survivors contended.
POSTMORTEMS -- With the Afghan war all but over, American officials are attributing the swift victory in large part to smart bombs -- high-tech, laser-guided devices whose accuracy and power enabled a ragtag opposition to defeat once-feared Taliban and Al Qaeda forces with nonstop killing and terror. There are geopolitical implications, too: Only America wields this kind of air power. 
In Tora Bora, where American bombs were raining last week, scavengers now roam the rugged terrain: soldiers searching for bullets, boys collecting firewood, men on donkeys loaded with bomb fragments that yield a bounty as scrap metal. There are dangers: some of the bombs are unexploded and the ammunition live. But for the miserably poor, the landscape of shredded earth and dead trees is a strange realm of plenty.
OTHERS IN NEED -- In New York, thousands of people who were homeless, hungry or afflicted by addictions and other disabilities before Sept. 11 are still needy, but express little resentment at being eclipsed by the families of firefighters and executives lost in the attack, who may be entitled to well over $1 million each from charitable funds. Soup kitchens that operate on far less than that a year have begun to shut down for lack of money.
With a recession under way, the American travel industry was also hurting before Sept. 11. One report says $1.36 billion was lost in the first month on forgone flights, hotel rooms, rental cars and cruises. Now, experts say waves of bankruptcies and layoffs are coming. But tourists still flock to Ground Zero to stare at death and pose before the skeletal remains for souvenir snapshots.

HEADLINE: The Year in Fashion, Before and After; 
Seeing Past the Cloud From Downtown

BYLINE:  By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
FASHION'S built-in unreality was violently cast into high relief on the morning of Sept. 11. Security guards rushed to padlock the Seventh on Sixth tents moments after the Liz Lange maternity show as a grotesque plume of smoke filled the sky above the lower Avenue of the Americas. If life as one knew it had not come to an end, it certainly seemed as if fashion had. 
 After quickly attempting to salvage what remained of New York's spring 2002 season by staging some of the 80 canceled shows at other sites, designers entered into the relief effort with an uncommon show of solidarity, joining Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at an Oct. 23 news conference to announce a Shop for America campaign. The aim, the mayor said, was to encourage people to exercise such "fundamental liberties" as shopping, "which is what terrorists want to deprive us of." 
 In truth, the economic downturn beat the terrorists to the punch. The combined effect of rising unemployment in many industries and lapsed consumer confidence left winds whistling through the empty corridors of department stores. Saks installed a potpourri boutique on the designer fashion floor. Bergdorf Goodman hired a Santa. Luxury purveyors on Fifth and Madison Avenues slashed prices, and still most shoppers sat the season out. 
Yet if the mood in fashion changed, its underlying logic remained immutable. In the months since September, as the fashion scene has crept back to life, it seems more than ever worth remembering that how we attire ourselves does not, as the historian Anne Hollander said, "reflect something that's already true," as much as "something we wish was true." 
For the gala Dec. 14 party to open a new Prada store in SoHo, New Yorkers pulled out all the sartorial stops, exhibiting themselves in slip dresses, crocodile pumps, ermine tippets, Brioni suits, big diamonds and all the other delirious markers of high style. Rumors of the demise of fashion, like that of irony, may have been greatly exaggerated. Very few things, it would seem, are more life-affirming than a hunger for frivolity.

HEADLINE: With Genome, A Radical Shift For Biology 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
With the Human Genome Project -- the effort to work out the sequence of the three billion chemical letters that embody human heredity -- nearly complete, biologists are facing a daunting transition.
 They must move from their traditional pursuit of understanding one gene at a time to the challenge of figuring out how tens of thousands of genes work in concert in the human cell. 
 Should they succeed, in 20 years it may be possible to compute the behavior of a cell, perhaps of a living organism, and to calculate how changing one unit of DNA may affect human health or performance. 
At a conference this month at the Airlie Center in Warrenton, Va., biologists tried to explore how the study of genomes might develop over the next 20 years and what tools might be needed. Central to their vision of the future is a thorough computerization of biology, made necessary by the vast computing power of the genome itself. 
The task seems likely to change the nature of biological research, requiring teams of engineers, mathematicians, nanotechnologists and computer programmers, and farms of computers if not a national computer grid.
Biologists used to work with one gene and its protein product.
But now that the entire genome is available for many commonly studied laboratory organisms, researchers can work with the complete parts list of an organism's cells -- all its genes (the genome), all the copies, or transcripts, the cell makes of the genes (the transcriptome), all the proteins synthesized from the transcripts (the proteome) and all the small chemicals manufactured by the proteins for the cell's metabolism (the metabolome).
The parts lists are huge -- people and mice have at least 30,000 genes in their genomes, with even more proteins -- and an even larger number of possible combinations between them.
Proteins interact with one another and with the DNA of the genes in complex regulatory pathways. If the operation of these pathways could be calculated, biologists would take a giant step toward computing the behavior of the cell.
Each type of cell in an animal uses its own subset of the genome's repertoire, so elaborate atlases are required to show in which types of cells a particular gene is switched on or expressed.
Another category of data, relevant to human disease, is that of how each gene and its common variants affect the body. These gene-to-body interactions are evident in patients whose symptoms are traceable to a single disrupted gene.
All these pieces of information need to be assembled in databases that are cross-referenced with one another, and with the scientific literature, as much as possible. "That biologists must be able to use computational skills is absolutely critical," said Dr. Barbara Wold of the California Institute of Technology.
Participants at the conference, which was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute, were encouraged to compile ambitious wish lists and speculate freely on the progress of genomics in 20 years.
Dr. Francis Collins, the research institute director, said he was looking for ideas as to what projects his agency should support now that the Human Genome Project was nearing completion. The consortium of academic centers, in which the institute is a major player, announced a draft sequence of the human genome in June 2000 and plans to finish in April 2003, the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick.
Dr. Richard Lifton of Yale predicted that in 20 years researchers would be "able to identify the genes and pathways predisposing to every human disease." A panel of biologists led by Dr. Michael Snyder, also of Yale, said that in two decades they would like to know the effects on the organism of the smallest possible change in the genetic programming, the switch of a single unit of DNA.
Other problems the panel said it would like to see solved included those of how a cell is built, how an organism develops from an egg, how organisms interact with one another, and the biological basis of intelligence and cognition.
Such advances would be speeded by cheaper ways of decoding the human genome. The cost of preparing the draft human genome has been about $300 million. What if in 20 years new technology and economies of scale could bring the cost down to $1,000 per genome, making it feasible to sequence an individual's genome for medical or research purposes? The $1,000 human genome "simultaneously solves and creates all problems associated with human genetic testing," said Dr. David Page of the Whitehead Institute, who led a panel on cheaper genomics.
With such easy access to genomic data, it would be possible to link diseases with particular genetic patterns, and use the information to forecast a person's health from his or her genome sequence, Dr. Page said.
But data would also bring out the genetic differences between different groups and races. "We take great comfort in our 99.1 percent identity to one another," Dr. Page said, referring to the very substantial genetic similarity between all people, but "with this massive amount of data available the issue of distinguishing among groups will come into much clearer and quantitative focus."
Another issue that may be clarified with better genomic knowledge is the strange path of human evolution. Humans are "a novel offshoot of a fairly conservative lineage," said Dr. Maynard Olson of the University of Washington, referring to the ape and monkey family of which humans are part. People may stick out from this family, he said, because having undergone a spurt of evolution of the sort that often happens when a species occupies a new and uncontested habitat -- in the human case the boundary between savanna and rain forest in humans' African homeland.
Being poorly adapted to this new habitat, Dr. Olson said, humans may have had to make many genetic compromises. "The point medically is that it may well be we need to understand what these compromises were, and to focus on the downside of being early members of a novel evolutionary lineage responding to a constantly changing environment," he said.
The National Human Genome Research Institute has long enlisted ethicists to think about the social and moral impact of genomic advance. One of the leaders of the ethicists' panel, Dr. Leon R. Kass of the University of Chicago, told the biologists, "There are other goals and goods beyond gaining knowledge and promoting health, important as they are."
Dr. Kass, who is chairman of President Bush's new Council on Bioethics, said some larger questions about the human genome project might have been inadequately addressed up to now, including "the meaning of genomic knowledge for human self understanding and the understanding of families, genealogy and race." 
The pursuit of knowledge is a great good, "but there are other goods, and there is often a price for pursuing goods in a monomaniacal way," Dr. Kass said.

HEADLINE: Archaeologists Find Celts In Unlikely Spot: Turkey 

BYLINE:  By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
In storybook histories, the ancient city of Gordion is remembered only as the seat of King Midas, he of the golden touch, and the place where Alexander the Great struck a famous blow in legend and metaphor. Challenged to separate the strands of an impossible knot, the Gordion knot, the conqueror cut through the problem, in the manner of conquerors, with one authoritative swing of his sword.
 After Midas and Alexander, Gordion languished on the fringes of history, and until recently archaeologists had taken little notice of its Celtic past. Yes, European Celts -- the Gauls of Roman times and the forerunners of Bretons, Welsh, Irish and highland Scots -- once migrated as far east as what is now central Turkey and settled in and around post-Alexander Gordion, beginning in the early third century B.C. 
 Archaeologists say they have now excavated artifacts and architectural remains dispelling any lingering doubt that the Celts were indeed there, as a few classical texts had recorded in passing. These people called themselves Galatai, a Celtic name for tribal warriors, and became known to the Romans as Galatians. Their Christianized descendants were advised by the apostle Paul, in the New Testament, that "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." 
The remains of Galatian Gordion, archaeologists conclude, reveal that the Celts, although they came as mercenary soldiers, bringing along their wives and children, were looking beyond warfare and pillage. They put down deep roots, revived Gordion and created an ambitious, thriving society.
Above ruins of ordinary mud-brick houses, they erected a monumental public building of cut-stone blocks that was surrounded by a massive stone wall. Inside a workshop were clay loom weights used in weaving, a possible clue to Celtic influence. Not far away, excavators found a stone sculpture of a human with faces in two directions, which replicates double-faced or "Janus" figures from Celtic sites in central Europe.
But the most decisive discovery was a grisly one: clusters of broken-necked skeletons and decapitated heads of children and adults, some of them mixed with animal bones. Ancient Celts had a reputation for ritual human sacrifice, but not the contemporary Greeks and Romans or any of the indigenous people of Anatolia, the central plateau region of Turkey.
In the current issue of Archaeology, a magazine of the Archaeological Institute of America, Dr. Mary M. Voigt of the College of William and Mary, a leader of the excavations, and her colleagues wrote, "Such practices are well known from Celtic sites in Europe and are now documented for Anatolian Celts as well."
Dr. Ronald Hicks, an archaeologist and specialist in Celtic prehistory at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., agreed that this appeared to be the strongest evidence yet for a permanent Celtic presence in Gordion.
"That certainly has the Celtic look," said Dr. Hicks, who is not involved in the project. "One of the Roman complaints about the Celts was that they still practiced human sacrifice. They said the Gauls were known for lopping off heads of men in battle, tying them to their belts and bringing them back to display for all their friends at home."
Dr. Oscar White Muscarella, an archaeologist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, called the discoveries "an extraordinary accomplishment." For the first time, he said, "we are able to see and hold in our hands what the Galatians did and can now talk about Galatians in Anatolia."
The excavations of Galatian Gordion are part of research at the site, 60 miles southwest of Ankara, being led by the University of Pennsylvania Museum in conjunction with the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. Dr. Voigt's co-authors of the magazine report are Jeremiah R. Dandoy, a retired businessman who has become a zooarchaeologist, and Page Selinsky, a doctoral candidate in anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Gordion's Galatian period had been neglected, Dr. Voigt explained in an interview, because archaeologists had their eyes on bigger prizes. They dug through the layers of Galatian ruins to get to the city as it was in Alexander's time, 332 B.C., and the even earlier city of Midas, ruler of Phrygia, probably in the eighth century B.C.
Dr. Voigt said archaeologists were also put off by the seeming impossibility of finding anything distinctive to confirm the Galatian presence in the city. How do you establish the ethnicity of an ancient population, especially if the people were warriors who traveled light, carrying with them little of their own material culture, and lived off the land?
"Historically, we knew they were at Gordion," Dr. Voigt said, "but we didn't know anything definitive about their way of life."
In one of the few sketchy accounts, the Roman historian Livy noted that a king in Anatolia hired Celts as mercenaries to re-enforce his own army. They arrived in 278 B.C., 20,000 of them, including provisioners and merchants as well as their families, in a caravan of 2,000 baggage wagons. But by this time the Celts had become somewhat Hellenized.
For an unknown number of years since leaving their homeland, somewhere in central Europe near the headwaters of the Danube, the Celts had passed through the Balkans and paused in Greece to sack Delphi. In battle, they stood naked before the foe. Along the way, they learned Greek and inscribed some of their possessions in that language. Their ceramics and other household wares were in the Greek style.
"It used to be hard to detect the Galatians at Gordion," said Dr. Keith DeVries, a University of Pennsylvania archaeologist and former director of the Gordion excavations. "There was not a single artifact that was absolutely demonstrable as Celtic. Some began to think the literary sources must be misleading us."
Livy described Galatian Gordion as a trading center and a fortified settlement in the early second century B.C., a judgment now supported by archaeologists. Artifacts like a small bone lion, probably used as inlay, suggested the Galatians enjoyed some affluence. Traces of a few substantial buildings -- with tile roofs, many rooms, paved floors, stone benches and generous courtyards -- seemed to attest to a city with a social and political hierarchy. This was more than a simple crossroads farming settlement, as some scholars once suspected.
A Roman army destroyed much of the city in 189 B.C., but excavations showed that it was soon rebuilt and eventually became part of the Roman province of Galatia, though with a continuing Celtic imprint.
In more than a decade of meticulous excavations, archaeologists were struck by the juxtaposition of Greek and Celtic customs in Gordion. Ruins of a workshop yielded figurines of Greek deities presumably used in household rituals. Nearby, in the lower town, five skeletons were strewn across the ground of what had been an outdoor area, and another four had been thrown into a deep pit.
Even though the date of the buried skeletons is in some doubt, Dr. Voigt's team said, "their treatment is undoubtedly linked to ritual practices that began in third-century Gordion and would represent continuity of Celtic traditions" after the town became part of a Roman province.
Nearly all these people appeared to have met violent ends, with strangulation by hanging or garroting the most usual cause. Several had broken necks and spines. A woman, probably 30 to 45 years old, had a fractured skull, and was also strangled. Below her lay the bones of a younger woman, who seems to have been done in by the two heavy grinding stones weighing down her upper body. In the same pit, the bones of two young children were mixed in an apparently deliberate way. Among other switches, the jaw of an older child was placed with the cranium of the younger one.
Archaeologists concluded that all of these people were presumably "sacrificed." They might have been war captives. Traces of wood in the base of a skull suggested that a person's severed head had been mounted on a pole for display. Some victims might have been killed as part of Celtic divination rituals. Texts recount that Celtic religious leaders, the druids, were prophets who killed humans in order to discern the future as revealed by the dying victims' movements.
In another part of the lower town, archaeologists came upon the largest bone deposit, holding more than 2,000 animal bones and those of a few dismembered humans. Three individuals -- a man of about 40, a woman of 35 and a child under 8 -- might have been a family. This might have been the scene of a feast associated with the Celtic celebration of Samhain, around Nov. 1. Based on their age at death, the animals were probably slaughtered in the fall, the time for culling herds before winter. Some humans could also have been cooked for the feast.
"It may not be too far a stretch to associate Bone Cluster 3 with this Celtic festival, which we still celebrate as Halloween," Dr. Voigt and her colleagues wrote.
The discoveries at Gordion have already contributed to changes in views of Galatian culture in Asia Minor. The Celts as politically and socially primitive barbarians who lived on raids and plundering had considerable basis in fact, which had been stressed in Greek and Roman texts. But at least in Anatolia, the new excavations suggest, the Celts succeeded in settling down, marshaling resources and labor for building and operating a prospering city -- not the behavior of primitives.
In an article last year in the British journal Anatolian Studies, English and Turkish scholars said the Galatian communities established in the third century B.C. constituted "a new, significant and increasingly important geopolitical entity within Asia Minor" and this "can hardly be attributed to a marginal, and politically, socially and economically unsophisticated people." On the contrary, they wrote: "The fact that their polities survived to be incorporated into the Roman empire would indicate the existence of highly developed social structures bound together by shared value systems. The European Galatians successfully adapted to their new environment, changing it and being changed by it."
The authors of the article are Dr. Gareth Darbyshire of the Oriental Institute in Oxford, England; Dr. Stephen Mitchell of the University of Wales in Swansea, and Dr. Levent Vardar of the Turkish Department of Monuments and Museums in Ankara.
But they and other researchers, including Dr. Voigt and her colleagues at Gordion, concede that the Galatians and their culture remain poorly understood. And no one can be sure what happened to those European settlers in the city of Midas and Alexander.
Through intermarriage with indigenous people, the originally tall and blond Galatians probably blended in with others around them. "I don't know how Celtic they would have looked, even in the time of Paul," said Dr. Hicks, the Celtic specialist.
But the Galatians were still speaking a form of the Celtic language for several centuries after Paul. In the fourth century, St. Jerome observed that the Galatians used a dialect similar to one spoken in the Gallic town of Trier, back in the Europe they had left in the third century B.C.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Dec. 25 about archaeological discoveries showing evidence of Celts in the ancient city of Gordion, in what is now central Turkey, misspelled the name of a knot that, according to legend, was undone there by Alexander the Great. Although the names are both derived from that of King Gordius, the knot is known as Gordian, not Gordion.

HEADLINE: Lego Tinkered With Success, And Is Now Paying a Price 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: BILLUND, Denmark 

 BODY:
For Christmas, Colin Stovel, 11, had his heart set on one of Lego's new electronic or science fiction sets, like Star Wars or Mindstorms. His father, Herb, 53, still pines for the old Lego pirate ship, which the company eliminated a few years ago.
 The differing tastes of Colin and his father, a Unesco employee in Rome -- one looking for the latest fashion, the other seeking nostalgia for the tried-and-true -- are one strand of the toy industry upheaval that has helped to cloud the fortunes of Lego, the Danish multinational that built its fame on the popular interlocking play bricks. Recently, however, it lost its way as it sought to incorporate electronics and licensed toys into its product mix. 
 Last year, Lego System reported losses of about $105 million, its largest ever, and only the second in the company's history, after a $24.5 million loss in 1998. The poor results led to a change in management. Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen -- the family patriarch whose grandfather, a village woodworker, began making toys in 1933 to rescue his business from the Depression -- turned over day-to-day management to an outsider, Poul Plougmann, who had built his reputation as a turnaround artist reorganizing Bang & Olufsen, the maker of stylish electronics components. 
The changes facing Lego challenge the very culture of a company whose employees stress its mission to promote the skills and imagination of children.
"We are taking a great company carefully forward," Mr. Plougmann said in an interview. Then, referring to Mr. Kristiansen, he added, "Both he and I love to play around with things."
In part, Lego is suffering from the malaise affecting many of the world's biggest toy makers as they adjust to age compression -- the demand for more sophisticated toys from ever younger children -- and the licensing costs connected with high-risk toys, often linked to books and movies like Harry Potter and Star Wars.
Moreover, with the recent terrorist attacks casting a pall over economies around the world, the current year turned into a particularly challenging one for the industry. While some forecasters expect sales of toys to end up considerably higher this holiday season as parents seek to comfort their children, others forecast little growth because of the overall weakness in consumer confidence.
That makes it even harder for toy makers to match their inventories to children's desires. Lego, for example, found it impossible to meet demand for some of its Harry Potter line, while certain other styles languished on shelves.
But many of Lego's problems also reflect its own mistakes.
In the 1990's Lego enjoyed its greatest success, with a spectacular drive to spread geographically, growing strongly in the United States and developing new markets that opened after the collapse of communism. New products expanded Lego's traditional selection beyond plastic bricks. Borne aloft by those fresh ideas and huge investments, revenue rose to roughly $1.24 billion in 1999, up from $864 million in 1995, before falling slightly last year.
"There are only a handful of great brands," said Hayley W. Kissel, director of global securities research at Merrill Lynch, "and Lego is certainly one of them."
But the kind of products Lego made transformed the company, too, injecting an element of unease among some Lego veterans. Long a manufacturer of a dizzying array of colorful bricks that required the touch of a child to become a real plaything, Lego started producing more and more ready-to-use figures, like the Star Wars kits it brought out in 1999 under license from Lucasfilm.
A latecomer to the electronic revolution in toys, Lego played catch-up with sophisticated new kits, like its Lego and Steven Spielberg MovieMaker Set, employing advanced camera technology supplied by Pinnacle Systems, of Mountain View, Calif., that enables children, or their parents, to produce their own action movies. To exploit the Lego brand's magnetism, products other than toys, like children's apparel and wristwatches, were made under license and sold.
But the changes did not stop there. In the 1960's, Lego opened a theme park on vacant land near its factories, mainly to ease the flow of visitors through its factories curious to see how Lego bricks are made. In the early 1990's, Mr. Kristiansen convinced his father, who ran Lego until his death in 1995, to roll out an international collection of similar parks.
The plan was for a new park every three years. With displays and rides that feature Lego's traditional bricks, the parks are supposed to showcase Lego's products and be a monument to its values of creativity and child education.
Despite its explosive growth, the family of Mr. Kristiansen has never taken the company public, at least in part to assure continuity of its traditional values. And those values extend not only to imaginative play: Lego will not make a toy to look like a 20th-century weapon and seeks to avoid promoting violent play.
But if Lego's values have remained firmly under Mr. Kristiansen's control, management and cost control gradually eluded him as Lego grew in global scope. "The years before had been so successful that they thought they could go forward unchanged," said Jesper Beenfeldt, who follows Lego for the Danish financial daily, Bersen.
With Lego adrift, Mr. Kristiansen, now 54, decided to hire Mr. Plougmann. As the father of two grown children who had played with Lego in their youth, and the grandfather of a two year old, Mr. Plougmann, 53, appreciates Lego's qualities.
"They were not fooling around just to grow rich and make money," he said, "but offering children the best possibilities to improve their skills."
Still, Mr. Plougmann knew the company needed to turn its losses into profits again, so he has moved quickly to shut unprofitable factories and cut the number of employees. Last year, Lego laid off 1,500 mainly white collar workers, eliminating a further 500 at the start of this year. Licensing agreements, particularly for the sale of watches, were scaled back.
And even as he shuffled the management team to expand the company's global reach, Mr. Plougmann returned control of the theme park division to Denmark from California. In the 1990's, Lego spent roughly $600 million to roll out new parks, one outside London, another near San Diego and a third in southern Germany, where the latest park will open in the spring of 2002.
The parks now generate about $150 million of annual revenue, but last year they produced $36 million in losses.
To overcome the problems, said Mads H. Ryder, the 38-year-old Danish executive put in charge of the theme parks, "we need to be better at playing on the synergies between the toys and the parks."
But the bigger challenge may be simply to boost attendance in the non-Danish parks. Roughly 5 million people live within a two-hour drive of the Billund park, where attendance last year was about 1.6 million. By contrast, the British and American parks had three times as many people within the same range, yet only achieved about the same attendance levels.
Someone who closely follows the change at Lego is Jason Rowoldt, 26, a computer consultant in Washington and a lifelong Lego enthusiast. Mr. Rowoldt, who grew up playing with Lego bricks, created a Web site for enthusiasts of its new MovieMaker product at Brickfilms.com.
He sees the kit as reflecting Lego's original goal of promoting imagination.
Mr. Rowoldt, while seeing the moviemaking kit as reflecting Lego's original goal of promoting imagination, expressed dismay at Lego's trend toward action figures. 
"Everyone from the '70's and '80's, we hate this," Mr. Rowoldt said. "But I guess they have to focus on what makes the dollar."
Mr. Plougmann, however, sees no deviation from Lego's original mission. "We want to provide the ability to create a story," he said, "rather than just a box and a price tag."

HEADLINE: Health Care Is New Darling Of Pork Barrel Spending 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Pork barrel spending used to mean roads and bridges and dams. Now it also means hospitals, medical schools and local health care projects singled out by Congress to receive tens of millions of federal dollars.
 In one of its last actions before adjourning for the year, Congress last week specified more than 600 health care providers that will receive federal largess in the coming year. The number of such directed expenditures, known as earmarks for their obvious links to the members promoting them, far exceeds the items in previous years. Congress designated hardly any health care projects in 1996, and since then the number has been well below 100. 
 President Bush and his budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., had asked Congress to eliminate most of the earmarks, saying they circumvented the usual process of awarding federal grants after thorough evaluations of the merits of proposals. But Congress ignored the White House request, producing a huge increase in the number of projects that will be financed by its command.
Republicans were just as eager as Democrats to obtain their share. Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who obtained $3 million for health care providers in his district, said, "This is a much-needed Christmas gift to our hospitals, which are in dire financial straits."
Congress specified significant sums for some recipients, $800,000 for the University of Iowa to train nurse anesthetists, $1.2 million for a nursing program at Creighton University in Omaha, $1.7 million for a rural health care program at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, $500,000 for an emergency medical services academy at Western Kentucky University and $1.9 million for health care information technology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
Members of Congress said that in obtaining federal money for their districts and states they were doing what they had been elected to do. Moreover, they said, they talk to constituents all the time and are at least as qualified to make spending decisions as anyone in the executive branch.
The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, is taking home $6.9 million for West Virginia University, $2.9 million for the "mountaineer doctor" program, $2 million for a new center on obesity and $2 million to establish a "virtual medical campus" with computers.
But Congress also took a keen interest in small grants. In a $123.8 billion appropriations bill, it earmarked $80,000 for the Wausau Health Foundation in Wisconsin to study the careers of local health professionals; $50,000 for a clinic in Somerville, N.J., that serves pregnant teenagers; and $46,000 for a family psychotherapy program in Hot Springs, Ark.
Many of the programs receiving federal aid are in states or districts represented by Congressional leaders or members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, which wrote the legislation.
Wausau is in the district of Representative David R. Obey, senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. Somerville is in the district of another committee member, Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, represents three hospitals explicitly named as recipients of federal grants. 
Ralph Regula, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, obtained $2 million for Pomerene Hospital in Millersburg, Ohio; $1 million for a new biomedical research center at Ohio State University; and $1.5 million for a program to reduce medical errors at five hospitals in northeastern Ohio.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, complained that Congress had gone wild in spending money on "parochial projects." Although some may be worthy, he said, "it is distressing that these funds are specifically earmarked and not subject to the competitive grant process."
But a more common reaction is for members of Congress to boast about the money they secured for constituents. Representative David L. Hobson, Republican of Ohio, said he had obtained $1 million for an outpatient cancer center; $750,000 for a Y.M.C.A. fitness center; $250,000 for a hospital; $250,000 for a hospice; and $500,000 for a physical therapy center.
Lobbyists, lawmakers and health care officials suggest several reasons for the increase in earmarks, including these:
*Hospitals note that they are major employers and engines of economic growth in many cities and rural areas.
*Neither party has much of a numerical advantage in the Senate or the House. So an individual member of Congress has leverage in trying to extract specific projects, even if the lawmaker has little seniority.
*Medicare, a major source of hospital revenue, uses rigid reimbursement formulas that do not always take account of a hospital's special circumstances. So many hospitals have turned to Congress to meet their needs.
*Several lobbying companies like Cassidy & Associates now specialize in persuading Congress to earmark money for specific hospitals and universities. Health care providers have found that Congress is more responsive to political pressure than the civil servants who disburse federal grants in the executive branch.
Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, said, "We simply cannot afford pork barrel politics right now," at a time when the nation is at war and the federal government is again running budget deficits.
But Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, said he was "proud of the pork" going to his state. He secured nearly $16 million for 10 health care projects this year, and he said, "I can proudly justify any of the projects." 
In the past, Congress subtly urged the secretary of health and human services to direct more money to particular groups like Asian-Americans. But this year, Congress became much more explicit, saying, "The conferees include the following amounts for the following projects and activities," and it then listed hundreds of projects.

HEADLINE: A Fiscal Crisis, Paid in Credibility 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Argentina's declaration of a moratorium on repayment of its foreign debt marks the end of a failed economic experiment that has cost this country dearly. But it is also a blow to the United States and the International Monetary Fund, which had invested much of their credibility and prestige here, yet proved unwilling to help when things began falling apart.
 "I think this is going to end up being a very costly experience for the United States," Walter Molano, chief of research for BCP Securities, a brokerage firm based in Connecticut that focuses on Latin America, said today. "It was very clearly the Department of the Treasury that pushed Argentina over the edge and allowed it to collapse, so I think the issue of accountability has to come up." 
 A decade ago, Argentina decided to tie its peso to the dollar at a value of one to one, a decision that at first dramatically reduced inflation and imposed fiscal discipline, but eventually led to the current crisis. The first Bush administration had strongly urged that step on Argentina, and the United States tried to sell the same system to other doubtful Latin American countries.
There is plenty of blame to go around. But from the start, the second Bush administration found it convenient to overlook the United States's earlier role as advocate and cheerleader of that policy and to distance itself as much as possible from Argentina's growing problems. The bluntest statement of official indifference came from Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill this summer and helped accelerate the loss of capital and confidence here.
"They've been off and on in trouble for 70 years or more," Mr. O'Neill said dismissively in an interview with the British magazine The Economist. "They don't have any export industry to speak of at all. And they like it that way. Nobody forced them to be what they are."
What was missing from Mr. O'Neill's analysis, however, was any mention of the high tariffs the United States imposes on Argentine exports or of the aversion to easing those barriers to help Argentina regain its footing. Nor was the Bush administration particularly helpful in "creating some kind of framework for how the international system could respond, rather than saying, 'It's all up to you,' " said Peter Hakim, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based conference of hemisphere leaders.
As a result, "the Argentines were operating in a vacuum, without a clear sense of what the United States was thinking and what it was prepared to do to be helpful," Mr. Hakim said. "The real blame is passivity: the U.S. did not want to engage, and so it stayed on the sidelines."
Taking its cue from the Bush administration, the International Monetary Fund kept "raising the bar" on Argentina, in Mr. Molano's words -- requiring increasingly harsh austerity measures -- in return for the disbursement of money already promised. That was followed by the fund's public declaration on Dec. 18 of its lack of confidence in the Argentine authorities, which helped hasten the government's fall.
"It's clear that the mix of fiscal policy, debt and the exchange rate regime is not sustainable," said Kenneth Rogoff, the fund's chief economist. He also maintained that "everyone recognizes that to a large extent the problem lies in Argentina," a statement that did not ring true to other governments in the region.
"The fund is partly to blame for this because the fund did not sound the alarm in time and then took a very hard line when things were incredibly difficult," said Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the finance minister of Peru, which has itself been in in talks with the organization recently.
But the abandonment of Argentina represents more than just an economic policy failure. It also has a strategic effect, because it confirms to the rest of Latin America what many leaders have always maintained: that the United States is a fickle and undependable ally.
Over the past decade, Argentina has aligned itself more closely with the United States on foreign policy questions than any other country in the region. It was the only Latin American country to participate actively in the Persian Gulf war, and in recognition of that and numerous other demonstrations of support, the Clinton administration formally designated Argentina a "non-NATO ally."
Even with its economy disintegrating, Argentina has not wavered from a commitment to send up to 600 troops as part of the peacekeeping force in Afghanistan and to open a field hospital in Pakistan. That effort, which will cost Argentina up to $20 million, has been criticized here as an expenditure that would be better directed at creating jobs for the millions of unemployed.
Six months ago, Turkey's situation was very similar to Argentina's. But while Argentina has been left to fend for itself, Turkey has been showered with financial and political support, which most people here regard as proof the United States regards Turkey as vital to American geopolitical goals in a way that Argentina, despite its demonstrated support of the United States, is not.Now, other Latin American countries are likely to draw the conclusion that there is no payoff for being America's friend, at a time when the United States hopes to draw its neighbors into a Free Trade Area of the Americas.
"On the whole, I think this bodes very badly for building a long-term economic community in the hemisphere," Mr. Hakim said. "If this is what community means, it doesn't really mean much."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Whole Spectrum of Santas Emerge for Neediest Cases

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN and VINCENT M. MALLOZZI 

 BODY:
Santa Claus is a 5-year-old girl from Manhattan.
 He is a marine biologist from Queens. 
 He is the chief executive of a major toy company in New Jersey.
To the children and adults around the city who had their wishes fulfilled after they were featured in articles this fall about The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Santa Claus came in many forms. But every one of those Santas had something in common. Each -- including 5-year-old Olivia Sabat of Manhattan, who sent a gift and a letter to a child whose family lost its home in a fire -- was responding to New Yorkers in need during a difficult time. 
Dear Darriel: My name is Olivia Sabat. I'm five years old, too. I'm sad that your house burnt. My Mommy read about you in the newspaper. I want to share my Barbies with you because you said you wanted a doll.
Merry Christmas
Love, Olivia
A faltering economy and an outpouring of giving to charities related to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 have contributed to what may become the largest year-to-year decline in donations to the Neediest Cases Fund since The Times began publishing articles about the Hundred Neediest Cases in 1912. The fund has received 24 percent less this year than it had at the same point in last year's appeal. That is a far larger decline than was ever recorded between any two campaigns, even the ones at the start of the Depression, when contributions declined 14 percent from 1930 to 1931.
Before Sept. 11, Jack Rosenthal, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund, said he hoped to raise $10 million in this year's appeal, 25 percent more than last year. On Saturday, he said he now thought the fund would receive $6 million, and noted another declining trend. "The really meaningful figure that troubles me is the decline in the number of donors," he said, noting that there were about half as many donors this year as there were by this point last year.
Despite discouraging statistics, the spirit that moved Olivia Sabat, and others nationwide, remains as high as ever.
It is the kind of spirit that gave Darriel Hall of Brooklyn 10 new dolls, including 5 from Olivia, and a CD player to replace some of the things she lost on Thanksgiving 2000 at age 5, when a fire destroyed her family's home. Her mother, Doreen Hall, told The Times in November that Darriel had asked if her dolls had been hurt in the fire and said that all her daughter wanted for Christmas this year was a doll.
It is the kind of spirit that moved a high school science teacher to call a small community center in the South Bronx to offer computers for homework and art class.
"It's all about helping the people who can't help themselves," said James Cervino, a marine biologist from College Point, Queens, who teaches science at St. Francis Prep High School in Fresh Meadows.
Along with a colleague, Christine Van Vliet, Mr. Cervino was touched by an article in The Times in November about the impoverished children who go to Abraham House on Willis Avenue in the Bronx, and could think of no better way to part with the 10 Macintosh computers the school will soon replace with newer models. Abraham House will be receiving the computers this week, he said.
"These are beautiful, powerful computers," Mr. Cervino said. "We just wanted to make sure we got them into the right hands, and I'm sure we did."
John Eyler, the chief executive of Toys "R" Us in Paramus, N.J., who read an article about a poor young boy from Brooklyn, was also caught up in the spirit. He decided to satisfy the boy's desire for a popular video-game system, the PlayStation 2.
Mr. Eyler, who declined interview requests, had read about Edwardo Reyes, an 11-year-old whose parents had recently divorced. Edwardo had two wishes for this Christmas Day: "I want Mommy and Daddy to be together again," he had said. "Oh, and don't forget, I also want PlayStation 2."
Thanks to the generosity of Times readers, even some elderly New Yorkers in need were feeling like kids this Christmas.
A man from Florida shared the warmth of his state by sending a coat to 77-year-old Ed Felder, who holds court on a street bench near Baruch College in Manhattan. And a dermatologist from Madison, Ill., paid for a voice-activated laptop computer for Rose Ann (who would not allow her last name to be used) , 73, from Astoria, Queens, who has severe arthritis.
Earlier this month an investment manager from Greenwich, Conn., who asked that his name not be printed, read an article about a 74-year-old woman, Madeline Castellano, who is confined to her apartment. Ms. Castellano, who lives in Coney Island, had said she felt isolated from the outside world and would have liked to write to her friends, if only she had a typewriter.
So on Christmas Eve, the man stopped by her apartment with a shiny black Royal typewriter.
"It's beautiful; I never expected anything like this," Ms. Castellano said yesterday as she looked at the typewriter, envelopes and stationery that had been given to her. "This shows you that there are still loving, caring people out there."
Many readers have been putting their own thoughts on paper -- the kind with dollar signs attached.
A check for $2,000 was made out to Bill and Jeff Collins of Rego Park, Queens. The 48-year-old twin brothers, who were out of work and on the verge of being evicted, received the money from Bruce Deal, an administrative associate with the College Board in Manhattan, which sponsors college admission tests.
Offers of help came in many other forms. An acupuncturist in Southport, Conn., Jody Eisemann, offered to help Dorian Hardin, 38, a Harlem man struggling to raise seven children on a limited income. Ms. Eisemann wasn't sure whether Mr. Hardin even needed acupuncture treatment, but she offered it anyway.
"I didn't know there were so many people out there so interested in me and my family," Mr. Hardin said.
Neither did Glenn Zoll, a man who lost his job, his daughter and his apartment in the space of a week. He received $2,000 from a man who so wished to remain anonymous that he scratched his name off the check he gave. At first, the bank refused to cash the check. But when Mr. Zoll produced a copy of the article about him and a letter that the donor had sent along, a bank manager relented, gave a smiling Mr. Zoll the money, and wished him a Merry Christmas.
In addition, Mr. Zoll received a telephone call from an executive at Orion Telecommunications in Bayside, Queens, who had read that Mr. Zoll once worked in the industry and asked him to send in his resume.
Perhaps Mr. Zoll was speaking for needy people and donors alike when he said, "I'm just doing what I have to do."

HEADLINE: Plan to Let Nations Declare Bankruptcy Gains 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Argentina's chaotic political and financial collapse has given a strong push to a plan by the International Monetary Fund to allow nations to declare bankruptcy and seek legal protection from their creditors, much as people and companies can do, fund officials and private experts said.
 The governing board of the fund has given a preliminary nod to the plan, which was floated late last month by Anne Krueger, the No. 2 official. The fund is expected to prepare a formal proposal in time for a financial summit meeting in the spring, officials said today. 
 The plan would fill what Ms. Krueger call a "gaping hole" in the international financial system. It would establish a formal bankruptcy process for nations that face severe financial difficulties, allowing them to stop paying debts while they negotiate with bankers and bondholders. 
"At the moment too many countries with insurmountable debt problems leave them too long, imposing unnecessarily heavy economic costs on themselves and on the international community that has to pick up the pieces," Ms. Krueger said.
The proposal has won early support from the Bush administration, as well as financial leaders of Britain and Canada. But it would probably require the approval of Congress and legislatures of all the fund's 183 member nations because they would have to grant legal amnesty to nations that meet the fund's conditions for bankruptcy.
The plan faces stiff opposition on Wall Street, where bankers and brokerage houses warn that investors will move their money out of developing countries rather than risk having funds impounded in an international bankruptcy proceeding. 
"This is a nuclear-bomb solution that could really backfire," said Charles H. Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, who represents many banks with loans in emerging markets.
Some developing nations have also expressed unease that they might be forced into bankruptcy instead of being granted aid to help them ride out financial storms.
Though the plan was broached before Argentina announced on Sunday that it would stop making payments on its $132 billion debt, the troubles there highlighted the urgency of finding a more orderly process for resolving financial disputes.
Some experts believe that Argentina is a case study in how not to handle a debt crisis. It sought to slash government spending, freeze bank accounts and dip into state pension funds to raise money for debt payments during a deep recession -- before riots brought down the government of President Fernando de la Rua last week. Under the fund's proposal, Buenos Aires could have declared a time out, halting debt payments or other outflows while it sought to rebuild financial credibility.
The I.M.F. has historically gone to great lengths to help nations stay solvent, often by providing large loans that they can use to stay current on debts or to shore up currencies. Such loans -- including recent multibillion-dollar packages for Mexico, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea Russia, Brazil, Turkey and Argentina -- have drawn criticism because they are seen as expensive ways of rescuing countries that make bad policy decisions, as well as protecting investors who buy risky stocks and bonds.
Major American, Japanese and European banks once accounted for most of the money invested in developing countries, and they often informally agreed to terms to settle disputes when countries ran into trouble. Today, there is more variety among bond investors, and many have been reluctant to accept anything less than full repayment.
The I.M.F. proposal is modeled on Britain's bankruptcy laws. A nation could apply to the fund for the right to declare bankruptcy. If granted, that nation would negotiate a settlement with its creditors, and a majority of them could decide terms for the whole. The fund would also allow nations to impose temporary foreign-exchange controls to prevent a rapid outflow of private funds.
Bush administration officials have signaled their support for a shift away from bailouts and toward a bankruptcy process. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has not publicly commented on the proposal, but during a meeting of the fund's executive board, the United States approved developing the plan. 
The proposal was also welcomed by some international economics experts, including Jeffrey D. Sachs of Harvard, who proposed a similar idea more than a decade ago. 
But critics like Mr. Dallara said the plan was deeply flawed because the fund wants to cast itself as bankruptcy judge even though it is often the largest creditor and seeks to protect its own loan portfolio. The interests of private investors do not rank as high, he said.
"How can the I.M.F. be a neutral judge when it is often the largest creditor?" he asked. "That would be thrown out in any court."

HEADLINE: American Investors in Argentina Mostly Taking Losses in Stride 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
As Argentina struggled to avert complete fiscal collapse with the anticipated issue of a new currency, the fallout in the United States is slowly coming to light.
 American financial markets barely shivered yesterday, even though Argentina's interim president, Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, declared at his inauguration on Sunday that he would suspend the repayment of public debt. The default had been widely expected for weeks, if not months, and investors hardly seemed surprised. 
 Prices of Argentine bonds that come due in 2008 slipped 10 percent yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged yesterday in light trading.
More than 20 of Argentina's bondholders recently formed a committee to negotiate new terms with the government. "The bulk of the members of the committee are large institutional holders who either hold for their own account or manage client accounts," said Michael P. Richman, a partner at Mayer, Brown and Platt who represents the group. 
J.P. Morgan Chase and TIAA-CREF, the pension fund for educators, have been identified as members of the committee. He also said that several smaller creditors had expressed interest in joining the group.
Mr. Richman said that Argentina would have a better chance of averting legal action if its officials worked with the committee.
"Our opinion for or against an overall restructuring may help to sell other creditors," he said. "We could be helpful if we believe them to be sincere and they reach out to us. If they don't, we can't pretend to control bondholders around the world."
Institutional investors with clients in the United States had mostly deserted Argentine debt issues before the default. Wendy Shapiro, a spokesperson for Zurich Scudder Investments, said the company's managers had sold all their Argentine bonds well in advance.
A survey released last week by J. P. Morgan Securities reported that 81 percent of investors considered their portfolios underweighted in Argentine securities.
For American companies doing business in Argentina, some of them already dealing with the economic downturn in the United States, the disruptions surrounding the economic crisis were only the latest chapter in a continuing tale of woe. 
At Wal-Mart, which has 11 stores in Argentina, sales ground to a halt during the recent political unrest. The company closed its stores in the country on Dec. 21 out of concern for the safety of customers and employees, said Jay Allen, a spokesman for the company. "We did have four stores that had demonstrations of some sort outside, but there was no damage done, no injuries and no looting."
The stores have since reopened, Mr. Allen said.
The watchword was also caution at Dow Chemical, which manufactures ethylene and polyethylene in Argentina for sales locally and in Brazil and Europe. Dow closed some offices but did not halt production of chemicals last week.
"We did evacuate some employees from our offices on Thursday, because our No. 1 concern is the safety of our employees," said Holly LaRose-Roenicke, a Dow spokeswoman.
Some American companies had already started to abandon Argentina as financial and economic tensions mounted. In October, Home Depot sold its four Argentine stores to Grupo Paulmann, a Chilean conglomerate that already owned a leading home-improvement retailer in Argentina.

HEADLINE: Desperation Sales Fail to Lure Shoppers 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
The holiday shopping season opened the day after Thanksgiving with nervous merchants cutting prices 40 percent. It ended over the final weekend before Christmas with a frenzy of desperation sales with as much as 70 percent off that failed to save the season for most retailers.
 Rather than generating lots of last-minute traffic, deep sales were the minimum ante retailers had to offer merely to attract the attention of jaded customers in a dismal recession-bound economy. Bargain hunting along Chicago's Miracle Mile on Sunday north of downtown, Mary Beth Patterson summed up the sentiment succinctly: "We are trying to get 30 to 50 percent off on everything we buy. And it's working." 
 Before Thanksgiving, industry analysts had hoped that nonautomobile retail sales might grow at least 2 to 3 percent. But warm weather, the economic downturn and general malaise after the Sept. 11 attacks combined to suck the spending spirits out of the holiday. Zero-percent financing deals from Detroit's automakers also siphoned off many of the extra dollars consumers might have taken to the malls. 
Final sales and traffic for this last weekend will not be reported by most retailers until tomorrow. Yet reports from the field and scattered evidence from various merchants indicate that the crowds, while dense in certain places, were too light to offer any last-minute miracles on 34th Street or anywhere else. Economists, analysts and retail consultants now generally agree that retail sales, outside the auto sector, are not likely to increase much more than 1 percent or so for November and December.
In short, it was a long, bitter season.
"It was the worst Christmas" in a decade, lamented Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers who follows the retailing sector. Mr. Feiner said that profit margins, already thin, could be down by as much as 10 percent across the industry.
"Retailers lowered their expectations," he said, "but when all things are added up, it will still be worse than that."
Products that encompassed the values of home -- everything from high-technology entertainment systems to old-fashioned board games -- fared the best. With a little extra cash in their wallets from skipping vacations, consumers spent big on cheap DVD players, expensive big-screen televisions, and video game consoles for their children and digital cameras for themselves. Sales of home-theater systems nearly doubled in the first weekend after Thanksgiving, compared with the comparable period last year, and then stayed consistently strong, according to a survey by NPDTechworld, a market information company.
But with much of the country experiencing temperatures this month resembling a brisk March rather than a blustery and snowy pre-Christmas, winter apparel sold particularly poorly. "I don't see how the apparel companies could be anything but down 3 to 5 percent," said John D. Morris, an analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison.
With sales at the height of the shopping season so tepid despite near give-away prices, several economists suggested that consumers may be even more reluctant to spend early next year.
"It is taking extraordinary measure of near desperation to keep consumers afloat," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist for Morgan Stanley. "The question now is how much of what we are seeing now is borrowed from gains that would have come next year."
Considering how cheap things are already, it seems hard to imagine that steeper price cuts are still to come, but the nation's merchants still have plenty of goods on their racks and shelves to unload. That suggests that retailers will cut prices even more after Christmas.
"Merchandise is not like a Merlot," said Michael Gould, chairman and chief executive of Bloomingdale's, a division of Federated Department Stores. "It is not going to get better with time."
Mr. Gould said Federated would offer its usual post-Christmas sales, but further price cuts would come on items that had been only partially discounted so far. Men's cashmere sweaters, for example, which started the season at $198 and sold for $129 the day before Christmas will be $89 tomorrow.
And if they do not sell even then? "Oh, at $89 we will have a riot," Mr. Gould predicted.
But even before the last discounts are taken and the inventory cleared out, it is clear that the spending torpor has taken a toll on the industry. Last Friday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Kmart's debt to junk status. The discount retailer has had trouble meeting modest sales targets despite extended hours and ferocious price cuts -- like 70 percent off its gold and diamond jewelry. 
Moody's also downgraded the outlook for the Limited, parent company of Express, and is reviewing Gap's credit. Gap, which also operates the Banana Republic and Old Navy chains, has suffered a devastating season. Just to clear unwanted sweaters, pants, and underwear, Gap's lineup of retailers has put an unprecedented amount of merchandise on sale. Even seasonal items like thigh-length hand-knit sweaters were marked down to $34.99 from $98.
The Gap's downfall has been the most spectacular of the season, but mall-based specialty clothing stores were hit hard across the board as the cathedrals of consumption did not seem to draw the usual immense crowds on the last weekend before Christmas, which has replaced the weekend after Thanksgiving as the busiest shopping burst of the year.
"Traffic was a bit off on Saturday," said Karen MacDonald, a spokeswoman for the Taubman Group, which runs 31 malls in 13 states, "although it rebounded on Sunday."
And despite an extra day of shopping when many people extended weekend breaks right through Christmas Day, malls seemed particularly empty yesterday. While shoppers reveled in the discounts, most said the price cuts were still not enticing enough to persuade them to spend more than last year.
"I am spending the same, but getting more and enjoying it more," said Barbara Kahn-Velez, who was getting in some last-minute bargain hunting Sunday on New York's Fifth Avenue.
"At Macy's it was like take 20 percent off something that was 40 percent off and take 15 percent more if you have your credit card," Ms. Kahn-Velez joked.
There were a few winners in this season of woe. The nation's biggest retailer by far, Wal-Mart Stores, reported yesterday that sales though Dec. 21 were up 4 percent over last year, a solid increase. Target said that its sales through Sunday were up more than expected.
Target did not say which was the biggest shopping day for the chain, but Dave Johnson, general manager of a Target store in Charlotte, N.C., said this year's sales on the last Friday night before Christmas were up 28 percent from the corresponding day last year. He said the store sold hundreds of George Foreman grills this year, along with electronic games like the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube. Harry Potter merchandise and "Lord of the Rings" books also have been hot, Mr. Johnson said.
Another bright spot for some retailers was the Web. Holiday purchases over the Internet -- focused on items like digital cameras -- grew 34 percent over last year, according to Bizrate.com. While that gain was substantial, Internet sales, at roughly $6.3 billion, are just a tiny piece of the overall Christmas retail pie.
Of course, the real winners in this holiday were consumers like Lisa Macias from Milwaukee, who was loaded up with merchandise from F.A.O. Schwarz, H2 0 and Gap this weekend.
"Every place it is sale, sale sale," she said. "That's the way I like to shop."

HEADLINE: Japan Says a Mystery Boat Fired Rockets at Its Ships 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Crewmen on a vessel suspected of being a North Korean spy boat used shoulder-held launchers to fire rockets at two Japan Coast Guard ships in a high seas battle that involved the firing of about 1,000 rounds from machine guns and other automatic weapons, Japan Coast Guard officials said today.
 "The Japan Coast Guard was attacked by rockets for the first time," Shigehiro Sakamoto, a chief of the Coast Guard's Guard and Rescue Department, said at a news conference today. "It was the most dangerous mission ever conducted by the Coast Guard." 
 The gunfire Saturday night left three Japanese sailors slightly injured and three ships damaged, including one, the Amami, that was riddled by 168 bullets. 
On the other side, 3 crew members were confirmed dead and 12 others were missing, and their 100-ton boat was resting on a continental shelf at a depth of 300 feet. With clues to the origin of the boat still limited to crew members' personal effects inscribed with Korean writing, Japan's government is considering sending divers to investigate the wreckage. 
Today, in its fullest account of the incident, the government released images from a Coast Guard plane's infrared camera that appeared to show a rocket streaking from the unidentified boat toward a Japanese vessel. 
The Coast Guard said that another infrared camera, this one mounted on the Inasa, a patrol boat, showed two or three men using shoulder-held launchers to fire simultaneously at the Inasa and the Amami. Coast Guard officials say the rockets missed the ships, but crew members recall seeing red flames passing over their boats. 
Responding to the rockets and automatic weapons fire, the Inasa and the Amami returned fire, expending 589 rounds from their machine guns in the space of a minute. Shortly afterward, a Japanese sailor reportedly watched through a night-vision lens as the boat's crewmen apparently set off an explosive device on board, perhaps sinking their own ship. 
"An explosion took place within the ship and a large amount of water poured into the hull," said Tadashi Kurogi, head of a Coast Guard rescue unit based in Kagoshima, southwestern Japan. "We cannot rule out the possibility that the ship sank by itself. It was such a large explosion." 
The sinking and loss of life are a further blow to ties between Japan and North Korea, two countries that have been estranged and last had direct talks on normalizing relations 14 months ago. 
"It is certainly one step forward in the deterioration of Japan-North Korea relations," Kazuhisa Ogawa, a defense adviser to Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party, said in an interview. "Since the terrorist attack on the U.S. in September, North Korea hasn't taken an aggressive stance because they don't want to take the blame for being a pro-terrorist country." 
North Korea has had a history of sending submarines and spy ships along the coasts of both South Korea and Japan, and this latest incident added new fuel to calls by the nationalist prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, for Japan to assume more of the burden of its own defense.
Just months ago he pushed through a new law that for the first time since World War II allows Japan's naval forces to take part in operations outside territorial waters. Today Japan's cabinet approved a record $38 billion defense budget.
Hours later, Mr. Koizumi called for greater military preparedness, saying that the suspect ship "had made considerable preparations and armed itself for an attack, so the Japanese side must also think of ways to deal with such incidents in normal times, given that such reckless unidentified ships exist." 
In North Korea, there has been no comment in the state-controlled media. Instead, the state media devoted its energies today to celebrating the 10th anniversary of the elevation of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, to supreme commander of the Korean People's Army. The Korea Central News Agency lauded the North Korean leader for his "forced march to victory with his original army-centered revolutionary leadership." 
The ascendancy of this "military first" policy in recent months is believed to be behind the stagnation in North Korea's talks with South Korea, Japan and the United States. 
Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945. Today, Koreans on both halves of the peninsula are sensitive to any perceived revival of Japanese militarism. Some South Koreans have watched skeptically as Prime Minister Koizumi won parliamentary approval to send military supply ships to the Indian Ocean to help the American war effort in Afghanistan.
Last month, a new law went into effect allowing the Japan Coast Guard to fire at unidentified foreign vessels when they try to escape from Japanese territorial waters.
Saturday's battle took place just inside a 200-mile economic zone claimed by China. Other than saying that the boat was not Chinese, China's reaction has been muted.
But South Korea's governing Millennium Democratic Party sounded a note of worry. 
"Japan and North Korea must explain to their neighbors what happened and why it happened, without delay," Lee Nak Yon, a party spokesman said today in a statement. "We pay attention to the incident which can be seen as part of Japan's recent expansion of military power."
The Japanese have been particularly jittery over North Korea's intentions since the Communist government test fired a missile in the direction of Japan in 1998, and in recent weeks, relations have been further battered. 
In late November, Japanese police arrested half a dozen longtime Korean residents on charges that they had defrauded Korean savings banks here, probably shipping millions of dollars to North Korea.
In response, the North Korean Red Cross Society suspended efforts to locate 10 Japanese who, the Japanese government said, were kidnapped from Japanese beaches by crews from North Korean vessels in the 1970's and 1980's.
Some Japanese sensed extortion.
"North Korea may be playing a game of brinkmanship to get more food aid from Japan," Tokyo's Asahi Shimbun newspaper wrote Wednesday in an editorial. "If so, the strategy has backfired. Pyongyang's action has done nothing but tarnish the country's image among Japanese."
But the kidnapping issue ties into Japanese fears about spy boats from North Korea. In the nearly half century since the end of the Korean War, North Korea has landed about 50 spies on Japanese beaches, according to Japanese police estimates. 
The heavily armed ship that sank on Saturday fits the profile of past North Korean spy boats -- a small number of antennas atop the wheelhouse, a few token items of fishing gear, like squid lights, and powerful engines for quick getaways.
In 1999, two suspicious boats disguised as Japanese fishing boats eluded a Maritime Self-Defense Force search party and returned to North Korea.
Japanese Coast Guard officials said today that the boat that sank on Saturday closely resembled aerial photos of a North Korean boat that transferred 640 pounds of amphetamines to a Japanese fishing boat in August 1998. 
Last month, Japan's Supreme Court upheld the drug trafficking convictions of six Japanese in the case and upheld lower court findings that they received the stimulants from a North Korean ship.
According to Japan's National Police Agency, 44 percent of drugs seized in 1999 originated in North Korea. In 1999, about 1,241 pounds of drugs were seized on a coast in Kagoshima Prefecture, about 75 miles from where the boat involved in Saturday's incident was first sited. In the 1999 case, the police said that a suspect admitted that the drugs were obtained at sea off North Korea. 
In February 2000, about 550 pounds of drugs were confiscated in Shimane Prefecture, the closest part of Japan to North Korea. Japanese police said the drugs were loaded at a North Korean port. 
Today, Kyodo news agency quoted a National Police Agency spokesman as saying: "Pharmaceutical plants in North Korea are used for the production of stimulant drugs. It seems that North Korean spy vessels play a role not only in transporting agents but also drugs."

Explosives Incident Adds To Airline Industry Tension
The passenger aboard an American Airlines plane who tried to ignite explosives in his shoes may have come very close to realizing the airline industry's nightmare scenario. Ever since Sept. 11, executives have worried that the downing of another jet by terrorists would reverse the industry's slow but steady recovery.
 The incident underscores simmering questions about the public's lack of confidence in stepped-up security measures since the attacks and whether American Airlines is being singled out because of its name. Page B5. 

HotJobs.com Seeks Higher TMP Bid
HotJobs.com, the Internet career site, told TMP Worldwide, the parent company of Monster.com, that it had 72 hours to top a $436 million unsolicited takeover bid from Yahoo or HotJobs would call off their six-month-old merger agreement. If HotJobs.com drops its deal with TMP, it will have to pay a breakup fee of as much as $17 million. Shares of HotJobs.com rose 26 cents, to $10.73. TMP rose 40 cents, to $41.50, while Yahoo fell 25 cents, to $16.67. C3.

Argentina Crisis Is Also Blow to U.S.
Argentina's declaration of a moratorium on repayment of its foreign debt marks the end of a failed economic experiment that has cost the country dearly. But it is also a blow to the United States and the International Monetary Fund, which had invested much of their credibility and prestige yet proved unwilling to help when things fell apart.

HEADLINE: For Street Vendors With a Dream, a New Indoor Market in Flatbush 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN

 BODY:
For years, the corner of Flatbush and Caton Avenues, in the heart of Caribbean Brooklyn, has been an economic battleground, a place where enterprising street vendors went head to head with local store owners. The vendors dreamed of one day having a market all their own, while Flatbush merchants wished they would just go away.
 Now it seems the two have found a peaceful way to coexist after all, thanks in part to a new $1.6 million indoor vendors' market, the Flatbush Vendor Mart. It will open its doors early next month to 61 small-scale vendors, mostly Caribbean and African, selling hats, health and beauty aids, handmade crafts, children's clothing and everything between. 
 The mart represents a promise City Councilwoman Una S. T. Clarke made to the vendors six years ago, as they looked for an ally in their effort to survive on Flatbush. Mrs. Clarke, who is one of the 36 veteran council members forced out of office by term limits this year, called the new building a crowning moment for Flatbush. "It means jobs, economic growth and a chance to help any vendor who wants to get off the streets and get back to the dream that they came to this country with," she said.
The mart, built with city money, will operate year-round. It will be one of a handful around the city, but that is where the similarities will end, vows Roy Hastick, president of the Caribbean Chamber of Commerce, the group that will manage the new mart. Vendors will be assigned a stall for 17 months, in exchange for $25 a day. After that time elapses, a new group of vendors will come in.
No two vendors will be allowed to sell the same products. They must also agree to participate in small-business courses run by the city's Department of Business Services. Mr. Hastick said the courses were expected to include training in areas like bookkeeping, pricing, marketing and obtaining tax identification numbers and vendor licenses. 
Part of the idea, he said, is to prevent the 8,960-square-foot Flatbush Mart from suffering a fate similar to that of Mart 125 in Harlem. Vendors at that mart were eventually evicted after a lengthy legal fight with the city, in which they claimed the city never made good on promises to train them and help them purchase part of the mart. 
"Obviously, we're concerned about what happened in Harlem," Mr. Hastick said. "But we're working very closely with the city to make sure that training is in place and that vendors understand this is not a permanent home. It's a micro-enterprise incubator, an opportunity for the vendors to make some money but also to learn the skills to hopefully open their own businesses on Flatbush." 
Out on Flatbush Avenue, known for its roti shops, Caribbean grocers and reggae record stores, the mart is being welcomed by street vendors.
"Finally," said Frantz Moise, 42, a Haitian security guard who for nearly 10 years has sold Afro-Caribbean art and postcards part time. "We waited a long time, and we've had to put up with a lot." 
Under the city's "zero visibility" ordinance, street vending is illegal along busy commercial arteries like Flatbush Avenue. The police began clearing sidewalks after complaints from residents and local store owners who were frustrated that the vendors were clogging sidewalks and siphoning off customers. "Every Monday morning, vendors would be at my office asking for help because their merchandise has been taken away in a sweep or because there was a complaint from the business improvement district," Mrs. Clarke said. "To me, these were poor people trying to make a living doing an honest enterprise, albeit in a forbidden area. These are substantial stakeholders in this community; they needed a way to lift themselves up." 
So she began lobbying on their behalf, first pushing for a temporary space, an outdoor tent to be set up in part of a municipal parking lot. As that plan drew criticism from local merchants, Mrs. Clarke set her sights on a permanent mart at Flatbush and Caton. 
Her efforts have made her a hero to vendors like Selwyn Branker. "Una Clarke was the only one who listened to us, who tried to understand what it was like to be out here dealing with the crowded sidewalks, the car fumes, the police trying to enforce the law," Mr. Branker said.
Seven days a week, Mr. Branker, who is 40 and from Barbados, drags heavy bags choked full of Afro-Caribbean flags and pendants around the avenue looking for a safe place to set up.
Lately, he has found a home in front of the new mart, the place where he now plans to move closer to his dream of opening his own shop.
"Out here, the minute you make a few dollars, the person next to you starts selling the same thing," he said. "In the mart, it will be less competitive. Everybody will have a chance to make some money and learn." 
Not all the vendors along Flatbush Avenue are so convinced. Some say they are being asked to pay too much for too little in the way of accommodations. There is no storage space at the market, and some longtime vendors worry they will lose regular customers if they are not allowed to sell the same products that they have for years. 
Doreen, a Jamaican hat vendor who would give only her first name, said she was happy about the mart's arrival. "But the mart is supposed to benefit us," she said. "It ain't pretty or cheap to have to lug this stuff back and forth."
Storage would be a nice perk, Mr. Moise and others agree. But as he sees it, "You never get everything you want in life. At least we're going indoors."

CONTRACT MANUFACTURERSEEKS CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The contract manufacturer ACT Manufacturing said that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after its lenders refused to finance its operations under any other circumstances. 
ACT recently posted a third-quarter loss and said its business was hurt by the weak economy. The company has been cutting jobs and slowing production in a bid to save money. ACT filed its bankruptcy petition on Friday at a court in Worcester, Mass., and said a hearing is scheduled tomorrow to authorize up to $9.5 million of temporary debtor-in-possession financing. ACT said its overseas operations are unaffected by the filing.

HEADLINE: Trying to Keep Young Internet Users From a Life of Piracy 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
When law enforcement agents seized 129 computers in 27 cities recently in a coordinated assault on online piracy, they focused much of their effort on colleges like Duke, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California at Los Angeles.
 They were probably too late. 
 As children have access to computers earlier and earlier in their educational careers, experts in piracy, hacking and other forms of Internet mischief say that any effort to tackle the illicit trade in digital goods -- including video games, computer software, music and even movies -- should be looking at a younger crowd. 
"By the time we get them, they already believe it's right," said David J. Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the former chief technologist of the Federal Communications Commission "If you're willing to bootleg music, you're willing to bootleg anything."
In fact, America's rush to the online world has created an enormous population of ever-younger computer pirates, say experts in the field. They compare the situation with giving every student a car without providing drivers' education classes. 
"We've got to focus on preparing kids to use the Internet in a safe and responsible manner," said Nancy E. Willard, director of the Responsible Netizen Center for Advanced Technology in Education at the University of Oregon. She has prepared course materials and guides for teaching computer ethics in secondary schools to help them meet the requirements of the Children's Internet Protection Act of 2000. The law, which requires schools and libraries to use filters or similar technology to protect children from objectionable materials, also requires an "Internet safety policy" to prevent "unauthorized access, including so-called 'hacking,' and other unlawful activities by minors online."
Online, the searching and trading for wares goes on day and night. In an online discussion last week using technology known as Internet Relay Chat, the "warez" channel, or chat room, was busy. Warez is slang for software that has been "liberated" from encryption. On the channel, rapid-fire bursts of messages requesting digital goods -- games, DVD's, business software -- were interspersed among the random comments and insults: 
Queball: "Anyone know where I can a copy Sybex virtual lab . . ." 
Porrin: "@find 3d studio para *pc*."
Nellie: "Anyone here have save the last dance movie. msg me."
The patter and trading are constant, yet this is small time. Far bigger players operate quietly with vast storage and bandwidth, cracking the copyright protection that keep the strings of ones and zeroes that underlie everything from the video game Tomb Raider to the movie "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and making them available in a limitless five-finger discount store in the ether. 
The recent raids focused mainly on the networks of hard-core traders in a handful of groups with names like DrinkOrDie, which tended to trade for fun and not for profit. Among the computers seized were ones belonging to business executives and administrators of computer networks.
Unauthorized copying and distribution of software is a global headache for the industry, which claims that more than a third of all business software used is pirated, according to an annual report commissioned by the Business Software Alliance, a trade group. In fact, the situation has improved markedly since 1995, when the figure was closer to half of all software. In the United States the figure has dropped to 24 percent, the lowest rate in the world, because of a vigorous education and enforcement efforts and until recently a strong economy. 
Over all, the cost of business software piracy alone was $11.75 billion in 2000, the group reported, although this amount assumes that any illicitly used software would otherwise have been bought by users.
The greatest incidence of software piracy, according to industry experts, occurs in business, where many employees of a firm will share a single copy of a program. Internet trading pales by comparison, said Bob Kruger, vice president for enforcement at the Business Software Alliance. But it constitutes "the biggest threat in the future," he said, "as people become more accustomed to getting digital works online."
The software industry does not break out the statistics for piracy in higher education, but "anecdotally, we see a lot of activity coming out of university areas," said Ric Hirsch, senior vice president for intellectual property enforcement at the Interactive Digital Software Association, the trade association representing computer and video game publishers.
Eugene H. Spafford, a professor of computer science and director of Purdue University's Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security, said if students lack the ethical preparation when they begin using the Internet, things quickly spiral out of control when they reach college, where they have lots of free time, peers they want to impress and high bandwidth.
That is to be expected, Professor Spafford said, since college is a time for testing boundaries. "We do encourage them to try new things, meet new people," he said. "It's not that surprising that they try to break some of the bounds, and not just in computing."
But fixing the problem would be expensive and intrusive, he said. He questions whether the monitoring required might be worse than the disease.
"When you have one person who goes bad out of 40,000, do you want to watch that other 39,999 to catch that one?" Professor Spafford asked. "To find the people doing the bad things might involve violating the privacy of all those other people. As a society is that the kind of trade-off we want to make?"
Professor Farber agreed. Closely monitor students, he warned, and "pretty soon you'll be looking at what they write and what they read." 
Some experts say they wish the corporations pushing for ethical behavior among customers would show more of it themselves.
Many students bristle at the newest legal tool for protecting copyright, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It has been criticized as heavy handed, tipping the balance of copyright law away from principles such as fair use. 
Many also note, Professor Willard said, a federal court ruling that Microsoft had abused its monopoly power.
That is how "Incursion" sees it. The Internet name belonged to a college student from Texas, who was looking for games recently on the Warez channel. The student said he generally pays for the software he uses but does like to sample the goods before buying. "If I feel it's a quality game," he said, "I'll buy it."
Asked whether using software without paying for it is wrong, he replied, "depends what you consider wrong." Pressed for further explanation, he wrote, "A monopoly is wrong."
Taking apart rationalizations like that one are part of what Professor Willard tries to do in materials that she has prepared for teenagers.
But she added that the argument has power -- and that recklessness and rebellion are not just part of adolescence but of the American character. "We applaud the U.S. patriots," she said, "who hacked onto the British tea ship and destroyed their product."
Ultimately, time might be on the companies' side. The environment changes so quickly that even would-be pirates say they find it hard to keep up. 
Jeremy, who goes by the online name "Xelsed" and asks that only his first name be used, insisted that he did not trade software any more -- which did not explain what he was doing in the Warez channel typing "!gimme stuff," a request he saw others type and which he figured could lead to offers. Even if he wanted to, though, he was out of touch, he said, having not visited the site in several months. 
The old formula for a request for software -- typing "/xdcc" and then the name of a program -- did not seem to resonate in the current slang. "Now I really dont know what to do," he types in the hasty, error-riddled style of instant messages. "I have to face the fact that well i'm dated."
Jeremy said he was 27 and out of college and added that he feels he has outgrown the warez world. 
"To be frank," he wrote, "I think its probably alot easer to buy the game then to spend the hours neccacery to make 'friends' and get into the sceen."

HEADLINE: The Scrooge Syndrome 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"Bah, humbug!" cried the U.S. treasury secretary. O.K., Paul O'Neill didn't actually say "Bah." But last week he contemptuously dismissed proposals for increased aid to poor nations. And his justification -- that he "would like to see evidence of what works before making new commitments" -- was pure humbug.
 For the truth is that we already know what works. Nobody expects foreign aid to perform miracles, to turn Mozambique into Sweden overnight. But more modest goals, such as saving millions of people a year from diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, are quite reachable, for quite modest sums of money. 
 That is the message of a commission report just released by the World Health Organization, which calls on advanced countries to provide resources for a plan to "scale up the access of the world's poor to essential health services." The program would provide very basic items that many poor nations simply cannot afford: antibiotics to treat tuberculosis, insecticide-treated nets to control malaria, and so on. The price tag would be about 0.1 percent of advanced countries' income. The payoff would be at least eight million lives each year.
 This is not starry-eyed idealism. The report quotes Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard professor who headed the commission: "I can be 'realistic' and 'cynical' with the best of them -- giving all the reasons why things are too hard to change." Mr. Sachs knows that it will be hard to persuade advanced countries to come up with the money -- and that the United States, in particular, is likely to be highly unreceptive. But this is one of those cases in which leadership could make a tremendous difference. 
 Right now, the United States is the Scrooge of the Western world -- the least generous rich nation on the planet. One of the tables in that W.H.O. report shows the share of G.N.P. given in foreign aid by advanced countries; the United States ranks dead last, well behind far poorer countries such as Portugal and Greece. The sums proposed by the W.H.O. would double our foreign aid budget, not because those sums are large, but because we start from so low a base -- about a dime a day for each U.S. citizen.
 Still, doubling our foreign aid budget sounds like an impossible dream. But is it? We may be a Scrooge nation, but we are not a nation of Scrooges. Not only are Americans often generous as individuals, they are -- without knowing it -- apparently willing to give substantially more foreign aid than the nation actually does. When asked how much of the federal budget should be devoted to foreign aid, Americans typically come up with a number around 10 percent -- about 20 times what we currently spend.
 Voters are, however, misinformed: they think that the share of foreign aid in federal spending should be cut to 10 percent. And they wonder why foreigners don't show more gratitude for all the money we give them. Americans are, in other words, living in the past: the Marshall Plan ended more than 50 years ago, but they haven't noticed.
 The point is that we like to think of ourselves as generous. This suggests that a U.S. administration that really wanted to follow the W.H.O. report's recommendations would not find it hard to build political support. All it would have to do is use the bully pulpit to inform the public of the difference between America's generous self-image and the less attractive reality.
 Why bother? You might say that the United States has a selfish interest in helping the world's poor. The Sachs commission argues that there would be large collateral benefits from improved health care in the world's poorest nations. Disease, it argues, is a major barrier to economic growth, and economic growth in developing countries would make the world as a whole a richer and safer place. 
 You might also say that reducing the disconnect between America's words and its deeds would give us a better claim to the moral leadership we think we deserve.
 But the key argument here is surely a moral one. A sum of money that Americans would hardly notice, a dime a day for the average citizen, would quite literally save the lives of millions. Can we really say to ourselves, this Christmas Day, that this gift is not worth giving? --------------------

Nicholas D. Kristof's column will appear tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Next, Pavel From Irkutsk Gives Putin A Mouthful 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin did something today that might be deemed remarkable even in a robust democracy like the United States: he spent two and a half hours on national television, taking questions from ordinary Russians. 
 He got an earful, too. 
 There was Lyubov M. Sergeyeva, a single mother of a disabled child with a family income of about $50 a month, calling from Kostroma Province, north of Moscow. "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we are not living, we are subsisting," she told Mr. Putin by telephone. "When will the state show care at last for such families?" 
There was a call from Petrov -- just Petrov -- a Moscow businessman who apparently was a target for extortion. "Do you know there is a popular concept called a 'protection market' ?" he asked, and went on to suggest that representatives of law enforcement bodies top the list of those involved.
And there was Pavel Tsvetkov, a 10-year-old from Siberia's Irkutsk region, whose school was closed for lack of heat. "My question to you, Vladimir Vladimirovich, is: Is it possible that we will be asked to repeat the year if it is not our fault that our schools are not heated?"
There were 47 questioners in all, plugged into a Kremlin office via the Internet, telephone and live video feeds from 10 Russian cities. They wanted to know why their pensions were late or meager, when their villages would get natural gas lines, how a teacher and a doctor could expect to survive as husband and wife on $100 a month in government wages.
Their queries carried an undercurrent, aptly summarized by an unidentified man who appeared on a video screen from Novosibirsk, in southern Siberia. "Won't we be cheated again, Vladimir Vladimirovich?" he asked. 
Mr. Putin, imperturbable as always, answered practically every query with a dollop of facts and statistics, a display that was reminiscent of President Bill Clinton's legendary grip on the details of governing. But his answers, too, reflected an undercurrent, which surfaced early, when a student from Vladivostok complained that Mr. Putin's promises to improve housing had yet to fix the maze of leaky pipes in the region's apartment buildings.
"This is roughly the same as if one of us were suffering from a grave, chronic disease for many years, and then would go to a doctor and say, 'Tomorrow, I need to take a test for the cosmonaut's unit, so give me a pill since I need to pass the medical examination,' " Mr. Putin said. "No such miracle will happen." 
Mr. Putin repeatedly told questioners that Russia would not transform itself overnight, even as he leavened most of his answers with data showing that average incomes and pensions are rising smartly, homeless soldiers are getting more housing and aid to the disabled is on the uptick.
Whether Russians took to his blunt message remains to be seen. When the Moscow news radio station Ekho Moskvy asked callers to register their opinions in an unscientific telephone survey, two-thirds of the 1,238 callers said Mr. Putin had not reassured them about their own concerns, while a third said he had. 
The two state-run networks that broadcast the program, RTR and ORT, said that they had been swamped with more than 500,000 calls from questioners, while another 27,000 questions were submitted through the Internet. 
Only two questioners asked about foreign affairs, and both were concerned with the United States. Responding to a caller who asked about the White House's withdrawal from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, Mr. Putin repeated, as he had before, that he opposed the move but that he expected relations with Washington to continue to improve. 
The other caller, harking back to cold war days, reminded Mr. Putin that in his days as a Soviet spy, America was viewed as the Kremlin's major enemy. He wondered what Mr. Putin thought about sleeping in the enemy's bed during his visit to President Bush's Texas ranch last month.
Mr. Putin had a quick and wry reply. "I was not very much excited over spending the night in Bush's dacha," he said. "I think he should himself be concerned about what was going on if he had let a former officer of the Soviet foreign intelligence into his home."

HEADLINE: Officials Race to Finish Stadium Plans For Mets and Yankees Before Year's End 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Despite the city's growing fiscal problems and the approaching departure of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, city officials are laboring furiously to complete plans for new stadiums for the Mets and the Yankees by New Year's Eve.
 It is unclear whether the work will be completed by the time Mayor Giuliani swears in his successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, in Times Square early on Jan. 1. But the city has been meeting with executives of the Mets and the Yankees in recent days, and an outline of the deals was contained in a thick environmental impact statement for a new stadium for the Mets that was completed last week. 
 The plans envision a public-private partnership, with the Mets and the Yankees making the largest private contribution toward the cost of a stadium of any Major League Baseball team. But the impact statement omits the cost of transportation improvements, and thereby understates the full cost of the projects to taxpayers by several hundred million dollars. Critics also said the report fails to provide an economic rationale for the projects. 
"Stadiums do not lead to long-term economic growth or jobs," said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office. "And there's nothing in this report that would indicate otherwise."
The push to complete the work just days before Mayor Giuliani leaves office comes as the economic fallout from the recession and the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center have deepened the sense that things like housing and education would have more claim on the ever-shrinking pot of public money than the stadium deal does. And the incoming mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, has been lukewarm about thesubject of stadiums and the broader topic of economic incentives to private businesses. 
Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment on the ongoing push for the stadiums. Robert Harding, deputy mayor for economic development, did not return calls requesting comment.
Contrary to most economists, Mayor Giuliani has long argued that stadiums would spark new business. In recent weeks, city officials have rushed to put the finishing details on his administration's stadium plans. The city's Art Commission approved the Mets' stadium design at a little-noticed public hearing on Nov. 12, and the Parks Department approved the team's impact statement last week. City officials have also met with the Yankees, although the team's plans are not as far along as the Mets' are.
Under the Mets' plan, the city and the team would build a 46,000-seat, $800 million stadium that would resemble the old Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, but include all the modern accouterments, including a retractable roof and 90 luxury suites, in the parking lot next to the team's current home, Shea Stadium, in Queens. The plan calls for work on the stadium to begin next month and be completed in time for the opening game in 2005.
Whatever Mr. Giuliani does before he leaves office, he cannot put any stadium plan into effect single-handedly in the days remaining in his term. Furthermore, some elements of the plan would require approval by the state and by the City Council. 
The city would issue $800 million in tax-exempt bonds, but according to the impact statement, the team would pay $25 million or more of the estimated $50 million in annual debt payments. At the same time, the Mets would be responsible for operating costs and maintenance, while the city would own the stadium and get an unspecified share of the revenue from baseball games and other events at the stadium.
Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp, a sports-consulting firm in Chicago, said that the $400 million contribution from the Mets would represent "the largest amount any team in baseball has put into a new stadium project." He also said that tax-exempt financing would save the teams millions of dollars a year.
In San Francisco, the Giants paid the entire cost of building Pacific Bell Park, but the cost was only $319 million. Taxpayers, however, covered the cost of more than $100 million in highway and sewer projects. In contrast, the Seattle Mariners provided about $150 million toward the $517 million cost of Safeco Field in Seattle, the most expensive stadium to date.
The report for "Shea Stadium Redevelopment," however, does not include more than $100 million in subway and highway improvements the Mets have asked the state to undertake for the new stadium. The estimated cost of the transportation improvements for the Yankees is even higher, more than $200 million, according to state officials. But neither the Yankees nor the Mets have met with state officials since the attack on the World Trade Center in September, when the stadium projects appeared to lose priority.
Plans for a new Yankee Stadium are still coming together, but according to one person involved in the talks, the team would receive "an equivalent deal." The Yankees project is more complicated because it involves the demolition of the team's historic home in the Bronx and the building of a new stadium at nearby Macombs Dam Park, which has generated opposition from the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, and from community groups.
Critics say it is hard to understand why New York would consider public funding for baseball stadiums when it must rebuild Lower Manhattan and has an estimated $4 billion budget gap beginning July 1 and a projected $40 billion in debt. The city already spends 16 cents out of every tax dollar to pay long-term debts, according to Ms. Lowenstein of the Independent Budget Office.
"Stadiums don't generate new hotels or office buildings," she said. "Economic activity that would have been here anyway, like restaurants and retailers, do wind up in different parts of city depending on where you put a stadium." The impact statement concluded that the Mets' stadium "would not result in substantial new development" or affect the real estate market.
The report does say that a stadium with a retractable roof would be used for up to 75 other events, including concerts, religious events, basketball games and college sports, that would bring in revenue for the city.
But Mr. Ganis of Sportscorp said that based on experience at other domed stadiums it is unlikely that the Mets could book that many events. "They're being very aggressive," he said. "I suspect that if the Mets were paying for the entire cost of the roof we might see a different economic analysis."
The report concluded by saying that, "The biggest single benefit of the proposed project to the City of New York would be the retention of jobs, earnings, and a variety of tax revenues by keeping the Mets in the city."
But the impact statement also says that if a new stadium is not built, "the Mets would presumably continue to use the existing Shea Stadium, and operations and revenue would be expected to remain."

HEADLINE: Blacks Who Voted Against Bush Offer Support to Him in Wartime 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Steven Price, the proprietor of the Wise Choice Barber Shop on Jacksonville's north side, was none too happy with George W. Bush this time last year. In this city's heavily black and Democratic neighborhoods, like the one where Mr. Price wields his trimmer, one of every five votes was thrown out because of confusion over the ballot, and folks here were street-marching mad.
 It was, in the eyes of Mr. Price and many other African-Americans, an outrageous disenfranchisement of black voters in a state where Mr. Bush won the thinnest of majorities and, as a result, the presidency. "I thought he was a crook, that he bought the election," Mr. Price said. "I just thought it was fixed." 
 But listen to Mr. Price now, as he assesses Mr. Bush's performance since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Not only does he approve wholeheartedly of the war in Afghanistan, he also has no qualms about the civil liberties implications of the government's antiterrorism measures, including the Bush administration's interrogation of Middle Easterners and its possible use of military tribunals to try terrorism suspects. 
"I think he's handled the situation properly and he's showing that he's a strong president," Mr. Price, 31, said on a quiet afternoon in his shop. "I don't even look at him now as having bought the presidency. I just look at him as president." 
As Mr. Bush's father can attest, a president's wartime popularity can be ephemeral, particularly if war is followed by recession. But for the moment, a striking component of Mr. Bush's immense public approval is his high level of support from black Americans, hardly any of whom voted for him. 
Pollsters and black political leaders say that Mr. Bush's ratings reflect the patriotism and unity felt by all Americans, and may demonstrate black support for the country more than for Mr. Bush himself. But they also note that the distance Mr. Bush has traveled with black Americans says much about the influence of a foreign conflict on public opinion.
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, taken from Dec. 7 to 10, found that nearly three of every four blacks and nine of every 10 whites approved of Mr. Bush's performance.
The poll's sampling of blacks was not large enough to measure the support for Mr. Bush with precision. But its general findings are reinforced by other polls, including a Gallup survey taken Dec. 14-16 that found that more than two-thirds of blacks approved of the president's performance. In early October, Mr. Bush's approval ratings among blacks exceeded 80 percent in the Gallup poll.
By contrast, surveys of voters leaving the polls in November 2000 found that Mr. Bush received only 8 percent of the black vote, the worst showing of any Republican presidential candidate since at least 1972, when modern exit polling began.
Until Sept. 11, Mr. Bush's ratings among blacks remained relatively low. In the Times/CBS and Gallup polls, he never received positive marks from more than half of the blacks surveyed, and typically no more than a third were approving.
Some of Mr. Bush's newfound popularity with blacks may be a product of the war's power to obscure concerns about the economy and other domestic issues. Some blacks also have been impressed by the high-profile roles being played by members of minorities in Mr. Bush's cabinet, like Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser.
Whatever the reasons, Mr. Bush is finding support these days in the unlikeliest of places.
"I think he's done a tremendous job in managing the war on terrorism," said Donna Brazile, a leading black Democratic strategist and the manager of Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000. "He's rallied the country, kept us focused on goals and kept us informed. I don't have any beef with him."
Like many other black Americans, Ms. Brazile said she had put aside her bitterness over the Florida recount "because it looked quite trivial when put next to Sept. 11."
"I still believe Al Gore won the election," she said, "but it doesn't matter anymore."
Ms. Brazile and other political analysts predicted that the warm feelings of African-Americans toward Mr. Bush would not last, and that he was unlikely to win many black votes in the 2004 election.
After all, former President Bush, who won 12 percent of the black vote in his 1988 victory, had a job approval rating of 72 percent from blacks at the height of the Persian Gulf war in March 1991. Twenty months later, he won only 10 percent of the black vote in losing to Bill Clinton.
George W. Bush's support among blacks "is as broad as could be but it doesn't run deep and he doesn't have coattails," said Ms. Brazile, who pointed out that blacks voted overwhelmingly last month for the winning Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia.
But she said Democratic polling and focus groups before those elections suggested that blacks would not have responded well to attacks on Mr. Bush.
"They wanted to hear about issues and comparisons" she said, "but nothing anti-Bush."
Julian Bond, the chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., said Mr. Bush had benefited because the war on terrorism had "driven most of the radical conservative agenda both out of the headlines and out of present-day politics."
And David A. Bositis, a leading analyst of black voting behavior for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, said blacks would eventually become discontented with Mr. Bush because of rising unemployment, which stood at 10.1 percent for blacks in November, double the rate for whites. Spending on defense and domestic security will leave little for education, health care and Social Security, he said, and blacks will then remember the impact of the Bush tax cuts.
That is already true for some blacks here in Jacksonville, a city of 780,000 where blacks make up 28 percent of the population. Fred R. Taylor, a 48-year-old construction worker, was laid off two weeks ago and blames the president.
"We had eight good years under Clinton and now we've had this guy in office for one year and there's no money left in the economy," Mr. Taylor said.
As for the war, Mr. Taylor seems satisfied with the way it has been conducted, but says he thinks Mr. Bush's "father is telling him what to do."
Similarly, the Rev. George A. Price, the longtime pastor of St. Matthew Baptist Church here, said Mr. Bush had simply made the obvious moves in leading the war effort. 
"The bottom line is that in these times you've got to support your leader," Mr. Price said. "Would I vote for him? No. But do I think that there should be any overt opposition? Not at a time like this."
But others in Jacksonville seemed almost sheepish in admitting that they had voted for Mr. Gore last year. They said that Mr. Bush had shown them something during the last three months, and that they would at least consider voting for him in the future.
"I've got all good things to say about him right now," said Robert K. Hickson, a 22-year-old firefighter who voted for Mr. Gore. "From what I get, he's keeping cool, he's showing good leadership, he's supporting all the troops. So far it seems like it's working."
Margaret A. Izevbizua, a 40-year-old nurse, said Mr. Bush had impressed her enough to have earned her consideration in 2004.
"He went forward with action, not just talk," Ms. Izevbizua said. "I didn't vote for Bush. I voted for Gore. I was born and raised a Democrat. But after all this happened, I said, 'Well, you know, he turned out to be different.' I don't look at him as being Republican or Democrat."
Some polls have suggested that blacks, presumably because of their history as victims of civil rights abuses, are more concerned than whites about ethnic profiling and other civil liberties issues growing out of the war on terrorism. But little of that showed up in interviews in Jacksonville.
Several people said the magnitude of the Sept. 11 attacks and the threat of future terrorism left the government little choice but to put the rights of Middle Easterners second to security concerns.
"From my view, it's like, Welcome to my world," said Steven Price, the barber. "Blacks go through that every day. I wouldn't say it's right. But with people's lives being wasted like that, it's worth giving them a little more attention."
And many of those interviewed seemed to feel that if it had been permissible for years to mistreat African-Americans because of their ethnicity, the same should now hold true for Middle Easterners.
"If it involves the civil liberties of African-Americans, we get involved," said George Price, the pastor, who is a veteran of civil rights protests here. "If it involves the civil liberties of anybody else, we tend to sit on the sidelines."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
For New York Diners, A Year to Remember

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
IN a year filled to bursting with improbable events, most of them alarming, it may be hard to make a case for restaurants as a big story, but I have to try. There were too many memorable meals, too many chefs doing inspired work and too many good new restaurants not to make the effort. Well before disaster struck in September, I was already convinced that 2001 was shaping up to be a year to remember for New York diners. The turmoil and uncertainty of the following three months did nothing to change my opinion. 
 The crop of newcomers in 2001 was stellar, with standouts like Pico, Town, Ilo and Craft at the top of the list, each exhibiting, in a very different way, a daring, almost giddy creativity. Two superior French restaurants, Restaurant Daniel and Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, got even better, joining the city's four-star elite. Patria, the hot-beating heart of Nuevo Latino in Manhattan, not only survived the departure of Douglas Rodriguez, it also improved in the hands of his understudy, Andrew DiCataldo. At Aquavit, Marcus Samuelsson could easily have decided to stick with a successful formula. Instead, he became bolder and more experimental, and the restaurant felt fresher than ever. Proving that sequels can be better than the original, Jimmy Bradley opened the Harrison, a casual American restaurant in the spirit of the Red Cat. Manhattan, which does not have any shortage of bistros, happily made room for Ouest and DB. The list goes on and on. 
 It has become almost reflexive to call Manhattan the best restaurant city in the world. The homegrown chefs at Pico, Town, Ilo and Craft, pure products of New York's restaurant culture, go a long way toward explaining why. The talent pool in New York is deep, the sense of freedom exhilarating, the local audience highly educated and quick to perceive genuine ability. The results can be seen up and down the price scale.
It's almost taken for granted that New York will deliver the best of the best: the big-ticket French restaurants that can traumatize even platinum credit cards, the high-end steakhouses, the stylized global and New American gastronomic temples. The real strength of the city's restaurants does not really show itself until you begin working down the hierarchy, and see the talent at the two-star and one-star restaurants, many of them good enough to be the best restaurant, by a wide margin, in any midsize American city. There were lots of those in 2001, too. It often made for some difficult reviewing choices.
Craft may have been the most important of the newcomers. Tom Colicchio of Gramercy Tavern set himself and his patrons a stern test, and in the early going it was not clear who exactly was going to pass it. As the name implied, Craft set out to deliver the culinary equivalent of Shaker furniture. Maximum impact, minimum interference was the implicit promise. For their part, diners were asked to assemble their own plates, selecting side dishes and, initially, even sauces, a procedure that forced a level of concentration that not everyone was up to. Things were touch and go for a while, as Mr. Colicchio adjusted the formula. In the end, he emerged victorious. And anyone looking for next year's trends, and perhaps the next decade's, might want to pay a visit to this groundbreaking restaurant.
The sagging economy, and a widespread sense of trend-fatigue, made it likely that some form of more simplified cooking would gain the ascendancy. Comfort food and blue-plate diner dishes showed up all over town, sure signs of a looming recession, but the door was wide open for a chef who could make simplicity seem like an inspiration rather than a limitation. 
Mr. Colicchio gave a nightly tutorial on the basics of cooking, coaxing big flavors from superb ingredients, serving his meat in little more than reduced pan juices, and often getting his best results from cheap cuts like breast of veal. This was cooking with no hidden tricks, no fancy flourishes, no gimmicks. Diners willing to deal with the unusual menu format were rewarded with a thrilling experience, the chance to rediscover fundamental tastes and flavors.
Pico, in its own way, was as daring as Craft. It was ethnic, but not really. Nor was it fusion, or neo, or anything else. Portugal gave the chef and owner, John Villa, a starting point, or a set of references, but in the end, Pico was a little like its popular dessert, the miniature dougnuts called sonhos, translated on the menu as "beautiful little dreams." 
Where it made sense, Pico insisted on authenticity. Its list of wines and ports, for example, was uncompromisingly, and adventurously, Portuguese. But Mr. Villa did not limit himself to reproducing standard Portuguese dishes, a limited repertory complicated by the fact that Mediterranean fish do not swim in local waters. (This inconvenience has a lot to do with the disappointing quality of many restaurants infatuated with the idea of the seaside cuisines of Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy.)
Instead, he invented a parallel Portugal, a dream country with a dream cuisine. He reached as far as the former colony of Goa, in India, to spice his foie gras, but his Amish chicken was stuffed with an old, traditional mixture of pork, peasant bread, olives and port. At a time when it seemed that Manhattan had run through the list of possible cuisines, Mr. Villa came up with another.
It was a good year for Midtown, in part because a boom in the creation of new hotels -- and newly renovated hotels -- added one restaurant after another to a section of town that needed a little excitement. Town, in the Chambers Hotel, gave Geoffrey Zakarian a chance to take center stage, after years as the quiet talent at restaurants like Patroon and 44 in the Royalton Hotel. He responded with a performance perfectly suited to the glamorous setting by David Rockwell.
Town was not simply in Midtown, it seemed to be defining a new Midtown cuisine, a little understated, but each dish made distinctive with a half-twist, an unexpected visual paint stroke, or both, like the roasted skate served with three sorbet-shaped quenelles: pea-peppermint, apple-miso, and eggplant with hazelnut oil and quatre-epices.
Ilo, across from Bryant Park, liberated another veteran chef, Rick Laakkonen, yet one more graduate of the River Cafe. His reach is global, his instincts rooted in a love of pure flavors. He developed a quirky menu at Ilo, often relying on strange ingredients like percebes, or goose barnacles, and serro, a puffy Sicilian cheese. Like a magician pulling one colored silk scarf after another from his sleeve, he managed to astonish without letup.
The percebes appeared in a dish called the tidal pool, an assemblage of Olympia oysters, sea urchin, wakame seaweed, and silver ear and wood ear mushrooms heaped in the center of a large bowl and poached when a concentrated broth was added. Small, cloudlike puffs of serro made a slightly sour foil to artichoke soup flavored with sliced mushrooms and truffles that form a dense thicket in the middle of the bowl.
The excitement was not limited to the high end of the market. Ouest, a very stylish-looking bistro from the shrewd team behind Ollie's and Virgil's Barbecue in Times Square, opened its doors on the Upper West Side and from the get-go could barely handle the crowds. It was the right place in the right place at the right time. Tom Valenti, formerly the chef at Butterfield 81, gave the neighborhood something it needed badly, creatively updated bistro food in a snazzy setting. 
Farther downtown, Daniel Boulud did his own reimagining at DB Bistro Moderne, which quickly made its name as the home of the whopper, Boulud style. The restaurant's signature dish, the DB Burger, had the swaggering insolence of New York when it is feeling flush. A towering cholesterol festival, it managed to squeeze, between two halves of a Parmesan bun, a thick sirloin patty stuffed with foie gras and braised short ribs. The price, $27, made it something worth talking about. I had some niggling reservations about it at first, but now I think it's the kind of production, excessive and unashamed, that New York could use now. They should make postcards of it.
Some of my favorite restaurants of 2001 were the humbler one-star and two-star places that brought something unexpected to the table, like NL, the tiny Dutch restaurant in Greenwich Village with the tingling mustard soup and the little powdered fritters called poffertjes. But NL was only one of many. D'Artagnan, the meat purveyors, created an authentic, weirdly decorated Gascon restaurant in Midtown that swashed and buckled its way though the land of foie gras, prunes, duck and Armagnac. With luck, the weather may get cold enough for D'Artagnan's cassoulet. In the meantime, there's its French Kiss, an Armagnac-soaked prune stuffed with foie gras mousse.
Mi, near Madison Square Park, breathed new life into fusion cooking, with innovative pan-Asian dishes like rack of lamb in Goan spices. At the edge of Chinatown, a Hong Kong chef named Guy Liu proved that the fusionmobile can drive the wrong way up a one-way street and survive. In a little place called Dim Sum Go Go, Mr. Liu, who has since departed, put a plexiglass coating on Chinese tradition. His Go Go hamburger, for example, wrapped a dim-sim beef patty in a folded steamed bun. It came with taro French fries, and as an exercise in cultural transgression, it deserved to sit on the table right next to the $27 foie gras guy. When the ball drops this year, my heart is going to sink with it. There's no way that 2002 can come up with two hamburgers to beat these.
The new year will bring new restaurants. The talent in New York won't go away, and New Yorkers will still want to eat. Nothing can dull the city's appetite. But I am pretty sure that the stunning performance of 2001 cannot be repeated. It was a lucky run in an unlucky year. I'm glad I was there to eat my way through it, dish by dish, not quite believing in my good fortune, and the city's.

 The shocking numbers cited in "Median Income Drops Are Tied to Immigrants" (news article, Dec. 22) should convince anyone that mass immigration is economically devastating for average Americans. 
The article noted annual income losses of $5,000 to $9,000 per household over the last decade in high-immigration locales. 
 Our open-borders policy has caused Americans to work harder for less and welcomed terrorists. The question is when will Congress close America's porous borders to protect both our incomes and our lives.

HEADLINE: Former Colleagues Reconnect, If Briefly 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN 

 BODY:
Friendships born around a water cooler tend to fade when people leave their jobs and no longer have office gossip to share. While the Internet has not exactly overturned that pattern, it has created a forum for hundreds of e-mail lists and Web sites that enable former colleagues to keep in touch, plan reunions and share job leads.
 The trend is more prevalent among former employees of technology companies, but as tools have emerged that make setting up Web sites and chat rooms easier, the concept has spread to mainstream industries. Through Yahoo Groups, a service that lets anyone set up an e-mail list on a given theme, more than 150 groups of former employees -- including former workers at a DaimlerChrysler plant in Argentina and ex-teammates from the Toronto Blue Jays -- have started such information exchanges. 
 Tricia Sutton started a Yahoo group last December for former employees of the Outboard Marine Corporation, a boat and engine manufacturer in Waukegan, Ill., that had just shut down, displacing thousands of workers. At its height, 600 of them were exchanging hundreds of messages a month about the bankruptcy proceedings, health insurance and the fate of their retirement plans. List members posted information about efforts by a committee of ex-employees to obtain representation during the company's Chapter 11 proceedings, news reports about the sale of company assets and details about a rally held last April to draw attention to the plight of laid-off workers.
Ms. Sutton said she initiated the exchange to let former employees share job-hunting tips and keep up with one another. Some of the more personal updates included a message about the birth of a colleague's twin daughters, contact information for an employee who underwent open-heart surgery and an announcement about a book published by the father of a co-worker.
As it turned out, the list also turned into what she called "a safe place to vent."
"We realized in the midst of it one of the most powerful things was to help people cope," Ms. Sutton said. "We tried to get people to follow certain etiquette and be decent, but there was a lot of anger and frustration and pain. That was not something I anticipated."
As a result, e-mails circulated with an antimanagement edge. "We ask ALL supporters to attend this rally," one read. "There will be news media, politicians and other victims of this corporate abuse."
Another former employee had this message: "Thank your O.M.C. C.E.O.'s and upper Mgt. decision-makers for running what was once a great company. . .into the ground." 
As people have moved on with their lives, however, activity on the site has fallen off to a trickle, Ms. Sutton said.
It is not just casualties of the dot-com meltdown and subsequent recession who have seized on the Internet to stay in touch. People nostalgic for workplaces of years or even decades past are re-establishing contact, too. Alan Reynolds, a systems engineer in Austin, Tex., started a Web site in 1997 for former employees of the Six Flags Over Texas theme park, where he worked for four seasons in the late 1970's. 
"It hit me that a lot of the people I had worked with 20 years prior I had no contact with, and I thought maybe there's a way I can stir up some of these people and find them," Mr. Reynolds said. "And it just exploded on me."
So far, the group has registered about 1,200 former employees, who post photos, share memories of old pranks and have even held two reunions at the park.
"I think this is a little more emotional than just working for I.B.M. or something," said Mr. Reynolds, who is a former employee of I.B.M. but said he had never considered setting up a similar group for its former employees.
The Six Flags group, made up mostly of people who worked at the park as teenagers, "goes a little deeper into trying to recapture some of the good times," he said.
Like Outboard Marine's e-mail list, many of these virtual communities have a short life span. Still, those who use them say they serve a useful purpose. "It's a way of overcoming the isolation that happens when you're laid off," said Randy Alfred, who worked for an Internet company called Netguide Live that closed its San Francisco editorial operation in 1997.
Through an e-mail list called Castaways, former employees shared news about job openings and industry parties (back when those parties still took place) as well as the virtual equivalent of humor once shared via the office copy machine: jokes and links to random Web sites.
Mr. Alfred also recalled a discussion about the tax implications of the 10 shares of stock former employees received when the owner of Netguide Live, CMP Media, went public.
But veterans of multiple companies, who in some cases end up joining numerous e-mail lists of ex-colleagues, say it can be difficult to stay active in so many virtual communities, which is why many of the lists fade along with the memories of office rivalries, glories and pranks.
Cormac Foster, a recent Los Angeles transplant who has worked for several Internet companies, is on three e-mail lists, one for former CNET workers, another for Vivid Studios and another for Jupiter Media Metrix.
"Three years down the road, it's a place to go to find out where someone is now," Mr. Foster said. "But as a daily community part of my life, I don't think it will be. There's a finite amount of randomness that you feel like sending out to the world and you have to pick a channel."

HEADLINE: Wire Walker In Benefit For Artists Hurt Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Philippe Petit will walk the tightrope. Bill Irwin will not walk the tightrope. The Streb dancers will do something extreme, perhaps involving glass. Laurie Anderson will make music. Suzanne Vega will sing. Jules Pfeiffer, Ben Katcher, Art Spiegelman and Chuck Close will read.
 In an eclectic program billed as "Arts on the High Wire," artists of various stripes will converge on the Hammerstein Ballroom on West 34th Street on Jan. 11 for a night of celebrating the arts and raising money for an arts-recovery fund started after Sept. 11. 
 Among others scheduled to appear, all without fee, are the musicians Don Byron, Jim Carroll, Joe Jackson and John Zorn, the X-ecutioners band, the writers Paul Auster and Roy Blount Jr. and the photographer Bruce Davidson. 
"Artists are a funny bunch," said Mr. Irwin, the baggy-pants clown who scored big on Broadway with his mime show "Fool Moon." "We lose track of how important the arts are. We forget how our work is part of the economic lifeblood of New York."
The event was organized by the New York Foundation for the Arts, a 30-year-old group heading up the New York Arts Recovery Fund, a partnership of arts-service organizations. "Arts groups all over the city suffered from the attacks," said Theodore Berger, its executive director. "Most were not direct victims, but certainly they have been terrorized by all this." 
At least one artist, Michael Richards, a sculptor working on a project on the 92nd floor of World Trade Center One, died. In all, the arts foundation said, 25 artists had studios in the trade center complex as part of an artist-in-residence program called World Views, sponsored by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. They lost $200,000 worth of materials and equipment as well as artworks they valued at $650,000. In addition, the group said, several hundred other artists living close to the destroyed towers incurred cleanup expenses put at $5 million. And it said, well over 2,200 artists below 14th Street also suffered disruptions and the loss of jobs.
The arts-recovery fund, started with grants of $600,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, works with other groups to issue emergency grants to artists, help artists navigate the relief bureaucracy, lobby for more support and develop promotional campaigns. The New York Foundation for the Arts distributes nearly $11 million a year in grants and services to artists and arts groups, including fellowships of $7,000 each to about 170 New York State artists.
The Jan. 11 program, at 8 p.m. at the Manhattan Center, 311 West 34th Street, is more rally than fund-raiser, with tickets priced at $25 and $15. (Information about the event is available online at www.nyfa.org/ concert.htm).
A highlight of the program will be a wire walk by Mr. Petit intended to recall his 1974 feat of walking a 7/8-inch cable that he had deviously stretched between the twin towers 110 stories above the ground. The exploit, he said, "took seven years of illegal preparations," a tale he expects to tell in a book and film he is now working on. 
Mr. Petit, now 52, said that this time he would walk a 3/4-inch wire strung between the Hammerstein stage and the second balcony. And because, he said, "that is not enough of a surprise, to appear on a wire," he and Mr. Irwin decided to combine their acts. Mr. Irwin will remain decidedly earthbound, a tightrope artist only in his mind, taunted by the unattainable. 
"We talked for years about doing something like that," said Mr. Irwin, who met Mr. Petit after his 1974 extravaganza. "I was a young clown at Ringling Brothers," he said, "he was huge, a cultural hero."
Ms. Vega, a cerebral singer-songwriter known for her poetic lyrics, said her long attachment to the downtown scene made her an especially eager participant. There were other poignant connections to Sept. 11, she said. The night before, her brother was constructing the stage for a dance festival in the trade center plaza. He called in sick the next day and watched the towers topple from his apartment. Her friend and fellow songwriter Jack Hardy lost his brother in the attack.
In their trademark high-energy way, the action dancers of the choreographer Elizabeth Streb plan their own tribute to the victims, burrowing through a plexiglass box and, perhaps, diving through a triple pane of glass. "You get a little hurt, but the faster you go the less it hurts," Ms. Streb explained. "Action is usually not content-based. But since 9/11 extreme events have taken on a new veneer of content." 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 2, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article last Wednesday about a variety show scheduled for the Hammerstein Ballroom at the Manhattan Center on Jan. 11 to benefit artists hurt by the Sept. 11 attacks misspelled the surnames of two par ticipating artists. They are Jules Feiffer, not Pfeiffer, and Ben Katchor, not Katcher.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
Job Fairs Give Ex-Convicts Hope in Down Market

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL 

 BODY:
In September, 600 men and a sprinkling of women nervously clutched their resumes and waited for a chance to land an interview with one of several dozen recruiters at the civic center's main library in downtown San Francisco.
 The scene was pretty much like any of the hundreds of job fairs that have sprung up in the first recession in more than a decade to help the unemployed find work. But there was one big difference: every single job seeker was a former convict. 
 In the last several years, job fairs for convicted felons have proliferated around the country, many held inside the prisons themselves. They generally attract a decent number of local businesses searching for entry-level workers in factory and telemarketing positions. Some vocational positions in welding and custodial work can pay as much as $20 an hour, though most are closer to the minimum wage. But all the jobs offer former convicts an opportunity to become a part of mainstream society. 
The Mountainview Youth Correctional Facility in Clinton Township, N.J., which holds 1,200 men age 18 to 30, has held three job fairs since 1999. The inmates must be three to six months away from release, participate in a career-awareness class and arrive with a printed resume. This year, 45 New Jersey companies, including the QuickChek grocery chain and Jarchem Industries, a chemical manufacturer, met with about 400 inmates.
"The experience of meeting these recruiters itself brings a big change in attitude," said Carol Winer, Mountainview's education director. "The offenders say, 'They're interested in me, they shook my hand.' The companies see that these aren't convict stereotypes hanging from bars and drooling. They're human beings who deserve a chance."
In Ohio, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction has sponsored more than 140 job fairs the last six years and even holds teleconferences for companies that cannot attend in person. Only inmates with clean prison records who have completed academic or vocational programs will be recommended to potential employers, the department says. The department has placed 785 of 2,834 inmates interviewed in jobs since 1996.
At the San Francisco job fair, at least one recruiter understood how it felt to be an ex-offender needing a break. Ishmael Redden, 40, is now the manager of an Oakland, Calif., auto-service store called Oil Changers, but two years ago he was serving a three-year sentence for armed robbery.
After his release in 1999, he entered a drug-treatment program, and last year he was referred to the Northern California Service League, a nonprofit agency that helps former offenders find work and navigate the outside world. After attending a workshop on basic skills like paying bills and managing stress, and taking an automotive-technology class at the City College of San Francisco, he was hired in July 2000 as a technician at the Oil Changers chain, earning $7.50 an hour.
In less than a year, Mr. Redden ascended from technician to manager and doubled his pay, to $30,000 annually. He returned to the league's job fair to talk about his experience and give hope to those who were now struggling. He also hired two new technicians.
"I'm not any better than they are," he said. "You get a lot of enthusiasm from an ex-con who decides to turn it around. We have more to prove. People are always wondering when you're going to screw up and go back to jail."
The league's executive director, Shirley Melnicoe, said hiring former convicts benefited both employers and employees. "Many of these people realize that this is their last chance," she said. "Businesses get highly skilled and motivated people who often make better workers."
The Mountainview site in New Jersey has its own education program, and offers inmates both academic and vocational training in engine repair, horticultural studies, welding and fork-lift operation. As incentives, businesses that hire former offenders receive tax credits and free insurance against employee theft.
Time was, most employers avoided ex-convicts at all costs, but that attitude is slowly changing. The Uponer ETI Company, a pipe-manufacturing plant in Columbia, Mo., for example, says 17 of its 87 employees have felony records, mostly for robbery or drug offenses. (It draws the line at hiring people convicted of violent or sexual crimes.)
Bev Pottebaum, the company's human resource manager, says most of them work without complaining, even though they have to lift and pack 500-pound pipes in often-sweltering weather.
"These are not bad guys," Ms. Pottebaum said. "I try to treat them like everybody else." She says the men earn $10 an hour and receive company benefits after 60 days.
Still, old prejudices die hard. And with the onset of hard times, workplace specialists say, the newfound tolerance of some employers toward ex-felons may be short-lived.
Last year, Kristy Littauer, a branch manager of the Manpower recruitment agency in Long Beach, Calif., spent time at the Los Angles County Jail, advising inmates on job-searching techniques. At the time, a soaring economy and low unemployment made the prospect of finding a job more promising.
Now though, she and others say, placing a former offender in any job is considered an achievement. "The best shot with a criminal record is light industrial and sometimes clerical jobs," Ms. Littauer said. "But they're always difficult to place."
It helps if your new boss was once in the same position you are. Maurice Foster, 35, a former drug dealer who ended a two-year jail term for drug dealing in September, was hired as a technician at Oil Changers after meeting Mr. Redden, the manager who once did time for armed robbery, at the San Francisco job fair.
Mr. Foster also has a second job as a forklift operator. His combined income pales beside the $2,000 he said he sometimes made in a single day in his drug-dealing past, and sometimes he has trouble making ends meet. But he said he was grateful for the chance to support his wife and three children legally.
"My record does make it difficult to get higher paying jobs, but I expect that," he said. "It's a company's prerogative. I try not to let it get me down. There are thousands of jobs out there."

HEADLINE: Pope Urges World to 'Save the Children' Affected by Conflicts 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: VATICAN CITY, Dec. 25 

 BODY:
Pope John Paul II turned his thoughts at Christmas to children -- Palestinian, Israeli, American, Afghan and African -- declaring that humanity's hope depends on helping them.
 In his traditional message "Urbi et Orbi," or "To the City and to the World," the pope said: "Day after day, I bear in my heart the tragic problems of the Holy Land. Every day I think with anxiety of all those who are dying of cold and hunger. 
 "Every day there reaches me the desperate cry of those who, in so many parts of the world, call for a fairer distribution of resources and for gainful employment for all."
With only a few hours rest after celebrating midnight Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, the pope, who is 81, appeared tired today when he spoke from the basilica's central balcony.
He sat while reading his message and had to be helped to his feet. The words of his blessing sometimes were almost unintelligible, and after he finished, he slumped quickly back into the chair.
Because his age and frailness, John Paul several years ago stopped celebrating Christmas Day Mass in the basilica.
"Today my thoughts go to all the children of the world: so many, too many, are the children condemned from birth to suffer through no fault of their own the effects of cruel conflicts," he said, his voice trembling. "Let us save the children, in order to save the hope of humanity."
In the baby Jesus, he said, there is "the face of every little child who is born, of whatever race or nation: the little Palestinian and the little Israeli; the little American and the little Afghan; the child of the Hutu and the child of the Tutsi" in Rwanda and Burundi, African nations devastated by ethnic fighting.
The pope made no direct reference to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks or to the American bombing of Afghanistan. But he said the new millennium began with much hope "but is now threatened by dark clouds of violence and war."
He also prayed that "God's holy name never be used as a justification for hatred -- let it never be used as an excuse for intolerance and violence."
The pope has said in recent speeches that nothing can justify terrorism. The Vatican has indicated that a "just war" may be waged to stop terrorist attacks but has also said innocent people must be spared any harm. Leading Roman Catholic bishops have also decried the poverty that is often the environment for terrorist groups.
The pope said many people were hoping "for a new humanity united not just by economic interests but by the unceasing effort to bring about a society that is more just and supportive."
John Paul, who has called leaders of other religions to join in prayers for peace in Assisi, the birthplace of St. Francis, on Jan. 24, praised those who work for dialogue between cultures and religions, "sometimes in the face of opposition."
The pope also recited Christmas greetings in 60 languages.
Italian newspapers had been reporting that a papal appearance in a crowded St. Peter's Square during the holidays could be a target of terrorists.
Clusters of police officers dotted the square, and plainclothes officers reportedly mingled with the tens of thousands who turned out on a chilly, sunny day for the pope's noon speech.
X-ray machines and metal detectors, used at the Vatican during the 1999-2000 Holy Year, were employed to check those arriving. Police helicopters also flew over Rome.

HEADLINE: Fallout of U.S. Recession Drifts South Into Mexico; 
Jobs Are Scarce And the Outlook Becomes Dismal

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico 

 BODY:
Workdays have begun to feel like weekends in the shanty communities at the edge of this industrial city across the border from El Paso.
 Just after 10 a.m. on a recent Wednesday, the sounds of hammers and saws filled the air. With work scarce at many factories, some men and women labored instead on improvements to their tumbledown houses, made from old tires and scraps of metal and wood. 
 While waiting for a coat of tar to dry on his roof, Hector Holguin, a 40-year-old machine operator, clipped the errant edges of his stylish goatee. Jorge Ibarra, a 29-year-old factory worker, had finished fixing his own leaky roof and was boiling water for his children's bath. And Erica Rosalba Aguilar, another factory worker, was hanging laundry in her front yard of tumbleweeds and making dark predictions for the future. 
"The situation has become very critical," she said. "Most of us came here because there were always new jobs. But now the maquiladoras are firing a lot of people. Some have totally closed down."
The border region, once a powerful economic engine for Mexico, has begun to sputter. Recession in the United States has forced assembly lines that manufacture everything from televisions and auto parts to blue jeans and toys to cut production and reduce their work forces significantly for the first time in two decades. Like Ms. Aguilar, some 200,000 workers at these export-oriented plants, known as maquiladoras, have lost their jobs.
Moreover, even after a recovery begins in the broader North American economy, this region may never be the same, many analysts argue, because the 2,000-mile border is pricing itself out of the low-skill manufacturing market. After more than a decade of expansion, 97 maquiladoras have shut down so far this year, according to information released recently by the government's statistics agency. At least 70 of those closings occurred near the border.
And while Mexican officials would like to encourage the development of low-wage factories in the far south of the country, the loss of jobs along the border is expected to increase emigration to the United States instead.
Permanent, not just fleeting, changes are being wrought because low-skilled workers on Mexico's northern border are no longer as cheap as in other parts of Latin America and some places in Asia. The employment erosion, under way before Sept. 11, has sped up since then.
"The deceleration in the economy has affected the border more than any other part of the country," President Vicente Fox of Mexico said in an interview in Mexico City.
In the last several years, the competition for workers had forced employers to increase wages at a faster pace than inflation, lifting real incomes. But those gains are now haunting some of the industries that first located here.
"Unskilled jobs are now cheaper in other regions of the world," said Juan Pablo Fuentes, an economist at the consulting firm DRI-WEFA in the Philadelphia suburb of Eddystone. "Even after the U.S. economy improves, and the demand picks up, it will be cheaper for manufacturers to produce in other countries."
Factory managers were reluctant to talk publicly about their plans. But industry analysts said that simple math makes the choices ahead of them clear. The average take-home pay for entry-level, unskilled maquiladora workers is $4 to $5 a day, less than what American workers in similar jobs would earn in an hour. Maquiladora employers also pay for transportation and meals. They pay the government a certain amount per worker for day care, housing and health care, too, effectively raising average wages to $2 or $3 an hour.
The problem is that those figures are far higher than average wages for low-skilled factory workers in El Salvador, where owners pay an average $1.59 an hour; the Dominican Republic, where it is about $1.53; Indonesia, about $1.19; and China, about 43 cents, according to John Christman at the Ciemex-WEFA consulting service, also at Eddystone. And although many factories here are more productive and it is easier to ship goods across the border than across an ocean, lower labor costs and declining expenses for ocean freight have begun to nullify this advantage.
Mr. Christman, director of the Maquiladora Industry Service at Ciemex-WEFA, said that high-technology plants would probably remain on the border because they are much more productive, their owners have made significant investments to build modern facilities, and they have gone out of their way to train Mexican engineers, computer technicians and machine operators.
"The only companies that are operating successfully on the border are high-tech plants," Mr. Christman said. "The low-skilled plants are either going to move inland or leave Mexico."
While Mexico continues to attract new factories, a substantial loss of maquiladoras would be a serious blow to the country. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994, the factories have become a leading source of jobs and money. In Ciudad Juarez alone, factories created at least 40,000 new jobs last year, and in 1999 they helped the city reap some $1.4 billion in direct federal taxes.
Over all, the industry generates $60 billion a year in exports. The factories -- many of them owned by Fortune 500 companies like Alcoa, Delphi Automotive Systems and General Electric -- also pay more than $400 million a year in corporate taxes to Mexico, about 2.5 percent of the central government's total revenue, and an additional $1.3 billion in social security taxes.
Industry representatives protested strongly against a provision of Nafta that went into effect this year -- viewed by some analysts as a direct attempt to kill Mexico's maquiladora industry -- that requires manufacturers to pay duties on parts and components that originate in non-Nafta nations.
President Fox has responded by offering maquiladora owners new tax incentives to offset those new duties. In the interview, the president said that he had recently met with maquiladora representatives and "resolved their tax issues," although a couple of industry analysts said the tax plans would depend on whether Congress supports Mr. Fox's fiscal policy overhaul.
A former corporate executive with a clear understanding of the bottom line, Mr. Fox acknowledged that the northern border had become an expensive place to produce textiles and toys. And he is urging factories with low-skill workers to move south.
"In southern Mexico, we are establishing the same conditions as Guatemala or China," he said, putting on his former salesman's voice. "Maquiladoras do not have to leave Mexico. We can offer them the same level of competitiveness."
Indeed, southern Mexico is very similar to Central America. It is the most impoverished region of the country. Its largely indigenous communities have the highest illiteracy and malnutrition rates. Many communities are torn by family feuds. And there is limited infrastructure -- including water systems, airports, and multilane highways.
In a kind of chicken-egg debate, manufacturers have said they would be more interested in moving to southern Mexico if the government would buildup the physical support system. Government officials, however, had hoped that cheaper wages would be enough to lure maquiladoras south, and that the factories would generate enough new revenue to pay for the improvements.
So far, the plan has delivered mixed results. Most new maquiladoras to open in Mexico over the last year are in states across the Mexican heartland, including Puebla and Queretaro. Five years ago, more than 90 percent of the maquiladoras in Mexico were on the northern border; today, about 60 percent are.
But Rolando Gonzalez, president of a trade association called Maquiladora Industry Export, said that of the dozens of plants to leave the border, he does not know of one that moved to southern Mexico.
"Instead of going south," he said, "they are going to China."
Meanwhile, signs of recession abound in Ciudad Juarez, which has some 300 manufacturing plants and the largest number of assembly-line workers on the border. The classified advertisements in El Diario de Juarez shrank from an average of 14 pages to four, according to an advertising director at the newspaper. Sunday classifieds have gone from 40 pages to 10. Artisan markets and liquor stores, once full of American shoppers, were empty on a couple of recent weekdays, with lonely merchants complaining that business had dropped in half.
And as layoffs continue, some 1.15 million maquiladora workers ponder their options. President Fox acknowledged that the constant increase in jobs along the border over the last couple of decades had served not only as a kind of magnet that drew hundreds of thousands of people to the border each year. It also served as a buffer that kept thousands of workers from emigrating to the United States.
But as that buffer shrinks, several laid-off workers said they were not interested in moving south. They had come north for jobs on the border. And if they could not find work on the Mexican side of the line, they said, they would move even farther north -- into the United States.
"I'll go out a few weeks to see if I can find work here," said Mr. Holguin, his goatee as straight as if he had just stepped out of a barbershop. Turning his sights to the arid hill that separates his neighborhood from the United States, he added, "If I don't find anything, I'll look over there."

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Offers Amnesty to Companies ThatAdmit Tax Indiscretions 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Tax shelters, many of them illegal, saved big companies at least $14.7 billion in federal income taxes last year, a senior Internal Revenue Service official said on Monday. Now all companies are being offered an amnesty in return for confessing their illegal tax avoidance. 
 The 95 companies that have already confessed their tax avoidance strategies to the I.R.S. this year shorted the government an amount equal to a dollar a week for every man, woman and child in America. 
 But the amount of tax burden that big companies shrugged off may be much larger because the 95 companies are a slice of the 1,700 large corporations that are prime customers for tax shelter promoters. 
"This may only be the tip of the iceberg," said Larry R. Langdon, the I.R.S. commissioner for midsize and large businesses. He said a survey of corporate income tax audits in October found 413 shelters that involve $16.2 billion of potential taxes. 
In a break from past practice, Mr. Langdon announced on Friday that companies that disclosed dubious tax shelters, and the promoters who sold them, by April 23 would not be charged the usual 20 percent penalty on taxes that were improperly avoided. 
"This is our Christmas present to big companies," he said. "We're going to determine who's naughty and who's nice" by waiving the 20 percent penalty for those who are nice to the I.R.S. 
Mr. Langdon said that in the first 11 months, under new regulations, companies voluntarily disclosed 72 illegal tax shelters, 41 percent more than the 51 disclosures in 2000. These shelters, prohibited by Treasury regulations, saved the 95 companies that confessed $4.4 billion in taxes in 2000. In 1999, companies admitted saving $3.7 billion through prohibited tax shelter deals.
In addition this year, companies disclosed 200 other questionable shelters that saved an additional $9.7 billion in taxes last year. Some of those shelters ultimately may be approved in I.R.S. audits as aggressive but legal tax planning.
Mr. Langdon said he was frustrated at the need to assign many of his auditors to ferret out dubious tax shelters, which can be easily missed in the stacks of accounting records that big companies attach to their returns. And, he said, it is unfair that some companies that are caught must pay their taxes, plus interest and the 20 percent penalty, while those that elude detection benefit from their misconduct. 
Companies that acknowledge using tax shelters would still owe any taxes that were improperly avoided, as well as interest.
Companies that disclose can pay or they can sue the I.R.S., hoping to persuade a judge that the tax savings were a byproduct of legitimate business transactions. Tax planning to reduce taxes as a byproduct of legitimate transactions is legal, while transactions done solely to reduce taxes are illegal. 
Mr. Langdon said he hoped that the penalty waiver was a big enough incentive to prompt universal confession. The waiver is worth as much as $2.9 billion to the 95 companies that have already confessed to the I.R.S. Companies that do come in must identify the promoter who crafted the plan to qualify for the penalty waiver. 
The I.R.S. has identified 28 tax shelter promoters so far, according to an I.R.S. document that was used for a briefing of senior Treasury tax policy officials on Dec. 18 about the corporate tax shelter problem. Seven promoters are accounting firms and seven are brokerage houses. The other 14 were not characterized. 
Tax shelter promoters are required to maintain lists of customers and to disclose those to the I.R.S. Because of the promoter disclosure provisions, companies that do not come forward face an almost certain prospect of being found out and then being forced to pay the 20 percent penalty on top of the taxes owed and the interest. 
The new I.R.S. data provide strong support for the warning by Lawrence H. Summers in February 2000, when he was Treasury secretary, that illegal corporate tax shelters were costing taxpayers at least $10 billion a year. He said illegal corporate tax avoidance "may be the most serious compliance issue threatening the American tax system today."
In the late 1990's, the share of corporate profits reported to shareholders that was taxed by the government declined. Even after taking into account the favorable tax treatment of employee stock options, the share of profits that was taxed fell, several studies have shown, raising questions about how much of the decline was the result of illegal tax shelters. 
The new I.R.S. data provides some evidence that the use of illegal tax-avoidance techniques is common at many large corporations. 
The new I.R.S. data also comes as the Bush administration is seeking to give more than $200 billion in tax breaks to corporations over three years as part of an economic stimulus package. The measure is dead for this year because of opposition by Senate Democrats to other provisions, but reducing corporate taxes is a goal of the Bush administration and has generally been accepted by both parties in the last year. 
Closing tax shelters not only costs money for auditors but also for litigation, which typically continues for more than a decade and costs the government and shareholders. 
Illegal corporate tax shelters involve transactions that have no economic significance but create the appearance of legitimate expenses that can be deducted. Some of these deals involve trading stocks at prearranged prices to take advantage of differing tax rules in different countries. Another technique involves temporarily swapping ownership interests within partnerships to take advantage of accounting rules on deferring income. 
Many of the techniques are so sophisticated that they can easily be disguised in the flow of billions of dollars each year through large corporations.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: REFUGEES; 
As Afghans Return Home, Need for Food Intensifies

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan, Dec. 25 

 BODY:
Thousands of refugees have begun returning to northern Afghanistan from Pakistan and Iran, often without even enough money to get home to their villages, and all the while disregarding the bleak winter that lies ahead.
 While the numbers are not yet overwhelming, aid officials warn that the return of tens of thousands of families to the areas that have been hardest hit by fighting, drought and poverty will ultimately intensify the need for aid at a time when the delivery of food remains blocked or woefully inadequate. 
 Today, Muhammad Qaim, 50, and his family climbed down from a bus after a four-day trip from Karachi, the Pakistan port city where they had sought refuge from the Taliban. 
"We came back because there is peace here now and but also because I ran out of money in Pakistan," Mr. Qaim said. He was borrowing money from a relative to finish the journey to his hometown, Shebarghan, still a two-hour drive away. 
Hundreds of thousands of people like Mr. Qaim left northern Afghanistan in recent years to find work and safety in neighboring Iran and Pakistan. Many fled the fighting or the repressive Taliban regime, which was particularly harsh on the ethnic minorities in the north of Afghanistan. 
But most fled poverty, as the drought ate away their savings and cut into jobs and livelihoods. They swelled the Afghan refugee population in Pakistan to more than two million and in Iran to 1.5 million.
In the past four days, more than 1,000 refugees have arrived from Pakistan in 83 minibuses and trucks at the bus station in Mazar-i-Sharif, said the supervisor of the station, Amidullah Popal. Most said they were returning because they had lost their jobs in Pakistan. Others complained that they had encountered increasing police harassment or violence by Pakistanis, especially in the border regions, where many residents supported the Taliban and had lost relatives who had fought on the side of the Taliban.
Mr. Qaim said he was working as a clothes packer in Karachi but was laid off a month ago, so he decided to come home. "The main reason is there is no work," he said. "People have used up all their money. Most people had to borrow money for the journey."
But he also said Karachi had become dangerous. "During the U.S. bombing, the Pakistanis changed their attitude towards the Afghan people," he said. "They have never liked us northerners, they say we are not Muslim."
Those returning to Afghanistan could also face harsh treatment on several fronts. Mr. Qaim hopes to return to a state-owned store and regain his job there, which he lost under the Taliban. But others will return to looted or damaged homes, and may join the vast masses of unemployed in an economy crippled by war and uncertainty. 
Sitting in a teahouse during a truck stop, Abdul Salam, 32, said his house had been destroyed and he would have to live with relatives in his village, in the far northwest, near the Turkmenistan border. 
"What will I do? I don't know," he answered himself. "I hope to borrow money to fix my house." He and many people in his village, where carpet weaving is the main source of income, had been hurt by the collapse of the market since American forces began bombing Afghanistan.
Ghulam Haidar, 21, spent two years in Peshawar, Pakistan, washing carpets for an Afghan company, but lost his job after Sept. 11. Back home now, he is philosophical. "Here I am jobless, but when my country is peaceful, why should I stay in another country?" he said.
But the returning Afghans will stretch already thin resources. In many villages, people have only enough wheat to last them a few months, and few residents have seed grain to sow a new crop in the spring.
Afghanistan already has nearly one million displaced people, who fled their homes because of war or drought and are living a precarious existence in camps or in overcrowded houses with relatives. Northern Afghanistan, and in particular the provinces west of Mazar-i-Sharif, have been the hardest hit by the drought.
"They are coming back and they need all sorts of assistance," said Vladimir Smoljan, who works with the United Nations refugee agency in Mazar-i-Sharif, "food, nonfood items, shelter and quick-start projects." He said his agency, which only recently came back to Mazar-i-Sharif after being forced out by the Taliban, did not know how many refugees had recently returned and was trying to assess the impact. 
A system for distributing food is still not in place, and aid agencies are increasingly concerned that more people will flood into the cities in search of food and aid. 
United Nations officials said that despite the recent opening of a border crossing with Uzbekistan, the route remains effectively closed to food trucks. The International Committee of the Red Cross says it is the only agency making widespread aid distributions to the displaced people in local camps.
"We have to take care about the population and its capacity to absorb the returning refugees," warned Malik Allaouna, who heads Doctors Without Borders in Mazar-i-Sharif. "People have been sharing their food already with relatives, and we are concerned how to reach those people in need."

A Muted Christmas, Corporate Obligations, the Anthrax Mystery

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
Fifteen weeks have passed since terrorists took down the twin towers. Holidays have come and gone, none more poignant than this first Christmas in a changed world, a changed city, where no amount of tinsel can replace the sparkle of nearly 3,000 lost lives. But hesitantly, reluctantly, inevitably people are inching toward more normal lives, groping for wisdom and perspective.
 HOW TO PROVIDE -- Peace will come slowly, if at all, to the widows and widowers of 9/11 and to their employers, grappling with questions of corporate responsibility that are not answered in business-school text books. Take Marsh & McLennan, which lost 295 of 1,900 employees working in the World Trade Center. Like Cantor Fitzgerald before it, Marsh is now the focus of angry survivors. The fury engendered by its evolving compensation plans -- how long will families get health insurance coverage and who will pay for it? -- suggests that there are no easy or right answers when it comes to meeting expectations of the bereaved while remaining mindful of long-term financial consequences. 
 Marsh may arrive at a solution that satisfies embittered spouses of employees. But there will be no end to similar battles over the distributions of charitable donations, the treatment of civilian versus uniformed victims, the choice between accepting formulaic settlements or risking litigation. 
WHEN TO LET GO -- The hordes of people who once lined West Street, waving banners of gratitude to the rescue workers at ground zero, have dwindled to a dozen or so regulars, who have staked out a traffic island at Christopher Street, known as "Point Thank You." 
Once, the crowds here were five deep. Once, convoys of military, police and rescue vehicles rumbled through the barricaded thoroughfare. These days, the road is open to traffic, the ambulances and Humvees are rare and most of the residents have returned to their daily lives. 
That change is a vivid sign of progress and also an occasion for gnawing regret. Yes, New Yorkers say, we want to laugh, work, sing. But how hard it is to abandon a collective mission of mercy, to stop bearing witness. 
ADMITTING IGNORANCE -- Other than searching vainly for Osama bin Laden, nothing has frustrated Americans as much as the unsolved mystery of this fall's anthrax outbreak, which infected 18 people and killed 5 others. And if ordinary Americans are frustrated, imagine the anguish of the nation's medical detectives at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, caught flat-footed time and again. 
From the first clue -- a blister on the finger of a New York Post employee, Johanna Huden, to the death of a 94-year-old Connecticut widow, Ottilie Lundgren -- the regretful refrain of America's public health establishment has been "no one knew." 
No one knew what skin anthrax looked like. No one knew that deadly inhalation anthrax could, in fact, be cured if diagnosed quickly. No one knew how many spores it took to kill. No one knew that postal workers were at risk. No one knew that even sealed envelopes were vectors of disease. No one knew that one unopened letter could contaminate another. No one knew the risk-benefit ratio of using the anthrax vaccine. 
But worst of all, no one seemed willing to admit ignorance. "It's time for us to stop needing to say we know and let people know what we don't know," said Dr. Ivan C. A. Walker, Washington's health commissioner. "Because if we don't do that they won't believe us when we come and say we know stuff, and that's critical." 
ADDRESSING THE NATION -- Groping along with his constituents is President Bush, who speaks to the nation next month in his State of the Union address at a time of war, terror alerts and economic uncertainty. Mr. Bush has instructed his aides that he will not tolerate discussions of politics and has no interest in his poll numbers. But that in itself factors in political considerations -- the wartime president above the partisan fray.
These days, the most consuming debate in the White House, recently joined by Mr. Bush himself, is how to structure the State of the Union. The speech will be the president's first opportunity since before the bombing of Afghanistan, when he addressed a joint session of Congress, to lay out his agenda to the American people. That earlier speech before Congress vaulted Mr. Bush's approval ratings into the stratosphere, where they have remained for three months. JANE GROSS

HEADLINE: From the Pulpit, Christmas Messages 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from sermons on Christmas Eve and Christmas: 

Broadway Presbyterian Church
Manhattan
The Rev. Walter B. Tennyson:
 In the early part of this century, before the Weather Channel and before long-range forecasting, a hurricane hit the northeastern United States, to many people's surprise. Many people had never lived through a hurricane before. One eyewitness told a Philadelphia newspaper that the gathering clouds were inky dark. The winds became violent and swept up everything in their path. Parts of whole buildings began to fly through the air. It seemed as though all hell were breaking loose in this surprise storm. 
 Just as suddenly, this eyewitness reported, a kind of calm began to break out. The sun even appeared through some patches in the clouds, and soon, perhaps within 15 minutes, the sky was completely clear. Just as suddenly as it had all begun, it began again. Skies on the back side of that hurricane's eye wall turned inky dark. The winds again swept up everything in their path. The wind blew pieces of roofs, of barns, leaves and anything that wasn't tied down loose. The eyewitness told that newspaper reporter, though, if not for that calm, those few moments of calm in the eye of the storm, when all was calm and all was bright, he might just have had a breakdown before that storm was over.
Interesting in that month of September that this man chose these words, "all was calm, all was bright," to describe the eye of the hurricane. As we sit here on Christmas Eve 2001, in this city, I suspect many of you know what it is like to come to this place, to come to this service, from a storm. All of us come from the storms and hectic nature of our lives. Anyone who lives in this city, anyone in this nation, indeed anyone who inhabits this planet this year, has been through a storm. If you were down there that day, you remember, you will never forget the inky dark clouds, the pieces of buildings flying through the air, the sense that all hell was breaking loose. Here tonight, all is calm, all is bright. 

St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church
Park Slope, Brooklyn
The Rev. Joseph Diele:
Sometimes I think when we look at the gospel story of God being born in humanity, it's too much for us. It's amazing to think that God could become one of us, it's a little distant. . . .
Let's imagine . . . when Mary and Joseph get to Bethlehem from Nazareth, there are wall-to-wall people. It's crowded. Imagine Fifth Avenue at 5 p.m. They need to find an inn, not like a Motel 6, but imagine this church without walls, a fort, with no privacy. . . . What they find is a cave with animals around it, animals help keep them warm. . . . This was not an ideal birthing room, and it was cold in Palestine. But by blood and water God became one of us. We've pushed the story so far from us. But God is where you and I are. God is where you and I are.

Washington National Cathedral
Washington
The Very Rev. Nathan D. Baxter:
There is no evidence that from their visit these Wise Men became either Jewish converts or embraced a faith in Jesus as their own Messiah. Is this not the universal prayer offered for the world, for children and their families, by people of peace and good will, no matter what their religion? . . . If there is anything we have learned in the years since the birth of Christ, it is that there is not world peace without peace among the religions.

Concord Baptist Church of Christ
Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn
The Rev. Gary V. Simpson:
In this season of expectation, we need now something lasting. Much of what we do in the holidays is transitory. The trees will droop and die or be packed into their bags. Lights will be at least turned off if not taken down. All of this temporary. At the next holiday, it will have been forgotten. . . . Where does hope come from? Sandwiched between the threat of an unholy alliance and an economic recession, hope springs forth with the promise of a messiah.
Behold, a virgin shall conceive and his name shall be called Emmanuel, God With Us. We find hope in our most trying times because God is with us. We feel power despite our weakness because God is with us. We have strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow. God is with us. 

Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Church
Forest Hills, Queens
Msgr. Joseph Funaro:
Christmas is a time for us to let the light of Christ shine within us and fill us with hope. The angel tells us that we should not be scared: "Do not be afraid." If we can hold on to that, take that lesson we celebrate today out with us throughout the year, we will prevail. When there is much darkness in our world, we have to remember the message of the angel -- "do not be afraid."
We are faced with many fears in this world -- tyranny, hate, so much in the world that could harm us. We here know that. We here in this city know this all too well. But if we hold on to the light of Christmas, the light of hope, that light will shine through it all. And we won't have to be afraid. 
It is important for us to keep the light of Christmas throughout the year, not just today, not just during the holiday season, but every day of the year. Not many people know how to do this, but we must learn, because the light shines throughout the year.

HEADLINE: China's Efforts Against Crime Make No Dent 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: TAIGU, China 

 BODY:
On his last night alive, Chang Dongqing responded to an emergency call about an armed robbery in progress near the police station here where he worked. Because another officer had checked out the station's only gun, a 1954 series, .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, Officer Chang picked up the long iron rod that was the station's only other weapon.
 Less than an hour later, he was dead, killed by a shotgun blast to the heart. 
 "My husband had a glorious job," his wife, Han Xuehong, her face drawn, her eyes apprehensive and sad, said as she talked recently at the police station here about how she has coped since he died in May. 
Officer Chang is one of hundreds of policemen who have died in the line of duty since April, when China declared its latest "Strike Hard" campaign, a period of frenzied police activity meant to cow criminals and reassure the populace that the government is keeping crime in check. 
He was part of China's figurative thin gray line. Like the thin blue line of the police in the United States, it is meant to hold society's criminals back from law-abiding citizens, only this one is far thinner. 
In fact, China is one of the most sparsely policed countries in the world. Not only are there few police officers per capita here, but also as a matter of policy few of them carry guns, making them vulnerable to the country's increasingly well-armed criminals, like the highway robbers that shot Officer Chang. 
To hold the line against crime, the government relies on draconian campaigns that periodically sweep up tens of thousands of suspects, rush them through abbreviated trials and send thousands of them to death -- regardless of the likelihood that some are innocent. 
Though the official number of those executed is a closely guarded government secret, this year alone more than 5,000 people are believed to have been put to death. They include the two men involved in Officer Chang's death.
The periodic crackdowns have become the policing strategy of choice for a Chinese government lacking the reach and resources to provide more police officers who are both better armed and better trained. 
But while tens of thousands of people have been executed since the country's first nationwide campaign in 1983, Chinese academics say government statistics show that the Strike Hard campaigns have no lasting impact on crime, belying the effectiveness of a policing strategy whose central feature is forced confessions and death.
The anticrime drives invigorate and define the darkest corner of China's formidable system of social control, a corner, largely unseen by the broader population, where police brutality is tolerated, even encouraged. For the vast majority of Chinese, the campaigns are reassuring and right. But for others, they bring terror and despair. 
With an average of six policemen for every 10,000 residents -- a quarter the ratio in the United States -- China relies on its citizens, particularly Communist Party neighborhood committees, to act as watchdogs against crime. 
Local police forces operate on shoestring budgets, which they supplement during normal periods with money collected through fines imposed for a wide range of illegal behavior.

Corruption Aids Criminals
But the line between fines and payments by criminals for protection from prosecution is easily blurred in a country where the political system has remained closed even as the economy has opened. 
Emboldened by such protection, criminals in many parts of the country have been able to take revenge on witnesses and informants with impunity. 
The government fears that people will be afraid to report on suspected felons and that the citizen network will break down, leaving the police overwhelmed. 
"When the press talks about the campaigns 'puncturing the puffed up arrogance of the criminals,' they are trying to reassure the populace that the police are in control," says Murray Scot Tanner, an associate professor of political science at Western Michigan University who has written extensively on China's anticrime drives. 
In many ways, Officer Chang was as much a victim of this understaffed, underfinanced police force and the campaign-style policing on which it depends as he was of crime. 
When the station received the call from the county's emergency dispatcher, Officer Chang raced to the scene and found the victim along the roadside, but the robbers were nowhere to be seen. His bosses say his job was to give emergency assistance to the victim and secure the crime scene for investigators who were on their way. But he was intent on doing more. 
He parked his unmarked car on the stretch of road where the robbery had taken place and opened the hood, feigning engine trouble. The robbery victim waited with him at the front of the car, while a part-time employee from the police station stood guard at the back. It was not long before they spotted two crouching figures who ran toward the car from a ditch beside the road. The robbers had apparently returned. 
Officer Chang stepped around the front and swung the iron rod he had take from the station house. One of the masked men fired a shotgun, hitting him in the arm. Officer Chang swung again, and the man fired the gun's second barrel into his chest. He died in the car on the way to the hospital. 
It is not clear that the Strike Hard campaign, which had begun a month earlier and was then at full pitch, pushed Officer Chang to take unreasonable risks, but the campaigns do put pressure on police officers to make arrests and close cases quickly in an environment of fervid competition. 
Like everywhere in China, Taigu's police chief is appointed by local Communist Party officials whose careers depend on how well their area performs during such politically directed campaigns. Many police stations are given arrest and conviction targets that they are expected to meet.
"The central government does not set quotas, but county-level officials do," says Liu Renwen, a lawyer who studies the campaigns at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Law in Beijing.
When asked whether the spirit of Strike Hard helped drive Officer Chang beyond the call of duty, the local deputy police chief did not hesitate. "Undoubtedly!" he replied.
Hu Xiaoguang, who had come from the Shanxi Public Security Department in the provincial capital to oversee a reporter's meeting with the slain officer's wife, said, "There's a strong sense of pride between provinces, and we compare ourselves to each other."
The percentage of policemen killed in the line of duty in China, already several times higher than the United States and as many as 10 times the rate during the Mao era, has surged during the current campaign. 
Presenting a looming challenge to the authorities, criminals in China are increasingly well-armed with guns either smuggled from Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries or manufactured in illegal factories at home. But China remains reluctant to arm its poorly educated, poorly paid police force, fearing more guns in its hands would lead to a rise in extrajudicial killings and other crimes by policemen with ties to local mafias. There is also concern that police officers could side with their communities against the central authorities in cases of local unrest.
Instead, weapons are reserved for the People's Armed Police, a national paramilitary force charged with guarding government offices, patrolling its borders and quelling riots or uprisings. Even counting the People's Armed Police, the number of police officers per capita is still only half that of the United States. The regular military does not ordinarily involve itself in routine police matters.

First Crackdown by Deng
The late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who steered the country into a social and economic transformation that continues today, called for the first Strike Hard campaign in 1983 to reassert government control over society as the pervasive network of party members and zealous resident committees began to lose its grip over the country's vast and increasingly mobile population.
At that time, droves of convicts were executed in cities across the country, often dozens in a single city in a single day. Scholars estimate that during the three years of the campaign, more than 30,000 people were sentenced to death.
Since then, there have been dozens of local and regional campaigns, sending judicial executions to annual levels that far exceed even those during the three centuries of the Ching dynasty. This year's is the third national campaign, following one in 1996.
Many people in China argue that the threat of severe punishment and the likelihood of arrest during Strike Hard campaigns keeps would-be criminals in line. But government statistics studied by Chinese academics suggest that career criminals have learned to lie low until the campaigns are over and the police, worn out, relax back into old patterns.
Almost immediately after the 1996 campaign ended, criminal cases began to climb, and by September 1997, monthly crime rates were back where they had been when the campaign began, according to Mr. Liu, the lawyer who studies the campaigns. 
"The same will happen after this campaign," he said. "If you expect the crime rate to go down after such a campaign, it won't work. Crimes have social causes."
The campaigns often result in abuses of power, particularly in forcing confessions from suspects in order to satisfy the bureaucracy's statistical hunger.

Torture and Conviction
In a private room of a hotel restaurant in Dashiqiao, the gray northeastern industrial town in which he was born, Li Huawei, 38, pulls aside the thick black hair atop his head to reveal a hairless divot left in his scalp by a policeman's truncheon. It is an enduring reminder of the three days of torture that ruined his life. 
Mr. Li had returned home from work on a cold afternoon in October 1986 to find his 21-year-old wife dead, her head nearly severed by a butcher knife. He briefly held her in his arms and then rushed to find help.
Almost three months later, at the end of the country's first major Strike Hard campaign, he was suddenly seized, handcuffed and taken to the local police station. Wang Chengyou, the local police chief at the time and now a judge, told a Liaoning newspaper this year that the police had arrested Mr. Li because "the case needed to be solved by the end of the year." 
He was made to stand for hours while he was interrogated. "When I wouldn't confess, they made me lean my head against the wall with my hands cuffed behind me," Mr. Li said, demonstrating how he was forced to stand two feet from the wall so that much of his weight was concentrated on his head. He said sweat ran from his face and puddled beneath him despite the winter cold in the room.
Occasionally, when he was on the verge of collapse, the police would allow him to sit, handcuffed to a chair, and his interrogation would begin again. 
Finally, in the middle of the third night, when he could bear it no longer, he pushed away from the wall to stand up. He was immediately felled by the crack of a truncheon that left him dazed on the ground.
Such police behavior is nominally illegal in China but widely tolerated because prosecutions here have long relied more on confessions than on physical evidence. The use of DNA analysis to solve crimes, for instance, is still extremely rare.
"As far as we can tell, confessions from torture spike higher during anticrime campaigns as lower level officials are compelled to generate criminals on short notice," says Mr. Tanner, the scholar.
According to a report by the Supreme People's Procuracy, torture cases surged to their highest level in six years during the 1996 Strike Hard campaign.
When Mr. Li had recovered from the blow, the chief investigator threatened him again, telling him that his mother had testified that he had confessed to her and that if he did not confess, his family would be arrested as accomplices to the crime. Not having slept for three days and allowed to eat only some bread and soup during that time, he decided that he should at least save his family if he could not save himself.
"I decided this was my fate," Mr. Li recalled, "and to live had no meaning. My family was already broken, my wife dead, and if I confessed, nothing more would happen to my family."
He sat, dispirited, answering "yes" to the investigator's account of how Mr. Li had stabbed his pregnant wife and sliced at his unborn child. He was then sent to a detention center, where his feet were locked into 10-pound shackles for the next three years.
Mr. Li was found guilty and sentenced to death in late 1989, even though the police had found fingerprints on the knife and a footprint on a bedsheet in the room clear enough to identify the brand of shoe, neither of which matched those of Mr. Li. As tacit acknowledgment that the case against him was flawed, the court suspended his sentence for two years, a reprieve that normally means the sentence will later be commuted to life in prison.
Then, in July 2000, a man arrested for a separate murder confessed to killing Mr. Li's wife. He had been a 17-year-old high school student living next door to Mr. Li at the time. The man's fingerprints matched those still on file from the knife used to kill Mr. Li's wife. 
It took eight months more before Mr. Li was released on bail. He will not have a chance to clear his name until after his wife's murderer is executed, as is expected sometime in the next few months.
Despite such cases, suggestions that innocent people are being sentenced to death in the current Strike Hard campaign leave many people unmoved, particularly given the absence of public debate in the state-controlled news media. Most Chinese are more concerned with seizing new economic opportunities than reflecting on possible injustices.
"I think there are very, very few cases of innocent people who are executed, and, anyway, that's better than letting some criminals get away to harm other people," said Li Boyu, a 19-year-old college student sipping a cup of tea at a fashionable cafe in the university district of Shanghai. "In China, the interests of the nation or the community are always more important than the interests of the individual."
On the contrary, she says, there are cases, like corruption and embezzlement, in which people have been given life imprisonment when she thought they deserved the death penalty.
"They are the termites of society," she says, her voice soft and high. "They deserve the death penalty."
Such conservative sentiments are easy to find in China, where there is a deep, historically linked fear of social chaos and a Confucian yearning for governance by a strong central authority. The sentiments are not surprising in a country where the vast majority of people are undereducated and poor and represent a latent threat to order. Ms. Li (no relation to Mr. Li) says her greatest concern about safety, in fact, is the tides of migrant workers that flow from the countryside into the cities and are blamed for much of China's crime.
For her and her peers, who have known only economic expansion, China is a country of opportunity, not oppression, and the Communist Party is responsible for having created the space in which they thrive. 
"If public security is good, ordinary people can live peacefully," she said, then cited an ancient Chinese adage: "Kill one to warn a hundred."

Workers Get More Bang for Their Bucks in Surprising Locations

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Where should police officers, registered nurses and truck drivers move if they want to earn a good living? Reno, Nev., might be a good choice. 
 Reno ranked No. 1 in the United States in pay for police officers and No. 2 for nurses and truck drivers, when calculated as a percentage of the average income in the city, according to an analysis of compensation data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 1999, the most recent available year. 
 Salinas, Calif., also did well, placing second and third, respectively, for police officers and registered nurses.
 For truck drivers, Reno was one of the few bright spots. In most places, the average hourly salary of truck drivers was less than the average for the area. In Rochester, for example, drivers earned an average of just 59 percent of the average for all workers. In Austin, Tex., drivers earned 61 percent, and in Los Angeles and Orange County, Calif., 69 percent. 
 Not surprising, computer programmers did well in technology hotbeds like San Francisco and North Carolina. But, reflecting the increased role of technology in recent years in the design and construction of automobiles, the most remunerative part of the country for them was Detroit and nearby cities.

HEADLINE: Japan Wants to Salvage Boat It Says Fired on Its Coast Guard 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
Japanese officials on Tuesday advocated salvaging a sunken boat believed to be from North Korea, a move that could give new insight into the electronic eavesdropping ability of that secretive nation.
 "Salvaging the sunken ship is technically possible," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said of the boat that went down Saturday night in the East China Sea after an intense firefight with the Japanese Coast Guard. "The area is outside Japan's territorial waters, so we should look into the situation carefully and salvage it if possible." 
 In the battle Saturday night, occupants of the mystery boat fired RPG-7 rockets, Soviet-era armaments that are often used as antitank weapons, Japanese Coast Guard officials have concluded. The officials say that at least two of the rockets flew over their ships, landing harmlessly in the water.
Although 12 Coast Guard vessels continued to search the area on Tuesday, the 90 pieces of debris recovered do not definitively identify the 100-ton ship as North Korean. Of the 15-member crew, only 2 bodies have been recovered, both wearing life jackets inscribed with Korean writing.
Japanese news media reported today that Japan's Defense Agency monitored radio communications last week from the mystery ship on a radio frequency used by North Korea's ruling Workers Party of Korea. Sankei Shimbun newspaper said the communications suggested that the ship was smuggling drugs. Kyodo News Service reported that Japanese defense officials focused on the ship after United States military satellites detected the unknown ship in Japanese waters on Dec. 18.
"I hope to salvage the sunken ship for investigations," Japan's land, infrastructure and transport minister, Chikage Ogi, said on Tuesday. "Unless we find out the nationality and the goals of the unidentified ship, we cannot take any steps."
The ship sank within waters claimed by China as its economic zone.
In Beijing on Tuesday, Zhang Qiyue, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said: "China is seriously concerned about the Japanese side employing arms while pursuing the boat, and about the fact that it sank in China's exclusive economic zone. We are requesting the Japanese side to brief us further on relevant situations. The Japanese side should fully respect China's rights, interests and concerns."
Kazuhiro Sugita, a Japanese deputy chief cabinet secretary, recognized China's authority at the site of the sunken boat, saying, "There are options such as salvaging the ship or sending divers, but we would need the consent of China."
Three days after the sinking, North Korea has remained silent on the episode.
Japanese public opinion seems to be hardening against North Korea. Over the last two days, Japanese television has shown videos taken by the Coast Guard of the intruder ship firing rockets, and of bullets slamming into Japanese ships.
Much of the tension comes from widespread suspicions that in the past North Korean boats have delivered drugs to Japan and have taken to North Korea about 10 Japanese citizens kidnapped from beaches.
On Tuesday, the Coast Guard quickly mobilized a search party of 10 boats and 9 airplanes to respond to a Japanese fisherman's report an unidentified boat off a section of coast directly across the Japan Sea from North Korea. This mystery vessel now appears to have been a Japanese fishing boat.

Magnet School in Westchester

BYLINE:  By Merri Rosenberg 

 BODY:
 A magnet high school open to students from three Westchester County school districts will begin classes at the State University of New York's Purchase campus at the end of January. The high school, known as the Westchester Magnet Academy, hopes to bring together students from different ethnic and economic backgrounds who live in Irvington, Harrison and the Greenburgh Central Seven School District, based in Hartsdale. A major lure is Purchase College's intense arts courses and its professional faculty and studios. The magnet school, financed by a $2 million, three-year federal grant, is starting with 60 ninth graders and will add a grade successively until the current freshmen graduate. So far about three dozen students have applied.

HEADLINE: Law Firms Put Less Money Into Bonuses for Associates 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Last year it seemed as if New York law firms tripped over themselves to dole out unprecedented year-end bonuses to their high-billing associates. This year it is with grave reluctance and not much fanfare that they are paying out half, at most, of what they paid last year.
 First-year associates appear to be getting a bonus this year of up to $20,000, compared with $40,000 last year, according to an unofficial poll of several large firms that are usually industry bellwethers. The amount of the bonus increases by $5,000 for each year of experience, topping out at $50,000, down from last year's top level of $100,000. 
 The leader in setting bonuses this year was Cravath, Swaine & Moore. That firm has been matched by Sullivan & Cromwell, which kicked off a bonus competition among firms last year; Davis Polk & Wardwell; Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton; and several others.
The lower bonuses are evidence that although law firms are generally viewed as buffered against economic conditions by the different kinds of work they do -- when mergers slow down, bankruptcies usually pick up -- they are feeling the effect of a slowdown over the last year. (Bonuses at law firms are generally far smaller than those received by investment bankers and other Wall Street professionals, whose take-home pay may increase by 50 percent or more as a result of bonuses.)
The overall drop in bonuses "reflects the fact that last year was truly an extraordinary year, and we felt that associates were entitled because they contributed a lot to that," said one partner at a large firm. "This year will probably not be an extraordinary year," the partner added.
But there is still bonus competition. Partners at Davis Polk told their associates in October that the firm would not pay bonuses at all because of the economic slowdown, but they assured associates at the same time that the firm would continue its no-layoff policy. The move was widely viewed as an effort to forestall a costly bonus war, like the one that occurred last year.
At the last minute, the Davis Polk partners changed their minds. On Friday they informed lawyers that bonuses would be given after all. 
The pressure to pay bonuses is the result of the "constant competition among the firms for talent," said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University. "A bonus has both real and symbolic value," he said, explaining that besides their monetary value, bonuses symbolize both the willingness of partners to share the wealth with junior lawyers and the confidence of partners in the financial health of the firm.
"Every second- and third-year law student and every associate is watching to see who gets paid what," he added.
Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which is representing the Enron Corporation in its bankruptcy proceedings, will pay first-year associates up to $20,000, as will several other firms. It will also pay retention bonuses of $11,900 to $19,800, based on lawyers' seniority.
What is most disturbing to young lawyers in the world of big firms is the number and the size of some of the law firms that are paying less, even slightly less. Debevoise & Plimpton is paying both first- and second-year lawyers bonuses of $20,000, for example. The bonuses increase only for every two years of experience, rather than for every year.
At Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, whose $140,000 starting salaries are significantly higher than the $125,000 paid by other big firms, bonuses will much smaller, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000.

 Marsh & McLennan has decided to extend health coverage to the families for three years.

HEADLINE: In Tumultuous Year, Con Ed Basks in ItsQuiet Success 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
It was among the many small, improbable scenes in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks: A blue Consolidated Edison Inc. truck rushed down West Street toward the disaster site, an American flag streaming from its roof, and the roadside crowd, which had gathered to cheer firemen and police, shouted, "Yaay! Con Ed!"
 Con Ed is basking in a season of redemption. A company that New Yorkers love to hate -- their ire stoked by blackouts, accidents and monthly bills that persistently reflect some of the highest rates in the country -- has won a new measure of respect. 
 Politicians and regular New Yorkers applauded the utility for dispatching legions of workers to restore power to the wounded financial district in time for the reopening of the New York Stock Exchange less than a week after the attacks.
Investors who long shrugged off Con Ed have embraced it, happy to own a stock market wallflower. With Enron collapsing and the share prices of deregulated power companies like Dynegy and Calpine swinging wildly, Con Ed has been a safe harbor, its stock hovering just under $40 since mid-November. 
While other utilities charged off in new directions, Con Ed stuck to its core business of delivering power to homes and businesses. It did not seize on electricity deregulation to start building power plants all over the country, only to watch electricity prices fall. It did not develop a sizable power trading operation, only to be vulnerable to Enron's collapse.
Con Ed's glow is mainly in relative terms, and no one can say how long it will last. But even when it fades, Con Ed will probably not veer from its conservative track.
"The company is intentionally risk-averse," said Barry Abramson, senior utilities analyst at the investment bank UBS Warburg. "Not missing opportunities isn't the goal at Con Ed. The goal is to miss foul-ups."
When the World Trade Center was attacked, Con Ed scrambled to minimize damage to the grid downtown.
Dozens of Con Ed workers rushed to the World Trade Center after the first plane hit, along with Richard Morgan, a former company executive who was working as a consultant on emergency response. Mr. Morgan was there to help firefighters navigate the electrical system and to keep an eye on two Con Ed substations in Building 7 that were part of the financial district's electricity grid.
Mr. Morgan died in the towers' collapse, and the substations were destroyed. Since Sept. 11, Con Ed crews have jerry-rigged an above-ground electrical network that skirts the disaster site and powers the rest of Wall Street.
The company is now digging nearly seven miles of trenches through the financial district to create a permanent grid, which it expects to have operating by May. The substations were insured for about $70 million; Con Ed estimates that the work will cost a total of about $400 million. 
While that is not a crippling sum for a company that routinely spends more than $1 billion a year on capital improvements, Con Ed is appealing for government aid, which is being disbursed through a number of state agencies. It does not expect to be fully reimbursed, and would fill the gap with borrowing, said Hyman Schoenblum, vice president for corporate planning. 
Con Ed probably could get reasonable terms, because its debt is low and its balance sheet strong, Mr. Schoenblum and industry analysts concurred. In any event, the company would probably seek to recover the costs from ratepayers in 2005, when its prices for transmitting and distributing power will be re-negotiated with New York state regulators. For now, Con Ed expects that any rate increase would be small, and Mr. Schoenblum said that the company does not plan to ask for an emergency rate increase in the meantime.
The strong balance sheet that has allowed Con Ed to weather attack-related costs is a product of the company's entrenched conservatism. And that worldview, in turn, was shaped by several tumultuous decades of corporate history.
For a time, Con Ed lurched from one crisis to another: blackouts in 1965 and 1977, with a near-bankruptcy in between; an explosion in 1989 in Gramercy Park that killed several workers and spewed asbestos onto homes; a string of accidents and mishaps at its Indian Point 2 nuclear plant, which was sold in September to the Entergy Corporation.
Managing its way through those problems, Con Ed became financially cautious. 
It stuck to its traditional businesses in the 1980's when other utilities diversified into real estate, to their near ruin. More important, in the late 1990's, when utilities rushed to embrace deregulation -- developing businesses that built power plants and traded in electricity to cash in on the volatility of the newly liberalized power markets -- Con Ed only dabbled in energy's new world.
When New York deregulated, Con Ed sold most of its power plants and focused on delivering power. And the company won the right to pass its power costs through to consumers, becoming the only utility in the country that managed to shift the risks of a newly deregulated market onto ratepayers from the start. By contrast, the nation's largest utility, California's Pacific Gas & Electric, sought bankruptcy protection precisely because it was unable to pass those costs along.
As unpopular as the pass-through has been among consumers -- especially in the summer of 2000, when prices spiked sharply -- it has left Con Ed strong enough to cope with the aftereffects of the World Trade Center attacks and the Enron meltdown.
Most analysts still yawn at the mention of the company, but investors with portfolios of power industry stocks are clearly picking it as an anchor; that is what analysts make of the stock's steady performance while the power sector swoons.
Con Ed's earnings are expected to grow by only 3 percent to 4 percent a year, but unlike power companies that use profits to finance rapid expansion, Con Ed pays dividends. At 55 cents a share per quarter, the stock's indicated yield is 5.63 percent, versus 4.22 percent for stocks in the Dow Jones utilities average, or 1.36 percent for the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500.
Con Ed knows its luck might sour. The local economy is sputtering, and the utility's health depends in large part on that of the city. It expects the city's power supply to be adequate next summer, but just barely, a slim margin of error that Con Ed came up against this year, when it narrowly averted blackouts during an extremely hot week in August. 
The company is still mired in litigation with Northeast Utilities, the big New England power company that Con Ed tried to acquire last year. The merger fell apart, and the two sides are now suing each other.
Eugene R. McGrath, the chairman of Con Ed, said earlier this year that the company is open to acquiring another concern, and that some executives have been assigned to look for opportunities. 
And while Con Ed would entertain a buyer, Mr. McGrath said, any takeover would face serious hurdles, from intense regulatory scrutiny to Con Ed's insistence on getting the right price.
"I continue to see Con Ed as more of an acquirer than an acquiree," said Jay Dobson, senior energy analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "They have a very conservative management team, and I don't know if they would want to sign on with another company."
But Mr. Dobson does not expect the company to make a move on another utility anytime soon, either. "Right now, they are focused on restoring the electricity system, so any move toward an acquisition is on hold," he said.
Con Ed, having grown more sensitive to criticism about the cost pass-through it fought so hard to arrange, is trying to make sure its rates do not rocket. It is arguing hard for the construction of new power plants and transmission lines to supply the city. It plans to bring more power online at its East River plant by the summer of 2003. It convinced the federal government to compel the state to intervene to keep prices from spiraling in the New York City wholesale markets. And it says that its work in the financial district will not trigger delays of other badly needed maintenance in the city. 
Next summer, of course, will be the real test, and Mr. McGrath vows to pass.
"Because we send the bills out to people," he said, "it's our responsibility to keep the lights on."

HEADLINE: Small Cable Operators Worry About Life After Big Mergers 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
The stakes in the battle for the nation's televisions are gargantuan -- subscription TV generates revenue of $60 billion a year. So the players need to be gargantuan as well, some industry executives argue.
 Thus the big are getting bigger in order to prepare for a clash of the titans. The two big satellite television companies, EchoStar Communications and DirecTV, are trying to consolidate to create a single company with nearly 17 million subscribers. At the same time, the Comcast Corporation has agreed to buy the cable television unit of AT&T, a move that would make it the largest cable company with more than 22 million subscribers. 
 The two new companies that would emerge, AT&T Comcast and EchoStar, would control 40 percent of the television households in the United States. 
Nervously watching on the sidelines of battle between big cable and big satellite are the 1,200 smaller independent cable operators that serve 12 million homes, about 17 percent of cable subscribers. 
The independent operators, many in small rural markets, say the talk about convergence and national competition neglects a fundamental fact: competition is local. They fear that federal regulators are missing the trees for the forest.
"What we fear is policy makers are going to take their eye off the ball because they are going to be focused on these high-profile media mergers and not the smaller markets," said Matthew Polka, president of the American Cable Association, an organization of independent cable operators that opposes the EchoStar and DirecTV merger.
The chief executive of EchoStar, Charles Ergen, has been trying to paint the competitive landscape as one of convergence -- the convergence of cable and satellite markets, the convergence of television and Internet, and a convergence of fractured local markets into one national market. But state officials agree that television, like politics, is local. Attorneys general from several states have joined the debate, discussing how to block the EchoStar and DirecTV merger.
Small cable companies cast themselves as mom-and-pop stores that come under siege when Wal-Mart rolls into town with lower prices and better distribution networks. In this case, the Wal-Marts are DirecTV and EchoStar, which distribute pizza-size satellite dishes that can receive hundreds of channels. 
But unlike the retail industry, the telecommunications realm is closely regulated. The Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission are also weighing the merits of the satellite deal.
The satellite companies say size will make them more competitive and allow them to build the infrastructure for high-speed Internet access and interactive television, all of which require extensive initial investment. They also say that rural customers will benefit from competition in urban areas through a nationwide pricing plan.
But small cable operators say the cost-effectiveness that makes satellite operators better able to compete with the likes of AT&T Comcast and AOL Time Warner's cable operation will undermine small cable companies. 
Despite the local nature of competition, satellite operators can leverage their national reach and size in ways local cable operators say they cannot. EchoStar, for example, offers one promotional package of 100 channels for $9 a month to new customers, compared with its regular rate of $30.99. 
"They are competing at a price below the cost," said Ben Hooks, chief executive of the Buford Media Group, a cable company with 7,000 subscribers that is based in Tyler, Tex. "How can they do that? Tell me what is going on."
Mr. Hooks said his programming fees alone, without taking into account the costs of the infrastructure, exceed $9 a month. "If you are going to advantage satellite operators to the point where it wipes out competition, what has it accomplished?" he said. 
In all of this, customers do not seem to be suffering, at least not yet. The quality and variety of satellite television has forced cable operators to scramble to upgrade their systems by installing digital networks. Customers are getting more channels, more diverse programming and more choices. Satellite operators have also put pressure on the cable rates in the markets where they compete.
But rural cable operators say the long-term consequences of consolidation will create a landscape where smaller players will be squeezed out and viewers will be left with fewer choices. 
Many are already feeling the pinch as satellite television has eaten into cable subscriber bases.
Small operators are confronted with a choice of losing subscribers or upgrading their equipment. But they say small and sparse subscriber bases in the rural areas make it hard to recuperate the upfront costs of upgrading. A rural operator may get only 30 or so households for each mile, compared with 150 or more households in an urban area.
In addition, small cable operators say they are feeling the brunt of the sharp increases in programming costs. The cost of the ESPN channel, for example, has nearly doubled in five years, to nearly $2 a subscriber, making it one of the most expensive basic channels. 
In addition, most national television channels are controlled by a handful of companies -- AOL Time Warner, Walt Disney, Viacom, General Electric, Vivendi Universal and the News Corporation -- many of which have financial ties to pay-TV companies.
The largest cable and satellite companies also have enough clout to get discounts from programmers. Smaller operators say they cannot get the same discounts, and as a result, they pay as much as 40 percent more for programming. 
Cable rates have jumped an average of 35 percent since 1996, so some of the costs have been passed on to the customers. But the cable companies say they have also had to absorb the higher fees, which has eroded profit margins.
The Comcast-AT&T merger will only make it worse, the rural operators contend. Small rural cable companies rarely compete head-on with the large companies because they are in different geographical areas. 
But the economics of the industry can be affected by the actions of the industry leader. Comcast executives say their programming costs will go down after the merger since they can take advantage of AT&T's better rates. Small cable companies say in turn, their fees will be increased to make up the difference.
The squeeze of increasing programming costs and an eroding subscriber base is getting to be too much for some operators. Many rural operators have sold out in the last several years. Independent Brokerage, a Denver company that focuses on selling rural cable companies, has seen the number of clients trying to sell their cable systems double this year compared with last year.
"We've had more listings of rural cable systems than we have ever had," Cindy Lyle, a partner at Independent Brokerage, said. 
"They are losing subscribers monthly," Ms. Lyle said. "They have come to a crossroads. They either need to upgrade and become digital to compete. They can stay and run the company. Or they can sell."
A cable system in Arkansas lost 100 of its 1,200 subscribers in one month. That prompted the owner to sell the business a year ago.
One trend may be for rural cable operators and satellite broadcasters to join forces. A weakness of satellite broadcasting is its lack of local channels. Limited satellite spectrum means that currently EchoStar and DirecTV broadcast local channels in about 40 of the 210 defined television markets nationwide, covering about 60 percent of the nation's population.
But local programming is important in winning subscribers, executives say, particularly in rural areas. Some businesses are creating hybrid systems of satellite television and local cable. Cable Direct, in Sikeston, Mo., has purchased rural systems over the last year and offered a combination of a satellite dish complemented with local channels. 
"This is the wave of the future," Ms. Lyle said. "If you can't beat them, join them."

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New Jersey: Newark: Insurer To Drop High-Risk Drivers 

BYLINE:  AP (Compiled by Yilu Zhao) 

 BODY:
 The Eagle Insurance Company, which covers about 12,000 high-risk drivers, will no longer handle them for other companies. These customers will be handled by an affiliate of the insurance giant A.I.G., according to the State Department of Banking and Insurance. 
Earlier this year, some of the state's biggest auto insurance companies, including State Farm and A.I.G., clamored to leave New Jersey, saying they could not operate profitably and lacked the flexibility to cope with changing economic conditions because of heavy regulation. New Jersey auto insurers were forced by the State Legislature to reduce rates by 15 percent in the spring of 1999. In the last several weeks, the regulators have approved increases for several companies, including State Farm and A.I.G. New Jersey already has some of the nation's highest rates for auto insurance.

HEADLINE: Hoping a Euro in the Hand Will Be Worth More 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 25 

 BODY:
For three years now, the euro has been a "virtual" currency, existing only in the ether-world of electronic transactions and bookkeeping but almost undetectable in daily life.
 That is about to change. On Jan. 1, if all goes as planned, automated bank tellers in 12 European countries will start dispensing crisp new euros and stop issuing national currencies like the Spanish peseta, German mark, French franc and Dutch guilder. It will be the last step in an effort that began more than 30 years ago, crowning Europe's boldest achievement yet in becoming a seamless union. 
 But even on the eve of that momentous transformation, affecting more than 300 million people, the euro is dogged by a credibility problem that has not been helped by its invisibility to date. Even before its introduction, it has fallen shy of some of the grander ambitions that European leaders had envisioned for it. 
Defying predictions that it would create the monetary equivalent of Airbus's rivalry with Boeing, the currency has not eroded the global dominance of the American dollar. In fact, it has lost about one-fifth of its value against the dollar since 1999. 
More important, it has failed to insulate Europe from outside economic shocks, like the blow provided by the slowdown in the United States, and its value has failed to bounce back even since America plunged into a recession.
The president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, knows better than anyone these shortcomings and the lack of apparent enthusiasm that the currency has generated. 
Indeed, Mr. Duisenberg suggested in a recent interview that one of the barriers to the euro's acceptance has been the absence of cold, hard cash. "I regard not having the notes in the hands of people as maybe the greatest handicap the E.C.B. has had in gaining confidence of the people at large," Mr. Duisenberg said in an interview. "Although the euro is already with us, the people at large still think of it as a thing that is coming."
Neither Mr. Duisenberg nor any other economist expects the arrival of cash to boost the euro's exchange rate. But many people believe euro notes and coins will reduce the popular skepticism. The practical advantages, such as not having to change money at most borders, will finally become apparent in real life.
Except for Britain, Denmark and Sweden, every country within the European Union will be setting prices and accepting payment in the same currency. Small states like Monaco and Vatican City will be minting euros as well, while Balkan territories like Kosovo and Montenegro are adopting the euro by converting the German marks that serve as their de facto currencies now.
It is an achievement that many people thought would never happen, a dream that dates back almost to the end of World War II and was championed in the late 1970's by President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France and the German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt.
But while the euro has already disappointed certain aspirations and has not been popularly embraced, it has hardly been a failure.
Most economists and business leaders say the single currency is a healthy step toward openness and more vibrant competition across Europe. Eliminating currency fluctuations between member countries reduces the expense and risk of cross-border business. Prices become easier to compare, for consumers as well as corporate buyers. Profit becomes easier to compare as well, putting pressure on companies to become more efficient.
"It is, on many levels, a catalyst and a driving force for reform," said Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. "It will have an effect on the unified growth of Europe."
Economists note that the arrival of a tangible European currency is merely the visible tip of a deeper transformation. Because countries joining the monetary union were required to reduce their budget deficits and bring inflation under control, Europe has attained a much higher level of economic stability.
Inflation is as low in Greece as it is in Germany, slightly above 2 percent. Interest rates on home mortgages in Italy, which routinely reached double-digit levels in the past, are about 5 percent. Spain and Portugal now have budget surpluses, though the current slowdown is producing budget deficits in countries like Germany and Italy.
Eric Vergnaud, economist at BNP Paribas in Paris, notes that Europe has weathered this downturn much more smoothly than the one in the early 1990's. In 1992, the currencies of Italy and Britain shifted so wildly that both countries had to drop out of Europe's currency-exchange stabilization system.
Why, then, does the euro generate so little enthusiasm? And will that really change once people have the notes in hand?
In the European Commission's most recent monthly poll of popular attitudes toward the new currency, only 48 percent of those asked thought the euro would mean more advantages than disadvantages for them. Only 50 percent said that using the new notes and coins would make them feel "a little more European."
"The coins look beautiful," remarked Christian Pavic, 20, a steelworker in Frankfurt, as he contemplated the handful of coins in one of the "starter kits" that went on sale earlier this month. But he added: "I find it difficult because of the conversion. I would have preferred to keep the mark."
Part of the euro's problem stems not from the currency itself but from the gauzy mixture of political expectations that surrounded its creation. When the euro was formally adopted on New Year's Eve 1999, Jacques Santer, then president of the European Commission, declared that "in one single blow, Europe is imposing itself on the world's financial and monetary map."
There were also widespread expectations that the euro would unleash a new era of economic growth, as companies took greater advantage of pan-European opportunities and greater stability. Those predictions were not entirely wrong: Europe experienced a big surge in cross-border corporate mergers and European companies began raising much more money than before through international stock and bond offerings.
The real problem is that Europe continues to fall behind in other areas. Job-protection laws remain rigid and taxes are high in many countries. Europe has lagged behind the United States in economic growth throughout the past decade, as homegrown companies like Siemens have shifted jobs overseas and international investors have flocked to the United States.
"The weakness that the euro has shown over the past two years, which we had not expected, obviously reflects the weakness of Europe as a place to do business," said Rolf Breuer, chairman of Deutsche Bank.
Frits Bolkestein, the European Commission official in charge of developing common rules for business within the European Union, provides a vivid insight into the difficulties of pushing through broader economic change.
The European Union already enjoys free trade between member countries, and citizens of one country have an automatic right to live and work in any of the other 14 countries. But companies remain bedeviled by different rules for setting up businesses, raising capital and carrying out seemingly mundane jobs like running a pension fund.
Earlier this year, German leaders torpedoed a 12-year effort to reach agreement on a Europewide set of rules governing corporate takeovers. 
Similarly, European banks are still charging fees as high as 17 percent on cross-border money-transfers. Only after a stormy battle this fall did Mr. Bolkestein finally win approval for a measure to prohibit such fees as of next summer.
Mr. Bolkestein counts that as one of his successes. But the list of stalled reforms is long: huge battles over a standard European prospectus for raising money from investors; bitter feuds over rules to let pension funds operate across borders; even a months-long logjam over reducing the number of languages required for filing a European patent.
"We spent about nine hours discussing linguistics," fumed Mr. Bolkestein, recalling a meeting in late November at which European cabinet ministers failed to agree on the patent issue. "It's three steps forward, and two backward."
Against that backdrop, the ability of 12 European countries to surrender their national currencies is a stunning achievement. But it is also one whose impact will be indirect and only become apparent over time, even once euros are in hand.
Daniel Gros, deputy director of Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, once compared the euro to a glacier that moves too slowly for most people to notice.
But wait, he predicted. "After 10 years, Europe's landscape will be transformed."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Courtesy and Decency Play Sneaky With a Tough Guy

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is, like his father and his son, a Georgia corrections officer. Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry) is a waitress struggling to make ends meet and to raise her 12-year-old son. She is also the widow of a man whose execution Hank helped to conduct. The relationship between Hank and Leticia, a relationship born of chance, moral reflex and desperate need, is at the center of "Monster's Ball," a tough, heartfelt new film from the young Swiss-born director Marc Forster. 
 In outline, the story of Hank and Leticia's entwined lives might seem implausible, and the events that surround it -- three deaths, including the unblinkingly filmed electrocution of Leticia's husband, Lawrence (Sean Combs) -- could have smothered the movie in melodrama. "Monster's Ball" could easily have been an exercise in liberal high-mindedness, a cinematic lecture on the inhumanity of the death penalty or the legacy of Southern racism. But Mr. Forster and the screenwriters, Milo Addica and Will Rokos (who is a native of Georgia), are more interested in the details of character and milieu than in deducing right-thinking morals. 
 Hank and Leticia are not easy people, and much to its credit, "Monster's Ball" is not an easy picture. Mr. Forster's deliberate pacing and the gritty, smudged look that Roberto Schaefer, the cinematographer, brings to the workaday modern South create an atmosphere heavy with the buried emotions of grief, rage and terror. Hank lives in the shadow of his bullying, bigoted father (Peter Boyle) and a brutal code of masculine behavior that blocks all access to feeling. But if Hank feels at all sorry for himself, he does not show us, and Mr. Thornton earns our sympathy the hard way, by showing us Hank at his unvarnished worst. "You've always hated me, haven't you," demands his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), a sensitive, troubled soul who is clearly not cut out for death row duty. "Yes, I have," is Hank's even-toned reply.
The night before, Sonny had incurred his father's wrath by showing intolerable weakness during Musgrove's walk to the electric chair. As one of his African-American colleagues tried to pull him off his son, Hank exploded in an obscene, racist tirade. "This is not you, Hank," his co-worker insisted, trying to calm him down. "This is me," Hank yells back. "This is me."
He's right. Hank's prejudice and suspicion are not simply mistaken attitudes in need of correction; they are integral to his character. But so is a habitual courtesy -- the writers catch the quiet politeness that inflects even the most tense or hostile exchanges -- and a reluctant sense of decency. These qualities overtake the others in a way that surprises Hank himself, and his transformation -- in Hollywood, as in the Baptist church, they like to call it redemption -- is all the more astonishing for being almost surreptitious.
Mr. Thornton, one of the most gifted screen actors working today, outdoes himself. For her part, Ms. Berry proves herself to be an actress of impressive courage and insight. Like Hank, Leticia is a character who could have been simplified, turned into a one-dimensional victim or a saint. Ms. Berry emphasizes the character's temper, and also the vulnerability beneath her toughness. 
What she has in common with Hank is an alienation from her finer emotions. She loves her son, Tyrell (well played by 10-year-old Coronji Calhoun in his first film role), but he is also the target of her anger and shame. In the last minutes of the movie, the burden of dramatic resolution falls squarely on Ms. Berry, and she soars. The film's conclusion is an enormous gamble for the filmmakers, as well as for Leticia and Hank, and it is above all Ms. Berry's fearless concentration that converts potential sentimentality into honest, complex emotion.
The characters and the bond that develops between them are too complex for words, and the writers use very few. Their economy and the eloquence of Mr. Forster's unshowily beautiful images give "Monster's Ball" the density and strangeness of real life. The raw intimacy of some of the scenes -- whether they take place at a diner, in the death house or in the bedroom -- is breathtaking. In the end, the movie belongs to the actors -- to Ms. Berry and Mr. Thornton, principally, but also to the large supporting cast, including Mr. Combs, Mr. Ledger and the hip-hop star Mos Def (as Hank's neighbor down the road). This is one of those rare movies in which even people glimpsed only for a moment or two seem to have lives that ramify beyond the screen, as if the story were being witnessed rather than dramatized.
"Monster's Ball" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of brutal violence and realistic sex.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Says He's Not Rushing to Close Deals on Stadiums 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday defended his plan to complete negotiations for two new baseball stadiums in his last days in office, adding that he was working with the incoming administration of Michael R. Bloomberg to do so.
 But Mr. Giuliani, who leaves office on Jan. 1, said that, contrary to news reports suggesting that he was trying to close the deals, he was trying only to reach tentative agreements with the Mets and the Yankees that would provide a framework for future deals. 
 Mr. Giuliani, who had an unusually busy Christmas schedule, extolled the economic virtues of his plan, saying that it would provide jobs and an economic boost to the city at a minimum cost. 
"We think this is an innovative deal," Mr. Giuliani said, adding that the city paid the entire cost to build Shea Stadium and to rebuild Yankee Stadium in its present form.
The Giuliani plan envisions a public-private partnership, with the Mets and the Yankees paying half the building costs, which in each case would be more than any major league baseball team has contributed to the construction of a stadium.
The estimated price tag for the Mets' stadium is $800 million, not including $100 million in road and subway improvements that the team has asked the state to make. The estimated cost of the Yankees' stadium, which is in a much earlier stage of planning, has not been disclosed.
The city's Arts Commission approved the design for a new Mets stadium on a parking lot beside Shea. Mr. Giuliani said that while the deal he was working on involved building the new Yankee Stadium in Macombs Dam Park in the South Bronx, he did not dismiss the possibility that that it would be built on Manhattan's West Side, a proposal that has drawn heavy opposition from area residents and Bronx politicians.
In the last two years, Mr. Giuliani has advocated using a West Side site owned by the state for either a baseball stadium for the Yankees or a football stadium for the Jets.
Mr. Giuliani's push to complete the negotiations just days before he leaves office comes as the economic fallout from the recession and the damage to Lower Manhattan caused by the attack on Sept. 11 has raised questions about whether building new stadiums would be money well spent.
At a news conference at a firehouse on East 75th Street in Manhattan, Mayor-elect Bloomberg, who on Monday declined to comment on the stadiums, said that he had spoken with Mr. Giuliani about the stadium plans and approved of the negotiations. Still, Mr. Bloomberg said that he would have a better idea once he appointed a deputy mayor for economic development later this week.
"We want to have the best facilities for cultural events, athletic events," Mr. Bloomberg said. "We also have to understand that we are going into some very tough economic times, and we are going to have to find some ways to balance that."
When asked whether he expected to complete the negotiations before Mr. Bloomberg was sworn in, Mr. Giuliani said, "Yeah," and then turned to Merrill Lynch's senior vice president and general counsel, George Schieren, and said: "Most deals get made at 4 or 5 or 6 in the morning, right, George?"
The last few days have been different for Mr. Giuliani, a man who has become accustomed to holiday routines as mayor.
Each Christmas Eve for the past eight years as mayor, Mr. Giuliani took gifts collected by the city to children, generally those living in public housing in low-income neighborhoods. On Christmas, Mr. Giuliani participated in Merrill Lynch's annual Christmas Calls program, which allows senior citizens to use the firm's telephones free of charge to call their loved ones around the world.
This Christmas Eve, Mr. Giuliani found himself giving out toys to children. But this time it was to the children of Scott Larsen, a firefighter who was lost in the World Trade Center attack. Firefighter Larsen's wife, Carol Ann, gave birth to a boy on Sept. 13. Mr. Giuliani went to the family's Queens home and took presents for that boy, August, as well as the other children, Marisa, 9; Brenda, 8; and Scott, 4.
Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani went to the Christmas Calls event. But instead of being held at Merrill Lynch's headquarters in the World Financial Center, it was held in temporary offices on Fifth Avenue where Merrill Lynch officials moved after the terrorist attack damaged their headquarters.
"This is a wonderful, special holiday for everyone," Mr. Giuliani said while at the temporary offices. "The joy of it transcends what happened on Sept. 11."
Instead of going home early on Christmas, Mr. Giuliani's entourage headed south on the West Side Highway to a tent on the edge of ground zero, within sight of Merrill Lynch's shuttered headquarters. There, Mr. Giuliani served Christmas meals to rescue workers laboring around the clock recovering corpses and removing debris.

HEADLINE: White House Aides Trying to Balance Attention on Terrorism, the Economy and Politics 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25 

 BODY:
Shortly after Sept. 11, President Bush instructed his aides that he would not tolerate discussions about politics during the emergency.
 "He just said, 'Politics has no role in this,' " recalled Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser. " 'Don't anybody talk to me about politics for a while.' " 
 But the White House and the Republican Party are persistently, if quietly, venturing back into the realm of politics. Officials are paying careful attention to how the war is proceeding -- and how it might affect the president's standing in the polls. In drawing up Mr. Bush's remarks about the war, the aides are ever mindful of how his words will play with particular constituencies. They are dispatching surrogates, including Vice President Dick Cheney, to give speeches that take on Democrats. 
Beyond the war, the most consuming debate in the White House is a political one: how to strike a balance in the State of the Union address next month between a discussion of the war and the nation's economic strains.
Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's counselor, said the president had recently held his first meeting to discuss the speech with aides, who have been meeting frequently among themselves.
"Our thinking right now is clearly, there are two key issues, and they are related," Ms. Hughes said. "One is the war, and one is the recession. Those two will obviously be major components of the speech."
No firm judgments have been made calibrating between the two.
"The country is going to want to hear from him about the conduct of the war," Mr. Rove said. "And they're going to want to know what his agenda is."
The offices next door to the White House of the vaunted group of aides that sets long-term political strategy, nicknamed the "strategery" team, repeating a joke from a "Saturday Night Live" parody of Mr. Bush, had been supplanted by the new Office of Homeland Security, which needed a "secure" first-floor location.
But White House officials said the group was back in full operation and focusing intensely on planning for the State of the Union address.
Beyond the Oval Office, White House advisers said, they have had extensive discussions about how long Mr. Bush can sustain his impressive popularity ratings. Several said that they were bracing for Mr. Bush's standing to begin declining early next year and that they viewed that State of the Union address as a fortuitous opportunity for the president to reassert himself -- and retain his popularity. 
There has been no such chance since his address to a joint session of Congress shortly before the bombing of Afghanistan began.
"It's a window where the American people are watching, and you don't get a lot of those," said Matthew Dowd, an adviser to the Republican Party who is in charge of polling for the White House. "You remember, in the speech he gave to the joint session his numbers went up."
"Obviously, the fact that he's got approval ratings in the 80's that have sustained themselves for three months is a huge thing," Mr. Dowd said. "Nobody since F. D. R. has had this situation. The question is, How does that translate into how much of your agenda you can get through?"
One White House official was blunter, saying: "The political viability or support behind the president's actions is always on everybody's mind. It's naive to think that that's not what every White House is constantly thinking about."
White House advisers said they were always seeking openings to score political points without appearing to be overtly political. 
Officials said they were pleased this month when Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, ridiculed the administration for the "Bush recession." 
That gave Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, an excuse to fire back, asserting that the president "thinks the job of leaders in Washington is not to point fingers, but to find solutions."
White House advisers also said they had considered the political benefit of initiatives like reaching out to women in Afghanistan.
"It will do nothing but help them with female voters," an adviser said.
Mr. Dowd said the effort would do more than simply appeal to women.
"It could have a broad effect on independents and soft Democrats," he said, by softening the president's conservative image.
Every word's nuance is weighed. White House officials said they had urged Mr. Bush to refrain from using the word "stimulus," because it sounds academic and inaccessible. They have implored him to favor terms like "economic security" that relate to ordinary people and could connect the economy to the war.
"You can pick up the Washington vernacular quickly," Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, said. "But that doesn't mean a lot to the guy sitting in Paducah."
There have also been discussions about whom to put before the cameras to relay the message. White House advisers said they were mindful that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was effective with the news media in his frequent briefings and that Attorney General John Ashcroft was helpful because, in the view of one, "he is a willing lightning rod to take the heat off the president on these very difficult criminal justice decisions."
Some aides said they had been less satisfied with the performances of Tom Ridge, who heads the Office of Homeland Security. But they said Mr. Ridge had been less visible lately, in part because the anthrax scares and other domestic threats have receded.
White House officials are also partial to having Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, as a high-profile surrogate on television.
"The initial response is always to put Condi out first," one White House official said. "She always has the exact tone and response the president wants. She's someone everyone feels entirely safe with."
The drive to intensify political efforts has not been entirely behind the scenes. The White House has significantly intensified its public political activities in recent weeks. The strategy is for Mr. Bush to continue to present himself as bipartisan as long as he can while his representatives, notably Mr. Cheney, become more partisan. Since late October, Mr. Cheney's fund-raising appearances have included stops in Pierre, S.D., Dallas and Oklahoma City.
This month, Mr. Rove ventured from Washington to be the marquee attraction at fund-raising events for Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Representative John Thune of South Dakota, who is running for the Senate next year. Mr. Rove was not bashful about delivering partisan comments about the economic stimulus, words that Mr. Bush would dare not repeat himself.
Mr. Rove insisted that Mr. Bush had so little interest in his standing in the polls that he did not dare mention it to the president until two weeks ago.
"You say, 'Mr. President, there was an interesting poll out last night,' " Mr. Rove said, "and he'll cut you off and say, 'Let's move on to something consequential.' "
But, Mr. Rove said, Mr. Bush will "absolutely" campaign for Republican candidates next year. The question is when.
In an interview last week with news agencies, Mr. Bush said, "I'm really just not thinking about politics right now, although I readily concede I will have to here pretty soon. If I do the job the American people expect me to do, not only the job in foreign policy, but also have a domestic agenda that will help people in need, my guess is I'll be in pretty good shape politically."
An illustration of White House success in public relations was in building the drama that led up to the release of the videotape of Osama bin Laden. At a time when impatience was growing over the hunt for Mr. bin Laden, the anticipation over the tape filled the void. Mr. Bartlett insisted that there was no orchestrated effort to leak information about the tape, but he acknowledged that it had been favorable public relations.
"I wish we could take credit for the buildup," he said.
Other advisers said the administration had painstakingly choreographed its handling of the war message.
"They're not manipulating the military operations," a strategist who advises the White House said. "But there's a manipulation of the environment. They take advantage of the situation to achieve some political objectives."
Former Speaker Newt Gingrich said the White House, after a shaky start, had been effective in orchestrating public opinion behind the war. Mr. Gingrich singled out Ms. Hughes for establishing a "rapid response" team with offices here, in London and in Islamabad, Pakistan, to wage the propaganda war against Mr. bin Laden.
"We are much more on the offensive," Mr. Gingrich said, "and I think Karen Hughes and Karl Rove are central to it. We've gone from Osama bin Laden being a martyr to Osama bin Laden being a mindless terrorist. And that's a very significant shift."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ANTHRAX TRAIL; 
Tracking Bioterror's Tangled Course

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON and KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
There was no commotion, no outcry. Except for the blond woman in the black dress sitting by herself in a back pew, no one knew that anything unusual had happened. 
 Johanna C. Huden, a 31-year-old editorial assistant at The New York Post, had first noticed the strange blister on her right middle finger the day before, Sept. 21. She had not thought too much about it; surely it was just a bug bite or a cat scratch. 
 Now, though, as she sat in the Long Island church, half-distractedly watching the wedding ceremony, the finger began to itch. She reached down and rubbed it gently against the coarse linen of her dress. Suddenly, a watery white liquid bubbled out across the cloth. 
"Ee-yew," Ms. Huden recalls saying to herself. "That is just really bizarre." 
The conventional understanding of America's first-ever anthrax attack says Ms. Huden was a bit player -- a victim of skin, or cutaneous, anthrax who fully recovered and got on with her life. As anthrax spores spread through the mail, and events blurred across six states and the District of Columbia, hers became no more than a name in the middle of a long list of victims. 
Yet the conventional understanding is wrong. In the light of hindsight, scientists can now see that the outbreak actually began that September afternoon.
Ms. Huden was the anthrax index patient -- the pivot point upon which every outbreak investigation is based, the crucial clue that every medical investigator hopes can be found, and fast. But on that muggy day at Mary Immaculate Church, she suffered her mysterious wound very much alone.
No one knew. 
Those words have become the theme of the medical investigation of the anthrax attacks, a refrain of epidemiological regret. 
Certainly, the medical investigators have done much to contain the outbreak and save lives. Yet the inside story of that inquiry -- pieced together from interviews with many of the lead investigators and other health-care officials -- is also a tale of missed cues, misread evidence and erroneous assumptions that led scientists and decision makers to misjudge the threat to postal workers and, through the mail system, to the American public. 
For weeks, primary-care doctors individually struggled to diagnose a disease they had never seen and never imagined they would see. In that uncertainty, medical investigators could never quite discern the sequence of infection that began with Johanna Huden. And only through the bitter experience of 5 deaths and 18 other confirmed or suspected cases did they learn how much they did not know about how anthrax spores traveled and infected their victims. 
Of course, the medical inquiry is just one of several intertwined strands of the government's still unresolved investigation of the attacks. In recent weeks, in fact, the other aspects have taken center stage, as microbiologists try to pinpoint the nature and source of the mailed anthrax and criminal investigators search for a suspect. 
But underpinning those efforts, at every point, are the epidemiologists, the medical detectives on the ground, tracing how the infection spread and whether the underlying pattern of cases can offer up some revelatory clue from the haze.
They can see now that Johanna Huden arrived first in that place of fear and fog. For weeks after the wedding, despite repeated visits to doctors and emergency rooms, her infection worsened and the cause of her illness was missed. And no one knew.

Florida
A First Case To Investigate
Every disease outbreak tells a detective story. The epidemiologist's job is to piece together the narrative threads -- to work back to the beginning and so hasten the end. 
Assume nothing; let the evidence speak for itself. That gumshoe credo was very much on Dr. Bradley A. Perkins's mind as the chartered jet roared toward South Florida on the afternoon of Oct. 4, carrying his 12-member team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
Dr. Perkins, a boyish-looking 42, chief of the centers' special pathogens branch, sat at a small conference table, chatting with the adrenaline-pumped scientists and passing around the latest papers on anthrax. But mostly he tried to concentrate on telling himself not to think about terrorists. 
Everyone at the centers, of course, had been worrying about just that since Sept. 11 -- planning for attacks of everything from sarin gas to smallpox to anthrax, perhaps the most widely developed bioweapon in history. But at that moment, all anyone knew was that a tabloid newspaper editor named Robert Stevens was dying of inhalation anthrax in a Palm Beach County hospital.
Perhaps Mr. Stevens had been infected deliberately -- the first periscope glimpse into a mass bioterror attack. Perhaps. It was also possible that the bacteria had been picked up naturally, from a sick cow, even one long dead; anthrax spores could lie dormant in the ground for decades. 
For now, this was just a medical case, though Dr. Perkins knew well that on his word a huge criminal investigation would be unleashed. The fear of being wrong was intense. "You don't pull the bioterrorism trigger lightly," he would say later.
Let the evidence speak for itself. That's how epidemiology had always worked. It was a rhythm of science, intuition and observation -- an art essentially unchanged since the 1850's, when a doctor named John Snow stunned the medical world with the insight that every family with cholera in his London neighborhood drew water from the same pestilential well. 
Dr. Snow took off the well's pump handle and became a legend. His cholera-cluster maps became the motif of a new science, premised on the belief that disease, in the dawning age of the germ theory, could be chased from the shadows of superstition and hunted to the ground. 
Now, flying to Palm Beach, Dr. Perkins and his team planned the hunt for the handle of this latest pump. They would meet with county health officials, then fan out, testing as they went -- Mr. Stevens's home, office, whatever made sense -- with swabs that would pick up any errant anthrax spores. 
By the time they landed, Dr. Perkins felt satisfied that he had pushed as hard as he should the admonition to leave no stone, quite literally, unturned. 
But then, leaving the airport, he saw something that tested his assumptions all over again. Flight Safety International, the pilot school where some of the Sept. 11 hijackers were thought to have trained, had a flight simulator right at the airport. Could it be coincidence that here, of all places, and now, of all times, anthrax would just happen? 
As he drove his rental car past the building, he had more or less the same thought that had flickered across Johanna Huden's mind two weeks before. 
"This is weird," he said to himself.

The Northeast
Though Unreported, Patients Accumulate
Actually, up North, seven people were already mysteriously ill.
Teresa Heller, a letter carrier assigned to West Trenton, N.J., had checked into a hospital with an infection on her arm. 
Richard Morgano, a maintenance worker at the mail distribution center in nearby Hamilton Township, had a similar lesion on his arm. 
In Manhattan, the infant son of an ABC news producer was in a hospital, gravely ill with a high fever and an ulcerated arm.
Erin M. O'Connor and Casey Chamberlain, assistants to the NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw, had skin lesions -- Ms. O'Connor on her collarbone, Ms. Chamberlain on her leg.
Claire Fletcher, a CBS News aide, had two small infected pimples on her face.
And Johanna Huden had been to two emergency rooms and seen more than half a dozen doctors. Ultimately, on Oct. 1, a surgeon at New York University Medical Center had cut the dead skin out of her finger. Ms. Huden left the hospital with a large bandage on her hand but no better idea of what had made her sick. 
None of those cases -- misdiagnosed and misunderstood -- were reported into the medical surveillance system on which epidemiology depends. 
Without realizing it, Dr. Perkins and his team were starting in the middle. The Stevens case, they believed, was the index case. And that misperception was the first of many to guide the investigation -- in Florida and then up North -- in the coming days. 
The next morning, Oct. 5, the scientists fanned out, checking things ;ole the vacuum-cleaner bags in Mr. Stevens's house and the ventilation system on the roof of the American Media International building, where he worked. 
They went to a store where he bought spices in bulk; the store kept live animals, they had been told, and had to be checked as a possible source of natural contagion. They visited his favorite fishing hole and traced his Sunday bicycle route. A separate team went to North Carolina, where Mr. Stevens had first felt ill while visiting his daughter.
All trails led nowhere. The dead-cow vector, even as a remote hypothesis, faded. Mr. Stevens died that day, unable to help them. 
Various pieces of evidence, though, eventually pointed toward the company's mailroom. Tests of a mailroom worker, Ernesto Blanco, hospitalized with a still-undiagnosed illness, turned up an anthrax spore in his nasal passage. Spores were also found on Mr. Stevens's computer keyboard.
But when the investigators first arrived in the mailroom late on the afternoon of Oct. 5, they realized to their horror that, in their exuberance or thoroughness, they had used up all but one of their cotton swabs.
One small swab to test the whole room -- it seemed like the wildest shot in the dark. 
So the scientists stood amid the postage meters and scales and argued the point: Though they could get more swabs, this was it for the day, and at a time when every hour felt laden with portents and pressures, the decision seemed enormous. Finally, they decided to use the last swab on a bin holding letters and packages for the photo department, where Mr. Stevens had worked. 
The results came back the next day with a direct bull's-eye. The mail bin was heavily contaminated, and the conclusion, Dr. Perkins said, was unmistakable: Mr. Stevens had been the victim of a criminal act. 
The finding sent a shock wave through the nation and changed everything about the case. This was not simply a medical investigation anymore. The F.B.I., which, like the disease control centers, had been preparing for bioterror attacks since Sept. 11, took over.
For the epidemiologists, the discovery was as if a fog had lifted just long enough to see that they were headed out into uncharted, and uncomfortable, territory. They were not just hunting an organism with genes and biological logic that could be tracked the traditional way. This was a weapon, deliberately wielded, with an exponentially increasing number of possible sources. That mixture -- the biological and the psychological, the genetic and the perversely pathological -- fundamentally altered the task at hand. 
"Usually we're talking about trying to define normal biologic transmission," Dr. Perkins said. "This is a terrorist transmission route."
Investigators followed that route from the mailroom to the delivery truck, to the Boca Raton post office and through the county's mail system, finding spores all along the way. 
What they did not find were any sick postal workers. They had no reason to connect Mr. Stevens to Teresa Heller and Richard Morgano and the others up in New York, because they did not yet know they existed.
The postal system, they now knew, had been used as an instrument of attack, an important finding. But it went only so far. Since no postal workers seemed even remotely affected, the postal connection was treated as one clue among many, not the sure, single pathway suffused with risk. 
On Oct. 9, President Bush told an edgy nation that the Florida case appeared to be "an isolated incident." 
But Dr. Perkins, the epidemiologist, recalls feeling "extremely uncomfortable." 
"We know someone is out there with the ability to cause disease, but we don't know how much mail is out there or whether the mode of delivery is going to change," he recounted. "We're operating on data that are inadequate for the situation."

New Jersey
Delayed Recognitions Of Cases Missed
"You heard about Hamilton?"
That was the question Dr. Michael Dash's wife yelled out as he arrived home Saturday afternoon, Oct. 13, on what was to have been a quiet weekend with the family.
She had been checking the headlines on the Internet that afternoon when she happened upon a news bulletin: an anthrax-laced letter had been found in New York that had been postmarked at the Hamilton Township mail-sorting center near Trenton. 
"Oh no," Dr. Dash thought after reading the story. "That is what that man had."
That man was Richard Morgano, 39, a barrel-chested maintenance worker at the Hamilton postal center, who had come into Dr. Dash's New Jersey office on Oct. 1 with a strange infection.
Mr. Morgano had scratched his arm on Sept. 20 while reaching into a Hamilton mail-sorting machine. A blistered wound had formed, oozing a yellowish liquid around back spots of dead skin. His arm was twice its normal size, his lymph nodes swollen and his hand unbendable.
At that first meeting, Dr. Dash put Mr. Morgano on a strong dose of antibiotics and, after checking a reference book, asked Mr. Morgano a line of questions fearing he was facing a condition he had never before seen.
"You doing any hunting recently? You've been working with pelts? Been around goats or any farms?" Dr. Dash asked, checking possible natural causes of anthrax. 
But Dr. Dash had never imagined that a postal worker in central New Jersey would be the victim of a terrorist attack. So when Mr. Morgano answered "no" to each of the questions about natural sources of anthrax, Dr. Dash had ruled it out. 
Dr. Dash was far from the only physician who had a sudden and disturbing realization that weekend. The discovery in New York of the anthrax-contaminated letter, which had infected an NBC News employee, evoked a series of calls to local and federal authorities in New York and New Jersey.
In fact, on the same day Mr. Morgano was at Dr. Dash's office, Ms. Huden and the ABC producer's baby were just eight floors apart at the New York University Medical Center.
"I kick myself when I think about it now," Dr. Douglas Yoshia, the attending physician on duty when Ms. Huden showed up at the emergency room. 
Like Dr. Dash, upon hearing about the NBC case and the Hamilton letter, Dr. Yoshia immediately realized Ms. Huden had had anthrax. But he had one more complication to overcome: He could not remember her name. It took a few days of searching through hospital records to track it down and by the time he reached Ms. Huden, her case was already being investigated.
It was only once these cases bubbled to the surface that the true pattern of the outbreak started to become apparent. And, perhaps most important, health officials now had hard evidence that postal workers were, at a minumum, at risk of cutaneous anthrax.
Even so, the full significance of this discovery was not initially recognized. It took five days to confirm that Mr. Morgano and Ms. Heller, the West Trenton letter carrier, had anthrax. 
By Oct. 18, when these cases were confirmed, seven other postal workers -- three in New Jersey and four in Washington -- had begun to feel sick, most with the more serious version of inhalation anthrax. The second wave was under way, this time from poisoned letters postmarked at Hamilton on Oct. 9 on their way to Capitol Hill. 
In this wave, a few of the cases would be identified quickly, and the postal employees would recover. But again, some doctors who encountered these sick postal workers would not make the anthrax connection. And this time, the implications would be fatal.

District of Columbia
The Medical Becomes Political
It was still dark and silent that Saturday morning, Oct. 20, when Dr. Michael S. A. Richardson picked up the telephone in the hallway of his Washington townhouse to call the office. During the night, he had received a message on his new cellphone -- issued to go with his new job as an acting senior deputy director at the District of Columbia Department of Health -- but no one had taught him how to retrieve messages.
Now, as he realized what he had missed during the night, he stretched the phone cord into the living room, perched on the arm of a chair and scribbled notes as fast as he could. 
A worker at the Brentwood Road postal center in Washington, Leroy Richmond, had been tentatively diagnosed with inhalation anthrax. The implication was staggering. 
"We are in the middle of this," Dr. Richardson recalled thinking. "And it's a huge deal."
Washington is where the anthrax story became political, social, even racial, theater. And it is where the assumptions of the investigation -- woven from decades of conventional scientific wisdom and weeks of evidence and missed cues -- all unraveled. 
When he picked up the phone that morning, Dr. Richardson did not know about the second wave. What he -- and the rest of the nation -- did know was that just five days earlier, on Oct. 15, an anthrax-laced letter had been opened in the Capitol office of Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader. And though reports conflicted, suspicions ran deep -- and had been played in banner headlines -- that the material in this letter was dangerously different. Many of the government's bioweapons experts were saying that the anthrax spores seemed much smaller, perhaps capable of staying airborne longer, and thus far more likely to penetrate deep into the lungs.
Even so, Dr. Richardson knew of no postal worker who had developed the life-threatening inhaled form of the disease, despite the trail of spores across the postal system. And the disease control agency had said that only people in the immediate vicinity when a poisoned letter was opened were at risk. 
Dr. Richardson also knew that an initial test at Brentwood Road, where the Daschle letter had been processed, had turned up no evidence of contamination. And there was the curious case of the worker at the P Street station, who had tested positive for inhalation-anthrax exposure immediately after the Daschle letter, but then, after retesting, was put back on the negative list. Both those results seemed to reinforce the conventional wisdom. 
Now it was all dreadfully wrong. Postal workers were in direct and dire danger. Sealed envelopes could leak. The inhalation case at Brentwood had presented, literally overnight, a new signature of threat. 
What was clear, too, was that the full implication of tinier, airborne spores had not been thought through; early hints, like the P Street worker, had become missed opportunities rather than signal flares suggesting that more testing might be needed. In Atlanta, it would be another week and a half before the C.D.C. opened what turned out to be a very prescient e-mail -- a warning from Canadian researchers, sent Oct. 4, that tests had shown that anthrax spores could leak through envelopes. 
Dr. Richardson has no illusions that an earlier grasp of the dangers of the Daschle anthrax could have kept Mr. Richmond or the three other infected Brentwood workers from getting sick; they had already been exposed. But it might have meant faster diagnosis and faster treatment. With physicians on the alert, the words "I work for the postal service" would have opened doors and minds in doctors' offices everywhere. 
"Everybody and their mother would have known that a postal worker is potentially at risk," Dr. Richardson said. "And so that famous tape of this man Morris, saying that he went to his doctor and the doctor told him don't worry, would probably not have happened." Thomas Morris Jr., a Brentwood worker, died on Oct. 21; Mr. Richmond recovered. 
The flawed assumptions had other consequences. Because postal workers had not been considered at risk, only people at the Capitol were tested and given the anthrax antibiotic Cipro after the Daschle letter was opened. Now, Dr. Richardson saw, a huge intervention -- running late and behind the curve -- would have to begin. 
And in Washington, where conflicts of race and class simmer even in the best of times, a late start would have its own costs and consequences. 
The city's health commissioner, Dr. Ivan C. A. Walks, faced it first-hand when the congregation at an African-American church peppered him with questions about why postal workers, many of them black, were being treated differently than people at the Capitol. While some postal workers ultimately were tested with nasal swabs, the process was stopped, epidemiologists said, because the technique was unreliable. 
" 'The folks on the Hill got swabbed, now you're not swabbing us,' " said Dr. Walks, who is black, recalling the uncomfortable questioning in the church. " 'White people got swabs, black people didn't get swabs.' "
People also questioned the switch from Cipro to doxycycline -- a far less expensive, but equally effective, antibiotic. 
"The white folks got Cipro -- we're getting doxy," Dr. Walks said, replaying the exchange. "They got the expensive drug -- you're trying to save money with us."
It was not just a matter of anger. The shifting understanding of anthrax also created doubt about just how much the epidemiologists should be trusted or believed. 
Dr. Richardson saw the doubt that Sunday night, as health officials distributed antibiotics to postal workers downtown. Around 10 p.m., Dr. Richardson was approached by a distraught man who said the disease agency was wrong to believe that only a directly poisoned letter was a threat. The man said he worked at Brentwood and knew how mail got tossed around in the sorting machines. 
"You don't know, it's not one place, things get mixed up," he said. "There has to be cross-contamination." In other words, even mail that came in contact with poisoned letters might not be safe.
"I had no idea what he was talking about," Dr. Richardson said. He told the man to share his information with the C.D.C.

Atlanta
Debating Public Policy At the C.D.C.
The national cerebrum of the anthrax crisis was a small conference room at Centers for Disease Control headquarters plastered with bioterror versions of Dr. Snow's cholera maps. There were detailed floor plans of newsrooms and Senate offices, and now, the shop floor at Brentwood Road, all color-coded to indicate the different paths the spores had traveled. 
Most of the room was taken up by a rectangular table with a speakerphone that linked the center's scientists with the other players in the investigation -- the F.B.I., the postal service, the homeland-security bureaucracy and local law-enforcement officials across the nation. The scientists found themselves exercising some unfamilar mental muscles. Dr. Perkins says he thought that a Cliff Notes compendium of fictional bioterror plots would have come in handy. 
It was in that conference room, on Monday, Oct. 22, that centers officials began debating what they say were among the most difficult questions the agency had ever addressed: Was the postal system itself contaminated? Should it be shut down? Such a decision, the officials knew, would rip through the economy, not to mention the delicate psyche, of a nation under siege. 
"Is there a health hazard here of such a magnitude that it would warrant that type of action?" asked Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, the centers' acting deputy director of infectious disease, who two decades before had seen the AIDS epidemic emerge in San Francisco. 
The magnitude of the anthrax hazard certainly seemed to be growing. Two Brentwood workers had died; two others were in intensive care. In New Jersey, a postal worker appeared to have the state's first case of inhalation anthrax. Four days earlier, state health officials closed the Postal Service's regional distribution center near Trenton. 
But there was also a conundrum underlying the debate. In an atmosphere of rising crisis, Dr. Gerberding and others felt huge pressure to act decisively, even as events in Washington had made it clear to them that decisiveness was hardly warranted.
What's more, they were in an unaccustomed, and uncomfortable, position of power. While the agency could only recommend shutting the system down, officials knew their advice would carry great weight. The debate became a test of leadership, science and nerve, all bound together by constant stress and sleepless nights. 
Dr. Walks, the Washington health commissioner, who participated in some of the discussions by speakerphone, said it had become hard to discern the line between the need to be confident and the need to be right. 
More than once, he said, as he stood alongside public officials at news conferences in Washington in mid-October, he inwardly groaned because old answers about anthrax were still being given and he realized that even information a week or two old could no longer be trusted. Some officials were still saying, for example, that a certain number of spores -- 8,000 to 10,000 was the commonly quoted figure -- were needed to contract inhalation anthrax. Given what was now known about the dangers for postal workers, perhaps that old assumption was no longer true either. 
"I think it's time for us to stop needing to say we know and let people know what we don't know," he recalled thinking at the time. "Because if we don't do that they won't believe us when we come to say we know stuff, and that's critical."
The verdict was to keep the system open -- not because it was deemed clean and uninfected, C.D.C. officials said, but because there simply was not enough evidence of widespread contamination. The finding did little to ease anxieties, though. Closing the system would have affected millions of people; not closing it might, too.

New York
A New Victim. A New Wave?
Dr. Stephen M. Ostroff's darkest hour came sometime before the dawn of Oct. 30. New York, he'd come to believe through a long, sleepless night, was under attack, and as the chief epidemiologist at the C.D.C.'s National Center for Infectious Diseases and the agency's point man for the city, the list of things he didn't know seemed endless. 
"It was my worst moment," he said.
He had just learned from the city's Department of Health that a 61-year-old stockroom clerk at a Manhattan hospital, Kathy T. Nguyen, was on a respirator and declining quickly from inhalation anthrax. 
Part of Dr. Ostroff's anxiety stemmed from the fact that Ms. Nguyen -- the city's first inhalation case -- fit no previous pattern. The first wave of anthrax-contaminated letters in mid-September had been aimed at news organizations; the second in early October had been sent to political leaders. Was she the sentinel patient of a third wave, focused on the health care system?
But he was also haunted that morning by the long shadow of Washington, and the presumptions that he and other epidemiologists had been so wrong about. Dr. Ostroff had been one of those playing down the threat to postal workers from sealed letters. "None of us, to our eternal dismay, would have ever imagined that an unopened letter could do what they did," he said. Would Ms. Nguyen's illness reveal yet another missed link in the chain of reasoning and evidence? 
Dr. Ostroff was hardly a novice. In 15 years at the disease control agency, he was one of the agency's most trusted detectives, helping to respond to the outbreak of hantavirus among American Indians in the Southwest, West Nile virus in New York, Ebola in Reston, Va. 
Now, on the morning of Oct. 30, preparing to help the city respond to this new threat, Dr. Ostroff anxiously arrived at City Hall so early that the night-duty police officer had to let him in. He was escorted to the mayor's anteroom, where he fell asleep on a couch. The mayor woke him up when he arrived for the 8 a.m. meeting about the Nguyen case. 
"We are about to see a lot of sick people in New York," Dr. Ostroff kept thinking. 
New York -- hardest hit by the Sept. 11 attacks -- still seemed deeply vulnerable, both to attack and to panic. The city's health department, only a few blocks from the still smoldering ashes of the World Trade Center, had been intently preparing for a bioterror attack that might send tens of thousands of acutely ill people to city hospitals all at once.
But as the inquiry intensified, the mysteries only deepened. Investigators could not find even a single spore of anthrax near Ms. Nguyen's home in the Bronx, or at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, where she worked. No else got sick, which eased anxieties at the health department but also added to the sense of incomprehensibility. 
Ms. Nguyen, who died Oct. 31, was not the harbinger of a feared new mass attack -- but neither, it seemed, would the evidence about her infection provide the break in the investigation that Dr. Ostroff and others had hoped for. One F.B.I. theory had been that Ms. Nguyen might have crossed paths with the bioterrorist. Now, all they knew for sure was that she had somehow been infected with anthrax in a place health officials could not find and in a way that had left no trace.

Connecticut
Revising the Textbook, One More Time
Dr. Joxel Garcia, Connecticut's health commissioner, had been working almost nonstop for six days to unravel the death of Ottilie Lundgren, the 94-year-old widow from Oxford, Conn., who on Nov. 21 became the nation's fifth fatality -- and his state's first -- attributed to inhalation anthrax.
Investigators had been sent to her favorite neighborhood dinner spot, her hairdresser, her bank, her church, her library and, of course, her local post office and her home. Nothing so far had turned up.
But on the evening of Nov. 27, Dr. Garcia's staff had made a discovery that at first seemed like wild coincidence: An 85-year-old man who had lived in the town of Seymour, about a mile and a half from Mrs. Lundgren, had also recently died. And he had lived right next door to a family that Postal Service officials said had received a letter postmarked in Hamilton, N.J., at nearly the same instant that the toxic letter to Senator Daschle had been processed.
Perhaps, this new evidence suggested, a letter that merely crossed paths with an anthrax-laced envelope could pick up enough spores to kill. If so, maybe that was how Mrs. Lundgren caught the disease, and her elderly neighbor, Oscar B. Haines -- and Ms. Nguyen in New York as well.
The implications were disturbing. Hundreds of thousands of letters -- perhaps millions -- had passed through the postal system since the anthrax mailings, and might now be contaminated with small amounts of anthrax that, if the theory held, might be lethal under certain conditions.
Dr. Garcia immediately called Gov. John Rowland, then the F.B.I., then the state's chief medical examiner. The first question on everyone's mind was as ghoulish as it was simple: Where was Mr. Haines's body now?
An F.B.I. agent and three state epidemiologists were dispatched to wake up the Farkas family, which had received the Hamilton letter, and swab their mailbox for spores. H. Wayne Carver II, the chief state medical examiner, tracked down the funeral home director who had Mr. Haines' body and ordered it sent over immediately to the state laboratory for examination.
Two months after the first anthrax victims like Ms. Huden had suffered in anonymity, the nation's sprawling investigation had come to this: a desperate search in the night for the body of a man who might or might not have had the disease, and who in any case could no longer be helped, but who might still bear silent witness for the prosecution.
The autopsy, begun at 2:47 a.m., revealed that Mr. Haines did not have anthrax. His heart had simply failed. Dr. Carver called Dr. Garcia at about 4 a.m. with the news.
But when the investigators arrived at the Farkas's house on Great Hill Road in Seymour, they found to their astonishment that the letter postmarked in Hamilton on Oct. 9 had, for other reasons, been saved. 
By Nov. 30, the investigators had the results -- the letter was positive for spores, and the news quickly spread out across the United States, once again changing the state of science about anthrax.
Cross-contamination was definitely possible. An innocuous letter, passing through the labyrinth of the postal system at the wrong moment, could become dangerous, as the Brentwood postal worker had insisted to Dr. Richardson weeks ago. Though it had not killed Mr. Haines, cross-contamination still might explain Mrs. Lundgren's death. 
Epidemiologists were still confused. How could anthrax that had merely settled on a safe envelope suddenly get back into the air so it could be inhaled, causing the more serious form of the disease? That spores could become airborne again in the whirring tumult of a mail-sorting machine now seemed perfectly reasonable, but on a kitchen table? The answer had been found when they went through Mrs. Lundgren's trash -- clue-hunting of the sort Dr. Snow himself would smile on.
Mrs. Lundgren, it turns out, was quite particular about her mail. Again and again, she tore her letters precisely in half before throwing them in the trash, an act that could easily send any dust or anthrax spores flying back into the air. 
The epidemiologists still did not know if in fact a cross-contaminated anthrax letter had arrived in Mrs. Lundgren's mailbox, and for all that they had learned, they didn't know whether, in the end, tearing such a letter in half had actually made a difference. But by then the idiosyncrasies of a little old lady seemed to be all they had to go on.
"In science, we keep the door open for everything," Dr. Garcia said then, two months and counting into the nation's anthrax inquiry.

B5) Chart: "How the Cases Unfolded"Anthrax infections that spread into a half dozen states and the District of Columbia, killing 5 people and affecting 18 others, unfolded in public in a sequence that differed markedly from the actual medical course of the outbreak. The first postal workers fell ill from anthrax long before health officials realized the risks they faced. These missed cases resulted in wrong, and ultimately fatal, assumptions by federal health officials who were trying to track down the cause of the infections. Sept. 18: An anthrax-laced letter postmarked in Trenton was sent to NBC and The New York Post. One letter infects two employees at NBC, while another infects three at The Post, even though it is never unsealed. Illnesses of at least two New Jersey postal workers appear related to these letters. Sept. 21: Johanna C. Huden, 31, New York Post editorial assistant and writer, notices blister on right finger. Blister bursts next day and in days following infection spreads. She goes to a doctor Sept. 29, then to two city hospital emergency rooms. But her cutaneous anthrax infection is not properly diagnosed for weeks. Recovered. Sept. 22: Richard Morgano, 39, a maintenance worker at Postal Service distribution center in Hamilton, N.J., has two mosquito-bite-sized spots on his arm. He goes to a doctor repeatedly starting Sept. 30, as infection spreads and his arms and shoulder swell. His cutaneous anthrax infection is not diagnosed for weeks. Recovering. Sept. 24: Ernesto Blanco, 73, mail room worker at American Media in Boca Raton, Fla., has onset of fatigue, which turns to fever, cough on Sept. 28.

Oct. 9: Anthrax-laced letters postmarked Trenton, for Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick J. Leahy. Letters apparently infect at least nine Washington and New Jersey postal workers. Two die. Oct. 12: Ms. O'Connor, NBC news aide, is confirmed to have cutaneous anthrax, the first case outside Florida. Same day, investigators discover anthrax-laced letter sent to NBC from Trenton, postmarked Sept. 18. Following her confirmation, cases at ABC, CBS, New York Post confirmed.

HEADLINE: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries To Miss Goals Despite Cuts 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
The slump in civil aviation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the reluctance of the Japanese government to spend more money on public works projects to stimulate the economy are clouding the future for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan's largest machinery maker.
 The company, whose products include jet engines and garbage incinerators, said today that it would eliminate 2,000 more jobs by 2006 and take other steps to cut costs. It has already announced 3,400 layoffs; it said it would save $2.5 billion from the new cutbacks. 
 Even so, it will probably take three more years for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to earn the $1.2 billion in profit it expected by March 2003, the company said.
Mitsubishi Heavy depends greatly on large construction projects in Japan to produce orders for products like power plants and pollution-control equipment. In past recessions, Japanese politicians have approved huge supplemental spending on public works projects. The country, however, ran up huge debts in the process, and the government's finances have been deep in deficit for years.
Junichiro Koizumi, who became prime minister early this year, has made taming the deficit and limiting new borrowing a central part of his program, and while his government has approved some supplemental spending, the scale has been smaller than in the past. 
Outside Japan, where Mitsubishi Heavy gets about 40 percent of its sales, the company has been stung by a downturn in corporate investment and the demand for aerospace equipment, including the engines it builds for Boeing.
"We rely on the American economy for profits, so the downturn in the global economy hurt us," said Takashi Nishioka, president of Mitsubishi Heavy. "The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 were the final blow."
The company lost 8.3 billion yen ($64 million) in the six months ended Sept. 30, a much narrower loss than in the comparable period a year earlier. But the company's performance fell well short of the 8 billion yen profit expected by analysts. Since then, the company's stock has bobbed up and down on political developments in Japan, and it closed up slightly today at 343 yen ($2.63) a share, but down 40 percent from its peak in late June.
Like its competitors, Mitsubishi Heavy is under pressure to reduce long-term debt and shed unprofitable divisions, but its financial straits seem relatively manageable compared with those of its closest rival, Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Mitsubishi Heavy has debts amounting to 73 percent of shareholders' equity, while Kawasaki Heavy owes 2.75 times its shareholders' equity. Mitsubishi Heavy plans to cut its interest-bearing debt 9 percent over four years, to a trillion yen ($7.66 billion).
Kawasaki Heavy has said it will split off its shipbuilding group next year to cut costs, while two other competitors, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries and Sumitomo Heavy Industries, have combined their shipbuilding units.

HEADLINE: Belgian Court Rejects Plan to Create Sabena Successor 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
A Belgian court surprised investors today by rejecting a crucial component of a government-backed plan to create a successor airline to Sabena, Belgium's bankrupt flag carrier. Sabena collapsed last month as the economic fallout from Sept. 11 amplified the financial strains on Europe's ailing second-tier airlines.
 The crux of the plan is a no-frills Sabena subsidiary, Delta Air Transport, which was not included in the parent company's bankruptcy filing on Nov. 7. The unit, known as D.A.T., is unrelated to Delta Air Lines, the American carrier. 
 A group of investors based in Brussels and known as SN Holdings agreed on Friday to buy Sabena's stake in D.A.T. for a token one euro (89 cents), but with conditions: About half of the unit's $97 million debt to Sabena's internal bank, Sabena Interservice Center, had to be written off and the rest converted to an equity stake, said the bank's vice president for corporate finance, Baudouin de Vaucleroy. SN Holdings also wanted reductions in D.A.T.'s lease payments for aircraft.
Virgin Express, a no-frills Belgian-based subsidiary controlled by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, had expressed interest in an alliance with D.A.T. and possibly a merger. 
Executing the plan required that Sabena Interservice Center file for bankruptcy protection. Earlier today the unit's creditors said they had agreed to the move, but the commercial court in Brussels said no.
The judge, Anne Spiritus-Dassesse, said in her ruling that Belgian law offered bankruptcy protection for corporate restructuring to keep running, not to merely sell assets, as Sabena Interservice Center was preparing to do. The effect of her ruling was to expose the bank to demands for immediate repayment of its debts.
Mr. de Vaucleroy said he was surprised by the ruling, since the creditors and the Belgian government, a half-owner of Sabena, supported the plan.
Marc Vandemeulebroeke, a lawyer for a bank creditor, Societe Generale, said the ruling was "very bad news" because it disrupted the plans for the successor, though "it's not the end of the show." 
Investors in SN Holding, led by Etienne Davignon and Maurice Lippens, were relying on a bankruptcy filing by the bank to take financial pressure off D.A.T. and help keep it flying. Mr. Davignon said on Belgian television that he and his partners had been "a little astonished" by the ruling. But he indicated that they would keep talking to the bank's creditors.
At least 6,000 jobs depend on D.A.T. emerging from the rubble of Sabena and staying in business; 7,000 more were lost when Sabena collapsed. 
Other European airlines have suffered to varying degrees since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, with majors like British Airways and Lufthansa trimming service and weaker rivals like Aer Lingus and Sabena pushed to the brink. Only low-cost carriers like Ryanair, based in Dublin, and EasyJet, based in London, have benefited.
Swissair collapsed under the strain of losses from stakes in several smaller carriers, including Sabena, and the withdrawal of Swissair's support brought down Sabena. But because national airlines are emblems of national prestige, both the Swiss and Belgian governments have been trying to fashion new flag carriers out of the remnants of the old -- Crossair in Switzerland and D.A.T. in Belgium.

HEADLINE: TURF; 
For Renters, the Map Is Redrawn

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
SO what if Santa didn't treat you right? You can go out and rent yourself a bargain apartment. Thousands have been marked down in Manhattan in the last three months, and good deals are emerging in some pockets where you would never expect to find them.
 Remember when Chelsea was so overrun with celebrities and moneyed culture vultures that you couldn't get a broker to call you back? Now agents are handing out their cellphone numbers to customers with abandon. Even parts of the Upper East Side, with its white-gloved doormen and entryway flower beds, are suddenly drifting back to earth. For the last three years, Manhattan's new renters didn't stand a chance. If they didn't write a whopping check at first sight -- including two or three months' deposit -- 20 people were lined up at the door, willing to do so. 
 But landlords have stopped gloating. On the eve of 2002, brokers are proclaiming a renters' market. Last week, Halstead/Feathered Nest, one of the largest real estate agencies in New York City, reported that rents had been marked down on about half the units on the open market (those that are not rent-controlled or rent-stabilized or in subsidized low-income housing). The Corcoran Group, another large real estate company, said that since Sept. 11, landlords have reduced the rents they are asking on more than 5,000 apartments. 
Anyone who has read a newspaper lately knows that landlords in Lower Manhattan, particularly in Battery Park City and the financial district, have been offering apartment hunters and current tenants discounts of up to 25 percent. But what they may not know is that reductions elsewhere in Manhattan average 10 to 30 percent, with the biggest concentrations in five less obvious areas: Chelsea, the West 40's and 50's, the East 40's around the United Nations, the eastern edge of the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side between 97th and 110th Streets.
"We need people to come back and rent," said Silvia J. Aboud, who manages rentals for Bellmarc Realty. "The landlords were used to having it all their way. But poof! Suddenly the renters are starting to breathe again." On Friday, Ms. Aboud gave a quick tour of six apartments for rent on the Upper East Side and in the East 40's, all marked down. Juggling listing sheets in the back of a taxi, she said that with more time, she could have shown 25 apartments under $2,000 a month, all on the Upper East Side.
Brokers say that as the economy has softened, neighborhoods with too many new rental buildings have inevitably been hit hard by bargain seekers, who are demanding 20 and 30 percent reductions, along with extras like one or more months rent-free and discounts on health club memberships. In a deluxe new building called the Pennmark near Pennsylvania Station (an area called the Tenderloin in the days of Boss Tweed, but now advertised as Chelsea), the developer has just dropped the rent on a two-bedroom apartment with two bathrooms, granite kitchen countertops and Woody Allen views of the Hudson River and downtown. Not only has he reduced the rent to $4,000 a month, but he's also offering to forgo three months' rent -- 25 percent off a year's total. He is throwing in a year's free membership in the rooftop health club.
Last December, the same Pennmark apartment would have cost closer to $5,000 a month, according to Daniel Segal, the rentals manager for Douglas Elliman, the city's largest real estate company.
A $4,000 apartment may not sound like a bargain -- especially to a tenant paying next to nothing for a rent-stabilized palace. But Manhattan's developers are wheeling and dealing, especially in neighborhoods on the edge -- on the far West Side or far East Side -- where construction of new rental towers has boomed in the last five years. Mr. Segal said all his rental customers are worried by the worsening economy "and would rather go to prime neighborhoods than the corners and edges of the city." (Some of them are buying. Brokers say that, with mortgage interest rates so low, the co-op and condo market has not been hit nearly so hard as the market for renters.)
On the Upper East Side, renters are finding reductions of 30 to 40 percent in some buildings, said Ms. Aboud of Bellmarc. Describing a $1,100-a-month studio near Gracie Square, she said that security was good in the area because the mayor's residence is there. "Dobermans patrolling," she said. "You name it." The apartment would have been taken "in a heartbeat" a year ago, she added.
Ms. Aboud said that east of Midtown, around the United Nations, many landlords are dropping the rents they are asking by 30 percent -- and sometimes throwing in a month or two rent-free.
"What's really crazy is that landlords, instead of giving one month's free rent, are giving two months -- and the customers aren't biting," she said. Two months' free rent on a one-year lease is a 16.7 percent reduction.
"But tenants don't have business minds," she continued. "They don't get it. They say, Why don't they drop the rent more?" (The reason is that landlords are hoping the market will improve. In addition, they got their construction loans by promising banks that they would charge higher rents; if they reduce rents too much, the banks may demand more collateral or even call in their loans, although that is unlikely.)
In one 1960's building with doormen in the East 40's near Second Avenue, Ms. Aboud showed a glamorous two-bedroom apartment with new white marble floor-to-ceiling tiles in the bathroom and black granite countertops in the kitchen. "It used to be $2,800," she said. "Now it's $2,350, and the developer told me yesterday he'd do the deal for $2,200." She paused. "And he'll throw in a month's rent."
Since Sept. 11, nearly all property below Houston Street -- whether for sale or for rent -- has suffered. But in the rest of Manhattan, including Harlem, the biggest, most expensive apartments were the first to be hit. (One Chelsea loft was originally priced at $14,000 a month but was cut to $7,500, Mr. Segal of Douglas Elliman said.) But now, the reductions have trickled all the way down to studios for rent.
"The day of the $1,300 studio is back," said Stan Ponte, downtown rental manager for Stribling & Associates. A year ago, such one-room apartments were edging up to $2,000 -- and in special cases beyond. That does not mean that every studio for rent in Manhattan is $1,300, but rather that the first have been spotted, like swallows returning. "Mark my words," Mr. Segal said, "we'll see the $1,000 studio again someday."
Mr. Segal and his colleague David L. Weiss showed several studios in Chelsea. In one, at 208 West 23rd Street, Mr. Weiss was quick to acknowledge the apartment's small size -- even for a studio -- and its ragged condition. "Would you let your daughter live here?" he asked. "I'm not sure I would." 
Whatever its condition, it is on the neighborhood's main thoroughfare, just a few doors from the Chelsea Hotel, and it is quiet. And it's $1,360.
In Chelsea, the agents said, $1,300 studios are starting to appear in older tenements. In a West 31st Street building, an impressive seven-room penthouse with three bedrooms and a terrace view that seems to put the Empire State Building in your lap has been reduced to $4,250 from $4,620. For all the apartment's charms, the building does have its drawbacks: the lobby is lined with brownish mock stones made of plaster, and on a recent visit a uniformed guard was chewing on a hamburger at the concierge desk.
Like Chelsea, the West 40's and 50's have had a boom in rental-apartment construction in the last five years, partly because land was relatively cheap there and partly because developers gambled that the area, which is west of Times Square, would become the next hot place to live. 
But the far eastern edge of the district has not caught on, and some agents wonder aloud whether too many rental towers have been built. Daniel Brodsky, president of the Brodsky Organization, one of Manhattan's biggest developers, said he is bringing rents down in his newest buildings "in the high 30's, mid-40's and mid-50's" -- anywhere that rents had reached levels that seem unrealistic now. And he is not the only one. "People are price-conscious now," he said, "and there's a lot of competition."
On the far side of town, in the east 40's near the United Nations, rents are also dropping. Last year, one-bedroom apartments in the Churchill, a tower at Second Avenue and 40th Street with doormen and a swimming pool, rented for $2,800. Equivalent apartments now go for $2,400. For years, agents considered this a "fringe" neighborhood, a long way from the subway and without a major park for walking the dog. But faced with a soaring rental market, developers bought into this area, too.
Brokers say there are discounts even on Fifth and Park Avenues, but they are rare. The real deals on the Upper East Side are in the post-World War II buildings east of Third Avenue. For example, a one-bedroom apartment at Third Avenue and 70th Street can be had for $1,275 a month, and Douglas Hochlerin, an independent broker, showed a distinctly unrenovated two-bedroom in a tenement on York Avenue near 76th Street for $1,600, just reduced from $2,099.
Brokers say that rents have held up in the prime stretch of the Upper West Side from the 70's to the 90's. But Brian G. Edwards, executive director of leasing at Halstead/ Feathered Nest, said that in a pocket between West 97th and West 110th Streets, from the Hudson River to Central Park West, rents in some buildings have dropped at least 30 percent from a year ago.
To rent them, landlords are spiffing up. In a well-maintained classic building at 207-211 West 106th Street, John Wasserman, the rentals listing manager at Halstead, showed a newly renovated one-bedroom with herringbone oak floors trimmed in ebony. The landlord had the walls skimmed with plaster and added new door moldings and baseboards. (Even the halls outside the door are stunning, with black and white tiled floors, white marble stairs and trim painted a deep red.) The rent is $2,200.
Just as there are pockets where rents are particularly low, there are some where rents have remained steady. While they are still strong in the heart of the Upper West Side, they are, perhaps more surprisingly, holding up on Avenues A through C -- "Alphabet City" -- in the East Village. In that section, agents say, the rents haven't gone down because the area was already perceived to be an enclave of bargains because of its scrappy, bohemian character. Bottom-feeders are now heading there in droves, keeping rents at or near the levels of a year ago.
Manhattan brokers and developers say they will be satisfied as long as the apartments keep renting -- even if for less. But many apartments are staying emptier longer than in the last five years, and landlords are doing what they can to fill them up.
"The landlords are saying let's make a deal," said Ms. Aboud of Bellmarc. "For crying out loud, this is the time to rent."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
A new study questions how much anyone really knows about the real rate of inflation in the U.S.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and of a new journal of social health, Indicators. Both publications are based in Armonk, N.Y. He is an adjunct professor of humanities at Cooper Union. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
IN 1997, a commission appointed by the Senate Finance Committee concluded that the annual Consumer Price Index computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was probably 1.1 percent too high, and perhaps even more.
 The Boskin commission's findings, named after its chairman, Michael Boskin, a Stanford economist who served as President George Bush's chief economic adviser, made headlines in the financial news media, and many took its conclusions as gospel. 
 But perhaps they shouldn't have. At the time, many members of the Senate Finance Committee were cheered by the findings. To them, it meant the federal government could justify reducing Social Security benefits, because payments are tied to increases in the price index. So are countless wage contracts, as are the federal income-tax brackets. 
If it was right, it also meant that both the economy and productivity were growing faster than reported, a boon to arguments on Wall Street and in Washington that the nation was embarked on a new economic revolution.
But a new, comprehensive study sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, and partly commissioned by the Bureau of Labor Statistics itself, raises serious questions about just how much the Boskin commission or anyone else knows about the true rate of inflation.
The study, undertaken by a panel of 13 economists from a wide variety of institutions and led by Charles Schultze of the Brookings Institution, restores one's faith in cool-headed economic analysis and measured use of economic theory.
"It is the report that the Boskin commission should have done," says Joel Popkin, a Washington economic consultant.
The main contention of the Boskin report was that the Labor Department's statistical experts did not fully take into account the improved quality of many products. You may pay $1 for a razor, but if you get twice as many shaves as before, you are really getting more for your money. In effect, you are paying 50 cents for that razor.
The same is true with automobiles. If they are more durable or have automatic window locks, say, buyers are getting a little more for their money. The labor bureau basically agrees with the theory and makes many such adjustments. But Mr. Boskin's group and many other economists contend that the adjustments are not adequate and that reported inflation has been much too high.
The problem with that argument, says the Schultze panel, is that such estimates are difficult to make and easy to exaggerate. It points out many holes in the Boskin analysis. For one thing, in some cases, it is likely the Bureau of Labor Statistics over-adjusts for quality, meaning inflation is too low, not too high. For another, the Schultze panel cites evidence that the Boskin commission may have overstated quality in important areas.
For example, Jack Triplett, a former bureau economist now with Brookings, says the Boskin commission's analysis of quality increases for cars was simply misinformed. Two government economists, Brent Moulton and Karen Moses, seriously criticize the work on housing and medical care.
One of the striking oversights of the Boskin report, I believe, was that it paid almost no attention to areas in which product quality deteriorated, like airline service and education. And in the years since, consumer surveys consistently have found declining satisfaction for both goods and services.
This Christmas season brought the point home for me. My new printer broke down within a year, my laptop within 18 months. My new answering machine garbles messages.
One assumption of the Boskin commission was rejected outright by the Schultze panel. How do you take account of the benefits to consumer well-being of new products?
Some ingenious economists believe you can assume the product already exists but is sold at a price so high that no one will buy it. They argue that the difference between the imagined price and the actual price of the new product, once introduced, should be included as a reduction in the price index. But such an estimate is difficult to make credibly, and including benefits from new goods as a reduction of inflation, the panel concluded, is itself theoretically questionable.
The most important contribution of the panel, however, was to clarify the central assumptions about the uses of the C.P.I. and other price indexes.
The simplest way to measure prices is to compute the changes for a fixed basket of goods and services. This is what probably most Americans think the consumer price index does. But in the early 1960's, a government commission urged the Bureau of Labor Statistics to adopt a broader concept: the index should reflect the cost of maintaining a given "standard of living." Thus, if products improve, the standard of living improves, or it costs less to maintain the old standard of living.
Certainly quality improvements have to be taken into account. But so must many other factors that affect the standard of living, including the quality of public goods, like transportation and the environment.
The Schultze panel concludes that such an index is inherently too ambiguous to develop in an objective way. How does one account for traffic congestion, for example? A car is worth less if traffic deteriorates. If the crime rate rises, people may have to buy more security devices. Should that be translated into a fall in living standards?
The panel also cites evidence that consumers need constant improvements just to remain as satisfied as they were. How does one incorporate rising expectations into an index that measures the standard of living?
The Schultze panel therefore recommends a conditional cost of living index that is relatively unambiguous, including quality adjustments but deliberately leaving out issues like congestion, environmental degradation and consumer expectations.
The panel makes no precise estimate of whether the C.P.I. overstates or understands the true rate of inflation. But given the questions the panel raises about the commission's central assumptions and its analysis of specific product areas, the claim that the C.P.I. has been and may remain seriously overstated is not nearly as clear-cut as many economists have assumed. And reported inflation has already been markedly reduced through recent changes introduced by government statisticians themselves.
I hope this report is put between hard covers soon. It is my business book of the year.

HEADLINE: American Companies Had Nearly a Million Layoffs This Year 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
United States companies, led by Motorola and Boeing, laid off about a million workers in 2001, as the economy lapsed into recession. It was the largest reduction in employment in at least a dozen years. 
 In 2001, there was "a quantum jump" in job cuts, said John Challenger, chief executive of the corporate recruiting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has work-force reduction data going back to 1989. "There's never been downsizing on this scale," Mr. Challenger said. 
 The breaking of the Internet and telecommunications bubble last year spilled over to 2001, throwing tens of thousands out of work at Motorola, JDS Uniphase, Lucent Technologies and Solectron. Motorola, a leading maker of mobile phones, cut 42,900 jobs. Layoffs accelerated after the Sept. 11 attacks crippled sectors of the economy like the aviation industry. More job cuts were announced after Sep. 11 than in any year from 1993 to 1997, Mr. Challenger said. 
The nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent in November from 4 percent in 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Several Issues Combine to Cause Biggest Oil Price Jump of the Year

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Prices for crude oil recorded their largest jump of the year on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, as traders became increasingly convinced that oil-producing nations would follow through on plans to cut production in January.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced last month that it intended to cut output by 1.5 million barrels a day to reverse the 24 percent slide in oil prices since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but the plan was contingent on persuading non-OPEC producers -- led by Russia, Mexico and Norway -- to cooperate by cutting their production by another 500,000 barrels. 
 Over the last week, several OPEC officials asserted that they had obtained agreement from the major non-OPEC countries, or at least pledges close enough to their goal, to allow the plan to go ahead. Yesterday, Ali al-Naimi, oil minister of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest and most important producer by far, added his voice to that chorus, telling reporters as he arrived in Cairo for Friday's meeting of the cartel that the cutbacks would be ratified. 
Prices for crude oil to be delivered in February reached $21.43 during the day -- their highest level in more than a month -- before settling back to $20.27 a barrel. That was still an increase of $1.65 a barrel, or 8.4 percent higher than the closing price on Friday, the last day of trading before the Christmas holiday. Heating oil for delivery next month also jumped 8.4 percent on the Nymex, closing at 59.46 cents a gallon.
Energy analysts said the strength of the price jump reflected more than simply the comments by the influential Mr. Naimi. Even so, some of them remained skeptical that the higher price would hold.
Contributing to the price increase was the belated arrival of colder weather in the northern regions of the United States, which is expected to push up demand for heating oil. In addition, traders said, demand in the futures market came from speculators seeking to cover short positions they had taken in the belief that prices would continue to fall.
Once prices started climbing yesterday, the fact that there were fewer traders on hand than usual to absorb the buying pressure added still more momentum. The International Petroleum Exchange, the London energy market that typically interacts with the New York exchange, was closed for Boxing Day, a British holiday.
"There was a combination of things driving the rally," said Mike Fitzpatrick, an energy analyst at Fimat USA, a New York brokerage. "Our fundamental analysis, though, is that it will be hard to sustain."
The downward pressure on oil prices has come from a combination of recession in much of the developed world and warmer than usual weather. Weather forecasters like AccuWeather and Jon B. Davis, the staff meterologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago, agree that the warm weather pattern ended this week and that the rest of the winter may be as cold or even colder than normal.
But energy analysts doubt that prices can rebound more than temporarily into OPEC's target range of $22 to $28 a barrel without an economic recovery in the United States and other major industrial nations.
The proposed cutbacks would amount to about 6.5 percent of OPEC's current daily output of a little more than 23 million barrels, which accounts for about two-thirds of the total world oil exports. They come on top of prior announced reductions aimed at cutting production by 3.5 million barrels a day, or 13 percent.
But the cartel has never been able to fully enforce such measures as individual members jockey to expand their share of the shrunken pie. Analysts have estimated that actual production is running 350,000 barrels a day more than OPEC's goals. And nonmembers, particularly cash-strapped Russia, have been even more reluctant to cut back on sales in the hope of bolstering prices.
The current estimate is that nonmembers will cut output by 460,000 to 473,000 barrels a day in January, with Russia and Norway both cutting output by 150,00 barrels a day and Mexico cutting 100,000 barrels from its output. But at least some of Russia's expected reduction is nothing more than a reflection of the normal seasonal difficulties of transporting and loading oil at Russian ports during the height of the winter. Many analysts expect exports to climb again as soon as warmer weather returns.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said that OPEC's efforts to shore up the price had already been compromised by the length of time it has taken to put together the agreement the cartel is expected to ratify in the meeting starting Friday. Even if the producers stick to their pledges, it will be well into January before shipping schedules are rearranged to reflect the new export levels and February before supplies actually tighten significantly, Mr. Fitzpatrick said.
"By then," he said, "the winter heating season is almost over."

HEADLINE: A Farewell to the Franc: Little Sorrow in France 

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
Just as it seemed apt for the land of the Gauls to be ruled by de Gaulle, so it was that the land of the Franks -- also known as France -- had a currency called the franc. Oddly, Belgium and Switzerland then borrowed the name, but their francs always needed extra labeling -- the Belgian franc and the Swiss franc were not quite the genuine article.
 The franc, the real franc, was France. 
 Such was the affinity that France used bank notes to boast its cultural and intellectual heritage: Marie and Pierre Curie are currently portrayed on the 500-franc bill, Gustave Eiffel on the 200, Paul Cezanne on the 100, Antoine de Saint-Exupery on the 50. And before them, Victor Hugo, Moliere, Racine, Voltaire, Debussy and others did their bit. 
So, for a land that cherishes patriotic symbols, these must be sad days. The disappearance of the franc into the euro on Jan. 1 must surely be provoking twinges of nostalgia, perhaps even outright pain.
Well, no.
Unlike the United States, or postwar Germany, France has never measured its national worth by the value of its currency. A good thing, too. During much of the 20th century, the franc brought France nothing but discomfort. Little wonder that few French seem upset by its imminent demise.
"We're used to not having a strong franc," said Dominique Borde, 60, a respected French lawyer. "The franc is an economic symbol and we always thought we could have a society without an economy. We never thought we should live by a balance sheet. We're proud of art, culture, intellectual life. Financial and economic matters are not what we are proud of."
Closer inspection shows why.
Even the circumstances of its birth were embarrassing. King Jean II ordered creation of a "franc d'or" -- a gold franc -- on Dec. 5, 1360, on his return from imprisonment in England. While the coin carried an image of the king of the Franks in armor and on horseback, its name was derived from "franc des Anglais" -- meaning the king was "free of the English."
Within 25 years, this franc vanished, replaced first by the gold ecu and followed over the centuries by the louis and new versions of the ecu. In the 18th century, the prevailing currency was the livre and its components, the sou and the denier.
Then, after the 1789 French Revolution, came a new order. Napoleon founded the Bank of France, resuscitated the franc and stamped his effigy on the new coins. Remarkably, this currency survived not only the 1815 battle of Waterloo, but also the 1848 popular insurrection, the 1871 Paris Commune and even World War I. But in the chaos of the 1920's and 1930's, when the dollar and pound remained strong, the franc steadily lost value.
With Germany's conquest of France in 1940, the franc as such lived on, but new coins and bills were issued by the collaborationist Vichy government, some with the image of its chief of state, Marshal Philippe Petain. The value of the franc was in turn distorted by the limitations imposed by rationing and the excesses of the black market. Only the occupation forces were free to buy goods or entertainment at artifically low official prices.
Understandly, when liberation came in 1944, France wanted to bury these memories. The Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories had different ideas. Before D-Day, the United States and Britain had already decided to administer France as an occupied land. When their troops landed on June 6, 1944, they brought their own currency, new franc bills freshly printed in Philadelphia and London.
The American and British francs were not even alike. The Americans printed 50,- 100- and 1,000-franc bills; the British 500- and 1,000-franc notes. The American francs were inscribed with the word "France" because President Roosevelt vetoed "Republique Francaise," arguing that Washington should not define France's future government. (The British francs proclaimed France to be a republic.)
Either way, back home from his long exile in London, Gen. Charles de Gaulle would tolerate neither new occupation nor new currency. He denounced the currency as "fake money," and the French quickly unloaded the foreign francs. By August 1944, just two months after D-Day, the new currency was withdrawn and the old franc prevailed.
Its troubles, though, were far from over.
In the next 15 years, as France wrestled with political instability, inflation soared and devaluation followed devaluation. By the time de Gaulle was recalled to power in 1958, the currency was a shadow of its old self: in 1944, the dollar was worth 50 francs; in 1958, it cost 420 francs. De Gaulle took drastic action. On Jan. 1, 1960, the old franc lost two zeros and became the new "strong" franc. "It was a gimmick, but it helped to convince the French that their currency had some value," said Gilbert Michlin, 75, a retired French businessman. "Since the war, the French have always had an inferiority complex with the respect to the German mark."
Since then, the value of the dollar has fluctuated -- 10 francs in the early 1980's, below 5 francs in the early 1990's and 7.46 francs today -- but the franc nonetheless steadily lost value against the German mark. Indeed, one key reason that France promoted creation of a single European currency was to fuse the franc and the mark. Not coincidentally, the decision to do so came in 1991 after German unification threatened to create a still stronger Germany.
"Now, if the euro devalues against the dollar, it won't be the fault of the franc," Mr. Michlin added.
On Tuesday, the currency change finally takes place in France and 11 other European countries. With the euro valued at 6.55957 francs, government offices, banks and businesses here have issued free calculators to help shoppers convert between the franc and euro. Automated teller machines have been supplied with the new currency, and merchants will be making change with it, too.
And yet, France being France, for all the public's readiness, things may still go wrong after Jan. 1. Adept at timing work stoppages to cause maximum disarray, French labor unions have announced that bank employees will go on strike to demand higher wages on Jan. 2. So, this may be an historic moment, but it may also have to be delayed.

HEADLINE: Locally, Big Discounts Draw Crowds and Dismay 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Lisa Blum braved the crowds at Bloomingdale's flagship Manhattan store yesterday to stock up on Christmas ornaments, some marked down by as much as 75 percent. Then she planned to head over to the linen department to pick up some sheets she had spotted before the holiday, which were now on sale.
 The day after Christmas, traditionally the time to return gifts that are either ill-fitting or ill-suited, has a different purpose for bargain hunters like Ms. Blum, who reads palms for a living. 
 "Whatever you didn't get for Christmas you get now," she said.
If conventional wisdom once held that the holiday shopping season ended on Dec. 24, that thinking became outdated once consumers had been conditioned to wait for post-Christmas sales. Indeed, the week after Christmas can often account for as much as 10 percent of a retailer's holiday intake, said Scott Krugman, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation.
But as if the economic recession, increasing unemployment, post-Sept. 11 blues, unseasonably warm temperatures and the worst holiday sales in a decade were not enough, retailers had another hurdle to face this year: Dec. 26 was in the middle of the week, on a day when many people had to work. 
At the Livingston Mall in Livingston, N.J., many stores were nearly empty yesterday and customers seemed to be window-shopping rather than buying. Retailers said they expected business to pick up in the evening.
At department stores around the city, people carrying unwanted gifts lined up at cash registers. Among them was Lee Simpson, a first-grade teacher from Manhattan, who waited 15 minutes to return a pair of mittens. But she also took the opportunity to buy herself a pink Pashmina shawl, reduced to $120 from $270, using coupons from a Bloomingdale's circular.
At Macy's, Marlene Rivera, a pediatrician from the Bronx, was in a crowd of women gathered around a display where cosmetics cases were on sale for $15. She was not returning presents but was searching for what she called "leftover gifts," for co-workers. "I'm shopping today because I know I can get a good deal," she said.
Laura Cruz, an administrator at New York University, was taking a break after shopping for bedding for three hours. But she was still looking for purses and cases for contact lenses. "The things I got for other people I now want for myself," she said.
Some shoppers said they were disappointed with the markdowns. "These are the same piddling sales that they offer all year long," said John Cappelletti, a drama teacher from Manhattan, who was exchanging a black suede hat at Bloomingdale's and buying a wool scarf that was marked down to $23 from $40.
Other customers, like Lola Francis and Khalilah Dozier, both from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, found that their strategy of waiting until after Christmas to buy things they wanted had misfired. The Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger baby clothes they had their eyes on were no longer in stock. "We're going to Baby Gap and Macy's," Ms. Francis said with an air of determination. "There will be others."
But while crowds jammed the sidewalk in front of Macy's and long lines formed at the Old Navy store on 34th Street, small shops farther downtown were doing very little business. All along West Eighth Street, the shops were practically empty, parking spaces were plentiful and few people were actually buying. 
"It doesn't even feel like there was a Christmas," said Yvette Ruiz, a saleswoman at Tosini, a shoe store on Eighth Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. Tosini says its holiday sales have declined by 60 percent since last year.
The few customers strolling on Eighth Street were not buying.
"The only thing I'm buying is food," said Scott Schroeder, 26, who has been unemployed since the dot-com company where he worked went under in April. "We're expert window shoppers."
Unlike most shoppers at the Livingston Mall yesterday, Michael Bianchi, a student from East Hanover, N.J., was laden with bags from four different stores, after spending all but $25 of the $500 he received as gifts from his family. "Since everything is on sale," Mr. Bianchi, 16, said, "I figured I'd make the most of it and get some of the things I wanted while I still have money and before the prices go up."
Christine Darcy, a nurse from Florham Park, N.J., came to the mall just to exchange a clothing gift. "After eight years of marriage, my husband should know my size by now," she said.
Ms. Darcy said she did not plan to buy anything else. "It's a shame to let these sales go to waste," she said, "but who knows how the economy is going to wind up, so it's better to save now, no matter how great the temptation to spend is."

HEADLINE: Pataki Says $700 Million in Aid Will Go to Downtown Businesses 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki announced a plan yesterday to distribute $700 million, the first installment of federal aid meant specifically for economic development, to businesses in Lower Manhattan.
 The funds are for small businesses and retailers crippled by the attack on the World Trade Center, as well as large corporations that the state and the city hope to keep in the downtown area. The money, in grants, loans and tax incentives, should begin flowing to downtown businesses in late January, after a two-week public review and approval of the plan by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
 State officials estimate that the attacks in Lower Manhattan disrupted more than 10,000 businesses and 377,000 workers, some of whom were were forced to relocate. The state has a grant program that provides $10,000 each to retailers and other small businesses whose work was disrupted by the attack; the federal money will let the state raise the individual cap on the program to $100,000. Companies that suffered property damage are eligible for up to $200,000.
Governor Pataki said the plan would "help bring these businesses back, keep New York's economy moving forward and help to revive our nation's economy." He added, "This marks a very significant step for New York's comeback."
The Bush administration initially promised to send $20 billion in aid to New York City, although New York lawmakers have been increasingly worried that the city may never get all of the money. Last week, the House and the Senate agreed to provide $8.2 billion toward that goal. The federal government has already reimbursed the city and the state for about $3 billion spent on rescue operations and the cleanup of the trade center site. 
The attack has had a devastating effect on Lower Manhattan. Some investment banks and law firms have moved to Midtown or New Jersey, leaving behind millions of square feet of empty office space. Some residential tenants have fled the area and many businesses are plagued by problems with mass transit and other issues, like New Yorkers' reluctance to work near the trade center site, concerns about air quality and the absence of an estimated 100,000 people who worked in the trade center and the surrounding area. With many tourists wary of flying to New York, hotels, restaurants and Broadway shows have also been hard hit.
"They've done a very good job of balancing the need to get some money out the door for small businesses and in designing a discretionary incentive program for larger employers that we want to attract or retain in Lower Manhattan," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, which oversees a business improvement district that includes 14,000 companies in the financial district. "It's a good start."
The governor's spending plan allocates $371 million for assisting small businesses and $285 million in grants, loans and tax incentives to retain jobs or attract corporations to Lower Manhattan. Another $25 million is set aside for rebuilding public transportation and communication networks. The spending plan indicated that up to $14 million would go for the administration of the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation, which was created by the state to coordinate the work and the development of a major memorial at the trade center site.
"We're going to broaden our programs and raise the caps on financial assistance for both loans and grants for small business in Lower Manhattan," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation.
The plan was described as the New York State Action Plan, a product of the Empire State Development Corporation in consultation with the city Economic Development Corporation. The publication of a full plan, accompanied by a comment period, were conditions placed on the grant by the Department of Housing and Urban Development when it allotted the money. 
The text is available in Empire State's office at 633 Third Avenue, at the agency's walk-in center at 110 Maiden Lane and on the Web at www.nylovessmallbiz.com.
Some economists suggested that the federal aid was too narrowly focused on businesses based in Lower Manhattan, or those with customers primarily from downtown. Thousands of Midtown hotel workers, for instance, lost their jobs after the attack when tourists all but disappeared from New York, said James A. Parrott, deputy director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research organization supported by labor unions. 
A recent study by the institute found that 80,000 workers in New York were likely to lose their jobs as a result of the attack. That figure does not include an estimated 25,000 jobs that moved to New Jersey.
"It's clear that there were a lot of workers who lost their jobs, not only in Lower Manhattan, but throughout the city because of the attack," Mr. Parrott said. "Companies hiring new employees should be asked to first look at workers now unemployed because of Sept. 11."

HEADLINE: Hungry, Cold and Stuck in Line; 
Food Pantries Find Charity Dwindling as Need Grows

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
There is free food in New York City, but for the hungry to get some, they must often set aside their dignity. They must also set aside a part of their day to stand in a food pantry line. 
 The line outside the Bronx Seventh-day Adventist Church at 1695 Washington Avenue starts forming just after sunrise, about 7:15, most mornings. The ragged men and women shuffle up to the wooden doors as if from nowhere, dressed in thrift-store parkas and old wool caps. 
 A junkyard dog, the color of rusty iron, begs for breakfast on the sidewalk, and nobody talks much. It is still too early for conversation, and the few words exchanged are mostly vague grumblings about lost jobs and the hard December cold. 
An entire system exists to feed these people, from the warehouse at the Hunts Point Produce Market, where donated food is shipped out in 18-wheelers every day, to the food pantries that distribute boxes of raisins and cans of pink Atlantic salmon. But with donations sinking in the wake of the terrorist attacks, and the need for food increasing, the system is in danger of collapse.
Perhaps 1.5 million New Yorkers now rely on food pantries, experts on hunger say, and since Sept. 11, more than 60 percent of them are taking donations for the first time. Statistics, however, are one-dimensional and tell only part of the story. The fleshed-out tale can be told by following a delivery of food.
The food at the Seventh-day Adventist church is given out in small blue plastic bags. The bags contain fresh apples, canned sliced peaches, black-eyed peas and boxes of farina. Tins of beef stew are also included if some happen to be on hand.
The pantry, in Bathgate in the Bronx, is much like others throughout the city. The hungry line up after sunrise for a numbered ticket. They return at dusk with metal pushcarts to trade their tickets for a meal.
At 7 a.m. a week ago Monday, Ricky Gibbs stood beneath the church awning with his fists jammed in the pockets of his secondhand coat. He lost his job as a machinist last month and now lives with his family in a homeless shelter around the block. His older daughter, Lakeisha, is 4; Kendra is 1.
"I'm here to get the food because I need the food," he said. It was his first time in a pantry line.
"I thought to myself, 'What if my friends see me standing out here?' " he went on, as the dog, known as Cindy, scoured a nearby patch of sidewalk with her snout. "It used to bother me, but now it don't. I'm out of work. I got to do what I got to do to feed my kids."
So Mr. Gibbs, 39, stood there until 11 o'clock, when the pantry opened and someone put a ticket in his hand.
Hours earlier and miles to the east, Jose Lopez zipped through a warehouse in the Hunts Point market on a pallet jack. He speared a shipment of canned beef stew and swung the pallet into the truck that idled outside Loading Bay 8.
Food for Survival, the city's largest food bank, runs the 90,000-square-foot warehouse. Every morning for years, the group has canvassed the market, seeking donations of canned tomatoes or wilted lettuce or whatever else is left.
This year has not been easy.
The slow economy and the loss of thousands of jobs after the World Trade Center attack have heightened demand at food pantries, but the supply of donations is decreasing, according to a study the group released last month. Individual donors had already given money to other charities and could not afford to give much more, they said. 
Mr. Lopez checked his manifest under a desk lamp that seemed to cast more shadows than light. A dozen deliveries were headed out; each contained less food than they would have last year. "It's getting harder, but that's what I think about in the Christmas season," he said. "Making sure we don't have hungry people left to feed."
Ousmane Kaba, a truck driver, winched up the parking brake of his truck at 6:36 a.m. The truck rolled out of the parking lot, groaning under a brightening sky. Nineteen pallets were in the back of the giant rig.
"With all the layoffs, we are doing more deliveries now but the amount of food is much the same," he said. "Many people, they live paycheck to paycheck. If they get laid off, there is trouble right away."
The food rolled north on the Bruckner Expressway, then west on Tremont Avenue. The sun began to rise, and the first pale sheets of light reminded Mr. Kaba of something that he saw last week.
"It was a morning, like this," he said. "I go to a church in Brooklyn. There is a long line of people already waiting. But there isn't parking and I left the truck a block or two away."
He downshifted for a traffic light.
"One lady was very drunk. She started screaming, 'Why are you so far away? Why are you late?' I wasn't mad, though. It made me understand how much they need this food."
Mr. Kaba pulls up to the Seventh-day Adventist church just past 7, and he and his crew stroll down to the snack truck on the corner for some coffee. Ricky Gibbs is waiting, a look of fear and hunger in his eye.
At 8:10 a.m., James B. Brown arrives. He is the church's director for community ministries. Mr. Brown unlocks the metal gate and walks inside. In a large room with folding tables and a mural depicting Christ, where the food will eventually be placed in plastic bags, he explains the current climate.
"We serve over 1,000 people here every day," he says as Mr. Kaba wheels the food inside and church volunteers start trickling in to help pack the bags. "When we saw 300 people, we thought it was a lot. That's been the increase since September."
Whole dried figs come in. Instant mashed potatoes come in. Jellied cranberry sauce comes in. It is 10 a.m., and Emma Bruce comes in as well. Ms. Bruce, 67, is a retired laundrywoman who sets to work within the hour, packing bags. "The food comes in pretty regular," she says. "But it's slowed down a bit. Sometimes it's not enough."
Outside the church, the line has grown long and Mr. Gibbs is taking pointers from some regulars. A woman tells him about a Catholic school on Freeman Street where free toys are being handed out for Christmas. He gets his ticket -- No. 1 -- and plans to visit the school on the woman's advice.
The wind has picked up when he returns at 4 p.m. Once again, he is first in line. His wife, Teresa, is with him. Lakeisha stands beside their pushcart, and her nose runs. A bundle is in the cart, and the bundle starts to move. It is little Kendra, wrapped tight in a blanket.
The Gibbs family waits. Four o'clock, 4:30, 4:45. Mr. Gibbs tells his daughters it will be only another minute. The light begins to fail, and it is cold.
"We're going to eat this food," he says, as if to himself. "Slowly but surely. Slowly but surely."
Now it is dark and the door cracks open, spilling a bar of light. "No. 1," yells Mr. Brown. Mr. Gibbs moves in.
He has to pull Kendra from the pushcart to fit the packages of food inside. But once they are safely stowed, he puts the girl back in.
Then they walk away, the wheels of their pushcart rattling. They are four people, heading off together to eat.

HEADLINE: Late Shopping Gives Retailers A Slight Boost 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
A surge of last-minute shopping may have given the nation's retailers and the economy a small boost, according to several reports on holiday sales released yesterday.
 The 11th-hour sales gains will not add much to retailers' profits because most of the increases were bought with dizzying price cuts like 70 percent off gold and diamond jewelry at Kmart and 75 percent off sweaters at Neiman Marcus. Still, several economists said the deep discounts that moved merchandise out of the stores could be good for the overall economy. 
 "The key issue this Christmas was whether retailers were going to be able to empty their shelves of inventory so that they would be in position to start ordering from the factory again," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Deloitte Research, who specializes in consumer spending. "The silver lining of this Christmas is they were able to accomplish that through very aggressive discounting." 
Nonautomotive retailing accounts for a little more than a quarter of the country's gross domestic product, Mr. Steidtmann said.
Some New York area retailers found it hard to lure many shoppers to spend heavily on the first day of post-holiday sales. Page C4. 
Still, nationwide, pre-Christmas sales in stores open at least a year rose 2.2 percent over 2000, according to TeleCheck Services Inc., which publishes one of several holiday spending indexes. That was the smallest increase since 1997, but it included positive results for a number of merchants. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, said sales had increased around 6 percent, at the high end of its predicted range, and other discounters also reported strong growth. Department stores did not fare as well, but their results were no worse than analysts had been expecting. Several Internet retailers reported solid sales gains. 
But there were far too few procrastinating purchasers to make this a glowing season. Unseasonably warm weather and a general malaise after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 kept many shoppers out of stores for the first three weeks after Thanksgiving, and many industry experts still believe that when all is said and done, holiday sales at major retail chains will not rise much more than 1 percent over last year.
But clearly, enough consumers went to the mall once Santa's sleigh was in sight to make a difference in the final tally.
"The last four days were especially strong in the context of the recession," said Dr. William Ford, the senior adviser to TeleCheck Services Inc. "The last week had to be up by more than 3 percent."
New York State had a particularly strong comeback over the holiday season, Dr. Ford said, with sales increasing 2.5 percent over last year. 
The TeleCheck Retail Index is based on a year-over-year comparison of the dollar value and the number of checks written by consumers at 27,000 stores. Because the TeleCheck index includes sales at a huge variety of stores, including mom-and-pop operations, its results sometimes differ from indexes measuring only chain store sales. 
In fact, other summations of holiday sales published yesterday were noticeably less optimistic. Redbook Research, which focuses more heavily on apparel retailers, said seasonally adjusted sales for the first three weeks of December, through last Saturday, were down 0.6 percent from the comparable period in 2000. 
Still, everyone seemed to agree that last-minute shopping, particularly on Christmas Eve, helped the picture a lot.
"Christmas Eve day was very big for us," said Douglas Kline, a spokesman for Target Stores, who said sales exceeded their projections. "Nationwide we had very big sales volume. We were good during the weekend, but something happened on Christmas Eve day and we had dramatically positive sales."
Discounters like Target and Wal-Mart, which dominated the holiday selling season as usual, were perhaps the greatest recipients of last-minute consumer largess. Wal-Mart said busy stores over the four-day weekend would contribute to healthy 6 percent sales growth and protect its profit margins. The company also said it had actually run counter to the rest of the country and put fewer items on sale this year than last. 
Department stores, as expected, fared far worse than the discounters. Still, the weekend flood of customers helped many stores contain losses. Federated Department Stores, the parent company of chains including Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Burdines, reported yesterday that sales were on track to decline 7 to 10 percent for the combined months of November and December. Sears, Roebuck predicted that it would see sales declines in the low single digits.
Those results came at a price, however, as retailers had to dramatically slash prices to get shoppers' attention in a highly promotional season. Along the nation's great shopping thoroughfares, sale signs were more common than American flags. 
While customers reveled in the steep discounts, the lower prices will certainly affect profits come January.
"Despite the fact that sales increased, you are not going to see earnings rise," said Richard Church, a retail stock analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "Mostly you are seeing retailers empty the shelves of inventory so they are positioned properly for the upcoming year."
Several of the biggest Internet retailers had strong seasons. Although there has been a draconian winnowing among Internet merchants the last 18 months, the survivors are reaping the rewards of a small but still growing segment. Yahoo said shopping sales made through its site rose 86 percent this holiday season, but that number was inflated because Yahoo added several new merchants to its site in the last year, including Wal-Mart.com and AnnTaylor.com. 
Dealtime.com, a price search engine, saw traffic double and revenues soar compared with last year as consumers logged on to search for popular items like digital cameras. Amazon.com, the Web's largest merchant, will not report sales numbers until it has figures for the whole month. 
The pre-Christmas sales do not tell the whole picture. Many retailers count on the days after the holiday to bolster their monthly sales figures. Now, retailers just have to hope the returns are light and the coat sales are heavy.

Deferred Money Creates Snag in Deal for Vaughn

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Mo Vaughn had one foot figuratively at Shea Stadium yesterday, but the other one remained in limbo. As a result, Vaughn remained a member of the Anaheim Angels, at least until further notice. 
 Just when it appeared that Vaughn would get his wish and leave the Angels in a trade for pitcher Kevin Appier, a snag developed in the Mets' attempt to restructure the remaining years of Vaughn's contract and make his salaries in those years more palatable to them. The snag stemmed from the interest rate the Mets proposed paying on the parts of Vaughn's salary they would defer. 
 Although it was unclear if Vaughn and his agent, Jeff Moorad, were prepared to accept the Mets' proposal, the players' union would not let them. "Obviously, we want to do what we can to help Mo," Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said. "But by the same token, no one understands better than he does that we have to guard against encroachments on the basic agreement. There are some issues we have to discuss with everybody before we reach a firm conclusion. The process deserves that much. We have neither rejected it nor approved the arrangement on this one."
Just as Major League Baseball officials review the contracts negotiated by owners, the union has that responsibility for the players. Even if a player wants to accept certain contract clauses, the union will prohibit them if they violate the basic agreement between the union and management or if they reduce the value of a player's contract without giving him something in return.
Moorad did not return telephone messages seeking comment. Jay Horwitz, the Mets' vice president for media relations, said last night that the talks were continuing. "We'll talk overnight," he said. "We'll have no announcement regarding Mo Vaughn tonight."
A person familiar with the talks said the interest rate the Mets proposed on the deferred money would cost Vaughn several million dollars in terms of present-day value of the contract. Vaughn has salaries for the next three years of $10 million, $15 million and $15 million. If the Mets stick to their proposal, or do not raise the interest rate they are proposing, the trade could die. In that event, the Mets could turn to Juan Gonzalez, a free agent who is also a Moorad client, as the big hitter they want in the middle of their lineup behind Mike Piazza.
The demise of the Vaughn trade would end any possibility of the Mets' adding him and Gonzalez, if they are considering that option at all. The 72-hour period the Mets and Moorad were given to reach an agreement expired at noon yesterday, but an extension was requested yesterday from the commissioner's office, which granted 24 hours. The length of extensions is up to the commissioner's office.
"There have been extensions for substantial periods of time," Sandy Alderson, baseball's executive vice president for baseball operations, said yesterday without acknowledging that the Mets had been granted permission to speak with Moorad. This past season, after the Chicago Cubs reached agreement with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on a trade for first baseman Fred McGriff, 19 days elapsed before McGriff agreed to the trade with some contract changes.
But not all contingency trades are completed. The Yankees had one for Gonzalez in 2000, when Gonzalez was a member of the Detroit Tigers, but he rejected the trade.
Vaughn, who missed all of last season with a torn biceps tendon, signed with the Angels as a free agent three years ago but became disenchanted with playing in Southern California and after the season said in an interview that he would like to leave. The Angels, who would not mind relinquishing his contract, are trying to accommodate him.
Vaughn did not return a telephone message left yesterday at his parents' home in Midlothian, Va., where he was staying before flying to Ohio. But his mother, Shirley Vaughn, said he liked the idea of playing for the Mets. "He would love to come," she said, adding that he was in "fantastic shape."
"I keep cooking and he won't eat," she said. "He says, 'I can't eat that.' "
A Mets official said earlier this week that he was confident that Vaughn would do whatever it took to get a deal done and join the Mets. But Vaughn is being asked not only to give up some money by the Mets but also by the Angels.
Under terms of his contract, Vaughn is to be paid the remaining $8 million of his $13 million signing bonus in 2002. The contract was negotiated that way to protect Vaughn in case there is a work stoppage next year. Even if there is, he would receive the $8 million because it is part of his signing bonus, not his salary.
In their negotiations with the Mets, the Angels agreed to pay the $8 million, but they want to defer it for two years at low interest. The delay in payment would cost Vaughn approximately $500,000 in present-day value.

HEADLINE: Hard Questions for Movement to Shut Indian Point 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
Since Sept. 11, an unusually broad coalition of elected officials, civic and environmental groups and homeowners across New York City's northern suburbs has come together over a temptingly simple demand: close the Indian Point nuclear power plant.
 Frightened by the possibility of a catastrophic terrorist attack on the nuclear complex 30 miles north of Manhattan, critics are saying with increasing intensity that it is time for the plant to be shut down. 
 But even as opposition continues to grow, the movement's leaders are confronting some hard questions. What are the options for closing the plant? Do they provide any promising avenues for opponents to follow? Would closing the plant eliminate the security issues there? 
And if Indian Point is closed, how will the region's energy needs and electricity rates be affected? 
None of the answers give easy comfort to those who think Indian Point's risks far outweigh its benefits to the region.
Indian Point's opponents have raised the possibility of a terrorist attack on the plant that would send deadly plumes of radiation into the densely populated area, a release that could imperil areas as far away as Manhattan. They have said Westchester County's emergency plan, which includes the possible evacuation of people up to 10 miles downwind of the plant, would never work.
At a public hearing on Dec. 20, the president of one of the bus companies whose drivers are supposed to pick up children in the evacuation zone called the plan "a fairy tale," saying the drivers would not go. Others have said the roads in the area -- jammed at rush hour even on ordinary days -- would be clogged with panicking families.
Many opponents believe that the plant, which is in Buchanan, N.Y., would be forced to shut down if Westchester officials, who are responsible for maintaining the emergency plan, decided to withdraw from it. A number of county legislators said they would vote for a withdrawal, and no nuclear plant can maintain its license without a federally approved emergency plan.
But federal officials have said the plant is safe, and they have no intention of closing it. The federal government can declare that the emergency provisions are adequate even in the absence of county or state participation. In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979, officials in Rockland County, just across the Hudson from Westchester, did withdraw from the emergency plan at Indian Point, and state officials simply created a substitute plan for Rockland.
Partly as a result of that incident, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission developed the so-called realism rule in the early 1980's, stating that the commission could independently determine that a plant owner's emergency plans were sufficient.
"If a state or county decides to withdraw in whole or in part from the emergency plan, the realism rule says we believe they will in fact do everything required for the safety of their citizens," said Edwin F. Fox, a senior emergency planning specialist at the commission.
Some opponents of Indian Point say that despite these rules, federal officials will not ignore the movement if it continues to grow.
"The N.R.C. may be the only agency with final authority over the plant, but what it would do in a changed political climate is not clear," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who convened the Dec. 20 hearings on the Indian Point emergency plan and is a leader of the movement to close the plant.
Neil A. Sheehan, a spokesman for the N.R.C., said the agency judged plants on the basis of science, not politics. It has periodically closed reactors with persistent technical problems, and it shut down one of Indian Point's two reactors for almost a year in early 2000 after an accident involving a steam generator tube. That reactor, Indian Point 2, drew more criticism in recent weeks after four of seven control-room crews failed their annual requalification tests. But N.R.C. and Entergy representatives said the reactor was making substantial improvements after Entergy acquired it from its old owner, Con Edison, in September.
There is no indication that Entergy is daunted by the opposition. The company has already spent about $3 million on new security measures since Sept. 11, and it intends to run the two reactors at least until their current licenses run out, in 2013 and 2015, said Jim Steets, an Entergy spokesman. There would then be an opportunity to renew the licenses for up to 20 years.
If politicians did try to force a closure, the nuclear industry would not go down without a fight. "You can't take away an asset like that and not reimburse the company," said Maureen Koetz, the director of environmental programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group. "I think it would require a lot of legal force." Entergy paid $528 million for Indian Point 2 earlier this year, and $967 million for Indian Point 3 and another reactor elsewhere in the state last year.
Entergy also employs 1,500 people full time at the plant, and they would probably make their voices heard if the movement to close Indian Point got closer to success, Mr. Steets said.
In any case, the history of political opposition to nuclear plants suggests that it is not easy to get to that point. There have been a number of popular referendums to close nuclear plants, and only one has succeeded, against the Rancho Seco plant in Sacramento in 1989. That plant was publicly owned, and polls taken after the closing suggested that the voters' decision was influenced more by concerns about management than by worries about nuclear safety. 
That was before Sept. 11, when the threat of a suicide attack made all of the nation's 83 nuclear reactor sites seem far more vulnerable. Opponents say Indian Point, whose two reactors and three pools of spent fuel are in the most densely populated area around any nuclear plant in the country, should be shut down until better security measures can be developed, if not permanently.
But it is not clear how much safer a shutdown would make the plant. The large amounts of spent nuclear fuel stored at the site would remain there even if it was closed because there is still no federally approved repository for nuclear waste, N.R.C. officials said. Moving the fuel out of the pools where it is currently stored to a dry cask storage system -- a change advocated by those who favor a shutdown -- would make it safer from an attack, said David Lochbaum, a former nuclear engineer and spokesman for the Union of Concerned Scientists. But that change could be made without shutting down the reactors.
Another obstacle to closing the plant is that it provides 7 to 8 percent of the electricity consumed in New York State, and is an important power source in New York City, said Carol E. Murphy, a spokeswoman for the New York Independent System Operator, the nonprofit company that controls the state's electricity grid. 
If the plant were to shut down tomorrow, there would probably be power shortages and certainly an increase in wholesale electricity prices this summer in the New York region, probably by about 20 percent, said Gavin J. Donohue, the executive director of the Independent Power Producers of New York, an industry association. For the average rate payer with a monthly bill of $100 during the summer, that would mean an increase of $6 to $7.
But Ashok Gupta, the senior energy economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which favors closing the plant, said that estimate excludes conservation improvements and a number of new power plants that are being planned in the region. If those changes are added to the picture, they could compensate for the loss of the plant by this summer, and certainly within two or three years, Mr. Gupta said. 
Other analysts say newer plants will worsen air pollution in the area, unlike Indian Point, which does not contribute in significant ways to air pollution. And the prospect of new smog-generating plants or higher electricity rates in low-income areas like the Bronx has already become an issue as the Indian Point opponents seek to expand their movement into the city. 
"We believe that any closure must first deal with alternative generation of electricity that will be needed to make up for a shutdown, and until those concerns are dealt with in an equitable manner, we could not fully support a shutdown," said Timothy Logan, the energy coordinator at the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, a group that works on environmental issues in low-income communities.
Acknowledging the region's energy needs, many of those who favor a shutdown say they would like to convert Indian Point into a natural gas plant. But converting Indian Point to natural gas would itself be a difficult process. The old plant would have to be decommissioned first, and the new plant would require a larger supply of gas than is now possible using an existing pipeline running through the site, Mr. Steets said. 
Converting the plant could inflame further controversy because the most likely source for a larger supply of natural gas would be the Millennium Pipeline, a proposed 422-mile high-pressure natural gas line that would run underground from Lake Erie to Mount Vernon. That proposal has itself been drawing protests over the past year from Westchester residents who say it poses serious environmental risks.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
In a Season of Loss, Acts of Giving

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN CARROLL 

 BODY:
In a city marked by tragedy, New Yorkers sending donations to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund this year are sharing their own misfortunes and including especially urgent appeals.
 With her donation of $50, Mary Joyce Bochroch of East Hampton, N.Y., wrote that she lost her job after the Sept. 11 events. After 35 years as a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines, Mrs. Bochroch began working for American Airlines last summer. 
 She is one of the many airline workers who have lost their jobs since the attacks. "My family is still stable financially, and I feel very blessed," she said. Still, she knows many of her urban neighbors are not. "This year, it's Christmas with a heavy heart," she said. "It's just about sharing love." In addition to her regular Christmas Day routine, Mrs. Bochroch delivered homemade cookies and hot meals to needy families on Long Island.
She was prompted to donate to the fund after reading about this year's shortfall in donations. "I feel like everybody sent lots of money for Sept. 11, but then other charities are hurting. I think a lot of people feel like I do. Your heart is aching for everybody," she said.
For Brianna Fowls, 16, of Glen Rock, N.J., a faraway trip last summer helped to highlight poverty close to home. Brianna spent one month as an exchange student in Costa Rica, where she was shocked by her host family's meager home and possessions. "When I got home, my house looked so huge, and I realized the overabundance," she said. "We have so many rooms, and they're all filled with stuff. My host sister had five shirts."
On Nov. 26, Brianna turned 16. At first, she wanted a big party with all the trimmings, her mother said. But after a season of terrorist attacks and dire reports of hard economic times, Brianna changed her mind.
"People here need a lot of help," she said. "Costa Rica opened my eyes to how much poverty there is, but now it's closer to home. So, I decided to collect money instead of presents. I don't really need anything," she said.
At her birthday party, 25 teenagers played volleyball in her backyard, ate spaghetti, decorated birthday cupcakes and donated money that Brianna divided between the Neediest Cases Fund and Heifer International, an organization that provides livestock to rural families.
She donated about $200 to the fund. "I hope that maybe it would be a starting point, a turning point in someone's life, so that they can get a stable job and help their family fix whatever is wrong," she said.
For Shirley Branner, the Sept. 11 attacks were a different sort of turning point. "I was a little girl on Dec. 7, 1941, when Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese, and nothing in my life has ever pained me more in all the years since, until Sept. 11," she said.
Mrs. Branner, a semiretired real estate broker and Upper West Side resident since 1957, increased her annual donation from $100 to $400 and wrote, "Such a tragic time in American history requires not just my usual gift to the neediest, but the most I can afford."
"I think the fund is a more important place for my money than any other," she said.
Josephine Thalia Howell of Brooklyn sent a check for $200 and wrote: "My donation is reduced this year because I am now unemployed myself. Hopefully next year we will all be back on track, but still conscious of the fragility and value of life, family and friends."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Big Spending Cuts Seen 

BYLINE:  By Chris Gaither (NYT) (Compiled by Alan Krauss) 

 BODY:
 Cutbacks in spending on information technology in the United States were even sharper than expected this year and will continue to drag on the economy in 2002, the Giga Information Group, a market researcher, said. 
It said strong declines in equipment purchases contributed to an estimated 5 percent drop in spending in 2001, to $750 billion, compared with growth of 22 percent in 1999 and 24 percent in 2000. Before Sept. 11, Giga had predicted a 3 percent decline. It predicted that spending would improve by 4 percent in 2002, lowering its earlier forecast of 7 percent. Chris Gaither (NYT)

 Faced with a $16 million budget shortfall over the next two years, the operators of the Golden Gate Bridge, which connects San Francisco and Marin County, are considering a toll increase of as much as $1 next year. 
With layoffs in Silicon Valley and a dwindling stream of tourists since Sept. 11, traffic on the bridge dropped 4 percent in the second half of the year, while security costs increased. The last toll increase was in the state's last recession, in 1991, when the fee rose to $3 from $2. Greg Winter (NYT)

HEADLINE: Air Travel in Russia Remains Strong 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Russian airlines have been relatively untouched by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States that has brought so many Western carriers to their knees.
 Amid a global collapse in air travel, in Russia it actually rose by 12 percent from September through November of this year versus the comparable period last year. For all of 2001, Russian airlines will have carried 24 million to 25 million passengers, up from last year's total of 21.8 million. 
 In a vast land of notoriously bad roads, where traversing the country by train takes the better part of a week, Russia's air travelers have little choice but to keep flying. And considering Russia's spotty safety record, they are not easily frightened. The remote threat of terrorism is not enough to discourage flying. 
"Russians aren't afraid -- they know it all and have seen it all," said Vladimir Savov, an airline industry analyst at Brunswick UBS Warburg, a Moscow-based investment bank. "At first there was a little shock, but on the domestic market, everything is fine."
Still, the industry has a long way to regain ground lost in the 1990's, when economic collapse and sharp rises in ticket prices wiped out the domestic leisure travel industry. Domestic air travel has shrunk 80 percent since the fall of the Soviet Union.
At the same time, however, international travel, virtually nonexistent in Soviet days, has doubled. And when world air travel collapsed this fall, these flights were affected. The partly state-owned Aeroflot, Russia's largest airline, accounts for 68 percent of Russia's international flights, and has a much smaller share of the domestic market. It estimates that it lost about 3 percent of passenger volume this year. That, however, is a small loss compared with the huge declines in the American airline industry since then.
"For us, the negative effects gathered slowly," said Alexander Zurabov, Aeroflot's first deputy director, referring to the terrorist attacks in the United States and the spate of plane crashes later in the fall. "There was not a sudden drop like in America."
Aeroflot, which had been dogged by financial scandals and slow to adjust to market competition, improved markedly when a new management team took control in 1998. Since then, it has hired the consulting firm McKinsey & Company to advise it on how to reorganize, has eliminated unprofitable routes and has added more flights on high-demand routes.
That helped increase passenger volumes by about 30 percent, to about 6 million, and last year turned Aeroflot's chronic losses into profits. The company's stock price is up 36 percent since August, buoyed by the recent bull market on Russia's stock exchange.
Even more important for Russia's airline industry is consolidation among the country's 290 regional airlines, analysts say. These companies, spun off from Aeroflot in the early 1990's and nicknamed Babyflots, lack the money to upgrade Soviet-era fleets. They clog Russia's small domestic market, and, analysts say, must merge to make the market more efficient.
"Eighty percent of airlines are financially unstable," said Igor Medzhibovsky, deputy director of the Ilyushin Finance Company, a Moscow-based aircraft-leasing company. "They are not able to afford even leasing new aircraft. The Russian government wants merging and concentration to be happening as soon as possible."
Though consolidation has been slow to start, there are some early signs that it has begun. This summer, Siberian Airlines agreed to acquire a Moscow-based carrier, Vnukovo. Siberian Airlines, based in Novosibirsk, an airport hub for Asian destinations including four major Chinese cities, has grown quickly. After the merger it would become the second-largest passenger airline in Russia.
Siberian Airlines has had some tough moments of its own. In October, one of its passenger planes was shot down by a stray Ukrainian missile fired from the Black Sea during a training exercise. All 76 people on board were killed.
At the time, the company said it would sue the Ukrainian government for more than $10 million in damages. A spokesman said that the company, mired in paperwork from various government commissions inspecting the plane crash, had not yet filed suit. Still, the company said, the crash did not hurt business.
One obstacle to consolidation is the cozy relationship between regional airlines and local airports, which grant them exclusive agreements and prevent out-of-area airlines from landing planes.
The regional airports "use a lot of cunning ploys" to keep out national carriers, said Aeroflot's Mr. Zurabov. "For example, ongoing runway repairs stop only for the half hour while the local airline lands its plane."
That is beginning to change. Increased competition and tougher financial discipline is leading to a shakeout in the industry, and industry experts say the federal government has been tougher with small, insolvent companies.
And as Russia's economy, which is entering its fourth year of growth, continues to expand, the country's airline industry will benefit. 
Even the attitudes among Russia's notoriously surly flight crews have begun to change.
More and more, employees "want to work in a modern company, not a glorious one," said Larisa Solodukhina, who runs staff training programs at Aeroflot.

HEADLINE: Sales of Digital Cameras Are Brisk 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Price, simplicity and a desire to weave tighter bonds with family and friends have combined to make sales of cameras, particularly digital cameras, soar this season, industry experts and camera retailers said yesterday.
 "The digital camera market just exploded this year," said Nathan Terzi, chief operating officer for Willoughby's Konica Imaging Center, a large camera dealer in Manhattan. "We sold over three times as many as last year, mostly through our Web site." Sales of single-use disposable cameras also rose, but sales of 35-millimeter cameras were just "fair," he added. 
 People seemed eager to send images of their children, vacations, pets and hobbies to others, using pictures they took themselves. And with prices falling, many of them bought digital cameras to do so. "The price points have come down significantly," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist for Deloitte & Touche. "And it's really 'Photography for Dummies.' It makes the whole process of photography a lot easier." At the same time, he said, digital cameras are so computer-friendly that it is simple for people to attach the images they create to e-mail messages or Web sites, which they can do from a home computer. 
At least one big discounter saw solid increases. "We went into the holiday selling season with very aggressive sales goals for our digital cameras, and we greatly exceeded those," said Douglas Kline, a spokesman for Target. Prices were slashed; an Olympus C-3000 digital camera was $499, compared with "over $600" last year, he said. He cited one study that showed about 14 percent of American households owned digital cameras this year, up from none in 1999. 
"That leaves plenty of room for growth, and we're planning to be a part of that growth," he said. 
At Wal-Mart, however, overall sales of cameras were unchanged from last year, with increases in digital cameras offset by declines in traditional cameras, said a spokesman, Rob Phillips.
Many analysts say worries about personal security in recent months have fostered a boom in products that can be enjoyed at home. Consumer electronics of all kinds sold well for the holidays this year, with sales of home theaters, big-screen TV sets and personal organizers all increasing particularly rapidly. 
One camera retailer said demand for cameras of all kinds fell off sharply after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but picked up again this month. "We ended up with sales 30 percent to 50 percent higher for December, compared with last December," said Fred H. Lerner, the president and chief executive of Ritz Interactive, an online camera specialist. Sales of digital cameras, traditional cameras and camcorders all increased he said, with demand greatest for the digital still camera. 
"We had Nikon and Sony digital cameras," Mr. Lerner said, "and they flew off the shelves." 
The photography industry heavily promoted digital technology this year, as did many retailers. "We advertise digital, digital, digital, and the business advertises digital, digital, digital," said David Katz of the Camera Company, an independent retailer in Norwood, Mass. He said sales rose at least 22 percent this year, and "we did surprisingly well with point-and-shoots and traditional cameras." By Dec. 22, he said, "we ran out of everything."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: SAUDI ARABIA; 
Holy War Lured Saudis As Rulers Looked Away

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
In the last decade, as thousands of young Saudis left their country to wage Islamic holy war, Saudi leaders let them go, aware of the danger they might pose to the United States, but more focused on the danger they would pose at home.
 At least four times in the last six years, Saudis who were trained or recruited in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Kosovo or Bosnia have been among the terrorists who carried out bombings of American targets -- in Saudi Arabia, Kenya, Tanzania and Yemen. But not until October, after the American military campaign in Afghanistan began, did Saudi Arabia detain young men trying to join that fight. 
 Until then, the Saudi royal family performed a diplomatic and political balancing act. Choosing accommodation over confrontation, the government shied away from a crackdown on militant clerics or their followers, a move that would have inflamed the religious right, the disaffected returnees from other wars and a growing number of unemployed. 
It appears to have been a miscalculation of global proportions, Western diplomats now say. As they look back to examine the roots of the Sept. 11 attacks, officials in Saudi Arabia, Europe and the United States describe a similar pattern. In country after country, Al Qaeda's networks took hold, often with the knowledge of local intelligence and security agencies. But on the rare occasions that countries did address the terrorist threat, they chose to deal with it as a local issue rather than an interlocking global network.
The result: for Osama bin Laden's most audacious strike against the United States, Europe was his forward base, Saudi Arabia his pool of recruits, the United States a vulnerable target. 
In interviews here, former senior Saudi officials said they had recognized the exodus of warriors as a source for concern, for the kingdom and its American ally. But they insisted that they thought the danger could be contained.
Only after Sept. 11 did Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties to the Taliban government of Afghanistan, which was spreading a fundamentalist form of Sunni Islam dear to the Saudis even as it forged ever closer ties with Al Qaeda. The Taliban were recognized by just three countries.
The severing of ties appears to have been belated. In the waning days of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, a former Saudi official estimated this month that the number of Saudis there, as combatants, prisoners or casualties, probably numbered between 600 and 700, and possibly as many as 1,000.
As many as 25,000 Saudis received military training or experience abroad since 1979, according to estimates by royal Saudi intelligence.
Rather than prevent young Saudis from enlisting in military ventures abroad or silence the sheiks encouraging them, some officials say Saudi Arabia has mostly tried to deflect the problem outside its borders.
"The Saudis' policies made the world safer for Saudi Arabia and the Saudi regime," said Martin Indyk, an assistant secretary of state for Middle East policy during the Clinton administration, who has become a prominent critic of the Saudi strategy. "I don't think it was their intention to make it unsafe for the United States. But that was the actual, if unintended, consequence of buying off the opposition, and exporting both the troublemakers and their extremist ideology."
Saudi officials say that an aggressive effort to stop the flow of holy warriors or halt financial transfers to militant groups or address the sources of a drift toward radicalism might have only inflamed the sentiment of extremists who saw both the Saudi government and the United States as their targets.
"There was absolutely no way and no reason to stop them from going," said one former senior Saudi official. He said that his government had "of course" seen the jihadis, or holy warriors, as a major problem, and had tried to monitor their travels with help from foreign governments. But he insisted that the young Saudis would have found a way around any barriers that were imposed.
Although a blanket ban on travel is clearly not enforceable, Western officials say that the Saudi government could have made a greater effort to identify potential terrorists or jihadis and disrupted their travel plans. Since Sept. 11, for example, the Saudi government has discouraged travel -- especially those under suspicion -- to countries like Afghanistan.
Among 15 Saudi hijackers who helped to carry out the Sept. 11 attacks, American officials say, some came from this new generation of jihadis, apparently recruited while traveling. Others were apparently recruited in Saudi Arabia itself. But none appeared on any Saudi watchlist, an American official said.
A former American ambassador to Saudi Arabia said that the problems posed by an exodus that exposed young Saudis to further extremism and to members of Mr. bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization should have meant that the issue was addressed directly. But he said the United States had never pressed for Saudi action.
"Alarm bells should have rung," said Wyche Fowler Jr., the former ambassador, who served in Riyadh until the beginning of this year. "Someone should have said, wait a minute, we can't have people marching off to choose their own jihad, without examining the foreign policy and security repercussions."
Through its history, Saudi Arabia has always tried to balance contradictory goals, preserving ties to the United States and the West, its defender in the Persian Gulf war, while accommodating what most analysts view as a deeply conservative majority that sees those ties as alien and potentially harmful to Islamic interests.
The United States, meanwhile, has tried to balance its heavy dependence on Saudi oil -- it imports about 18 percent of its oil from the kingdom -- with concerns about radicalism within the country. It has been wary of undermining or questioning the Saudi royal family. On both sides of a crucial alliance, hesitation and caution long prevailed over the confrontation of difficult issues.
Until Sept. 11, the Saudi balancing act seemed to be acceptable. The participation of its citizens in the earlier attacks had not received much attention in the West. At home, an internal terrorist threat that had flared in 1995 and 1996 seemed to have been shut down.
But with the attacks of Sept. 11, American and some Saudi officials say, shortcomings in the Saudi approach have become clearer.
In one of two 90-minute interviews for this article, a former senior Saudi official acknowledged that his government might have underestimated the extent of the problem, but he said the full dimensions of the problem had become apparent only with hindsight.
"That there were people calling for jihad against America, well, bin Laden had been calling for that for the last three years," said the former Saudi official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The call had been there, the declaration had been there. But the fact that we had people who were willing not only to heed that call, but to go against everything Islamic, that was unimaginable."

A Sheik's Influence
Young Saudis Intent On Becoming Martyrs
In a cramped office at the rear of Princess Zohra Mosque, Sheik Saleh al-Sadlaan is dispensing judgments that carry enormous weight. On this night, his callers in person and by phone line up for his rulings on countless matters Islamic, from divorce to fasting and prayer.
The hardest questions, he says, include some that have become among the most frequent. Is it time, young Saudis want to know, to wage jihad in the defense of the Muslims, whose suffering appears nightly on their television screens, from places like Chechnya and the Middle East.
"If he says go, we will go, because he is our sheik," declared a prayer caller, Abdul Hadi, 24. In fact, Sheik Sadlaan said he had spent years trying to persuade his best young Saudis to stay home. But his advice seems tinged with ambivalence.
"If he truly wants to defend Islam, that is one thing," he said. "If he just wants to be brave, that is something else." In the last few years, he said, young men have come to him "more often than I can say," ready to leave their lives as students behind, having set their sights on martyrdom.
A half-blind man of 61, Sheik Sadlaan is a professor at the kingdom's leading Islamic university and a religious adviser to a senior member of the royal family. What he says carries the weight of the ulemaa, Saudi Arabia's official religious establishment, and what he says, carefully, is that the king is his imam, and the king does not currently advise young men to march off to holy war.
But asked about other scholars, like Sheik Hamoud al-Shuaibi, who since Sept. 11 and the American retaliation have openly called for jihad against the United States, Sheik Sadlaan stops short of condemnation.
"He made a mistake, but it was not a major one, and it does not detract from his reputation," he said of Sheik Shuaibi, a former teacher.
Even the Saudi government is not known to have taken action against Sheik Shuaibi, despite his statements that those who support infidels, or unbelievers, should be considered unbelievers themselves, a statement that would seem perilously close to treason in Saudi Arabia, still home to more than 5,000 American troops.
Out of roughly 10,000 religious scholars in the kingdom, perhaps just 150 embrace such a radical view, according to American estimates. But among this group, only a handful is known to have been detained by Saudi authorities since Sept. 11, and in the videotape recently broadcast in the United States, Mr. bin Laden was eager to know how Saudi scholars had interpreted his actions.
"What is the stand of the mosques there?" Mr. bin Laden was heard to ask.
"Honestly, they are very positive," answered the visitor, identified by a senior Saudi official as Khaled al-Harbi, a veteran of conflicts in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Bosnia, who named several Saudi scholars as having spoken out in favor of Mr. bin Laden's campaign.
Even if only a small fraction of Saudi religious scholars are sympathetic to such causes, Sheik Sadlaan acknowledged that some Saudis saw their rulings as more credible than his own, because of his close ties to the government and the royal family. (The mosque is named for the mother of his patron, Prince Abdelaziz bin Fahd, a minister of state and the son of the king.)
In 9 cases in 10, the sheik estimated, juggling a visitor's questions with the demands of an insistent phone, he had persuaded young Saudis to set aside their dreams of jihad. But he wondered how often his advice made a real difference.
"If they don't like what I have to say," he said, "they'll go to some other scholar, who will tell them what they want to hear."

Bin Laden's Rise
An Early Glimpse Of Militant Forces
Shortly after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, Osama bin Laden approached Prince Sultan bin Abdelaziz al-Saud, the Saudi defense minister, with an unusual proposition. Mr. bin Laden had recently returned from Afghanistan, heady with victory in the drive, backed by Saudi Arabia and the United States, to expel the Soviet occupiers.
As recounted by Prince Turki bin Faisal, then the Saudi intelligence chief, and by another Saudi official, the episode foreshadowed a worrying turn. Victorious in Afghanistan, Mr. bin Laden clearly craved more battles, and he no longer saw the United States as a partner, but as a threat and potential enemy to Islam.
Arriving with maps and many diagrams, Mr. bin Laden told Prince Sultan that the kingdom could avoid the indignity of allowing an army of American unbelievers to enter the kingdom, to repel Iraq from Kuwait. He could lead the fight himself, he said, at the head of an group of former mujahedeen that he said could number 100,000 men.
Prince Sultan had received Mr. bin Laden warmly, but he reminded him that the Iraqis had 4,000 tanks, according to one account.
"There are no caves in Kuwait," the prince is said to have noted. "You cannot fight them from the mountains and caves. What will you do when he lobs the missiles at you with chemical and biological weapons?"
Mr. bin Laden replied, "We fight him with faith."
The conversation ended soon afterward, and the proposal was left to rest. But Saudi officials now say that the episode offered an early glimpse of several of the forces the kingdom would spend the rest of the decade trying to contain.
One such force was represented by Saudi veterans of the Afghan war, at least 15,000 men who had helped to drive the Soviets from Afghanistan in the name of Islam. Many returned to ordinary lives, but others did not.
Some remained in exile abroad, enlisting in other conflicts, in places like Bosnia. Others were jailed by the Saudi government.
In one sign of concern, a person knowledgeable about the kingdom said, the Saudi interior ministry conducted extensive psychological profiling of 2,500 veterans in an effort to identify those who were a potential security threat.
A second force was Mr. bin Laden himself, who soon returned to Pakistan. As early as 1992, Prince Turki said, "We started receiving information that he was active in recruiting Saudis to go there, and that he was in cahoots, so to speak, with some very unsavory characters, from Egyptian Al Jihad to Algerian groups, people who espouse terror as a means to carry out political ends."
A third was anti-Americanism, which gave further ammunition to Mr. bin Laden's cause, particularly when American troops stayed behind in Saudi Arabia after the Persian Gulf war. Mr. bin Laden was only one among the critics who said that the presence of "infidel" forces, for the protection of the kingdom, showed that the ruling al-Saud family was no longer legitimate, since its responsibilities included the protection of Islam's holiest sites at Mecca and Medina.
At the same time, Saudi officials concede, the problem of internal discontent was intensifying for other reasons: a surging population, stagnant revenues that sent per capita income plunging and growing unemployment.
Some of that disenchantment prompted direct criticism of the Saudi government. Royal profligacy and corruption were increasingly seen as indefensible.
The response was evasive. For decades, a former senior Saudi official said, the Saudi approach has been "to argue, and then to co-opt, in a way, and to act as if crimes weren't committed unless there were actual calls for an uprising against the government."
In the case of Mr. bin Laden, who by 1992 had in fact called for a toppling of the government, the Saudis moved slowly. They stripped him of his citizenship in 1994. But their attitude still betrayed uncertainty: for several years they relied on emissaries from Mr. bin Laden's family in the hope they could persuade him to change, officials said.
Among a series of shocks that brought extremism to the kingdom, the first came in November 1995, with a bombing in Riyadh that killed 5 Americans and wounded 37. Within months, four Saudis had confessed to the crime, including one who had served in Afghanistan, saying they had been inspired by Mr. bin Laden's calls to oust the nonbelieving forces from the kingdom.
Then in June of 1996 came a second attack. The bombing of an air base in the eastern city of Al Khobar, killed 19 American airmen and wounded hundreds more. Mr. bin Laden was long suspected of involvement, but Saudi and American investigators ultimately discounted that theory, blaming Saudi Shiite Muslims with ties to Iran.
Mr. bin Laden declared war against the United States in 1996, and two years later, he announced the forging of his "Coalition Against Crusaders, Christians and Jews." Yet it was not until June 1998 that the Saudis sought his arrest.
On a trip to Afghanistan, Prince Turki won what he said had been agreement from Mullah Muhammad Omar to surrender Mr. bin Laden. Three months later, after the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Mullah Omar reneged.
"We didn't leave any stone unturned," Prince Turki said in an interview of the effort to secure Mr. bin Laden's arrest. He said his government had maintained relations with the Taliban even afterward, despite the fact that Mr. bin Laden's group had been implicated in the August attacks, in order to "leave a door open" for a Taliban change of heart. In fact, it seems clear that Saudi ambivalence toward a movement close to its own Wahhabi interpretation of Islam persisted.
Some American experts did question whether the Saudi government was prepared to bring Mr. bin Laden back home, and face a potential backlash from his admirers. "I think there was a conscious idea among the Saudis that they would rather have Osama in the Hindu Kush than anywhere else," said F. Gregory Gause III, an expert on Saudi Arabia at the University of Vermont.
In the Kenya attack, the terrorists included Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, a Saudi who later confessed to being recruited in Afghanistan. In the next major terrorist attack, the bombing in Yemen of the destroyer Cole in October 2000, another Saudi, Tawfiq al-Atash, who lost a leg in Afghanistan, has been identified by American officials as a likely leader.
In response to these events, the Saudis stepped up their supply of intelligence to the United States on Mr. bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network, officials from both countries said.
George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, traveled four times to Saudi Arabia between 1996 and 2000; Mr. Fowler, the ambassador, worked closely but secretly with Bakr bin Laden, the dissident's elder brother, to shut down sources of Al Qaeda's financing.
At the same time, the Saudis stepped up their oversight of money transfers. But one problem persisted: the charities whose funds sometimes found their way into the hands of extremists included prominent members of the royal family on their boards.
With more conflicts involving Muslims breaking out in Bosnia, Chechnya and elsewhere, many Saudis reached deep into their wallet. Since 1992, one Saudi charity, the Al Haramin Foundation, has increased twentyfold in size, distributing hundreds of millions of dollars over those years to schools and refugee camps in what officials of the group say are strictly humanitarian missions.
American officials say this largesse has been prone to significant "leakage," with money channeled to extremist causes and terrorist groups.
"The Saudi government never intentionally funded terrorism; that's nonsense," argued a former State Department official with long service in the region. "But what you had was a really serious command and control problem."

Sharing Intelligence
Cautious Cooperation But Strained Ties
Almost every day since Sept. 11, an F.B.I. official based at United States Embassy in Riyadh has met with Saudi counterparts to discuss the investigation, regular, face-to-face encounters that both sides regard as a major development in intelligence-sharing between the two countries.
But the two sides still walk on eggshells, the Americans careful in their questions, and the Saudis guarded in their answers, American officials said. Even in the post-Sept. 11 meetings, one senior Bush administration official said, the Saudis "dribble out a morsel of insignificant information one day at a time."
There are reasons for such caution, Saudi and American officials say. The very idea of close ties between the home of Islam's holy sites and the West remains alien to many Saudis. Since the Persian Gulf war of 1991, the partnership has come under increasing strain, because of differences over Israel and Iraq, over the American troop presence, and over terrorism, on which American requests for cooperation have often been perceived as insensitive to Saudi sovereignty.
"The United States sometimes expects Saudi Arabia to do publicly what they are willing to do only privately," said David Mack, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served during the early 1990's as the top American diplomat in Riyadh. "They do not by inclination like to talk about what they're doing, whether it's good or bad."
Still, some American officials say the United States has leaned much too far in the direction of deference, thus failing to avert terrorist attacks.
In the mid-1990's, one administration official recalled, the Saudis would not acknowledge the existence of a Shiite Muslim group called Saudi Hezbollah, which was later acknowledged by the Saudis to have been among those responsible for the 1996 bombing in Al Khobar. "They would take our request and promise to get back to us and never did," the official said.
On the issue of Saudis heading off to holy war, Mr. Fowler, the former ambassador, said: "I'm willing to acknowledge up front that we missed it. It's the kind of thing that with hindsight, I wish I had thought to raise."
Even on terrorist financing, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said during a visit to the kingdom in September that he had not asked the Saudis to freeze the assets of people and groups linked to Mr. bin Laden, even though the United States had asked all countries to do so. He said at a news conference that such matters were being handled by others.
"We understand that each country is different," he said, "each country lives in a different neighborhood, has a different perspective and has different sensitivities and different practices, and we do not expect every nation on the face of the earth to be publicly engaged in every single activity the United States is.
Not infrequently, Saudi and American officials say, the tiptoeing results in miscommunication. This month, a delegation led by a senior State Department official arrived in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, to discuss the issue of terrorist financing, only to find that the kingdom's most senior princes were already in or on their way to Jidda, for their annual retreat in the last 10 days of Ramadan.
For their part, Saudi officials say they were angry that the United States has not shared in advance some of its investigative findings, including the recent videotape showing Mr. bin Laden and a Saudi visitor.
Scrambling to respond, some Saudi officials mistakenly identified the visitor as a Saudi cleric who, it turned out, was still in the kingdom.
A former Central Intelligence Agency official said that American deference and other constraints, including efforts by the Saudis to discourage efforts by American diplomats to mingle with ordinary people, had left the United States dangerously dependent on the Saudis for information that could affect American as well as Saudi security.
"It's not that there are divisions within the intelligence community about Saudi Arabia," said the official, Kenneth M. Pollack, who served on the National Security Council staff in the Clinton administration. "It's that the intelligence community doesn't know."

Undetected Danger
Hijackers Remain Mystery to Saudis
Saudi officials have revealed next to nothing about the Sept. 11 hijackers. The official position is that even the theory that Saudi citizens were involved remains unproven. But in private, Saudi and American officials say the real mystery to the Saudi government is not whether Saudi citizens took part, but how so many of them were able to evade detection by the Saudi authorities.
"All names that have been mentioned in the incident," Prince Nayef, the interior minister, said in an interview, when asked what his government had learned about the Saudis named by the Americans as hijackers, "they do not have the capability to act in a professional way." The statement amounted to yet another denial of Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks.
To the Saudis, American officials say, the fact that the Saudis involved in the assaults were unknown to them was almost as startling as the attacks themselves.
In recent years, the mubahith, the Saudi equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, infiltrated Al Qaeda cells within the kingdom, while the monitoring of the Saudis fighting abroad was thought to have kept a handle on potential troublemakers.
American officials say it is now clear that Al Qaeda networks were more deeply entrenched in Saudi Arabia than either the United States or Saudi Arabia understood. But they also say the Saudis may have missed clues left by young men like Hani Hanjour, a reclusive, religious young Saudi who told his family that he was working as a pilot in the United Arab Emirates from 1997 to 2000, but never left a phone number, and is now suspected of having been in Afghanistan at least part of that time.
Among the Saudi hijackers, only two, including Khalid al-Midhar, ever turned up on the State Department's antiterrorist watchlists, American officials say, and not until after they entered the United States. They had been identified as suspicious, not by the Saudi authorities, but because they stopped in Malaysia to meet with Mr. Atash, the suspect in the Cole attack.
Some American officials say that the Saudis placed a higher premium on hounding potential troublemakers out of the kingdom than keeping tabs once they left.
"Isn't it better that they go off and fight a foreign jihad, rather than hang around the mosques without a job and cause trouble in Saudi Arabia?" said one such official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in summing up what he called the Saudi view. "They've radicalized a group that wouldn't have been so radical had they stayed home."
At the Zohra mosque in Riyadh, Sheik Sadlaan said the end of Ramadan seemed like a good time for reflection. The news from Afghanistan had been disturbing, with the names of young Saudis killed in battle beginning to circulate around the kingdom, posted on Web sites but never mentioned in Saudi newspapers, which operate under close government supervision.
The dead included young men like Badr Muhammad al-Shubaneh, whose tearful relatives were telling callers that they still could not explain why the 22-year-old college freshman, a social studies student at King Fahd University in Riyadh, had abruptly left the kingdom a year ago, to end up killed in Afghanistan in the first week of December.
"It's a big problem," Sheik Sadlaan said of the zeal for jihad. "It will create problems for the country and beyond."
But with Muslims seen as under siege in so many places, he said, he could not imagine the militancy ending any time soon. "It's not just the Saudis," he said. "The strong desire to help and defend and fight for the Muslims -- it's felt all over the Arab world."

HEADLINE: A Nation Challenged 

 BODY:
 New Plan, New Captives

SEARCH IS ALTERED -- The United States military has revised a risky plan for American troops to search the caves of Tora Bora for traces of Osama bin Laden and other fighters of Al Qaeda, and is once again urging local forces to take the lead. Just last Friday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he was ordering hundreds more American troops to join Afghan militia in the hunt. A1

MORE DETAINEES -- The Marine-led force in Afghanistan took custody of 20 more Arab fighters, accelerating the hand-over of Al Qaeda prisoners from the new government. B2

GENERAL'S BOAST -- General Abdul Rashid Dostum, the newly appointed deputy defense minister for Afghanistan, made clear that he believed that nobody could govern the country without his support. B1

Leaders' Voices

BIN LADEN TAPE -- A new videotaped statement from Osama bin Laden, purportedly made in late November or early December, shows him looking tired and gaunt but alive. If, as Mr. bin Laden suggests, it was filmed three months after the Sept. 11 attacks, the tape offers proof that he survived the first waves of the American bombing campaign in Afghanistan. A1

SECURITY IN FOREFRONT -- President Bush will emphasize domestic security in his State of the Union speech next month and propose billions of dollars in security initiatives in his new budget, officials say. To underscore the new priority, the budget will include a separate section on domestic security, including aid for police and fire departments and for the public health system. B1

PEACEKEEPING FORCE -- Afghanistan's foreign minister, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, said that negotiations over the shape and duration of an international security force were nearing their end. So far only a few dozen peacekeepers have arrived in Kabul; the size of the force could reach 5,000. B3

The Saudi Paradox

SOURCE OF FIGHTERS -- Thousands of young Saudis have left their country to wage Islamic holy war in the last decade, and Saudi leaders have let them go, aware of the danger they may pose to the United States but more focused on the danger they may pose at home. At least four times in the last six years, Saudis have been among the terrorists who bombed American targets. But not until October, after the American military campaign in Afghanistan began, did Saudi Arabia detain young men trying to join that fight. A1

AL QAEDA'S SHIPS -- Osama bin Laden's organization is said to control at least 20 ships, mostly purchased years ago, when Mr. bin Laden was not yet mixing commerce with terror and neither he nor his lieutenants were recognized for what they were to become. B1

TEMPERED DISSENT -- After spending five years in a Saudi prison, the religious scholar Sheik Salman al-Awdah is again playing an influential role in that nation's political opposition. In lectures broadcast by telephone and accessible on the Internet, he has renewed tempered calls on the government to consider reforms while also admonishing young Saudis against heeding calls for jihad. B4

The Shoe Bomb Suspect

INSIDE FLIGHT 63 -- The passengers and crew members who subdued the man known as Richard C. Reid on Flight 63 thought he was unruly and possibly drunk, but they had no inkling of the possible disaster they had just prevented -- that the man's shoes contained explosives powerful enough to bring down the plane. A1

A CRIMINAL PAST -- Mr. Reid, also known as Abdel Rahim, is a British small-time criminal who converted to Islam in prison and then was lured to radical action by Muslim extremists, the head of a London mosque he attended confirmed. B6

CHAGRIN IN FRANCE -- The failure of the French police to realize that a man they were questioning was a human bomb and their efforts to explain how he made it onto Flight 63 to Miami turned into finger-pointing and public defensiveness. B6

AGENT DENIED FLIGHT -- An Arab-American member of President Bush's security detail was denied passage on an American Airlines flight Tuesday evening after the pilot questioned his credentials. B6

Aftermath in New York

REBUILDING PLAN -- Governor Pataki unveiled a $700 million plan to distribute the first installment of federal aid designed to revive the economy of Lower Manhattan. Funds will go to small businesses and retailers crippled by the Sept. 11 attacks and to corporations that the city hopes to keep in the downtown area. D1

FOOD BANKS STRUGGLING -- Perhaps 1.5 million New Yorkers now rely on food pantries, which offer free provisions. But with donations sinking since the terror attacks and the need for food increasing, the system is in danger of collapse. D1

SOLACE IN CULTURE -- While the Sept. 11 attack has frightened hundreds of thousands of visitors from most of New York's cultural centers, New Yorkers have been more eager than ever to visit parks, zoos and botanical gardens. D3

The Arts

A BAND'S NEW FAME -- No new cases of anthrax have been reported for weeks, and that is good news for everyone, including Anthrax, the metal band from Bayside, Queens, that has become more famous for its name than its music. E1

Business

AID TO AIRLINES -- America West Airlines, which is the country's eighth-largest carrier and one that was struggling even before the terror attacks, has asked for help under a $10 billion federal loan program created to bolster the airline industry. The country's other airlines, which together have lost billions of dollars since Sept. 11, are watching the process closely. C1

HEADLINE: Mayor Defends His Planning To Build New Sports Stadiums 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
With less than a week remaining in his term, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani again defended the idea of building two new baseball stadiums and lashed out at critics yesterday who suggest that the city should be putting its strained resources elsewhere.
 "Baseball is a tremendously big business," Mr. Giuliani said. "It's like keeping the Stock Exchange here. This is by far, without any doubts, one of the best deals in sports." 
 Those who criticize the spending of public money on building stadiums while the city is suffering from the economic fallout from a recession and the damage to Lower Manhattan "haven't the foggiest idea of what they're talking about," he added.
The mayor also said it was important to show the committee making selections for the 2012 Olympics that the city was committed to construction, because the city would need to build an arena to accommodate the Games. Later, on the related matter of building an arena on the West Side of Manhattan that could be used for football games and 100 to 200 indoor events a year, the mayor said that without it, the city would jeopardize its chances of landing the Games.
Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg, whose administration would have to carry out the stadium plans, said yesterday with Mr. Giuliani by his side that he thought it was good that the current mayor was trying to ensure that the city and its facilities remained "first class."
"Even though we have a current budget problem, we should not forget the future," Mr. Bloomberg said. "This is a city of big ideas, and big projects and a big heart, and things that take many years to do, you have to continue to work on, even when you happen to have tough times short term."
Under the Giuliani plan, the Mets and the Yankees would each pay half of the building costs. A new stadium for the Mets is expected to cost about $800 million to build, while the estimated cost for a new Yankees stadium, which is at an earlier planning stage, has not been disclosed. But officials suggested that it would be a comparable amount. In addition, the mayor said, the state would contribute $300 million to $350 million to help with infrastructure, like new or repaired parking facilities and train stations.
"The state is going to do all the things that they promised to do some time ago, which is to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure," Mr. Giuliani said of his plan.
Gov. George E. Pataki reiterated yesterday that the state would help with the infrastructure, but not the direct building of the stadiums. "That's between the city and the private owners," he said, "but we will keep the commitment that has been made to help with infrastructure."
Mr. Giuliani said rent payments would be determined according to a formula, depending on how well the teams performed each year, that would substantially increase what the city earns now. "We stand to make an enormous amount of money if they have great seasons," he said. "And in weaker seasons, we would do O.K."
The mayor also said that the deals, whose final details are still under negotiation, would keep the teams in the city for 35 years and save millions in upkeep on the present stadiums. To maintain the teams' present stadiums for a decade or more, Mr. Giuliani said, "could cost all of the rent that we get and then some." 
The plan for the Yankees, in which a new stadium would be built in Macombs Dam Park in the South Bronx, would require the approval of the State Legislature of a plan to substitute parkland for what would be lost in the construction, he said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DOMESTIC SECURITY; 
Security Issues Called a Focus Of Next Budget

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
Addressing the challenge of strengthening the nation against terrorist threats, President Bush will emphasize domestic security in his State of the Union speech next month and propose billions of dollars in security initiatives in his new budget, White House officials say.
 To underscore the new national priority, the budget will include for the first time a separate section on domestic security, including aid for local police and fire departments, assistance for the public health system and money for upgrading technology and for agencies at the front lines of the struggle to protect the public. 
 "We will multiply our investments in what we now call homeland security," Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, said in an interview.
The final figure would be "dramatically" above current spending levels for domestic security, Mr. Daniels said, adding, "This is real money." 
Mr. Daniels did not use specific figures. Other administration officials said that while the budget for the 2003 federal fiscal year was still being assembled, it was likely to contain as much as $40 billion in measures for security and fighting terrorism.
It was not clear just what programs officials were counting. But the amount would compare to roughly $25 billion in similar security measures in the current budget.
The budget will highlight and bring into sharper focus the first efforts of Mr. Bush's fledgling Office of Homeland Security, run by Tom Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania, who stepped into the new job in October.
While lawmakers have given Mr. Ridge time to establish himself, some critics in Congress say they remain unconvinced that he has enough power as an adviser to the president to do his job. They argue that Mr. Ridge should have cabinet status and his own agency outside the White House.
"Right now, the war effort abroad is highly organized and highly effective," said Representative Jane Harman of California, the senior Democrat on a House terrorism subcommittee, "and the homeland security effort is not highly organized and not highly effective."
The focus on securing the nation is also sure to set off a debate about how large a federal government is needed to safeguard everything from air travel to public health to the nation's borders. Democrats -- traditionally more comfortable with a larger governmental presence than Republicans -- are expected to push to enlarge the security effort beyond what Mr. Bush will propose.
"Like it or not, the federal government is going to have to expand," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, "and the American people are going to demand that it expand."
Two Democratic senators, Harry Reid of Nevada and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, for example, are calling for a federal security force to guard the nation's nuclear power plants.
Perhaps the most difficult question for Mr. Ridge and the Bush administration is how much security is enough. Experts say that in a nation as open as the United States, with a million people on average entering the country daily, the vulnerabilities are almost limitless.
"They've got the whole waterfront," said Dr. Amy E. Smithson, an expert on biological and chemical weapons at the Henry L. Stimson Center, a private group in Washington, referring to the homeland security office. "And there's not a single aspect of that panoply of terrorism prospects, whether it's cyberspace or bioterrorism, that they can be seen as not paying utmost attention to."
States and localities, too, will be putting billions of dollars into security and are lobbying for more federal assistance.
The United States Conference of Mayors has called for a new federal block grant program to localities to help pay for security measures. Local officials say they also want to make sure that new money for security is not offset by cuts in other programs.
"We think a homeland security block grant is essential," said Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans, the president of the conference. "But in a climate of economic downturn, increases in homelessness and against the progress cities have made, it is not the right approach to rob Peter to pay Paul."
Mr. Ridge's office has a staff of about 50 people, about half its eventual planned size, and the budget proposals are just the first step in creating a comprehensive national security strategy. The effort, his aides say, is related to counterterrorism, which seeks to identify threats posed by shadowy enemies and the motivations, abilities and whereabouts of their terrorist networks.
Yet the analysts are focusing not just on threats, but also on where the United States is weak, where it is unprepared to respond to a catastrophic attack, where the complex, overlapping relationship between federal government and states has the potential to leave no one in charge should terrorists strike.
"How do we want to button up America?" Mr. Ridge asked recently. "How do we want to harden America? How do we want to reduce the threat?"
Or, as one of Mr. Ridge's senior aides said, "I think about it as vulnerability reduction."
Some of the country's most glaring weaknesses were ones that government officials scrambled to deal with after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Combat jets flew patrols over cities. Airspace was closed over nuclear power plants, and the plant operators were ordered to their highest level of security. National Guard troops took up arms in airports. And Border Patrol agents along the thinly policed border with Canada worked double shifts. 
Now Mr. Ridge's aides and officials across the government are coming up with new lists of security priorities, to be addressed in this budget and subsequent ones.
The officials cite a national health care system that would not be able to cope with the casualties that could be caused by a mass biological or chemical attack after a decade when managed care and cost containment caused it to shrink. They speak of the containers full of cargo that pour into American ports and get only spot-checks.
They point to the inability of the numerous government agencies to communicate intelligence to each other or get access to different databases, and they say there will be initiatives to deal with such problems in the president's budget. They speak of shortages of equipment and training among first responders and promise an infusion of money for those police and firefighters.
To help set priorities, Mr. Ridge has divided his staff into 13 policy coordinating committees reviewing issues including surveillance and intelligence; terrorism training exercises and evaluation; weapons of mass destruction; border, territorial waters and airspace security; research and development; and medical and public health preparedness.
The committees report to Adm. Steve Abbot, who was deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and commander of the sixth fleet before he retired.
Admiral Abbot returned to the government in May at the request of Vice President Dick Cheney when the president assigned Mr. Cheney to review national preparedness for responding to weapons of mass destruction. He is now deputy director to Mr. Ridge.
"I'm a former military officer and grew up looking at the Soviet threat in the cold war era," Admiral Abbot said. "That's time gone by now."
Acknowledging that the terrorist threat is more diffuse, he said, "You can still take a complex problem and one that perhaps is fuzzier at the edges in some respects than that nice crisp cold war experience and attack it in a systemic manner."
Reporting to Mr. Ridge and Admiral Abbot is a growing corps of individuals who have studied terrorism or have hands-on experience in disaster management. Michael Byrne, a 20-year veteran of the New York City Fire Department and a high-ranking official of the New York City region of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is senior director of response and recovery.
Dr. Richard A. Falkenrath, a faculty member at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, has moved over from the National Security Council to be senior director of policy and plans. A co-author of "America's Achilles' Heel," about the nuclear, biological and chemical terrorist threats, Dr. Falkenrath has criticized the federal domestic preparedness program as disorganized and lacking a guiding strategic concept.
Gen. Bruce Lawlor, the first commander of a new military operation called the Joint Task Force Civil Support that would respond if the United States experienced a chemical, biological or nuclear attack has been appointed senior director of protection and prevention.
And Frank J. Cilluffo, an analyst of counterterrorism and information warfare at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, has joined the staff as a special assistant to the president.

HEADLINE: Homelessness in New York 

 BODY:
Mayor-Elect Michael Bloomberg faces all sorts of daunting challenges when he takes office in New York City next week. High on the list are the twin problems of hunger and homelessness that have taxed soup kitchens to the limit and jammed the city's homeless shelters with record numbers of men, women and children. In a city where so many people are needy, the problem of what to do for the very neediest has bedeviled mayors for the last two decades. We hope Mr. Bloomberg can bring a new energy and determination to the issue. 
 The crowds at the soup kitchens and homeless shelters were already growing before the Sept. 11 terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan rocked the local economy, costing the city nearly 80,000 mainly low-income jobs in October alone. Many of those thrown out of work are still receiving unemployment benefits or emergency disaster aid. But the state has nonetheless reported that welfare caseloads grew between September and October. After six years of dramatic reductions, New York may be facing the beginning of a new surge in the welfare population. 
 Local food pantries are reporting a startling increase in the number of New Yorkers who seem to be putting what money they have toward the rent and turning to charitable organizations to feed their families. People who somehow found ways to support themselves in the booming 90's have begun to reappear on the streets and subways. As of the November census, the city's homeless shelters housed about 30,000 men, women and children. Homeless-rights lawyers describe this as the largest number since the city began keeping records in the early 1980's.
The state provides a welfare family of three with a rent subsidy of just $286 a month -- far short of the nearly $700 it would cost that same family to find a two-bedroom apartment in a low-income neighborhood. However, that is still far less than the $36,000 a year it costs to house a family in a hotel- style shelter.
Mr. Bloomberg should begin his administration by vowing to ensure that every New Yorker who is eligible for federally funded food programs is enrolled to get help as soon as possible. Beyond that, he should work with Albany to redirect the state's homeless dollars toward housing subsidies. Common sense calls for a policy that keeps as many people as possible in their own homes instead of driving them into homeless shelters that cost the city and state a fortune.

Late Surge in Holiday Sales May Have Lifted Retailers
A surge of last-minute shopping may have given the nation's retailers and the economy a small boost, according to several reports on holiday sales.
 The late sales gains will not add much to retailers' profits because most of the increases came after deep price cuts. Still, analysts said the discounts that moved merchandise out of the stores should be good for the overall economy. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Harvard Is Seen Gaining In Economics Game; 
Top Graduates No Longer Favor M.I.T.

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL STEINBERGER 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Last March, when Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary, was named the 27th president of Harvard University, nowhere was the popular choice greeted with more enthusiasm than on the second floor of Littauer Center, home to the economics department.
 "People were delighted," said Oliver Hart, the department's chairman. "Larry has a lot of friends here." 
 It's no wonder. Mr. Summers, 47, is almost a pure product of Harvard's economics department. While he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate, he received a Harvard doctorate in 1982, became the youngest tenured member ever of its faculty at age 28 and taught there for eight years before leaving for Washington in 1991. 
More important, Mr. Summers -- whose sharp rise has given him enormous influence in policy and scholarly circles -- epitomizes the increasingly important position that Harvard now holds in the world of academic economics.
Harvard's economics department is on a roll these days, attracting a disproportionate number of the most coveted graduate students and turning out an equally hefty share of the most promising young economists. Making it all the sweeter is that Harvard's success is helping it eclipse the profession's traditional lodestar, the economics department at crosstown rival M.I.T.
"We feel we are currently winning the competition," Mr. Hart said. "Over the past five to eight years, things have moved in our direction."
Ben Bernanke, who is now the chairman of Princeton University's economics department, recalls that M.I.T. was long the premier incubator of economists and an intellectual hothouse that thoroughly overshadowed Harvard. Indeed, when he was an undergraduate at Harvard in the 1970's, even Mr. Bernanke's own Harvard adviser recommended M.I.T.'s doctoral program.
"He told me that's where all the best students went, and he was right," Professor Bernanke said.
That's no longer true. "Now, things aren't so clear-cut," he said.
One reason the balance of power in Cambridge has shifted is because Harvard has made itself a much better teaching institution. At the same time, M.I.T. has become, relative to Harvard at least, a less attractive place to study economics, in large part because it has suffered a number of prominent defections from its faculty over the past decade. The altered competitive landscape represents another twist in a long, storied rivalry, but it also reflects the changes that have swept the field of economics generally.
In a sense, M.I.T.'s department is being victimized by its own success. It has remained a small shop as the profession it led to prominence has become a sprawling subject. Moreover, the discipline's biggest names are now virtually celebrities, with opportunities extending beyond the lecture hall. Yet M.I.T. clings to the egalitarianism that has always been its trademark; one former faculty member jokingly calls it "the last kibbutz in economics."
Whatever their comparative strengths and weaknesses, M.I.T. and Harvard, which each admit around 25 doctoral candidates annually, still boast what are widely acknowledged to be the two finest graduate programs in economics.
The rivalry between Harvard and M.I.T. is fueled nowadays primarily by proximity and ego. "It's the narcissism of small differences," said Michael Kremer, a specialist in issues of growth and development who jumped from M.I.T. to Harvard two years ago. And while Harvard is a more politically active department, there is no real ideological divide.
Both departments lean to the left politically, though Harvard is more catholic in its composition: its faculty includes two leading conservative economists, Robert Barro and Martin Feldstein. Each school practices what is known as Cambridge-style economics, which, while heavily mathematical, is less formalistic and theoretical than the economics done at the University of Chicago, which has long been at the forefront of the free market school of economics championed by Milton Friedman, who taught there for many years.
Many of the professors and students in Cambridge have taught or studied on both campuses, and there is frequent collaboration among faculty members. Except during recruiting season. "Recruiting is a good old-fashioned fight," said Olivier Blanchard, M.I.T.'s chairman."It usually takes a few weeks for friendships to be restored. Apart from that, it's a state of generalized incest."
It's a rivalry, however, that was conceived in bad blood. In October 1940, a remarkably gifted 25-year-old economist named Paul Samuelson, then an instructor at Harvard, was offered a professorship by M.I.T., which at the time had a threadbare economics department. Harvard was expected to eagerly match the offer, but it did not.
It was widely understood that Mr. Samuelson was snubbed because he was Jewish. Even those who saw it differently acknowledged that anti-Semitism was a factor. The renowned Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, who was then teaching at Harvard, remarked: "I could understand if they didn't want to hire him because he is a Jew. But that wasn't it. he was just too brilliant for them."
From his perch at M.I.T., Mr. Samuelson revolutionized economics. Although firmly in the Keynesian camp, his foremost achievement was to unite a century of economic insights, many of them seemingly at odds, into a single, coherent theory -- the neoclassical synthesis, as it was called -- that would dominate economic discourse for some three decades. He also wrote a primer on economics that, 50 years later, remains a popular introductory textbook around the world.
In the early 1950's, he was joined at M.I.T. by another talented young refugee from Harvard, Robert Solow. Together, Professors Samuelson and Solow turned M.I.T. into the institution that best embodied mainstream economic thought. They were distinguished not just for their path-breaking work, but also for their dedication to nurturing their students.
From the 1950's through the 1980's, Harvard's economics department was no match for M.I.T.'s. While it had a fine faculty, professors were not particularly interested in teaching either undergraduate or graduate students, who often received little guidance. "One was hesitant to send students to Harvard," said David Colander, an economist at Middlebury College. "You knew they would receive a good education at M.I.T.; at Harvard, they would have to educate themselves."
Consequently, M.I.T. almost always beat Harvard for the most prized doctoral candidates.
In the early 1990's, however, the first signs of shifting fortunes emerged. Professors Samuelson and Solow, along with other members of the old guard, began to retire even as M.I.T. lost some younger stars as well. In 1993, Mr. Hart and Drew Fudenberg, two leading microeconomic theorists, bolted for Harvard. Shortly thereafter, Jean Tirole, another microeconomic theorist, returned to his native France.
Meanwhile, Harvard was becoming a more user-friendly place, thanks mainly to an influx of M.I.T. economists who had been reared on the Samuelson-Solow ethos.
"In the past, if you were a graduate student, you really took your chances coming here," Mr. Hart, the department's chairman, said. "But the culture has changed. We're able to compete with M.I.T. now because we have people who were taught in the M.I.T. tradition and believe in treating graduate students well."
In the meantime, M.I.T.'s faculty exodus has continued. Besides losing Mr. Kremer, the department could not prevent Susan Athey, a highly reguarded young microeconomist, from going to Stanford University. It also suffered an even bigger defection when Paul Krugman, arguably the world's most influential trade theorist and also a columnist for The New York Times, left for Princeton.
M.I.T. now finds itself at a disadvantage on several fronts. Over the last few decades, economics has flowered into a broad, yet highly specialized, field. With some 60 full-time faculty, Harvard can blanket the subject. M.I.T.'s economics department is half that size.
"It seemed to me that Harvard is a better place if you don't know exactly what you want to study," said one first-year student there, who chose Harvard's economics program over M.I.T.'s. "It's got almost every area covered, and in almost every area it has people who are at the top of the field."
Small was once beautiful for M.I.T., but the department also made a virtue of necessity. For all its influence on the outside world, economics has never cast a large shadow within the university itself. "No one comes to M.I.T. as an undergraduate with the intention of pursuing a degree in economics," Professor Blanchard said.
Engineering and computer science are M.I.T.'s bread and butter; as a result, more resources flow in that direction. "The administration has always been accommodating and generous," said Peter Temin, who has taught economics at M.I.T. since the mid-1960's, "but it prefers to put money into labs than give it to people who just sit there with PC's."
While M.I.T. pays top dollar for faculty, it has trouble matching Harvard's generous housing allowances. Likewise, there is less money floating around for graduate students; some M.I.T. doctoral candidates even serve as Harvard teaching assistants.
M.I.T. is also being punished for remaining true to its teaching mission. The field, notes Princeton's Mr. Bernanke, is now in a "race to the bottom" in terms of teaching loads, with major departments requiring fewer and fewer hours of instruction from faculty. Princeton economists are obligated to teach two course a year. The same applies at Harvard. M.I.T. insists that its faculty teach two and a half courses.
That may not seem like a big difference, but M.I.T. is also less willing to sanction the kind of outside activities that are now commonplace for heavyweight economists.
"There are people who have left who I would have loved to have kept, but we couldn't offer them what other places might," Mr. Blanchard conceded. "There are departments that are willing to bring in big names, pay them lots of money, and let them teach one introductory course a year and to spend four days a week on the road. That is something we will not do."
But for all its comparative difficulties, M.I.T. continues to attract plenty of the best and the brightest: Princeton, Stanford, and Chicago still lag in the battle for graduate students. "When I think about these challenges in the abstract, I think to myself, gee, this is a real problem," Mr. Temin said. "But then, when I look around and see all the talent we have here, things don't look so bad after all."

Noir Indeed Is the Night, So Very Dark and Stormy

BYLINE:  By Anita Gates 

 BODY:
Adam Goldberg's good-looking black-and-white movie "Scotch and Milk" knows its Sam Spade; its Mickey Spillane; its all-noir vocabulary, visual and verbal. The film begins with shots of big-city building exteriors, a taxi roof light, a cigarette in close-up. Mr. Goldberg's voice-over sets the mood, to say the least: "There wasn't particularly anything to do that week, but then there never was in the city that's always sleeping. A familiar voice was telling me a story, one I had heard too many times before." 
 The viewer has to assume that Mr. Goldberg is having a little fun with the genre by recreating it, but it's an imitation without impact. The only point made by "Scotch and Milk," which has its television premiere tonight on the Sundance Channel, is that American ennui is alive and thriving among youngish, white, chronically unemployed males. As a film-school exercise in noir camera work, "Scotch and Milk" is expert. As an entertainment, it's mostly unsatisfying, despite the appeal of Mr. Goldberg, whom audiences know as an actor in films like "Saving Private Ryan" and the current drama "A Beautiful Mind." 
 The film takes place during one man's aimless ride in a New York taxi ("Just drive around downtown") on a rainy night. Our protagonist, Jim (Mr. Goldberg, who also wrote and directed the film), spends the trip reflecting on his life in a series of short, scattered flashbacks. Jim's life seems to consist of being rowdy with his male buddies (among them Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Pastorelli and Mr. Goldberg's old co-stars on "Dazed and Confused" Nicky Katt and Cole Hauser) when he isn't busy failing at his relationship with Ilsa (Clea Lewis), a pretty, soft-spoken woman who has read Nathanael West. ("You're a smart chick," he tells her admiringly.)
The men dress and behave in a style somewhere between Jack Kerouac and the Rat Pack, but they talk -- in their own superficial way, heavy on the R-rated adjectives -- about the big issues. "Time either runs out too fast or it takes too long," Jim observes just before three of the guys decide to spend an evening out on the town. At a bar Mr. Pastorelli says in a voice slurred with drink, "You can't think too much, because the mind is for more than just thinking." There is even a discussion of the afterlife, with the observation that in hell at least you'd be among old friends. And once in a while insight appears. When Ilsa accuses Jim of loving the sound of his own voice, he tells her that's impossible because he truly hates himself. "It's the same thing, Jimmy," she says.
Jim seems to be an aspiring poet. That is, he owns a typewriter and talks a lot about his inability to write. It may be just as well, based on the originality of much of the script. "It was night already -- again," Jim thinks in voice-over, looking out a city window. "But it was warm, and there was a faint smell of lilacs." The lines dividing homage, parody and accidental comedy are dangerously thin.

HEADLINE: What's New at Ford? Try the 2003 Model T 

BYLINE:  By TONY SWAN 

DATELINE: REDFORD, Mich. 

 BODY:
THEY say that history repeats itself, and in one quiet corner of the sprawling Ford Motor Company empire, that aphorism is literally true.
 Ford has resumed production of its legendary Model T, the car that put America on wheels, though the factory consists of a single large bay in one of the company's engineering buildings here, and the final assembly crew is just two workers. 
 The hiatus has been a long one.
Model T production began in October 1908 and ended on May 31, 1927. Ford built more than 15 million of the cars, a single-make record that stood for decades until it was surpassed by the Volkswagen Beetle. 
Although the Model T was thoroughly obsolete by the end of its long run, it was tough, durable and -- its chief virtue -- cheap.
In 1908, the list price for a basic two-seat runabout was $860. By 1925, thanks to economies of scale that followed the 1913 introduction of the moving assembly line, the same car cost just $250.
At one point, half the cars on the planet were Model T's.
Ford has made just half a dozen of its latter-day T's, though it could possibly build more. The new cars were commissioned by Ford for the company's 2003 centennial celebrations.
If you could buy one, which you can't, the new cars would be a lot more expensive than the originals, since economies of scale certainly don't apply. The limited production stands in sharp contrast to output at the Model T plant in Highland Park, Mich., where as many as 8,900 cars left the line in a single day.
To be fair, ramping up for production took a lot of time because the team -- Bill Leland, an engineer with Ford's advanced vehicle engineering group, and Guy Zaninovich, an independent auto restorer and Model T expert -- started with a well-restored 1914 Model T touring car and little else.
But the project seems to have had an ample budget -- enough to call on outside suppliers for items like new body shells, engine block castings, cylinder heads, transmissions, rear axles and more.
It was a complicated process. The original engineering drawings, which had been executed on linen, had long ago crumbled to dust. So to get precise specifications for the castings for the four-cylinder engine block, Mr. Leland and Mr. Zaninovich submitted an original block for a CAT scan at Hill Air Force Base, near Ogden, Utah. The scan generated a three-dimensional computer model, which was used, in turn, to create the castings.
A woodworking team -- Sture Lundin and Sven Hansson -- was brought in from Sweden to hand-craft the bodywork (sheet metal supported by wood) for the new cars.
Other replica parts were easier to obtain.
With so many Model T's still running -- Mr. Zaninovich estimates that there are some 300,000 out there -- there are several sources for replacement items like ignition coils, magnetos, carburetors, brakes, lamps, wheels and the like.
And the partners do acknowledge some departures from the original. For example, the pistons are aluminum and the valves are stainless steel, instead of the cast iron originally used. The substitutes are more durable and efficient.
Even with so many parts ready-made by outside companies, this is an expensive way for Ford to acquire Model T's for its centennial. No one connected with the program will discuss costs, but there is no doubt that building one of these all-new T's exceeded the $25,000 or so that it would have taken to buy a well-restored original.
So what was the point? "Well, what we really wanted to do here," Mr. Leland said, "was say we'd made a new Model T."
Ford has not decided exactly how the cars will fit into its centennial plans, but four have already been donated to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. If in 2003 you visit Greenfield Village, a historic park affiliated with the museum, you are likely to see -- and possibly ride in -- one of the painstaking replicas.
And if you can distinguish the new ones from the old, your eye is sharper than most.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
When a Year Becomes An Old Acquaintance

BYLINE:  By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
Soon it will be over. That may be the best thing left about 2001. No one needs to be reminded of the devastation of Sept. 11, of the recession that was already under way, of a war with no immediate end in sight. And it would hardly be surprising if New Year's Eve events were more muted than they have been in recent years, and filled with mixed emotions: relief, sadness, determination, uncertainty, hope.
 The rituals of New Year's Eve, observing the change of calendar in a blur of noise and intoxication, have always tied good riddance to stubborn optimism. Fireworks, confetti, "Auld Lang Syne," shouts, kisses, honking horns and popping corks expunge the past year while making the next one joyful for at least as long as the party lasts. Like most rituals, they provide the reassurance of familiarity and continuity. For a few escapist hours, they may even hold this year's sobering realities at bay. 
 The public and media events this wartime New Year balance pleasure and duty. The glittering ball will drop at midnight in Times Square, but New York City's new mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, will also be sworn in there as a symbol of civic stability. Perennial New Year's events, like the concert and Mass for world peace at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and the Poetry Project's Jan. 1 marathon at St. Mark's Church, are likely to be especially charged.
Television suddenly grew in importance on Sept. 11, and many more stay-at-homes are expected this year. MTV will proceed with its annual New Year's Eve show, including the punk-pop of Sum 41 and the hip-hop of Ja Rule, but on New Year's Day at 2 p.m., it will have a counterpart: a U.S.O. special from Rammstein, Germany, interspersing performances by Jennifer Lopez and Kid Rock with conversations with the troops. 
Meanwhile, Turner Classic Movies is playing Dec. 31 for laughs with a marathon of 13 Marx Brothers movies. Dick Clark's 30th annual "New Year's Rockin' Eve" special on ABC-TV, with Blink 182, Aerosmith and Barry Manilow, will be preceded by its counterbalance: a three-and-a-half-hour news special combining a retrospective of 2001 with New Year's events from Afghanistan, Jerusalem, Tokyo, Edinburgh, Moscow and Rio de Janeiro. It will also have music from U2, Sting and Arlo Guthrie, who will sing "This Land Is Your Land," written by his father, Woody Guthrie.
"I can't imagine anyone celebrating the new year without some sense of commemoration as well as challenge," said Peter Jennings, the ABC anchor. "But people still think we have an awful lot to celebrate. There is a quite remarkable resilience in this country."
Polls taken by ABC News for the program show optimism, Mr. Jennings added. "Eighty percent of folks were more hopeful rather than fearful about what the coming year holds for them personally," he said. "It probably reaffirms the great notion that the country is able to withstand so much pain and to still be a beacon for the rest of the world."
In 2001, simply going to work turned people into victims and heroes. And for the last few months, consumption, even self-indulgence, has begun to be touted as tantamount to a public service. Add a heightened sense of mortality, a longing for frivolousness to seem as compelling as it was earlier this year, and the result is something like a government-approved suspension of the Puritan ethic. It's the antithesis of World War II, when rationing and austerity were the duties of the home front.
"One thing I find everywhere," Mr. Jennings said, "is a confusion about whether the leadership, principally the president, is going to ask people to sacrifice over the long term. We haven't been asked to do that yet." And New Year's Eve is traditionally a night when gratification is not to be delayed.
At least, events promoters hope so. Clubs are just beginning to recover from their empty weeks after Sept. 11 and still face the effects of decreased tourism. As always, the city has events for every musical taste, from the Metropolitan Opera's "Boheme" gala to hipster rock of the Strokes and Guided by Voices at the Apollo Theater to the drum-and-bass marathon at the Limelight. But many of the headliners are locals rather than touring musicians, perhaps reflecting musicians' reluctance to travel or promoters' lower budgets.
Michael Dorf, the founder and chief executive of the Knitting Factory in TriBeCa, has seen audiences return after a two-month lull, but he has also noted a change. "People are drinking more and maybe have a slightly more zealous approach to life," he said. "They would rather not spend a lot of money on a ticket and spend more on beverages."
Running a club that has always prided itself on its experimental side, he has run into a paradox. "I've had some of the most intense conversations with musicians about what's important in this world since Sept. 11," Mr. Dorf said. "On one hand I think things have gotten deeper as the creators of music think hard about why they are in it. But as a business proposition, right now we have to present what people are wanting to pay for rather than having more visionary aspirations."
In a 21st century that was touted as the era of easy global interchange and of the instant mobility of cyberspace, the attacks were a brutal reminder of physicality, of the stubbornness of place and time. New York City night life, concentrated in the city where virtually every culture has an outpost, has always defined the happier flip side of that physicality. Site-specific and ephemeral, it brings together self-selected strangers -- 24 million a year in live music and cabaret-licensed clubs alone, according to 1997 research by the New York Nightlife Association, a club owners' group -- in, as the old-school rap line goes, "the place to be."
The rocker, poet and bandleader Patti Smith has become a staple of New Year's Eve in New York City. This year, as usual, she is performing at the Bowery Ballroom. "I really thought it was more important than ever to do this job and to do it in New York," she said. "I had all these great offers to play New Year's Eve in all these different places, and I thought: 'I don't want to go anywhere. I want to be home here in the city. I want to gather with the people and find out where they're at and where I'm at."
For Ms. Smith, it's not just a recurring gig but an annual milestone. "The 30th of December is my birthday and the 31st is New Year's Eve, and they're both deeply reflective days," she said. "I figure, either celebrate it like a monk, alone and writing, or as a happy warrior, and I'm still in happy warrior mode. I think it's important to address what happened on 9/11, to remember the people who have passed, to consider the plight of Afghan civilians and the refugees, to consider what our government policy is, to comprehend how our civil rights are being tampered with. I'm looking to addressing all of these things as best as I can through our music."
Ms. Smith has written a new song, with the working title "Have a Heart," about John Walker, the American who joined the Taliban. "I find his story to be a microcosm of everything," she said. "It's one human story. Someone who as an American, having freedom to do so, searching for a pure state of expression, whether religious philosophy or some kind of philosophy, going from that search to being where he wound up."
"I'm not thinking that people are going to come and get a world history lesson," she said. "But we're not going to avoid it, and we're not going to avoid different aspects of it, whether sorrow, grief or anger. But I'm very aware that people also need some respite. I'm also going to do some songs that I haven't done in over 20 years, because I know they'll be a lot of fun for people."
"With all that there'll be some out-of-tune singing and a couple of bad guitar chords," Ms. Smith added. "It'll be, hopefully, a raucous, flawed night. I always remember one thing, which is that anybody who's there will have made it, will have gotten through another year. Every year we lose some friends, and a lot of people got lost this year. But anybody's who's there will be alive. In that little Bowery Ballroom, we're what I would like to see us as -- trying to radiate as much positive strength as possible so people can go out in the world and feel strengthened and feel like we're not alone."

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

CALL it the year of good will gone bad. Never in history has so much in intangible assets been wiped off balance sheets as companies were forced to acknowledge that they had made some very bad acquisitions.
 But records are made to be broken, and accountants and appraisers say that companies are lining up to announce huge write-offs in 2002. 
 Until this year, the worst annual performance for an American corporation was the $23.5 billion loss posted by General Motors in 1992, largely because of an accounting change that forced it to recognize the costs of health care for retired workers. But that record was smashed by JDS Uniphase, which lost $56.1 billion in its fiscal year that ended June 30. Of that, more than $51 billion came from writing off the costs of bad acquisitions and investments. 
As a symbol of the age, that was perfect. When G.M. set the record, it was an American icon, and its net loss that year came to just one-sixth of its annual revenue. JDS Uniphase, a maker of telecommunications equipment, is not known to most Americans, and for good reason. Its 2001 loss was about 10 times as large as its lifetime revenue.
JDS never saw $50 billion in cash, but it could lose that much because it was blessed, for a time, with an overvalued stock, which it used to buy overpriced companies. After the bubble burst, the accountants acted as if JDS had spent real money.
Another 2001 record breaker, Enron, did spend real money. Its bankruptcy set the record as the largest in American history in terms of assets. It managed to go broke without ever reporting a bad quarter, at least not as measured by the "pro forma" earnings that Wall Street relied upon until it was too late.
Enron will now report huge losses. And, reports Alfred King, the co-chairman of the Valuation Research Corporation, it will not be alone.
"A lot of write-downs are coming" early in 2002 and will involve hundreds of billions of dollars, Mr. King told a recent New York University seminar on the new merger accounting rule that has just taken effect. Appraisal firms like his have been inundated with business from companies seeking advice on how much to write off.
The rule says good will from mergers must be written off if the business unit containing the acquired company is worth less than book value, including the good will taken on as part of the acquisition. Companies have some leeway in determining whether a write-off is needed, but it appears that many of them want to take their write-offs quickly, when they can blame a change in accounting rules.
After the 2002 baths are taken, the usefulness of the new merger rule for investors will depend on whether it forces companies to take losses quickly when a deal goes wrong, or whether companies can postpone the bad news until years later, after problems are clear to all.
There is a sense in which JDS did not suffer 2001's largest loss, nor did Enron. The biggest loss of good will may have been suffered by the accounting profession. The Big Five accounting firms are clearly worried, and they are scrambling to come up with a quick fix to improve disclosures of off-balance sheet debts, related-party transactions and market risks relative to commodity prices. In other words, all the things that Enron hid until it collapsed.
The worry among accountants is that investors who were willing to shrug off accounting scandals during the bull market may now be less tolerant. Whether that proves to be the case will be one thing to watch in 2002.

HEADLINE: Barrick Gold Joins Battle For a Rival 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Citing the need for a long-overdue rationalization in the gold mining industry, Barrick Gold of Toronto has waded into the takeover battle over Normandy Mining of Australia, with plans for closer cooperation with AngloGold of South Africa if AngloGold's bid for Normandy succeeds.
 AngloGold is vying with Newmont Mining, based in Denver, for control of Normandy. AngloGold, 53.4 percent owned by the Anglo American Corporation, disclosed Barrick's involvement today when it announced a second sweetening of its offer for Normandy. 
 Confirming the talks with AngloGold, Vincent Borg, Barrick's vice president for corporate communications, referred to "layers of potential opportunities" for cooperation, especially in Tanzania and in Australia, where Normandy is the biggest producer. 
Specifically, AngloGold said that if it won Normandy, it would offer Barrick operational control of Kalgoorlie Consolidated mines in western Australia. Kalgoorlie is now a joint venture between Normandy and Home stake Mining of Walnut Creek, Calif., which Barrick recently acquired.
Adding Normandy to Newmont would vault the combined company to No. 1 among world gold producers, with 22 mines on five continents producing 8.2 million ounces of gold a year, compared with AngloGold's 7.2 million ounces and Barrick's 5.7 million ounces. Newmont's bid also includes an offer for Franco-Nevada Mining of Canada, Normandy's biggest single shareholder, which is free of debt and flush with cash.
This would put Newmont in a position to rival Barrick as investors' favorite gold stock. Barrick now has the highest market value and the strongest balance sheet of any major gold producer, and its average production costs are lower than Newmont's.
AngloGold said its new cash and stock bid valued Normandy at 1.84 Australian dollars (93 cents) a share, or about 4.1 billion Australian dollars ($2.08 billion). That would be slightly short of Newmont's latest offer of 1.87 Australian dollars a share, and the gap widened a bit today when AngloGold's American depository receipts fell 1.5 percent in New York trading to $17.80 each, while Newmont slipped 0.7 percent, to $19.24.
Newmont said it was reviewing AngloGold's offer and would respond "in due course." Several analysts predicted that Newmont would again raise its offer and hope to knock AngloGold out of the bidding.
Normandy's board recommended the Newmont bid earlier this month but advised shareholders on Wednesday to "do nothing" for the time being while the bidding played out.
Georges Lequime, an analyst at HSBC Securities in Toronto, said AngloGold's latest offer "smacks of desperation." "They don't have the balance sheet to cough up that extra bit of cash," he said.
But AngloGold said its offer had the advantage of being unconditional and open for immediate acceptance, while Newmont was not expected to make payment before mid-February. "A lot of arbitrageurs and hedge funds might be more inclined to take their money and run," said the manager of an American gold fund that owns shares in all the companies involved.
That Barrick would be involved with AngloGold is not surprising. Barrick sees Newmont as a bigger threat to its investor appeal than AngloGold, and Barrick's chief executive, Randall Oliphant, is close to Robert M. Godsell, his counterpart at AngloGold.
Speaking by telephone from Chile, Mr. Borg said that talks about cooperation between the two companies' mines in Tanzania had been taking place for some time but had been widened in the last few weeks to include Australia. "There are too many companies running too many mines," Mr. Borg said. "This is an attempt to discuss how we can put Humpty Dumpty together again."
The discussions include not only control of specific operations, but also economies of scale through joint procurement and training.
Mr. Borg said Barrick would be willing to pay AngloGold for the Kalgoorlie management contract, saying, "If one management team was operating it, you could extract greater value."
AngloGold said it also intended to offer Barrick participation in a planned expansion of the Boddington mine in southwestern Australia. The project would extend the life of the nearly depleted mine about 15 years and bring annual output to 600,000 ounces.
AngloGold described the talks as "exploratory," with no agreements likely until it landed Normandy. Analysts said there was no reason Barrick could not reach similar arrangements with Newmont.

HEADLINE: Home Loan Applications Climb 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Record numbers of Americans applied for loans to buy houses in the week before Christmas, a sign housing may lead the country out of recession, a mortgage banking group reported today. 
 Warm weather and a desire to lock in rates that are on the upswing fueled a 16.5 percent rise in the purchase index kept by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. 
 The reading of 373.5 for the week ended last Friday was the highest ever. Applications to refinance mortgages plummeted. 
Home sales are likely to approach record levels this year, and companies like Pier 1 Imports and Lowe's, which sell furnishings and home-improvement items, are projecting increasing profits next year. That may help underpin the economy's return to growth after slipping into recession in March.
"We are looking for a very positive real estate market," Maureen Passerini, president and chief operating officer of Coldwell Banker, a real estate brokerage firm, said in an interview last week. "There's still great demand." 
A total of 888,000 new homes will probably be sold this year, eclipsing the record of 886,000 in 1998, according to a forecast from the National Association of Realtors. Sales of previously owned homes this year are likely to reach 5.2 million units, second highest on record, the group said. 
Housing "is shrugging off the disruptions that occurred to the rest of the economy after Sept. 11," said Henry Willmore, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital in New York. He said its resiliency would contribute to the economy in the new year. 
Mortgage refinancing is well past its peak even as purchase applications soared, the mortgage bankers figures showed.

HEADLINE: Help-Wanted Index Was Flat in November 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
An index measuring the number of jobs being offered across the United States was flat in November compared with October, but it was nearly half its level in November 2000, the Conference Board said yesterday.
 The private research group's help-wanted advertising index dipped to 45 in November from 46 in October, as the recession continued to affect the already weak labor market. 
The index stood at 75 in November 2000. 
 "Even if the economy is slowly starting to turn around, the labor market is still in retreat," said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board. 
"In more than half the country," Mr. Goldstein said, "help-wanted ad volume is about half of what it was a year ago."
The number of Americans claiming initial unemployment benefits dipped to 384,000 in the latest week, but the number of claims is expected to climb above 401,000 in a Labor Department report today. 
The Conference Board surveys 51 newspapers across the country about their patterns of help-wanted ads every month to determine the index.

HEADLINE: In Spain, Political Gains of Euro Outweigh Nuisances 

BYLINE:  By EMMA DALY

DATELINE: MADRID, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
It is merely a TV advertisement but it captures a national turning point. 
 Doctors and nurses gather around a life-support machine, wires connected to the bed-ridden patient. On its death bed, it seems, is a tiny aluminum coin, the Spanish peseta. A phone company is advertising itself by bidding farewell to the 133-year-old currency and offering a goodbye bargain: phone calls that cost just one peseta a minute, about half a cent. 
 Spain is swapping its currency for the euro, and the country is paying homage to the peseta, adopted officially in 1868 for an earlier (failed) monetary union. An exhibition at the Bank of Spain in Madrid shows dozens of old bills and coins, with a video commentary on the country's road to the euro, which makes its debut in cash registers and automated teller machines on Tuesday.
Over the years the look of the peseta has reflected the nation's gallery of heroes -- Spanish writers, explorers and artists. 
One 19th-century banknote, worth 100 pesetas and printed by the American Bank Note Company of New York, depicts a comely maiden flanked by two storm-tossed ships. Miguel de Cervantes (who also appears on Spanish euro coins), along with his creations, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, appear on bills from the 1870's, as do the painters Velazquez and Murillo.
"Traditionally Spanish coins and bills had some very pretty designs, because they used very good painters and engravers, above all before the Civil War, and that's what we will miss," says Teresa Tortella, the curator of the exhibition.
Spaniards, who long suffered in isolation because of Francisco Franco's four-decade dictatorship, have embraced everything European with alacrity, and surveys now show the country to be keenly awaiting the euro, which will have a fixed value of 166.386 pesetas.
"We Spaniards have been using pesetas for many years, but with today's economic advances, we need a strong currency," says Manuel Lazaro, 65, who retired from an insurance company. "I think the euro will be very positive." 
The peseta replaced the real, created by King Pedro of Castile in the 14th century. (The American quarter was born when colonists made change by cutting reales and other European coins in fourths.) 
"The history of Spain has been reflected in these bills, from a political, historical and cultural point of view," said Ms. Tortella. Banknotes from the 1936-39 Civil War, for example, reflect the battle between the Republicans and the Nationalists. The Republican bills show scenes of muscular workers alongside steaming factory chimneys executed in bold reds and blues, while Franco's Nationalists used conservative etchings highlighting cathedrals, battles and Castillian landscapes.
The most recent peseta bills, re-issued in 1992 to coincide with the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage to the Americas, bear his face along with those of the Conquistadores Francisco Pizarro and Hernan Cortes.
One rarely seen bill, the 10,000-peseta note, with a portrait of King Juan Carlos, suddenly made a comeback in recent months, thanks to the euro. Spaniards who once stashed their "mattress money" in large bills seem to have gone on spending sprees, knowing the peseta will vanish as a currency early next year. Property prices have soared, as have purchases of luxury cars and artworks. 
This consumption has helped to offset Europe's economic slowdown, economists say.
The government has backed a major campaign to familiarize citizens with the new coins and bills, and revelers gathering on New Year's Eve in the central squares in Madrid, Cordoba and Las Palmas will see a sound-and-light show celebrating the end of the peseta and the public introduction of the euro. The show will be broadcast on national television, when millions of Spaniards tune in to hear the clock strike midnight.
Modern Spaniards, who are unaccustomed even to using the 1-peseta coin (known as the lentilla, or contact lens, because it is so flimsy), grumble that they will now have to learn to deal in euro cents. But the main concern here is so-called euro-inflation: that retailers will be tempted to round up the prices when they convert to euros from pesetas.
A cartoon for the daily El Mundo captured the public's fear: a mugger approaches a prosperous couple and shouts, "Stop, this is a rounding up!" To which the fur-coated woman replies, "Oh, damn that euro!"

GRAPHIC: Photo/Chart: "IN A MONETARY UNION LONG AGO, THERE WAS THIS PESETA . . ."First Introduced: 1868. Trivia: Spain officially adopted the peseta to join a 19th-century monetary union that grouped the currencies of France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland and, eventually, Greece. Though Spain never joined the union, the peseta was established at five grams of silver and divided into 100 cents. Peseta-to euro value: 166.3866.

HEADLINE: Could've Been Worse 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It has not been a good year for economic policy, at home or abroad. The best you can say is that things could have been worse.
 The bad news was legion. The U.S. went into recession, and the collapse of Enron raised questions not only about our economy but about the state of business ethics. We squandered our hard-won budget surplus, and with it our best chance to do something about the fiscal burdens of an aging population, on an ill-conceived tax cut. Overseas, Argentina melted down -- something I had long predicted, but the actual events were still shocking. And Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, looks less like Franklin Roosevelt and more like Herbert Hoover every day. 
 The good news all takes the form of things that didn't happen.
 The good news about the U.S. economy is that it fell into recession, but it didn't fall off a cliff. Most of the credit probably goes to the dogged optimism of American consumers, but the Fed's dramatic interest rate cuts helped keep housing strong even as business investment plunged. The pain is far from over -- unemployment looks set to keep on rising, even if the G.D.P. starts growing again -- but our worst fears have not been realized.
 It was good news that the World Trade Organization didn't collapse. Trade is one area in which the Bush administration is right and the Democrats are wrong; but there was a real risk that the 1999 debacle in Seattle, where an attempt to start a new round of negotiations collapsed in disarray, would be repeated this year. In fact the meeting, in Doha, Qatar, went off fairly well. Alas, I cannot take any satisfaction in the passage of "fast track" trade authority: as Lael Brainard pointed out on this page yesterday, the Bush administration purchased fast-track at the cost of appalling concessions to special interests, concessions that hurt the very countries free trade is supposed to help. 
 It was good news when California's energy crisis evaporated, thanks to price controls and conservation. The Bush administration was all set to use the crisis to push through an environmentally destructive program of corporate welfare, which had nothing to do with the actual problem; the sudden surplus of power put that plan on hold. 
 Really big good news: To my immense relief, the absurdity of Social Security privatization became manifest before the system had been dismantled. I had been really worried about that; the Bush administration's claim that private accounts would improve rather than worsen the system's finances made no sense at all, yet it got a free pass from most commentators. 
 Fortunately, the commission that was supposed to propose a detailed plan came to a farcical end. Its final report declared that private accounts would indeed strengthen Social Security, if they were accompanied by sharp benefit cuts and huge financial injections from unspecified sources. Yes, and eating a jelly doughnut every morning will help you lose weight, if you also cut back sharply on other foods and do a lot of exercise; otherwise the doughnuts will make you fatter. Again, aren't you glad the absurdity of the Bush proposal came to light before $1 trillion was diverted into private accounts?
 And one more thing to be grateful for: We didn't get a stimulus bill. That doesn't sound like good news, unless you look at the content of the bills that were actually on the table: huge further tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, doing little for the economy but further worsening our already dreary fiscal outlook.
 But what about the year ahead?
 For me the gloomiest moment was probably around mid-October. That's when the straight economics looked worst -- when the impact of Sept. 11 on confidence seemed all too likely to turn the recession into something truly nasty. It was also the moment when some politicians decided to abandon all restraint, and throw their weight behind huge special-interest giveaways. But guess what? Confidence didn't collapse, and the special interests didn't get what they wanted. It turns out that there are still decent politicians, in both parties, and so far they have had enough power -- just -- to prevent the worst.
 In short, things could have been worse, and there is still reason to hope. Happy New Year.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Shift By Government Adds to Doubts Of Argentines 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
A plan by the new Peronist government here to create an emergency currency is running into opposition, as details emerge and owners of businesses or anyone with a bank account comes to realize that the proposal is backed only by promises and not by hard cash.
 Growing doubts about the government's intentions led to long lines outside banks today, as middle-class Argentines tried to get their hands on dollars or pesos before the new system, announced on Sunday but largely ignored during the Christmas break, goes into effect. Depositors unable to withdraw money from their accounts demonstrated outside a downtown bank today, blocking one of the capital's main shopping streets for several hours. 
 "I can't run the risk of losing everything if they should suddenly decide to change all the rules on us," said Marta Menendez Cipriani, a 33-year-old secretary, as she stood in line at an automated teller machine this afternoon. "I deposited dollars, and I want dollars back." 
For the last decade, the backbone of the Argentine economy has been a system known here as "convertibility." One Argentine peso has been valued at one American dollar, which has allowed the two currencies to be used interchangeably and forced the government to adopt fiscally restrictive policies that reduced inflation from more than 5,000 percent a year to less than 10 percent.
But interim President Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, who took office on Sunday after the resignation last week of Fernando de la Rua, said the only way out of the four-year recession brought on by that fiscal straitjacket was a burst of spending. He has promised that the new money will begin circulating alongside pesos and dollars next month, just as soon as Congress approves it.
In general terms, the objective of the new currency, which is to be called the argentino, is obvious. The government hopes "to begin an orderly exit" from the linkage of the peso to the dollar without devaluing the peso, the new finance secretary, Rodolfo Frigeri, said in an interview with the newspaper Clarin on Wednesday.
The government has also said that though the new currency will initially be valued at one peso and one dollar, it will not be convertible to either of those currencies and will be allowed to float so as to find its real market value. What is not clear, however, is how much of the new currency the government plans to print or what will be supporting it.
Remarks by Mr. Rodriguez Saa on Wednesday indicated that the argentino is not backed by the reserves of the central bank, which in any case have dropped sharply as a result of the crisis. Instead, he said, the government can only offer "all the buildings and lands that are property of the state," including congressional offices and Argentina's embassies abroad, as a guarantee.
"Who do they think they are kidding with this scheme?" asked Osvaldo Musso, a bookstore clerk. "I can protect my patrimony by trading one peso for one dollar, but how can I possibly exchange an argentino for a brick from the seat of government? It's a meaningless promise they are making, a mockery."
In an additional effort to jump-start the economy, Mr. Rodriguez Saa has already revoked a decree of the previous government that slashed pensions and salaries of government employees by 13 percent. But Mr. Frigeri said that the new government's intention was that as soon as possible, all those obligations would be paid in the new currency, instead of dollars or pesos.
That has raised questions about an inflationary surge, especially in view of the Peronist Party's populist origins. Mr. Rodriguez Saa, who has begun moving away from his pledge to serve only until new presidential elections are held on March 3, has revived many of those traditional themes, promising to create a million new jobs and double the minimum wage, currently $200 a month.
"These will be a gradual emission and not, as some fear, a flood of new money," Mr. Frigeri said in an effort to calm such concerns, also promising that the peso will not be devalued. "We are going to be very prudent in this entire process."
Because of the lack of liquidity, provinces have already issued a half-dozen different types of bonds, whose nominal value is put at $1.3 billion or more, to continue paying their employees and suppliers. In a move likely to shake confidence further, the northern province of Tucuman today announced a 90-day moratorium on the repayment of such notes.
In the meantime, banking and commercial activity remains all but stalled as the population waits for the government to sort out its options. Wheat farmers who have been earning dollars, for example, are reported to be holding back their crop for fear that the government is going to change the rules on compensation for exporters.
Store owners have responded either by pulling products off the shelves or with price increases intended to anticipate a devaluation. "In the face of exchange-rate uncertainties, many store owners have marked up their peso prices around 20 percent during the past 72 hours," the main store owners' group acknowledged in a statement.
"All of a sudden, you can hardly find any medicine in the pharmacies," said Lucrecia Gimenez, a schoolteacher who was trying to fill a prescription this afternoon. "I think they are holding everything back because right now the only thing worth anything is something you can hold in your hands."
In his inaugural speech on Sunday, Mr. Rodriguez Saa also said that Argentina would suspend debt payments to foreign creditors while continuing to pay its domestic creditors. Though the first test of that pledge comes on Friday, when nearly $500 million in Treasury notes fall due, it is still not clear whether Argentine pension funds and other local investors will be paid.
"No one knows exactly what he meant," said Peter Darrow, a lawyer with the New York firm of Mayer, Brown and Platt who is representing the Argentine bondholders committee. "The delineation between what constitutes local debt and external debt isn't all that clear, and there are also different classes of local debt." 
But who Argentina pays or does not pay this month or next may be of secondary importance, given the continuing internal economic crisis. At the moment, the country is a pariah to lenders abroad and would appear to have little to gain by following their recipe for recovery, which is more austerity.
It is going to "require the best part of the first half of 2002" before Argentina can return to the capital market, said Marcelo Podesta, the managing director of J. P. Morgan here. But even that timetable, he added, depends on Argentina achieving "a stronger political consensus" and then putting together an economic program that gains the support of lenders and leads to "rational and reasonable negotiation with creditors."

HEADLINE: Galveston Journal; 
Port Deal Is Rejected As History Weighs In

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex., Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Prosperity floats past this shabbily elegant island city every day, and Harris L. Kempner Jr. has a great view of the procession. Out the window of his 12th-floor conference room, Mr. Kempner can see the line of tankers and cargo ships that chug past Galveston to carry their goods to Houston.
 The snub is nothing new: Houston, landlocked and 50 miles upstream along a ship channel, has become the bustling port and international city that Galveston was a century ago. So when Galveston faced a referendum this month calling for the city's outdated port to be merged with the thriving Port of Houston, it seemed as if the inevitable capitulation was finally at hand. 
 But Galveston voters scotched the deal, rejecting a plan that officials at both ports had portrayed as mutually beneficial yet many locals had regarded as little more than a giveaway to Houston.
"That was a hard idea for everybody to swallow, that, in a sense, they win," said Mr. Kempner, 61, the president of a money management firm and scion of one of Galveston's oldest families, who ultimately favored the merger.
Indeed, while many local critics framed their opposition as a matter of simple economics, the subtext to the vote was the very different histories and psychologies of two cities less than an hour's drive apart. 
Here in Galveston, where horse-drawn carriages pull tourists through the small downtown district, history hangs heavy. When people mention "the storm," they are talking about the Great Storm of 1900, the worst natural catastrophe in American history, which killed 6,000 people and essentially left Galveston in ruins. 
Before then, Galveston had dominated banking and shipping in Texas and was a city of national importance. But while San Francisco recovered from the 1906 earthquake and Chicago rebounded from the Great Fire of 1871, Galveston never regained its luster after the storm. Instead, Houston emerged, in part because of what many in Galveston call "the ditch," the canal that was built after the storm and that is now the Houston Ship Channel. The monopoly on trade Galveston had enjoyed was shattered, and even a century later a sense of lingering resentment pushed some voters to reject the merger.
"It was sort of like the Yankees are coming south to take over again," said Linda Clark, 58, a museum guide at one of the city's antebellum mansions, Ashton Villa, in explaining why she voted no. 
Port officials in Galveston and Houston agree that a regional approach is the best way to cement the area's pre-eminence as the leading port on the Gulf Coast. The merger would have given Houston much-needed space to expand; the Port of Galveston, which is owned by the city, would have been upgraded, had its debts paid and added 2,000 jobs. Revenues at the Port of Galveston are so low that it recently had to decline a federal offer to deepen its channel because it could not afford the $8 million in required matching money.
To many, the merger was an enticing package for a city with a high poverty rate and a desperate need for economic development.
Still, voters balked. "You've got to take the position that the people are always right, and they voted it down," said Don Schattel, chairman of the Port of Galveston's board, who supported the merger.
Some locals fretted that the deal would have effectively given the quasi-governmental Port of Houston carte blanche to develop the Galveston port as it saw fit -- perhaps with projects that could threaten the environment and air quality. Supporters said that threat was exaggerated, as the deal would have required the port to comply with local zoning rules.
But many critics simply thought the proposal was an example of Houston's hoodwinking Galveston once again. They argued that the Galveston port would have generated money for Houston while bringing little in return and noted that the deal was proposed as Galveston was finally having success as a midlevel cruise ship destination.
"Just when we were up on one knee, they want to jerk it out from under us and give our port away," said George Liberato, a real estate broker and Galveston native who helped lead the opposition.
Mr. Liberato's group is now organizing committees to discuss plans for the port's future. Some want to develop the port near the downtown tourist district with restaurants and other businesses. There is also talk of privatizing the port and selling it to the highest bidder.
Ultimately, history will again judge Galveston, whether it made a shrewd decision or allowed pride to get in the way of a new chance at prosperity.

HEADLINE: Latest Population Figures Show West Setting Pace in Growth 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Nevada, Arizona and Colorado top the list of states whose populations grew fastest during the past year, Census Bureau estimates show, while states in the Midwest and in the East lagged the rest of the nation.
 The steepest declines were in North Dakota and West Virginia, where slow economies continued to drive residents out of state. 
 The opposite occurred in Sun Belt states like Nevada, according to the new figures, which estimate population growth or decline from April 1, 2000, the date of the decennial census, to July 1, 2001. With outsiders lured by a warm climate and a thriving tourism industry, Nevada's population climbed 5.4 percent, to 2.1 million. 
Arizona's rate of population growth was second-highest, at 3.4 percent, and Colorado's third, at 2.7.
By comparison, the nation's overall population grew 1.2 percent, to 284.8 million from 281.4 million. 
The pattern reflected a trend that for decades has drawn more people to the South and the West than to other regions. 
In that trend, cities like Atlanta, Las Vegas and Denver act as a hub for growth that spills out into new, sprawling suburbs. Suburban growth fueled a rise in New Hampshire's population as well the past year, making that state the only one among the 10 fastest-growing that lies outside the South or the West. Its rate of growth was nearly 2 percent, for a total population of 1.3 million.
Much of the increase in New Hampshire sprang up along the state's coastline of roughly 17 miles between Massachusetts and Maine, a stretch that is increasingly attractive to people commuting to Boston.
Most of the trends in the latest report mirrored those from 1990 to 2000, said John Haaga, a demographer with the private, nonprofit Population Reference Bureau. For instance, North Dakota had the biggest rate of population decline the past year -- 1.2 percent, to 634,448. No state lost population in the decade ended 2000, but North Dakota's rate of increase was the smallest, less than 1 percent.
West Virginia, Iowa and Louisiana were the only other states with a net loss of population the past year; the rate of decline in each was less than 1 percent. Among other states, the rate of increase was smallest in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, Kansas, South Dakota, Montana and Nebraska.
New York's rate of growth was 0.2 percent, Connecticut's 0.6 percent, and New Jersey's 0.8 percent.

HEADLINE: To U.S., a Terrorist Group; To Lebanese, a Social Agency 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: BINT JBEIL, Lebanon, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Last year the shelves of the small hospital in this southern Lebanese village were so barren that Irish soldiers serving with the United Nations pooled several thousand dollars of their own to stock it with bandages and rudimentary medicine. 
 Times have changed. Energetic doctors from the Islamic Health Society now bustle through the corridors, pointing out the beds, a simple operating room and the lab. 
 Half the one-story building is open to the air because the Jihad for Construction is remodeling. A host of social services are offered, including aid for anyone who steps on a mine. 
"Nobody thought of providing this area with medical services," says Fuad Taha, the hospital director, who trained in medical technology during 12 years in Florida. Without the improvements, he said, "things would have been miserable here."
The rocky hills all around are Hezbollah country. The panoply of social, educational and agricultural branches spread throughout Hezbollah's strongholds like this one underscore the difficulty the United States faces in making its terrorist label stick to the militant Shiite organization, just as Washington presses its campaign against terrorism in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
But Hezbollah presents one of the most difficult quandaries for the United States as it tries to paint terrorist groups with the same brush. Almost since its inception in 1985, Hezbollah has been a perennial entrant on the American list of terrorist organizations. Last month, the United States listed it along with 21 other groups and called for the freezing of its assets. 
Today marked a United Nations deadline for nations to respond to a list of 17 questions on their counter-terrorism efforts on issues like money laundering and arrests. Most nations delayed their filings until after the holidays, but Lebanon, eager to shed its past image as a kind of Club Med for terrorists, was among the 20 or so that did reply.
Yet it left one telling loophole, saying that it wanted to differentiate between "terrorism on the one hand and the legitimate right of peoples to resist foreign occupation on the other." Lebanon had already announced that it would not freeze Hezbollah's assets. 
Hezbollah denies any role in terrorism, claiming that its sole purpose has been attacking Israel. Hezbollah's guerrilla warfare prompted Israel to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon in May 2000 after nearly 20 years of occupation. 
The organization, fostered by Iran and Syria, garnered widespread respect from an Arab world long humiliated by its lack of battlefield success against Israel, and Lebanese of all stripes pay homage to Hezbollah's considerable fighting ability and the calm way it took over many government services. 
"There is not a single Lebanese, whether Christian or Muslim, who doesn't respect the role Hezbollah played in expelling the Israelis from Lebanese territory," said Georges Najm, a member of Parliament from the south, and the lone Christian among the 12-member Hezbollah bloc in Parliament. 
The United States did not label Hezbollah's activities against Israeli troops during the occupation as terrorism. But it has a long list of accusations leveled at the group, including the bombing of the Marine base and two American embassies in Lebanon in the early 1980's, as well as the later kidnapping and killing of Americans here. In the 1990's, the United States says, the organization attacked the Israeli Embassy in Argentina and it is suspected in the bombing of an Israeli cultural center there. In addition, it is accused of providing support and expertise in the bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996, killing 19 American servicemen. 
In recent years, Washington maintains that Hezbollah has been training Palestinians to fight Israel at a camp in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. Senior officials including Condoleezza Rice, the national security advisor, and William Burns, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, have warned recently that it remains a dangerous organization. 
"We do, first, recognize that Hezbollah has a number of different dimensions to it: as a political party, as a social welfare organization," Mr. Burns told reporters in Beirut earlier this month. "But the United States continues to be concerned about Hezbollah's terrorist activities that go well beyond the borders of this country." 
Hezbollah has continued skirmishing along a disputed portion of the border and it kidnapped three Israeli soldiers there in the fall of 2000. 
No one is quite sure where the tens of millions of dollars needed to sustain it come from. One possible source was exposed by the arrest of 18 people in North Carolina last year on charges of smuggling cigarettes in order to supply the group with cash and weapons. 
All Hezbollah organizations acknowledge getting money from Iran, but they will not say how much. Lebanese press reports put the figure at over $10 million monthly. The various organizations also say that they receive substantial charitable donations from the 20 percent annual religious tax on profits that many Shiites pay. Such funds are collected in Iran, among Lebanese living in the in the United States and West Africa, and elsewhere. 
The organization revels in its hard-line image. After parading thousands of fighters earlier this month, its secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, a religious scholar, said all Israelis were legitimate targets for Palestinian suicide bombers because all serve in the army.
Such spectacles draw some rebuke inside Lebanon. Gibran Tueni, the publisher of the independent daily newspaper An Nahar, attacked the government for allowing a state within a state to exist. "How can the government allow such a parade to take place at such a sensitive time?" he wrote. 
But Hezbollah's political and social clout leaves it virtually untouchable. When Lebanese Christians started agitating for less of a Syrian presence in the country last spring, Hezbollah poured 300,000 supporters into the streets for a counter-demonstration. 
"No other political group in Lebanon can do that," said Talal Salman, the publisher of As Safir a pro-Syrian newspaper in Beirut, noting the group's growing role in economic development. "Hezbollah is not stealing the role of the government, the government has disappeared from the south."
Analysts in Lebanon say Hezbollah is making the transition from a militant armed group to a political party, but there is an evident internal struggle on just how far it will go.
The United States says that Imad Mugniyeh, who has been indicted for organizing the attacks against American targets in the 1980's, lives in Lebanon and helps run Hezbollah. Hezbollah says it has no idea what country he is in. 
Many in the Lebanese population, weary of 25 years of war, would just as soon Hezbollah retire its fighters and get on with rebuilding the country. "Hezbollah did the right thing, but Israel is gone" from Lebanon, said a restaurant owner in Bint Jbeil, where traffic circles are decorated with hand grenades. "It's time for their fighters to go sit in their houses."
Iranian leaders are pictured on lamp posts and office walls. A picture of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Islamic revolution in the 1970's, even graces the entrance of the hospital here. 
"He represents a leader for us," said Mr. Taha, the director. "It's like some hospitals put Mother Teresa on the wall."

HEADLINE: The Yen's Relentless Downhill Slide 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
The Japanese yen keeps falling, affecting business, trade and tourism in increasingly powerful ways. 
 As Japanese officials systematically nudge their currency lower, the yen fell on Thursday to about 132 to the dollar, the 11th straight day of losses and the longest losing streak since 1971. The currency has lost nearly 7 percent of its value this month alone. On Jan. 3, 2000, the yen was at 101.45 to the dollar. 
 Japan once again seems to be trying to fight its way out of a recession -- its fourth in a decade -- by devaluing its currency and therefore increasing exports. A cheaper yen makes Japanese products more competitive on world markets. 
Indeed, Tokyo's stock market, which had slumped by about 25 percent since the start of the year, leaped 2.6 percent Thursday on news of the yen's latest fall. Major exporting companies led the gains, as a weak yen instantly adds millions of dollars to the profit margins of major exporters like Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, Canon and Sony. 
But a weaker yen will also affect Japanese consumers, slowing a recovery of tourist visits to the United States and making imports more expensive. With imported beef costs rising, McDonald's Japan operation announced last week that it was raising prices on some hamburgers. 
A weaker yen will add to mounting concerns among exporters, who fear that the dollar has become so strong that they are being priced out of many foreign markets. 
Automakers are especially sensitive to the value of the yen, particularly at a time of recession, when price competition has grown. 
But a wide range of manufacturers, like those that make appliances, electronic goods, steel and heavy equipment, see themselves as losing both domestic and overseas customers if Japanese companies gain a big price advantage. 
Business lobbyists, including the National Association of Manufacturers, have pressed the Bush administration for months to intervene in the market to lower the value of the dollar and help exporters. But the Bush administration has taken no such action and appears inclined to let the market set the dollar's value. 
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill had criticized the official mantra of the Clinton administration, saying Mr. Clinton favored a "strong dollar." But when markets reacted to Mr. O'Neill's comments by anticipating a decline the dollar's value, he retracted his comments and has since largely refrained from speaking about currency values at all. 
In Asia, Chinese and South Korean officials have urged Japan not to set off a "beggar thy neighbor" round of devaluations that would impoverish the region. With memories strong of the 1997 currency crisis, the governments of South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore have allowed their currencies to drift to multimonth and multiyear lows. 
China, with $200 billion in foreign currency reserves, appears to be trying to talk the Japanese into stopping the decline, rather than preparing for a devaluation of China's currency, the yuan. 
The yen's decline to its lowest levels in three years comes as Japan runs out of tools for an easy fix to its economy, which is expected to shrink in 2001 and 2002.
With most Japanese enjoying high living standards, politicians have shied away from taking painful measures to create future growth: deregulation of the economy, large-scale privatizations or decisive action against a rising mountain of bank debt. Instead, in a typical move, a "top member" of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party briefed Japanese reporters on Thursday, under the cloak of anonymity, that "the acceptable level is probably some 140 yen" to the dollar. 
But a continued fall in the yen could accelerate an exodus of foreign investors from Japan's stock markets. In the week ended Dec. 14, foreigners pulled a net $3.7 billion out of Japanese stocks.
Bush administration officials, in Washington and in Tokyo, bluntly warned this month that real growth will return to Japan's economy only with deregulation, privatization and a major banking cleanup.
Today, Japanese news services reported that Ishikawa Bank, a regional bank, was filing for bankruptcy, the first Japanese bank failure in two years.
With Japan serving as customer or supplier -- and increasingly, both -- for so many American manufacturing companies, the yen's devaluation is certainly cause for consternation.
"Japan's sales represent about a billion of our $28 billion-plus revenues, so the devaluation of the yen is viewed as a modest negative for us," Irvin Lipp, a spokesman for DuPont, said. 
Japan imports lumber, pulp, packaging materials, newsprint and other commodity paper products, primarily from North America. 
"Prices will increase in Japan, and of course that can impact us down the road," said Frank Mendizabel, a spokesman for Weyerhaeuser. "And almost all our products are sold in dollars, so we can't hedge against the price of a currency." 
Companies that both import from and export to Japan seem the least concerned, in that their businesses have a built-in natural hedge against currency fluctuations. David Frail, a spokesman for General Electric, notes that G.E. buys and sells products in Japan directly, and also buys numerous products that include parts made in Japan. "With multiple transactions like this, the effect of differences in currency is indiscernible," Mr. Frail said.
Of course, many companies may be more worried than they will publicly let on. After all, many manufacturing companies have blamed this year's disappointing earnings on the strong dollar. But few are ready to say they will have to again revise earnings estimates downward because of this. 
The plummeting yen is even less of a threat to the growing number of American companies that do their Japanese business through alliances with Japanese companies. Goodyear Tire and Rubber, for example, owns only 25 percent of its operations in Japan; Sumitomo Rubber Industries owns the other 75 percent. 
In Detroit, a weak yen is seen as giving an edge to Japan's Big Three -- Toyota, Honda and Nissan Motor. These companies can make more profit, in yen, by charging the same prices in United States dollars. 
Next year, many analysts expect a sharp falloff in auto sales and an excess of capacity, which will create pressure for further price cuts. The currency imbalance means Japanese automakers will have even "more ammunition" when it comes to pricing, and the American Big Three will have none, according to Rod Lache, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. 
Currencies aside, earlier this year Mr. Lache estimated that Japanese automakers could charge $3,000 more per vehicle than their American counterparts because of their vehicles' better quality ratings, better brand strength and higher residual values, among other factors. And since Sept. 11, the Big Three have been offering interest-free financing deals, increasing their costs. 
A continued weakening of the yen, on top of all that, does not leave the Big Three with much wiggle room on pricing. 
Not all analysts agree that currencies are such a significant problem. "I think the Big Three's problems are 10 percent currency and 90 percent product," said David Healy, a financial analyst at Burnham Securities. Mr. Healy pointed out that about two thirds of the vehicles Toyota, Honda and Nissan sell in the United States are assembled in North America, which significantly blunts any yen advantage. 
But Mr. Lache said that most of the auto parts in Toyotas, Nissans and Hondas come from Asia, meaning the currency imbalance is still "a significant negative." 
The weakening yen is expected to retard a recovery in Japanese tourism to the United States, which plunged after the terrorist attacks of September. For much of the last decade, the United States has been an increasingly popular destination for Japanese tourists despite the malaise in the Japanese economy. 
In an October forecast, the United States Commerce Department estimated that the number of Japanese tourists to the United States would fall 21 percent in 2001 from last year's level of just over five million. 
Since most local employees are paid in yen, the slide in the currency will not help American companies operating there, said David Malpass, an international economist at Bear, Stearns. And rents, while cheaper, are still expensive. 
It is possible, however, that the currency's renewed weakness will encourage potential buyers to take a fresh look at Japanese companies, much as the Asian financial crisis did in 1997 and 1998. 
"Things are cheaper, which creates opportunities for nimble foreign operators," Mr. Malpass said.

India and Pakistan Move Closer to a War Footing
India moved short-range ballistic missiles to its border with Pakistan, military officials said, as part of what some Western diplomats characterized as the largest military buildup in 30 years in a dispute over responsibility for an attack by gunmen on India's Parliament. Military analysts said that the missiles, which have a range of up to 150 miles, could carry nuclear warheads, but that it was unlikely that they were carrying them now. India has a policy of no first use of nuclear weapons. A10

U.S. to Aid Russian Disarming
The White House said reiterated its commitment to helping Russia dispose of tons of military plutonium and said it would continue a program to reduce the dependence of some Russian cities on nuclear weapons development and to provide alternative jobs for nuclear scientists. A7

A Question of Terrorism
Lebanon, which is trying to shed its image as a haven for terrorists, has refused to freeze the assets of Hezbollah, which the United States has listed as a terrorist organization. Lebanon has asked to differentiate "terrorism on the one hand and the legitimate right of peoples to resist foreign occupation on the other." A10

China's New Execution Method
The authorities in China have begun carrying out some executions by injection at the urging of the People's Supreme Court, which wants that method used in major cities by the end of the year. An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 executions are conducted annually, many by gunshot to the head. A3

Official Knew of Tunnel Dash
There were renewed calls to close a refugee camp for illegal migrants near the French entrance to the Channel tunnel after a Red Cross official said he had known of the plan by 550 men to make a dash for the tunnel but did not alert the authorities. A10

Baby Missing in Chicago Is Found Safe in W. Virginia
Jasmine Anderson, a 16-month-old girl abducted from a Chicago bus station while her mother was buying a ticket on Christmas Eve, was found alive and apparently in good health in West Virginia. Sheila Matthews, 33, was charged with kidnapping. The police said she took the child in an effort to fool a boyfriend who recently got out of jail in California and believed she had given birth to his child while he was behind bars. A12

Montana Mine Approved
Federal and state officials completed a 14-year review by approving plans for a large copper and silver mine in habitat for threatened wildlife in northwestern Montana. The project will take at least five more years of development before construction begins at the Sterling Mining Company's Rock Creek Mine, where the company hopes to extract 10,000 tons of copper and silver ore daily for 30 to 35 years. Environmentalists have fought the project for years, asserting that populations of bull trout and grizzly bears will be harmed. A12

Sun Belt's Lure Undimmed
Nevada, Arizona and Colorado top the list of states whose populations grew fastest during the past year, Census Bureau estimates show, while states in the Midwest and in the East lagged behind the rest of the nation. The pattern reflects a trend that for decades has drawn more people to the South and the West than to other regions. The nation's overall population grew 1.2 percent, to 284.8 million from 281.4 million. A14

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Telecommunications: Globix In Debt-Reduction Talks 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News (Compiled by Alan Krauss) 

 BODY:
 Globix, an Internet service provider, said it was negotiating with bondholders and preferred shareholders to reduce its debt through a prepackaged bankruptcy filing. 
Current shareholders would receive nothing under the plan, which would give equity in the reorganized company to preferred stockholders and holders of Globix's $600 million in 12.5 percent senior notes. Globix, which is based in New York, has been hurt by the dot-com collapse and the recession as demand for World Wide Web services and space on computer servers has slowed. At its peak, Globix's market value was almost $1 billion. Its shares closed yesterday at 17 cents, down 30 cents.

'Miss World 1972' -- 'A Free-Form Art Show by Daniel Reich'

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
Daniel Reich
308 West 21st Street, 2A
Chelsea
Through Jan. 31
 The young curator Daniel Reich, formerly of the Pat Hearn Gallery, has figured out a way to be in Chelsea without necessarily being of Chelsea, at least the Chelsea of the pricey art malls. He operates out of his tiny ground-floor apartment with real shows but limited walk-in hours: Thursdays and Saturdays, 1 to 6 p.m. 
 At the moment he is offering an eclectic mix of some 30 small pieces, several by artists who have yet to become familiar names in Manhattan. The title is taken from a video montage, assembled by Mr. Reich, of 1970's film clips: a little Hollywood, a little television, a little pornography interspersed with snippets of the Miss World event. And the gallery show, directly or indirectly, takes off from this.
A few pieces -- a vintage hippie poster, a photograph of Michael Jackson by Lynne Goldsmith -- go back a bit in time. Other entries are recent. In line with the just-post-flower-child theme, floral images abound, among them a photographic still life by Roe Ethridge, a funeral wreath sculpture by Virgil Marti with the Kiss logo spelled out in purple pansies, flower decals by the artist who calls himself Assume Vivid Astro Focus (a k a Eli Sudbrack), and a pretty shaped painting of cartoonish blooms in a pot by Scott Reeder.
In addition to Mr. Reeder, "Miss World 1972" has other promising painters, including Gina Magid, Cannon Hudson and Robert Kitchen; graphic work by Albert Tien; and drawings by Amy Gatrell, Steven Hull, Tyson Reeder and Mari Eastman, the last represented by an ash-gray ink image titled "September" of silhouetted figures and shattered buildings.
The choice of video artists is especially engaging. Marcos Rosales's hilarious "Untitled Mouthpiece Part 1" is like an art theory lecture delivered by the Ramones with a hip-hop coda. The four artists known as Forcefield have a compilation tape of short pieces that blend film, sound, sculpture and performance art with zany, low-tech, back-to-the-future brilliance: it's abject, psychedelic sci fi.
They have previously shown at Parlour Projects in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, another apartment gallery (open Sundays only). Given the economic climate, this exhibition format seems like one of the more viable ways to keep new dealers, curators and artists visible and in circulation.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Sells Debt to Pay Its Bills 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Massachusetts sold $400 million in short-term debt yesterday to pay bills due on Monday, a step that it said showed the seriousness of its financial condition. The state will sell an additional $200 million in debt today, Treasurer Shannon O'Brien yesterday said in a statement. 
 "Without this borrowing, the state would be unable to make its mandated local-aid payments to cities and towns next Monday and pay its other bills," Ms. O'Brien said. 
 The growing financial problems led Moody's Investors Service to lower its outlook for the commonwealth to negative on Dec. 19, saying the economy was expected to weaken further. Moody's has given 13 states negative outlooks.
It is unusual for a tax-exempt issuer to sell debt this close to the end of the year. James Borghesani, a spokesman for Acting Gov. Jane M. Swift, said the short-term borrowing was needed because of a sharp drop in revenues.
"We're in a very tight fiscal situation now, so it doesn't come as a great shock to us that there's a temporary borrowing problem," Mr. Borghesani said.
In October, Massachusetts forecast that its budget would have a $1.4 billion shortfall, according to Moody's. In response, the Legislature cut spending $600 million and decided to draw down $866 million in cash reserves.

The Bombs' Toll, the Sneakers' Trail, Giuliani's Vision

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
After a lull of several days, the American bombardment of Afghanistan resumed as B-52's dropped 2,000-pound laser-guided bombs on a walled compound in the eastern province of Paktika that American brass believe was used by the Taliban's chief of intelligence. 
 Villagers reported that dozens of civilians had been killed in the bombing. Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowleded that "there may have been" some civilians inside the compound. A spokesman for the United States Central Command said the Taliban might have deliberately placed civilians there. 

BIN LADEN'S WHEREABOUTS -- As criticism of the American bombing grows in Afghanistan, an Afghan defense official added a twist to the search for Osama bin Laden by saying the terrorist leader had escaped into Pakistan. The official said Mr. bin Laden was under protection of the fundamentalist Jamiat-e-Ulema-i-Islam party, which has supported Islamic extremists for a decade.
American officials dismissed the report, and the secretary general of the Jamiat-e-Ulema-i-Islam party in Pakistan denied that Mr. bin Laden was there.
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said members of Mr. bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and other prisoners captured in Afghanistan would be held at the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. 
Some may stand trial before military tribunals. Although the site of the trials has not been set, Defense Department lawyers have drafted regulations covering operations of the tribunals. Under the rules, a unanimous verdict by the five uniformed officers on the tribunals would be required to impose a death penalty on a convicted terrorist. Defendants will be presumed innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the same standard used in civilian trials. 
The trials will be open to the public, except when matters of national security are raised. Apparently in response to critics, the rules will provide for some kind of appeals process before a three-member panel. 
Mr. Rumsfeld said there were no plans to hold military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay. Legal problems may prevent the use of American military bases in countries that do not have a death penalty. An administration official said the possibility of using military ships on the open seas was being held out as a last resort.
EUROPE'S FAILURE -- As authorities try to untangle the roots of the fundamentalist rage behind the terrorist attacks on the United States, attention returns again and again to Europe. Officials in several European countries now admit that they were too focused on domestic discord to pick up early warning signals from the Islamic terrorist cells in their own cities. 
With the British, Spanish and French governments worried about separatist and nationalist extremists within their borders, the Al Qaeda network recruited members, often using local mosques and prisons. European officials concede they underestimated Al Qaeda's reach and sophistication and acknowledge that their lack of cooperation hampered terrorism investigations before Sept. 11.
A SUSPECT'S MOVEMENTS -- Investigators in Europe and the Middle East continue to try to piece together the movements of Richard C. Reid in the days before he tried to blow up an American Airlines jet with a bomb hidden in his sneakers. Dutch officials believe Mr. Reid, 28, may have bought the sneakers in the Netherlands eight days before the attempt on Dec. 22. 
The Israeli airline El Al said that Mr. Reid had flown to Israel in July. Security guards, alerted by his suspicious behavior, checked his luggage, clothes and shoes, but found nothing and allowed him to board the jet.
GIULIANI'S PLEDGE -- Huge cranes continue to sift through the rubble of the twin towers and huge crowds of tourists continue making pilgrimages to the site. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wants the entire 16-acre site preserved as a memorial, and he pledged to personally see that come to be. 
"We should think about a soaring, monumental, beautiful memorial that just draws millions of people that just want to see it," Mr. Giuliani said in his official farewell address after eight years in office. 
Mr. Giuliani's successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, has not embraced the idea of dedicating the whole site to a memorial. He said he favored at least some economic development, a position favored by some business leaders. ANTHONY DePALMA

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE TRAIL; 
Terror Cells Slip Through Europe's Grasp

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER and CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Late last July in Afghanistan, after months of terrorist training, Jamal Beghal, an Algerian-born Frenchman, was summoned to the home of a senior aide to Osama bin Laden. 
 The time for action had come, said the aide, Abu Zubeida. Mr. Beghal was instructed to return to France via Morocco and Spain and orchestrate a suicide bombing of the American Embassy in Paris. According to a senior French intelligence official, Mr. Beghal shaved his beard, put on Western clothing, and, before leaving, was given three gifts from Mr. bin Laden -- a toothpick, prayer beads and a flask of incense. 
 On July 28 -- six weeks before Sept. 11 -- in the Dubai airport transit lounge, Mr. Beghal's plan fell apart. With his name on a watch list, he was arrested for a forged visa extension. His lawyer said that he was tossed into a darkened cell, handcuffed to a chair, blindfolded and beaten and that his family was threatened. After some weeks he talked and out poured a wealth of information. Agents in half a dozen countries went to work. 
It was a real intelligence break, later recounted in detail by senior French intelligence officials, but it would prove too late to stop the World Trade Center plot. Enough time and work could have led investigators from Mr. Beghal to an address in Hamburg where Mohamed Atta and his cohorts had developed and planned the Sept. 11 attacks. But the hijackers had already slipped into the United States and were within days of carrying out their mission. 
Those missed opportunities and the case of Mr. Beghal tell a great deal about the world of Muslim militancy that took root in Europe in the 1990's, its shifting focus and varied structure, as well as the failure, many intelligence officials now acknowledge, of most European governments to understand its gravity, danger and depth.
Terrorist cells formed, carried out specialized tasks, dissolved and then re-formed elsewhere, careful to maintain isolation and disguise their identities.
Mr. Beghal, who lived on the margins of French society and wandered across Europe finding others like himself, typifies the immigrant Muslims who fell under the sway of Al Qaeda in the 1990's.
The mission he was leading was one of three known bin Laden plots being hatched last summer in Europe, including the World Trade Center attack and the assassination of the anti-Taliban leader of the Afghan Northern Alliance, Ahmed Shah Massoud. Mr. Beghal's path crossed that of activists of the other two plots; the way they made plans and built cells explains why Europe became the forward operating base for Islamic terror over the last decade.
European officials now ruefully admit that they were not paying enough attention to these Islamic networks in their midst. Their focus was largely domestic -- the British worried about the militants in Northern Ireland, the Spanish about the Basques, the French about the Algerians. There was not enough cooperation.
Different countries had different political and legal cultures, different traditions of police power, different levels of concern for individual rights to privacy and protection from the state. The reach and sophistication of Al Qaeda was underestimated. 
"The problem was bigger than we thought," a senior British official said. 
In Britain and Germany, security and immigration laws are now being changed and toughened, and traditional protections for religion-based communities, including those that preach hatred, are being diluted.
But these laws amount to a belated reaction. By following the path of Mr. Beghal from the time he first came to the attention of French authorities eight years ago until his confession, a picture emerges that helps explain how the tranquillity of the United States was shattered three-and-a-half months ago.

A Radical's Journey
After Immigration, Jihad Offers Meaning
Mr. Beghal's journey is typical of that followed by thousands of Islamic radicals in Europe, who find meaning in jihad after lives of alienation. Born in 1965 in Algeria, Mr. Beghal was brought to a gritty suburb of Paris as a child.
He grew up there in the public housing projects of Corbeil-Essonnes, where his name, until October, was still on the intercom of the first-floor apartment of building C-5. In some ways, Mr. Beghal integrated well. He married a French woman, Sylvie, with whom he has three boys. He speaks flawless French.
But like many immigrants he was stuck on the bottom, drifting between menial jobs in grimy food stalls in an outdoor market near Paris. For a man with intelligence, charisma and a penchant for leadership, it was a frustrating existence.
According to intelligence officials, he began to frequent the mosques in the projects, where he was exhorted to build the new Islamic society and where he heard Western society excoriated for its decadence, selfishness and godlessness. 
He learned about Muslims in Bosnia, Chechnya, the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Iraq. As an Algerian he was also painfully aware of the annulment of the Algerian elections in 1991 when Islamic parties swept to victory only to be denied power. France played a pivotal role in backing the military government that broke the Islamic insurgency. 
"In the suburbs many people belong to the Algerian network although they are French nationals," said Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, the French magistrate-prosecutor who specializes in investigating terrorist organizations. "They have no job. They have no information, no hope for the future. One day they meet a guy who is interesting, who has good knowledge of Islam. They tell him, 'I can give you something, a task for you, for the future.' They explain Islam. They bring a global conception of their life, teach them a skill and they say, 'We have a goal for you in the future.' They say, 'You can continue to deceive, continue to forge papers, but now you do it as a sign of the measure of God, for Allah.' " 
In 1994, Mr. Beghal was picked up in a police sweep of Algerian Islamic radicals who were waging a terrorist campaign inside France. It is not clear whether he was imprisoned.
Many Islamic radicals in France have prison records. The French refuse to release figures on those of North African descent in the prison system, but social workers estimate that it runs as high as 70 percent. The prisons have become more efficient recruiting grounds than the mosques.
"Prison is a good indoctrination center for the Islamic radicals, much better than the outside," said a French Interior Ministry official. "There are about 300 Islamic radicals in prisons in Paris, and they spend a lot of time converting the criminals to Islam." 
After his first encounter with the French police, Mr. Beghal threw himself into work on behalf of militant Islam. He began to speak in small storefront mosques and Islamic centers. He raised money for Muslims fighting in Chechnya and Bosnia. Then, one night in 1997, he packed his wife and children in a car and left for London.

A Terrorist Vortex
Radicals' Plots Hatched in London
It was a trajectory similar to that of several leaders of Islamic networks in Europe. London is filled with Arab dissident groups, many of which fled there from Beirut during the 1975-1991 civil war in Lebanon. Others had fled the repression in countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Many of the Muslim terrorist plots that have plagued Europe and the United States have had crucial ties with clerics in Britain. The perpetrators of three plots -- the failed attempt to blow up the American Embassy in Paris, the World Trade Center attack and the assassination of Mr. Massoud -- all had London in common. Several of the people involved had met there, forging ties that would be cemented in Afghan camps. 
In London, Mr. Beghal met another French child of immigrants, Zacarias Moussaoui, according to British intelligence officials and members of two London mosques. While there is no evidence that Mr. Beghal had any direct ties with the September attacks, Mr. Moussaoui had a connection to the Hamburg cell of Mr. Atta.
Now under arrest in the United States, Mr. Moussaoui is believed by investigators to have been selected to be the 20th hijacker.
It was from London that Mr. Beghal made frequent trips to Europe, including Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. He built up a coterie of followers, several of whom would go with him to Afghanistan to train. While he was in France in 1999, French authorities picked him up and questioned him about his activities. 
When he was in Britain, the French received reports from British intelligence about his activities. Mr. Beghal, like Mr. Moussaoui, frequented the mosque of Abu Qatada, a 41-year-old Palestinian from Jordan, sentenced to life imprisonment there for involvement in bombings. The cleric fought in Afghanistan and was granted political asylum in Britain in 1994. 
Abu Qatada, born Omar Mohamed Othman, is described as Al Qaeda's "spiritual guide." Videotapes of some of his sermons were found in Mr. Atta's apartment. 
Mr. Beghal and Mr. Moussaoui also attended the Finsbury Park mosque, in north London, where Sheik Abu Hamza al-Masri preaches jihad and the overthrow of the impure governments of Islamic states like Saudi Arabia, whose leaders they view as betrayers of Islam because they have allowed American troops to be stationed on Saudi soil.
Mr. Beghal was often seen with Abu Walid, the right-hand man of Mr. Qatada, intelligence officials said. He became part of a circle with Mr. Moussaoui and Kamel Daoudi, another Algerian-born Frenchman whom Mr. Beghal later recruited for his plot to blow up the American Embassy in Paris. 
Mr. Beghal and Mr. Daoudi were friends with Jerome Courtailler, a French convert to Islam, who lived in London as Mr. Moussaoui's roommate. Another friend of Mr. Moussaoui, Xavier Djaffo, another French Arab, died fighting in Chechnya in 1998.

Borderless Rebels
Autonomous Cells Re-Form With Ease
The capture of Mr. Beghal in July was no accident. He had been under surveillance for two years. The French intelligence services, after a wave of bombings and attacks by Islamic radicals in France in the early 1990's, were better equipped than most to follow potential terrorists like Mr. Beghal. Their prosecuting judges have enormous authority to order surveillance on suspects. While American agencies have too few Arabic speakers to translate intercepted conversations, the French have separate translating units for the 20 Algerian dialects alone. 
But even as the French broke the Algerians terrorist groups, they and officials in other countries began to face a far deadlier, multinational terrorist mutation. 
As efforts in the 1980's and early 1990's to overthrow the governments in Algeria, Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia stumbled, the focus of many Islamic rebel groups shifted away from their home countries toward a transnational war against the West, especially the United States.
Pan-Islamists groups gravitated toward each other. They were inspired by the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan to the mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors. They were also encouraged by the Islamic revolution in Iran. Meanwhile, Western economic sanctions against Iraq, the Russian war in Chechnya and the growing acceptance and power of Israel fueled their anger. 
But no longer did they meet only in mosques or Islamic centers or stay within structured groups, all habits that made them easier to track and destroy. Rather, they broke into autonomous cells that, to mask their activities, did not show outward signs of traditional Muslim piety and had only loose connections to one another. 
Many even adopted the outward habits of the West, drinking and dating in the belief that jihad required such deception. The new terrorist cells became a huge intelligence headache, since many carried out one attack, dissolved and re-formed with new members across the porous European borders. 
"For these groups, there are no borders," said Judge Bruguiere. "They may consider it better or easier to have explosive materials in some countries and support bases in other countries, electronic matters in others, and financial support -- forged papers, or forged credit cards and so on -- in still others."
Most of those in the European cells were equipped with European passports, some of them false, making movement between states easy. Various responsibilities were divided among different parts of Europe, with many cells specializing in narrow and specific tasks, French and Spanish intelligence officials said.
The centers for forged documents were in Spain and Belgium. Spain also seemed to be a frequent meeting point for operatives and a source of funds through petty crime and credit card fraud. (In apartment raids, equipment was seized that is used to alter the magnetic strips on the cards.) 
A card stolen anywhere in Europe could be shipped overnight, copied 10 times and given to members who could run up several thousand dollars in bills before the number was reported stolen, intelligence officials said. Usually the men bought electronic gear or gasoline, which could be resold for cash.
The leader of the Al Qaeda cell arrested in Madrid in November, Eddin Barakat Yarkas, known as Abu Dahdah, was said by Spanish authorities to be the chief bin Laden aide in Europe. He was known to have made dozens of trips across the continent, including 20 to London. His number was found in Mr. Atta's papers and in the diary of Said Bahaji, one of his Hamburg roommates. 
Phone conversations to Abu Dahdah had been taped, including one on Aug. 27 that picked up a phrase used by a North African named Shakur. He said, "In our lessons we have entered the field of aviation and we have cut the bird's throat." The police believe now that this was a reference to the World Trade Center plot. Other clues found among the Madrid cell's apartments were videotapes on airplanes and a CD-ROM on the infrastructure of an American airport.
Britain was generally used as a way station for those sent to Afghanistan. France was more often the home of the foot soldiers who carried out the attacks.
A cell uncovered in Milan, where Italian authorities recorded conversations by a Tunisian, Essid Sami Ben Khemais who trained in Afghanistan, showed that some operatives were little more than Osama bin Laden hopefuls, aspiring radicals who had never had direct contact with Al Qaeda but who reached out to fight on its behalf anyway. They contacted radical groups in Germany, Britain and Spain in the hope of being brought into the network. Mr. Khemais was arrested in April. 
The cells also mutated, changing their style frequently, intelligence officials say.
"We may have a grasp of some cells, what they did, but we can't use this knowledge for the future," Judge Bruguiere said. "Everything changes. If you have good knowledge of the network today, it's not operational tomorrow. I compare these networks to AIDS. It's a virus. It's a moving shape. It's impossible to grasp it and to destroy it." 
Certainly, Germany missed some important clues. Mr. Atta, a leader of the Sept. 11 plot was registered in Germany with three different passports and no one noticed.
With no global ambitions outside Europe and careful of their own business interests in the Middle East, the Germans tended to be more worried about domestic terrorism and neo-Nazis. Given Germany's Nazi past and its strict laws protecting privacy, the German prosecutor was more meticulous than his French counterpart about requiring substantial evidence before authorizing arrests and investigations.
The German police, in 2000, did smash a terrorist cell in Frankfurt plotting an attack on Strasbourg, France. But officials earlier that same year dropped an inquiry into the group in Hamburg that was busy planning the Sept. 11 attacks. The federal prosecutor felt there was insufficient evidence to continue surveillance on the apartment where Mr. Atta and at least four other plotters lived. Mr. Moussaoui was apparently not on any American watch list; nor was Mr. Atta.

A Transnational Mix
Sleeper Cells Bond And Wait to Strike
In November 2000, Mr. Beghal left London for Afghanistan, intelligence officials said, shortly after Al Qaeda operatives bombed the destroyer Cole off the Yemeni coast, killing 17 American sailors. The 1998 attacks on the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were considered resounding successes and the American responses tepid.
Mr. Beghal was already the leader of an eclectic group of followers, most of whom appeared to move easily in European society. The transnational mix included French converts to Islam nicknamed the "Gauls" or "the white moors," along with students, petty criminals, computer specialists. All looked to Mr. Beghal. He would soon be anointed to lead what would have been an audacious strike in the heart of Paris. 
"He oversaw a group of mixed nationalities, although there were a fair number of Tunisians, who are some of the most zealous militants," said the French Interior Ministry official. "These people had time in Afghanistan to get to know each other and plan activities. They ate the same food. They lived in the same conditions. It is like the bonding that comes from military service. Once these groups return to Europe their loyalty is to the cell, even if members come from different countries. They forget their past, their origins."
After he departed for Afghanistan, French intelligence officials lost track of Mr. Beghal. They put out a watch for him, but while they wanted him stopped, they did not want him arrested because they hoped to follow him.
As it turned out, he headed last July to Morocco, where he was to pick up $50,000 to carry out the Paris attack, and move on through Spain. But the Central Intelligence Agency, which had put out a warning of a possible terrorist attack against American interests a month before, insisted he be held and questioned. 
Mr. Beghal's lawyer, Fabrice Dubest, said that after his arrest in Dubai, he was repeatedly interrogated about strikes against American targets. 
According to French intelligence transcripts of his interrogation, Mr. Beghal said he planned to buy a van at the Salon de l'Auto car fair in Paris. A former soccer player, Nizar Trabelsi, born in Tunisia and living in Brussels, would drive the van into the embassy compound and blow it up in a suicide mission. 
Operatives in Brussels had already begun to collect chemicals for transport to Paris, French intelligence officials said. In the final weeks before the planned attack, Mr. Beghal intended to rent a house, start a business as a cover for the activities of the group and open a small cybercafe so he could communicate in code with Mr. bin Laden's operatives in Afghanistan. Most codes, French intelligence officials said, were hidden in pictures transmitted over the Internet. The final approval to strike, they said, was to come from Afghanistan. 
"Beghal did not give us the names of the other Islamic terrorists in Europe he was working with, but he gave us addresses and physical descriptions," said a French official. "All of them used pseudonyms." 
Mr. Beghal was known as Abu Hamza and Mr. Trabelsi was known as "le Noir," French intelligence officials said. 
"We checked our files and matched his descriptions to those we suspected of involvement in terrorist activities," said a French intelligence official. "It was a perfect fit. Then we began to follow everyone."
On Sept. 23, shortly before he was turned over to the French, Mr. Beghal signed 32 documents in Arabic with 16 questions that summarized his confessions. Once in France, Mr. Beghal retracted his confession, telling his lawyer that he was forced to sign the papers, which he had not been allowed to read, after being tortured.
Some European officials say that after the arrests in Europe and the collapse of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, the group has been crippled for now. A Spanish police commander estimated recently that "probably 50" members of Al Qaeda had been jailed in the European sweeps. He expressed confidence that many others "fled and are now fearful because of the information we have." He is convinced, he said, that "the hard core has been jailed, and I don't believe there are other cells." 
But others say they are bracing for a new wave of attacks. The nature of sleeper cells -- people apparently integrated into society -- makes it hard to know. 
French officials estimate that as many as 100 French Muslims of North African descent were fighting alongside Mr. bin Laden. They say that after escaping to Pakistan they are working their way back to France. 
"These fighters did not cross into Pakistan and head for the mosques," said a senior French intelligence official. "They are headed back here to set off bombs."

Missed Signals
This is the second of three articles. The final report will examine how Al Qaeda took root in the United States and how investigators failed to heed clues that could have helped to foil the attacks of Sept. 11. The first article examined Saudi Arabia's policies toward militants who left home to wage holy war. Articles in this series and related coverage are on the Web:

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE NEW TAPE; 
In Its Express Delivery and Its Details, Bin Laden's Latest Tape Differs From Past Ones

BYLINE:  By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Osama bin Laden's latest videotaped statement was delivered to an Arab television network two days ago from Pakistan by the DHL express package company, in an apparent break with the terrorist leader's past practices of using personal couriers to deliver messages to the outside world, according to a network executive and American officials.
 Abrahim Helal, an executive with Al Jazeera, the Arab television network that has often served as an outlet for Mr. bin Laden, answered questions by e-mail. He did not say whether there was a return address on the package, but an American official said it would be simple for an intermediary from Mr. bin Laden to falsify a return address in Pakistan. A spokeswoman for DHL said she could not comment on the company's handling of the package. 
 United States officials said that the fact that the tape was sent by a major express service from Pakistan does not indicate that Mr. bin Laden has left Afghanistan, because the tape was probably mailed by an intermediary.
United States officials who have reviewed the latest tape from Mr. bin Laden heard little that was new in his anti-American rhetoric, but still found some details that were of interest, particularly in his gaunt appearance. One official also observed that during the statement, Mr. bin Laden did not move his left hand, even though he is left-handed.
He also used a cloth background, clearly in an effort to disguise his location. If he was in a cave in southern Afghanistan, the color and texture of the rock formations in the background of a videotape could give a clue as to where he was hiding.
The tape appears to have been made in late November or early December: "three months after the blessed strikes against world atheism and its leader, America, and around two months after the fierce crusade against Islam," Mr. bin Laden said, referring to the Sept. 11 attacks and the beginning of American bombing on Oct. 7.
In the tape, he says he wants to destroy the American economy in order to make it impossible for the United States to influence the world. "If their economy ends, they will busy themselves away from the enslavement of oppressed people," he said, according to a translation of the videotaped statement made by The Associated Press. "It is important to concentrate on the destruction of the American economy."
"Our terrorism is against America," he added. "Our terrorism is a blessed terrorism to prevent the unjust person from committing injustice and to stop American support for Israel, which kills our sons."
He also said Al Qaeda, his organization, used the openness of the United States against it on Sept. 11.
Referring to the 19 hijackers, he said: "They used the enemy's planes and studied at enemy schools, without the need for training camps. But God helped them and taught this cruel lesson to those arrogant people, who see freedom only for the white race and keep other nations humiliated and oppressed." 
Mr. bin Laden also came closer than he ever had before to accepting responsibility for the bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa in August 1998, speaking approvingly of the individuals who carried out the attack. Those bombings first forced the United States to wake up to the growing threat posed by Al Qaeda. 
According to a translation of the tape by Agence France-Presse, he said that when "the youths, may God receive them as martyrs," blew up the United States Embassy in Nairobi, less than two tons of explosives were used. 
"The United States then said it was a terrorist act and a mass destruction weapon, while it unscrupulously used two bombs of seven million grams each," he added, referring to 15,000-pound "daisy cutter" bombs dropped by American aircraft in Afghanistan.
Al Jazeera executives were unsure what they had on their hands after they received the DHL package, Mr. Helal said. Not only was the delivery by DHL out of the norm for Mr. bin Laden, but also tape itself was an old-style videotape that made it difficult for the network even to play it. 
When the station opened the package, "we found only a small Hi-8 tape," Mr. Helal wrote in his e-mail message, adding: "We had to search a lot before we found the suitable machine, as it was a very old kind of Sony video 8. Finally, we managed to view it, and we found out that it was Osama bin Laden."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: BIN LADEN'S WORDS; 
'America Is in Decline,' the Leader of Al Qaeda Says

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the most recent videotape by Osama bin Laden, as translated by Agence France-Presse. Additional excerpts are available on the Web at nytimes.com/world.
 The events of Sept. 11 were no more than a reaction to the continuous injustice being inflicted on our sons in Palestine, Iraq, Somalia, southern Sudan, Kashmir, Assam and elsewhere. 
 These blessed and successful strikes were in response to what is happening on our land in Palestine, Iraq and elsewhere. George Bush the son, who began his term by launching heavy air raids on Iraq, is sticking to the U.S. policy of injustice and aggression, confirming that Muslim blood has no value for Americans .
These blessed strikes showed clearly that this arrogant power, America, rests on a powerful but precarious economy, which rapidly crumbled.
Those who perpetrated the attacks were not 19 Arab states. The armies and ministries of the Arab states, which have got used to submissiveness and to the injustice inflicted on us in Palestine and elsewhere, did not move.
They were 19 high school students who shook the American empire, hit the U.S. economy where it hurts and hit the mightiest military power.
This shows clearly that the global economy based on usury, which America uses along with its military might to impose infidelity and humiliation on oppressed people, can easily crumble. . . . The hijackers used the enemy's planes and studied in the enemy's schools. They did not need training camps.
They gave a harsh lesson to these arrogant peoples, for whom freedom is but for the white race; as to the other people, they must remain humiliated. . . . 
While America staged a show of force in Afghanistan recently, we learned important lessons in how to resist this arrogant power.
Even if our weapons do not reach their planes, the impact of their strikes can be alleviated by expanding our defense lines. Another method is to hit the economy, which is the basis of military might. If their economy is finished, they will become too busy to enslave oppressed people. . . .
A few days ago, they bombed Al Qaeda positions in Khost Afghanistan and dropped -- in what they said was a mistake -- a radio-guided bomb on a mosque where ulemas were praying. They targeted the mosque, killing 150 Muslim worshippers. . . . 
America and Western leaders often say that Hamas, the Islamic Jihad in Palestine and other militant organizations are terrorist groups. If self-defense is terrorism, what then is legitimate? . . .
God willing, America's end is near. Its end does not depend on whether Osama is killed or remains alive, because this is a time of revival.
Those who say that martyrdom operations are not permissible are expressing the wishes of the tyrants, the United States and its agents. . . . America is in decline; the economic drain is continuing but more strikes are required and the youths must strike the key sectors of the American economy.

HEADLINE: Trade and Security Tie Canada Closer to U.S. 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
With concern growing about ree trade and continental security, the economy of Canada has become so rigidly synchronized with that of the United States that if America stumbles, they both fall, and cannot regain their feet alone.
 The links between the two countries have existed for decades, but they have grown so intense that Canadian officials have little leeway in piloting the nation's economy. And in recent months, even the far-reaching impact of United States foreign and military policy has exerted a pull on the Canadian economy. 
 In a recent poll by Compas Inc., a polling company in Toronto, Canadian executives said the most important force in shaping how far and how fast the Canadian economy recovers is not any factor under Ottawa's control but rather the success of America's antiterrorism campaign in Afghanistan. 
"Nobody should underestimate the impact of the U.S. slowdown," Paul Martin, the minister of finance, said in a telephone interview from Ottawa. "We're weathering the storm relatively well, but we're definitely feeling the effects of the U.S. slowdown. Our turnaround here is going to be heavily influenced by a turnaround in the United States."
The slowdowns in the two economies this year have been mirror images. Major economic indicators from industrial production to unemployment are so closely aligned that the two nations resemble partners in synchronized swimming.
Despite such close links, Peter Morici, a professor for business and public policy at the University of Maryland who has studied the Canada-United States relationship, said he thought that Ottawa still retained one significant handle for steering the Canadian economy.
Although the Bank of Canada tends to parallel the interest rate actions of the Federal Reserve in the United States, it can time its moves to best support Canada's economic cycle and adjust its monetary policy accordingly, keeping at least that aspect of the nation's economic fate in its hands. 
"The real issues for Canada are border security and sensible monetary policy, which they've had," Professor Morici said. "Besides that, all they can do is run a fiscally responsible shop and hope for the best when it comes to the U.S. economy."
In the latest federal budget, the usually tightfisted Mr. Martin loosened the purse strings to increase spending on border security and military preparedness by $4.8 billion. That reverses a trend of budget cuts that lasted much of the last decade and significantly reduced Canada's sovereign debt. 
Mr. Martin said that before Sept. 11, he was expecting a recovery to begin by the end of the year; if that had happened, more money would have been available to retire debt. 
"But we're not going to do that now," he said. Rather, he will try to kick start the economy and enhance Canada's competitive export position by spending heavily to improve border security with high-technology systems that can identify security threats without delaying commercial shipments. 
"What we're striving for is the maximum amount of cooperation on matters of security," he said, "while having the most open border in terms of commerce." 
Some Canadians have criticized the current government's policy of lining up in close coordination with the Bush administration on security measures at the border, often described as the longest undefended border in the world. Critics see any such cooperation with the United States as a small but significant surrender of sovereignty. 
But for others, the greater concern is keeping the border open and flowing smoothly. 
"The real threat to the Canadian economy would be a welling up of nationalism over border security," Professor Morici said. "That's not a function of American politics, but a reality imposed by geography."
Mr. Martin, the finance minister, does not see enhanced border cooperation as the equivalent of surrendering sovereignty. 
"There's no doubt that we've moved closer," he said. "But to go beyond that to a customs union or a common currency, I don't believe it has moved us in that direction."

HEADLINE: A Turbulent First Year 

 BODY:
George W. Bush is spending the days before New Year's at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., enjoying the kind of informal, secluded weekend he has probably envisioned having many times during his presidency. And the public, much of which was once prepared to resent Mr. Bush's desire to get away from Washington as much as possible, now simply hopes he gets to catch up on his sleep. It has been a far different first year than the one the president, or the country, anticipated.
 Mr. Bush heads toward his second year at the White House with his presidency transformed by crisis and the nation propelled by a renewed sense of purpose. He hardly seems like the same chief executive who squeaked into office thanks to a badly designed ballot in some Florida counties, let alone the candidate who was embarrassed by his inability to name the general running Pakistan. Mr. Bush, whose critics worried that he would never be able to conduct foreign diplomacy, has proved himself a strong wartime leader who gives the nation a sense of security during a period of crisis. 
 Among the many things America learned this year about its new president is that Mr. Bush sometimes responds uncertainly when he is taken by surprise, as he did in the hastily arranged appearance he made on Sept. 11, as he was being flown from one air base to another in search of security. But he recovers quickly. Since the terrorist attacks, Mr. Bush has approached the war against Al Qaeda in much the same way he ran his campaign for president -- by giving the people a series of clear, simple messages repeated with the firm discipline of a man who lives for his hourlong gym workouts. He picks subordinates he trusts and lets them do their jobs. 
As America approaches a new year, the lingering horror over Sept. 11 has been somewhat ameliorated by the success with which Mr. Bush and his team have prosecuted the war in Afghanistan, and the president's popularity is at historic highs. But there is no piece of history Mr. Bush is more familiar with than what happened to his father in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war. Economic problems at home turned the American mood sour, with fatal results for his re-election campaign.
The lesson the current President Bush takes from all that is the importance of maintaining the loyalty of his right-wing base, and showing the public he cares about their distress. In the new year he should reconsider the moral of his father's story. The American people want neither sympathy nor ideological purity. They are concerned with getting the economy back on its feet, and if that does not happen quickly, history suggests they may begin looking worriedly at federal deficit spending, which was made inevitable by Mr. Bush's huge tax cuts for wealthy Americans.
As the nation moves into 2002, we no longer worry about whether George W. Bush has the gravitas to lead the country in time of crisis, or whether his foreign policy team has the skill to protect the nation's interest in a global conflict. But there are many other things we still cannot be sure of. We do not know whether the president has the ability to trim his early impulse toward unilateral thinking and conservative ideology in ways that will allow him to maintain an international alliance against terrorism. The wheels are already coming off the cooperation between India and Pakistan. More ominous, Mr. Bush is needlessly challenging Russia and undercutting its president, Vladimir Putin, by insisting on scrapping the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The administration has dismayed allies by its hostility to international treaties on the environment and nuclear proliferation.
We do not need to wonder, as we did a year ago, whether the president is capable of using his famous people skills to create bipartisan alliances in Congress as he did in Texas, where the parties are far closer together than they are in Washington. Mr. Bush demonstrated through his work on the education testing bill that he has the talents to fashion a strong legislative agenda that can be passed into law. 
What we still do not know is whether he has the will to put all these talents together and create the sort of bipartisan, moderate domestic agenda that the voters were clearly demanding in that inconclusive presidential election a year ago. Finishing up his first year in office, George W. Bush is a larger, graver figure than the one we met during the 2000 election. He sees himself as a man wrestling with history, and he is right. The only question is whether he will learn the wrong lessons.

HEADLINE: Playing the 'Jersey Card,' Firms In Manhattan Compare Incentives 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In the summer of 1997, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani hailed the decision by a securities firm called Exco P.L.C. to move hundreds of employees from Jersey City to the World Trade Center as a breakthrough and rewarded the company with millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives.
 "For the first time in years," Mr. Giuliani said at the time, "companies like Exco are realizing the advantages of doing business in New York City and are making sure they have a major presence here." 
 But in the latest example of the cross-border war for jobs, the company announced yesterday that it was moving back across the Hudson River to Jersey City, to a new office tower at the Harborside Financial Center. Now known as Garban Intercapital, the company was lured there with at least $8.3 million in subsidies from New Jersey after its offices at the trade center were destroyed. 
The Garban deal surfaced two days after Gov. George E. Pataki unveiled a plan to use $285 million in federal aid to offer tax incentives to companies that remain in Lower Manhattan, or move there from elsewhere.
While a lawyer for Garban says the company plans to pay back the city, the growing bidding war for companies like Garban has prompted critics to question the wisdom of the incentive strategy.
"It would be wiser for the city to concentrate on strengthening entire industries, not just a few large corporations, and making the city more attractive for the indispensable employees and executives of these companies," said Jonathan Bowles, research director for the Center for an Urban Future.
Garban is far from alone in pressuring New York in a weak moment. Euro Brokers, another financial firm that had offices in the trade center, is "playing the Jersey card big time," said one New York official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Euro Brokers is threatening to move its 303 employees to Jersey City unless New York officials provide tax breaks comparable to the $24 million package New Jersey is offering, according to officials on both sides of the Hudson.
Euro Brokers could not be reached, but two real estate brokers familiar with the company's plans said Euro Brokers planned to move to 199 Water Street in Manhattan and was merely using the Jersey card as leverage.
Eight other companies, including Lehman Brothers, Fuji Securities, CIBC Oppenheimer and Dow Jones, have moved thousands of workers to New Jersey since Sept. 11 in exchange for millions in tax breaks.
Glenn J. Phillips, a spokesman for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said the state had not taken advantage of New York City's vulnerability, as many state and city officials in New York suspect.
"We've been very sensitive to that charge," Mr. Phillips said. "Since Sept. 11, it's been business as usual. There's no attempt to take advantage of the situation, but we're here if companies call us."
Over the past six years, he said, Goldman, Sachs, Merrill Lynch, U.S. Trust, Cigna Healthcare and other companies have moved employees to New Jersey from New York and taken advantage of the state's business incentive program. Many others simply threatened to relocate.
Whether or not the corporations truly intend to leave Manhattan, real estate brokers and urban planners say the executives have become adept at playing off New Jersey against New York to obtain special tax breaks, low-cost electricity or cash grants. In the last eight years, the Giuliani administration has provided more than 50 companies with a total of $2 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.
State and city officials are more worried than ever that investment banks and others will move their headquarters, or part of their operations, outside the city.
Earlier this month, New Jersey's governor-elect, James E. McGreevey, met with Mr. Giuliani at City Hall and pledged to not try to lure companies across the river. "Poaching is wrong," he said. But he did not vow to eliminate the incentive programs intended to attract out-of-state employers.
A decade ago, economic development officials from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut endorsed a no-poaching agreement at a news conference in Manhattan, and then promptly forgot about it.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said New Jersey officials had told him that they were not working overtime to benefit from New York's current problems.
As for Garban, Mr. Gargano said he intended to sue the company to recover more than $1 million in grants, charging that Exco did not live up to its 1997 agreement with New York to keep 460 jobs in the city. "We're going after them," he said.
But Jay Biggins, a lawyer who worked for Garban in obtaining the tax incentives in New Jersey, said the company intended to pay back both New York State and the city for the $6.3 million incentive package it received in 1997.
"This is not a dispute," Mr. Biggins said. "It's a nonissue."
The history of the Exco deal illustrates the pitfalls of tax incentives. In 1997, Exco promised to move 460 employees into the World Trade Center, including 219 from Jersey City. But within two years, Exco was losing business and cut its payroll in half, forfeiting any future benefits from the city and state. It was acquired by Intercapital, which later merged with Garban. Garban, in turn, moved into Exco's office space at the trade center.
Last summer, Garban executives said they wanted to expand Exco's original incentive deal to cover 700 employees who would remain in New York. The city refused the offer, Mr. Biggins said. Wracked by competition and problems after the trade center attack, Garban is now moving about 250 employees to Jersey City.
"They made the deal because the New Jersey economic benefits were so attractive," said John Picco, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, a brokerage firm that represented Garban. "There was no comparison with New York."

HEADLINE: U.S. Drops Threat to Cut Aid to Russia For Disarming 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Dec. 27 

 BODY:
After nearly a year of threatening to end programs aimed at helping Russia stop the spread of nuclear weapons, the White House announced today that it remained committed to an effort to help Russia dispose of hundreds of tons of military plutonium.
 The Bush administration, its concerns about the availability of nuclear weapons heightened since Sept. 11, said it would also continue a program to reduce the dependence of some Russian cities on nuclear weapons development and to provide alternative jobs for nuclear scientists. 
 In addition, the White House said that the Pentagon would seek to speed up the Cooperative Threat Reduction project to construct a chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuchye, 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow, allowing for its earlier completion.
The announcement marked the culmination of the Bush administration's yearlong review of Clinton-era programs, designed to work with Russia to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and essentially left all of them intact. Early in the administration, Bush administration officials criticized many of the programs as expensive and ill conceived, and had threatened to eliminate them or greatly reduce their funding. 
"I think it shows a fairly profound evolution of Bush administration views over the past year," said Rose Gottemoeller, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a senior Energy Department official during the Clinton administration. "They raised huge expectations early in the administration that they were going to slash and burn. I think they began to see the national security implications, and then after Sept. 11 it became untenable to cut the programs radically."
The administration released the announcement in a brief e-mail to reporters from the White House office in Crawford, Texas, where President Bush is vacationing on his ranch. Officials on the National Security Council oversaw the yearlong review of the programs.
The e-mail included only a short statement from Mr. Bush, taken from a speech he gave on Dec. 11 at The Citadel, the military college in Charleston, S.C. In that speech, Mr. Bush said that "together, we must keep the world's most dangerous technologies out of the hands of the world's most dangerous people. A crucial partner in this effort is Russia -- a nation we are helping to dismantle strategic weapons, reduce nuclear material, and increase security at nuclear sites."
The White House review covered 30 programs with a combined annual budget of $750 million. Arms control advocates consider them a cornerstone of America's scientific and military relationship with Russia. The programs involve mostly the Pentagon, the Energy Department and the State Department, and pay for the dismantling of weapons facilities and the strengthening of security at sites where nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are stored. 
Bush administration officials have said that their review, parts of which were made public by senior officials over the summer, does not endorse the Clinton approach. Rather, they say, the administration is trying to make the programs more cost-efficient and better-managed.
To that end, the administration has said it will pursue a less expensive approach in its effort to help Russia dispose of plutonium. The administration favors using plutonium in reactors as "mixed oxide fuel," as opposed to a more expensive method that mixes plutonium with glass and nuclear waste materials. 
In addition, the White House has sought more financing from Russia and European nations to help build the chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuchye. Critics said the original program was too costly and was not moving forward, and that Russia had not put up enough of its own money for the project. 
Under the Bush review, the program to provide alternative jobs for nuclear scientists, called the Nuclear Cities Initiative, will be consolidated with another program, called Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention. The combined program will be restructured, the announcement from the White House said, "to focus more effectively on projects to help Russia reduce its nuclear warhead complex."
The Nuclear Cities Initiative was started in 1998 to help create nonmilitary work for Russia's 122,000 nuclear scientists and to help Russia downsize geographically and economically isolated nuclear cities, where 760,000 people live. 
The aim of the program was to prevent nuclear scientists from leaving for Iraq, Iran and other would-be nuclear powers.

HEADLINE: IN FINAL ADDRESS, GIULIANI ENVISIONS SOARING MEMORIAL 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
In his official farewell address to New Yorkers after eight years in office, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani promised yesterday that he would push for a "soaring, monumental" memorial to be built at the World Trade Center site. He also said he felt that he and others were obligated to make sure that ground zero was sanctified and not controlled by economic development.
 Stepping from behind the lectern of St. Paul's Chapel, just a stone's throw from the gigantic cranes still sifting through the rubble, Mr. Giuliani walked, with microphone in hand, toward his audience of supporters and promised that all the families who had lost their loved ones would always receive assistance. 
 "I really believe we shouldn't think about this site out there, right behind us, right here, as a site for economic development," Mr. Giuliani told the assembled crowd of about 300. "We should think about a soaring, monumental, beautiful memorial that just draws millions of people here that just want to see it." 
"We have to be able to create something here that enshrines this forever and that allows people to build on it and grow from it," he added. "And it's not going to happen if we just think about it in a very narrow way." Excerpts, Page D6. 
If the memorial was done correctly, he said, "millions of people would come here. And you'll have all the economic development you want, and you can do the office space in a lot of different places." 
The departing mayor's support for letting the memorial govern the redevelopment of the trade center site could make things more complicated for the administration that succeeds him. Page D6. 
The incoming mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, gave a lukewarm reception yesterday to the notion of turning the entire 16-acre site into a memorial, which Mr. Giuliani has suggested as an option in recent weeks. 
"Everybody thinks we will have a memorial and should have a memorial," Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday, "and that is what we have the committee for: to look and see what's the appropriate use of that space, and I think I'll sit back and let them come up with suggestions and give them my input. I think that I'm in favor of more of a mixed-use thing."
As City Hall was being festooned with red-white-and-blue bunting in anticipation of Mr. Bloomberg's inauguration on Tuesday, Mayor Giuliani took the unusual step of saying goodbye from the 18th-century chapel where George Washington prayed after being inaugurated president.
He became slightly emotional during his 55-minute speech as he talked about fleeing the scene of the attack on Sept. 11. Mr. Giuliani jokingly referred to his cranky reputation before then and his image afterward as the old Rudy and the new Rudy, while he read newspaper clippings as a way of answering his critics. At times he reminisced about his family and his life, while at others he borrowed from the script of his annual State of the City speeches to credit his administration for the sharp declines in crime, lower welfare rolls and other achievements.
But the speech, by turns playful, technical, religious and patriotic, was also notable for the ground it did not cover, which included subjects like children's services, parks and recreation, education and public health, even though they were outlined in a handout about what the administration considers its successes, which was given to reporters.
At times, Mr. Giuliani's language and tone reverted to his familiar scolding voice, as he settled old scores and found fault with those who disagreed with him on crime, budget policy and treatment of the homeless.
He once again defended his policing policies and said places that used other approaches like community policing had had recent spikes in crime. And apparently stinging from recent criticism regarding the debt the city carries in a weakened economy, he digressed into a lecture about long-term debt and the city's fiscal responsibility.
The mayor began his speech by saying, as he has many times, that he drew his strength from New Yorkers and places like the chapel, its pews plastered with messages of thanks and encouragement to the recovery workers and its balcony lined with beds where those workers have rested alongside stacked boxes of paper towels and hot chocolate mix.
"Although I have to leave you as the mayor soon, I resume the much more honorable title of citizen," Mr. Giuliani told his audience, mainly former and current members of his administration, supporters, friends and family. "And the people of the city should understand that all of the sources of my strength absolutely endure because you have it, and you have that strength and you've displayed it."
Around the time he took office in 1994, Mr. Giuliani said, the city had been labeled a rotting apple on the cover of Time magazine and was the subject of terrible publicity, including 2,000 murders a year, the decline in jobs, the departure of Fortune 500 companies in record numbers and the flight of residents to other locations.
"I didn't know if I would succeed or not, but I felt that my job as the mayor was to turn around the city," he said. "Because I believed rightly or wrongly that we had one last chance to do that, to really turn it around in a totally opposite direction from the direction it was going in. And that created a lot of hostility and a lot of anger."
Mr. Giuliani gave a lengthy discourse on the city's accomplishments in reducing crime through what he called the application of rational strategies rather than emotional and political responses. He moved on to defend, as he frequently has, the city's dealings with welfare recipients and the homeless, casting those efforts as ideological shifts in social policies that critics were incapable of understanding.
Taking a swipe at a recent federal court decision that ordered the police to stop ejecting homeless people from the grounds of a Manhattan church, the mayor said that none of the problems of the homeless were solved "by doing the kind of thing that the judge allowed last week."
"That's cruel," he continued. "He doesn't think it's cruel. But he's having a hard time thinking through the ideology that he brings with it to analyzing his decisions."
On welfare, displaying his penchant for using numbers in speeches, Mr. Giuliani said that the city had nearly 700,000 fewer people on welfare than it had when he came into office, and that it was on track to having created 250,000 jobs in the last two years. He also praised the city's fiscal policies, saying that Mr. Bloomberg would take office with a budget surplus of more than $1 billion, whereas Mr. Giuliani came into office with a $2.3 billion deficit.
The mayor credited his administration with having accomplished more development in the last 8 years than had occurred in the city in probably 30 or 35 years. He cautioned against a return to an "anti-development, high-tax philosophy" as the national economy sags.
Despite his often frosty relationship with some of the city's minority populations and representatives, Mr. Giuliani also took time to say that the city's greatest strength was its diversity. He added, "I remember after the attack on the World Trade Center, it just came very naturally for me to say to people, do not engage in group blame. Do not go single out people who are Arab-Americans and blame the attack on the World Trade Center on them."
Indeed, all roads, it seemed, led back to Sept. 11. In one of the more emotional parts of his speech, the mayor called himself "a survivor like the church," along with many of the officials seated in the front row of pews. There, flanking his friend Judith Nathan, were many of the people who had been with him that morning, he said, including Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik, Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, and Deputy Mayors Joseph J. Lhota, Anthony P. Coles and Robert M. Harding. The fourth deputy mayor, Rudy Washington, although mentioned by the mayor in the lineup, was not seated among them.
Mr. Giuliani said he owed it to those who perished to ensure a proper memorial at the World Trade Center site and promised to make it his mission. The area, he said, will be remembered 1,000 years from now for "the sacrifice of our patriots and their heroism."
"This place," he said, "has to become a place in which when anybody comes here immediately they're going to feel the great power and strength and emotion of what it means to be an American."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Talks of a City's Spirit, and a Grand Monument to Those Who Died 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's farewell address at St. Paul's Chapel in Manhattan yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
 . . .The reason I chose this chapel is because this chapel is thrice-hallowed ground. This is a place of really special importance to people who have a feeling and a sense and an emotion and an understanding of patriotism. This is hallowed by the fact that it was consecrated as a house of God in 1766. That's a long time ago. And in 1789, in April of 1789, George Washington came and after he was inaugurated as the first president of our republic he prayed right here in this church, which makes it very sacred ground to people who feel what America is all about. 
 But then it was consecrated one more time, in 2001 on Sept. 11. When I walked in here from the back, I looked up because every time I've walked in this church when I looked up I saw the twin towers just way, way above. . . . And on Sept. 11 when the twin towers were viciously attacked and came crashing to the ground in the worst attack on America, destroyed buildings all around, did damage as far away as City Hall all the way south in the southern part of Battery Park City and covered this whole area with debris, body parts and in many, many ways damaged buildings, this chapel remained not only not destroyed, not a single window was broken, not a single thing hurt. And I think there's some very, very special significance in that. The place where George Washington prayed when he first became president of the United States stood strong, powerful, untouched, undaunted by the attacks of these people who hate what we stand for. Because what we stand for is so much stronger than they are.
So this chapel stands for our values. And it's a very important place. And I hope you return here often to reflect on what it means to be an American and a New Yorker.
When I became mayor of New York City in 1993, with the help of many of you that are here, it seemed to me that I had to do something different than other mayors. It seemed to me that what I had to do was to totally change the direction and course of New York City. Maybe I was right about that, maybe I was wrong about it, but that's the way I felt I had to operate. I saw this city deteriorating. . . . I saw the city on the front page of Time magazine in 1990 in which the front cover said "New York City: the Rotting Apple." 
And then several years worth of terrible, terrible publicity about the city: 2,000 murders a year; people fleeing; 320,000 fewer jobs; Fortune 500 companies leaving in record numbers. A poll in 1993 said that over 65 percent of New Yorkers wanted to leave the city if they could afford to do it. When I saw that poll I became really concerned about the future of the city. And then another one that said that the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers believed that although we would survive as a city, our best days were behind us, our best days were history, that our future would not be nearly as bright as our past. . . . 
So I felt that my job as the mayor, I didn't know if I would succeed or not, but I felt that my job as the mayor was to turn around the city. Because I believed rightly or wrongly that we had one last chance to do that, to really turn it around in a totally opposite direction from the direction it was going in.
And that created a lot of hostility and a lot of anger. I knew it would. Because the city was headed in the direction it was in because of ideas. There were people who had political philosophies and political creeds and ideologies and those were the reasons behind all of the things that had the city headed in the wrong direction, in my view. And I had a different group of ideas about what should lie behind where the city was going. . . .
The physical structure of the city has to be rebuilt like the human structure of the city is rebuilt. And the city should never again go back into the antidevelopment philosophy. We did more developing in the last eight years than in probably the last 30 or 35 years combined. I won't list all the projects. You know them: Times Square, 125th Street, the first hotel in Brooklyn in 50 years. 
Nobody had built a hotel in Brooklyn in 50 years. I don't know what they were doing in Brooklyn in 50 years . . . But no hotel in Brooklyn in 50 years. We brought baseball back to Brooklyn and Staten Island. 
And the one that I'm the most proud of now and keep going to look at is the AOL Time Warner headquarters on Columbus Circle. That's a grand new project that was mired in the antidevelopment philosophy and letting it rule for 15 or 20 years. And I can give you all kinds of examples like that. Hotels that were built, office buildings that have gone up, courthouses, Judge Kaye, courthouses in every borough with the very, very strong support and help of Chief Judge Kaye. Thank you.
But you have to fight the antidevelopment philosophy. Because it's there and it can be very, very harmful, particularly now, when the city has to work its way out of two things. And I think it's the second more than the first, actually. The attack on the World Trade Center and the impact that that has had on our economy. I'm not sure that some of that wasn't exaggerated now that I look at our tax receipts, the impact of the World Trade Center. 
But the second part, and that is the national economy. No matter how we try to outperform it, and we do nowadays, it's still going to affect us. So given that, this would be the worst time to go back into an antidevelopment, high-tax philosophy. . . . 
There are just too many things to talk about and too many people to thank. But there is one big change that has taken place that's the most important and the one that I wanted to bring about. And that one I'm really sure of. It's a change in the spirit of the city. That city that used to be the rotting apple, that 60, 70, 80 percent of the people wanted to leave and nobody wanted to come to, that city now is very strong and it is a confident city. It's a city that has withstood the worst attack of any city in America or in the history of America and people are standing up as tall, as strong and as straight as this church. . . . 
So I really believe we shouldn't think about this site out there right beyond us right here as a site for economic development. I think we should think about it this way: we should think about how we can find the most creative minds possible who love and honor America and can express that in artistic ways that I can't, but they can. And we should think about a soaring, monumental, beautiful memorial that just draws millions of people here that just want to see it and then also want to come here for reading and education and background and research.
Long after we are all gone, it's the sacrifice of our patriots and their heroism that is going to be what this place is remembered for. This is going to be a place that is remembered 100 and 1,000 years from now, like the great battlefields of Europe and of the United States. And we really have to be able to do with it what they did with Normandy or Valley Forge or Bunker Hill or Gettysburg. We have to be able to create something here that enshrines this forever and that allows people to build on it and grow from it. 
And it's not going to happen if we just think about it in a very narrow way. How do you replace the offices? And how do you get the jobs? There is plenty of -- we can do all that. We've got to think about it from the point of view of a soaring, beautiful memorial. And then if we do that right, if we do that part right, then the economic development will just happen. And millions of people will come here. And you'll have all the economic development you want. And you can do the office space in a lot of different places. And I feel very, very strongly about this. And it is something I'm not going to forget and something I'm going to continue to speak up on because I feel I owe that in a very, very personal way. Thousands of people died there. And hundreds of them died as rescue workers. They didn't have to go there. They walked in to try to pull people out. Some of them are very close friends of mine. And some of them are very close friends of people that I love and care about and are related to the people that I love and I care about. . . .
So I think we have an obligation to the people who did die to make sure of two things about which there can be absolutely no compromise: Their families need to be protected just as if they had been alive, financially and in every other way that we can help and assist their families, there should be no compromise about that, ever; and second, this place has to be sanctified. This place has to become a place in which when anybody comes here, immediately they're going to feel the great power and strength and emotion of what it means to be an American. We have to do that and not worry about other things. Because this is too important a place. In their memory we have to do that. . . .

Tokyo Weighs Pouring More Public Money Into Banks

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
Japan's government, in a bid to stave off another banking crisis, said it was considering pumping public money into the nation's beleaguered lenders for the second time in three years.
 Taku Yamasaki, secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told Japanese reporters that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi supported using taxpayer money if needed to bail out the banks, which are sinking under at least 150 trillion yen ($1.1 trillion) of outstanding loans that are not being repaid. 
 Yasuo Fukuda, the chief cabinet secretary, and several other high-ranking government officials echoed that stance today in separate remarks.
Although investors have talked about the need for additional financing, the comments were the first direct acknowledgment by Mr. Koizumi's inner circle that Japan's banks cannot solve their own problems. With the economy mired in recession, the stock market trading near three-year lows and widespread deflation making it harder for companies to repay loans, Japan's four largest bank groups expect to lose 1.6 trillion yen ($12.15 billion) in the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2002. 
Making matters more difficult, the government will end its blanket guarantee on deposits in April next year and will instead limit deposit insurance to 10 million yen ($75,953) in each savings account. In anticipation, depositors are withdrawing money from smaller, weaker banks and moving it to safer institutions. The loss of deposits has driven several banks into bankruptcy.
On Friday, Ishikawa Bank, based in western Japan, filed papers with the Financial Services Agency to start bankruptcy proceedings, according to Kyodo News. Financial regulators and the bank refused to comment.
Though government officials offered no specifics on how much money they were prepared to inject into the banking system or which banks would be eligible for aid, they signaled an awareness that conditions in the industry will deteriorate further in the first quarter of 2002.
"We will not let an economic crisis occur in February or March, and to do this we will take emergency measures when necessary," Mr. Yamasaki said, referring to comments by the prime minister.
The government's tacit admission that the banks need more money to stay afloat comes three years after it funneled 7.5 trillion yen ($56.96 billion) into the country's 15 largest banks to help them meet international capital adequacy standards. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi has since repaid the aid it received; most others have not.
Although the biggest banks are still solvent as Japanese law defines it, investors and analysts say the economic downturn will expose even larger losses on the banks' balance sheets as more companies are forced into bankruptcy.
"Everyone knows this situation is coming sooner or later," said one banker at a major Japanese lender, referring to the need for another infusion of public money. "The question is really the timing."
Japanese bank shares on average lost 40 percent of their value in 2001, and are now trading at lows not seen since 1984. But the news that the government is mulling another bailout pushed them up 3.5 percent higher on Friday, the last day of trading for the year in Tokyo. The yen also got a lift from the reports, posting its largest gain in a month to settle at 131.24 yen to the dollar.
On the stock market, major gainers for the day included Mizuho Holding and UFJ Holding, two banking groups believed to be especially in need of aid because of their exposure to some of Japan's most troubled companies. The four major banking groups, including Mizuho and UFJ, have promised to write off $44 billion in nonperforming loans this fiscal year, but additional large-scale failures could drive that amount higher, analysts said.
The banks also face losses stemming from their stock portfolios, which have fallen in value along with the broader market and offer little scope for offsetting lending losses, as they commonly have done in the past. New accounting rules forcing the banks to carry stocks on their books at their current market value, not their original purchase price, have further eroded the portfolios' value. In all, the banks are likely to lose $25 billion on their stock holdings, according to bank analysts.
At the same time, the largest banking groups -- products of mergers planned two years ago -- are struggling to integrate their operations, another financial burden. Estimates of the amount of public money that will be needed to prop up the banks this time range from 5 trillion to 10 trillion yen ($39 billion to $78 billion).
Mr. Koizumi, who is pushing a program of government austerity and reduced regulation, has been reluctant to say that another bank bailout is needed. But the economic slump is forcing his hand.
On Thursday, the government said the country's unemployment rate, already at postwar highs, rose to 5.5 percent in November while consumer prices fell 0.8 percent. Reports earlier this week showed declines in industrial production, retail sales, home starts and construction orders.

PERSON: Edward G. Jordan 

HEADLINE: Edward Jordan, Chief of Conrail, Dies at 72 

BYLINE:  By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
Edward G. Jordan, who helped to lift the remnants of several railroad freight lines out of bankruptcy as the first chairman and chief executive of Conrail, died on Wednesday at his vacation home in Bend, Ore. He was 72.
 Mr. Jordan, who also had a home in the San Francisco area, had suffered from esophageal cancer, his family said. 
 A native of Oakland, Calif., Mr. Jordan graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1951 and earned a master's in business administration from Stanford University. He worked for several corporations, including the Ford Motor Company and Procter & Gamble.
He was a Los Angeles insurance executive when President Gerald R. Ford selected him in 1974 to be president of the United States Railway Association, the federal agency formed to develop a plan to take over most properties of ailing freight carriers in the Northeast and the Midwest.
After he had been president of the association for 17 months, its board picked him in mid-1975 to head the new line created by the association: the Consolidated Rail Corporation, known as Conrail. Although he had no experience with railroads, Mr. Jordan was confident he could do what earlier train executives could not. His credo was, the fewer managers, the better.
"One of the real problems with American industry, in large organizations such as the railroads," he said at the time, "is that you get such incredible depth in management that the nature of a real problem and the man dealing with it never gets to the decision maker."
But Mr. Jordan was battling more than management problems, however intractable they may have been; he was also up against the tide of history. For much of the 19th century, there were scores of thriving railroad freight lines. But by the middle of the 20th century, there were only six: the Penn Central, the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Erie Lackawanna, the Lehigh and Hudson River, the Lehigh Valley and the Reading.
Buffeted by competition from trucks using the Interstate highway system, hobbled by federal requirements to run money-losing passenger service, the six railroads deferred maintenance on trains and tracks. As their service deteriorated, more freight business went to the trucks in what seemed to be a death spiral for the rail lines.
One by one, the six lines entered bankruptcy in the early 1970's, weakening a national economy already in recession. The federal government responded by creating Conrail and appropriating money to rebuild tracks, locomotives and freight cars. Congress also loosened some regulations, making it easier for trains to compete with trucks, and created Amtrak to take over intercity passenger service from the freight railroads.
Mr. Jordan confidently predicted a quick turnaround, with engines in mint condition hauling more freight for more customers on smoother tracks. But despite his efforts to modernize the operation and bring costs under control, Conrail ran at a loss and was troubled by problems and complaints for many months. Mr. Jordan and other Conrail executives said that the equipment they had inherited was even worse than they had expected and that harsh winter weather and a prolonged coal strike had made things worse.
In 1980, after Conrail had finally recorded two consecutive profitable quarters, Mr. Jordan resigned. He was dean of the Cornell University business school for nine months, then for several years was president of the American College, in Bryn Mawr, Pa., which provides instruction to insurance and financial services professionals. He also sat on the boards of several corporations.
He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Nancy; two daughters, Susan Thomas of Accra, Ghana, and Kathryn Ragan of Fair Oaks, Calif.; two sons, Jonathan, of Rohnert Park, Calif., and Christopher, of Lake Oswego, Ore.; and 11 grandchildren.
In 1981, Conrail had its first profitable year and no longer required federal subsidies. On March 26, 1987, the government's 85 percent share of the corporation was sold to private investors for $1.65 billion, then the largest stock offering in Wall Street history, a transaction that completed one of the more successful federal bailouts. (The remaining 15 percent of the railroad was owned by concurrent and former Conrail employees.)
In 1997, Conrail was bought by the CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Corporation in a deal worth more than $10 billion.

HEADLINE: U.S. Arabs, Spurred On By Inquiry, Set Museum 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. 

 BODY:
The nation's first Arab-American museum will be built in a gutted and leaking furniture store in this city, known both as home to the Ford Motor Company and the most concentrated community of Arab-Americans. 
 Though the museum project has been under way for more than a year -- and will not be completed for several years -- the sense of purpose among its organizers has been elevated since Sept. 11. 
 "This is a real watershed event for us and we'd better try to capture it," said Ismael Ahmed, executive director of the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, known as Access. The group, which is organizing the museum, provides a host of social services to Arab-Americans in Dearborn and nearby Detroit. 
Mr. Ahmed says the domestic terror investigation and its focus on people of Arab descent should be reflected in the museum. That inquiry has included interviews with people here on recently issued visas from Middle Eastern countries. 
"We've moved from what was an investigation of a crime to creating a suspect class," Mr. Ahmed said. "I think we should start documenting this." 
There is time to mull over how to do that. Last year, Access bought the 36,000-square-foot, three-story building for $750,000, but it does not plan to open the museum until 2004, after an $8 million to $10 million fund-raising campaign. 
At present, the building is a dusty space littered with cabinets, woodpiles and a few fluorescent lights casting long pockets of shadow. Access has considered building the museum for years, but has always seen the immediate social services needs of immigrants as its top priority. 
"We realized that every 10 years we have a new wave of refugees so we can't keep putting it off," said Anan Ameri, the group's cultural director. "I'm just sorry that we weren't closer to opening by Sept. 11." 
Cultural officials from around the country met here recently for a planning session sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
One of the participants was Irene Hirano, the executive director of the Japanese-American National Museum in Los Angeles. She says that the Arab-American museum can serve as both a resource for the community itself and a window for other Americans. 
"It can be a positive byproduct of a terrible time," Ms. Hirano said. "Current events spotlight this as an important community that we need to know more about."
The Japanese-American museum was created largely through the efforts of both Japanese-American veterans of World War II and citizens who were put in internment camps. Both groups were interviewed when the museum was being developed in the 1980's and early 1990's. But these people were "looking back 50, 60 years and interpreting events they remembered," said Ms. Hirano, noting the Arab-American museum has a more immediate opportunity. 
"Recording the first-person perspective -- the fear, the uncertainty, the questions that are being asked of people -- I think the current feeling is that there is an important opportunity to capture that," she said. 
But how big a role Sept. 11 will play in the museum is unresolved. 
"When writing the history of a community in a museum, the question is whether to highlight these events or hide them, or say this is just part of what has happened to the community," said Michael Suleiman, a political science professor at Kansas State University. "My own preference is that there isn't too much politics, but you can't talk about a community and leave out the challenges."

OPEC to Cut Back Production By 6.5% for at Least 6 Months

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
Hoping to prevent the global economic slowdown from further eroding world oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries finalized an agreement today to cut back oil production by 6.5 percent, or 1.5 million barrels a day, for at least six months starting Jan. 1.
 The decision, made at an emergency meeting of OPEC ministers here, followed a pledge by non-OPEC oil producers -- principally Russia, Norway and Mexico -- to reduce their exports by 462,500 barrels a day. OPEC officials prompted the non-OPEC nations to act using barely veiled threats of a price war. 
 Oil prices had been rising in recent weeks in anticipation of the action by OPEC, and did not move much in reaction today: the benchmark price for crude fell slightly, to $20.41 a barrel. 
OPEC's total daily production is now scheduled to reach its lowest level in 10 years, but oil prices remain well below OPEC's target bands set in 1999 of around $24 to $31 a barrel, depending on grade. Informally, OPEC now hopes for prices in the $20 to $25 range.
"The first objective is to stop the fall," said Ali Rodriguez, OPEC's secretary general. "We'll see some recovery in coming days, but the main recovery will be in the second half of next year."
In the short term, oil experts do not expect OPEC's production cuts to have a significant impact on the cost of heating oil or gasoline at the pump in the United States. "I don't think this will cause a major spike in prices," said Thomas Bentz, senior energy analyst for BNP Paribas in New York. "Prices will go a little higher, but we're not looking at a major rally."
One immediate variable may be the winter weather in the United States, which so far has been mild. More significant, though, is the impact of the global economy on demand for oil.
"The demand situation is difficult," said John Kilduff, senior vice president at Fimat USA Inc., the commodities trading arm of Societe Generale. "With the United States, Japan and Germany in contraction, if not in recession, the forecast is for lower oil prices."
Having already met seven times this year, OPEC ministers today agreed to another conference, on March 15 in Vienna, to review the impact of the new cuts. Mr. Rodriguez refused to speculate on whether further cuts were likely then, although he noted that global demand for oil usually falls in the second quarter of every year.
Analysts said it remained to be seen how closely both OPEC and non-OPEC producers would comply with the announced cutbacks. "Compliance by OPEC members is voluntary," Mr. Rodriguez said. "It's a question of honor for countries. Sometimes, for different reasons, compliance is not satisfactory. But we have a mechanism for monitoring the situation."
The Saudi Arabian oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said he preferred not to cast doubts on the response of other producers. "I think it is much more important to focus on what the leaders of these countries have said, and that's enough indication that they are serious," he said.
OPEC has already cut its production by 3.5 million barrels a day this year, but oil experts believe its members are now producing at least 600,000 barrels a day over quotas, half of that from Nigeria alone.
"OPEC needs to cut 1.5 million, plus the 600,000," said Leonidas Drollas of the London-based Center for Global Energy Studies, referring to the overage. "That is a huge cut that we will never see. So we at the center think we'll get a maximum of one million from OPEC and token amounts from the non-OPEC producers. That will push prices up, but only slowly."
The new agreement, which fixes OPEC's output at 21.7 million barrels a day, came in response to a further slowdown in the world economy after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "If we maintain current production," Mr. Rodriguez said today, "we can suffer a collapse of prices, for example, to $8 to $10 levels, and this would present very serious problems for producers and consumers alike."
Meeting in Vienna last month, OPEC said it would cut its own production only if non-OPEC members agreed to reduce their exports by 500,000 barrels a day. After lengthy negotiations, Russia and Norway agreed to cuts of 150,000 barrels a day each; Mexico by 100,000 barrels; Oman by 40,000 barrels; and Angola by 22,500 barrels. OPEC decided to go ahead even though those promises fell short of the 500,000-barrel goal.
"It took a lot of effort to obtain cooperation from non-OPEC countries," said the Algerian energy and mines minister, Chakib Khelil, who holds the rotating presidency of OPEC through Dec. 31. "It was a long process that will have a very important effect on price stability."
Analysts remain skeptical that Russia will comply fully with its pledge. Russia's initial response to OPEC's request for a 200,000-barrel-a-day cut was a counteroffer of just 30,000. After a war of words with Saudi Arabia, it eventually agreed to a cut of 150,000 barrels a day for three months. But Russia is continuing a major push to find new markets for its oil exports.
"The Russian government has given its word, but the Russian companies are now privatized and have no incentive to cut production," Mr. Drollas said. "They have made investments and, by cutting production, they will not recover their investment. They can promise a cut in exports, but exports are always down at this time of the year because of high domestic demand."
Mr. Rodriguez said he would travel to Moscow early next year to try to reinforce Russia's commitment.
Stable oil prices are in everyone's interest, he said. "For many industrialized nations, the revenue from oil taxation is a major part of their budgets," he said. "Oil is not just a question of the stability of oil producers."
Even a modest rise in prices, though, would impede global economic recovery, some analysts believe. "I think Mexico, Norway and even Russia see the benefits of lower prices for the world economy in the short run," Mr. Kilduff said. "But for OPEC producers, a drop in oil revenue hurts them. Venezuela and some Middle East governments are in trouble and are interested in higher prices."
Mr. Drollas was more pessimistic. "Prices will rise, but there will be repercussions," he said, "because it will make the world economy grow at a slower rate, it will destabilize oil prices and encourage non-OPEC countries to push up production. OPEC countries are harming themselves in the mid term, but they only care about the short term."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
A Rise in Consumer Confidence Helps to Push Up Shares

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
As it approached the end of its second consecutive down year, Wall Street remained positive yesterday as stocks managed some slim gains in response to positive economic news and managed to offset some typical year-end tax selling.
 The Dow Jones industrial average also reached its highest level since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
 The market got a big lift when the Conference Board reported its consumer confidence index rose to 93.7 from 84.9 in November. Meanwhile, sales of new homes soared 6.4 percent in November, the largest increase in nearly a year, according to the Commerce Department. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.68 points, to close at 10,136.99. It was the Dow's best close since the terrorist attacks, which caused the blue chips to drop to a yearly low of 8,235.81 on Sept. 21. The Dow also has gained 95 points in the previous two sessions.
The broader market was also higher. The Nasdaq composite index gained 10.84 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,987.26, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.89 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,161.02.
Investors were also heartened by a report on orders of durable goods. Although orders to the nation's factories fell 4.8 percent in November, mainly because of a big drop in demand for military airplanes, demand rose for many other big-ticket items, including computers, cars and industrial machinery.
"To me, the market's responding to the fundamentals," said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. "There's been some positive earnings news, some positive guidance, and today you had a nice jump in consumer confidence. That's all good for stocks."
While the market's mood was upbeat, some investors sold stocks to take tax losses for 2001, a yearly occurrence and particularly predictable in years when the market falls.
"You are down to the crunch time of those who are left to take some tax losses," said Matt Brown, head of equity management at Wilmington Trust. "It makes sense for taxable investors, and when you have had back-to-back down years, you have to expect some year-end tax-loss selling."
Yesterday's gainers were mostly concentrated in technology sectors, which many investors expect will lead the market higher next year. Broadcom rose 95 cents, to $43, while PMC-Sierra gained 93 cents, to $22.78.
Yahoo climbed 53 cents, to $18.30, on a fourth-quarter revenue upgrade by a Merrill Lynch analyst, Henry Blodget. Mr. Blodget estimated the Internet portal would post revenue of $175 million, above Wall Street's forecast of $168 million.
Blue chips were more mixed. American Express rose $1.05, to $36.05, but Procter & Gamble fell 64 cents, to $79.51. General Motors gained 95 cents, to $48.92, while Coca-Cola declined 77 cents, to $47.17.
Oil stocks were slightly higher after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed that it would slash 1.5 million barrels a day from its daily crude production to firm up sagging oil prices. The cuts, a 6 percent reduction, will begin Jan. 1, and last at least six months. Conoco rose 13 cents, to $28.38, while ChevronTexaco also gained 13 cents, to close at $90.44.
Another reason for yesterday's gains was the so-called Santa Claus rally, an annual occurrence between Christmas and New Year's when stocks move higher as investors grow hopeful about the year ahead and money managers adjust portfolios, picking up stocks that have reached bargain prices.
With one more trading session left in 2001, the major indexes are still showing significant losses for the year. The Dow is off 6.02 percent, while the S.& P. 500 is down 12.06 percent. The Nasdaq, which skidded early in the year on the continuing shake-out in high-technology companies, is off 19.56 percent.
Treasury bond prices slipped yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32 , to a price of 99 8/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.10 percent from 5.08 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 30/32 , to 97 22/32 . The bond's yield rose to 5.54 percent from 5.48 percent.

HEADLINE: Positive Reports Hint at Swift Recovery 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
A flurry of unexpectedly positive reports hinted yesterday that the economy might make a swift exit from recession.
 The latest figures on home sales, consumer confidence, orders for durable goods and claims for unemployment benefits all came in better than anticipated. Despite the pleasant surprises, economists still warned of a feeble recovery next year. 
 Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, made its biggest one-month surge in almost four years. The business group's index, which is based on consumers' satisfaction with business and employment conditions, jumped to 93.7 in December, from a revised level of 84.9 last month. The reading suggests that consumers are almost as confident as they were in August. 
Analysts from several Wall Street research groups had forecast a decline in consumer confidence rather than a gain. Kevin Logan, the senior United States economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, credited the rise to Americans' resilience from the terrorist attacks.
"There was a lot of fear that the shock could cause consumers to go into hibernation" and the recession would deepen, he said. "The shock of Sept. 11 and all those events seems to have faded more quickly than any of us thought a short time ago."
Consumers may also have begun to feel more secure about their jobs. First-time claims for unemployment benefits rose by only 7,000 last week, just half of Wall Street's consensus prediction, to 392,000, the Labor Department said. New weekly claims have dropped by more than 100,000 from their peak in October, though 3.7 million people are still receiving benefits.
Plenty of consumers were buying houses last month. Sales of existing homes rose 0.6 percent in November, to an annual pace of 5.21 million units from a revised 5.18 million rate in October, the National Association of Realtors said. New home sales jumped 6.4 percent in November, the Commerce Department reported.
Behind the uptick were good weather and low mortgage rates. Thirty-year mortgage rates fell to 6.45 percent early last month, according to a survey by Freddie Mac.
The figures for new home sales were the most notable, said Robert E. Mellman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, because new houses represent "real activity in the economy."
The Commerce Department's report of a 1.1 percent increase in orders for durable goods, excluding transportation items, also impressed Mr. Mellman. "In the durable goods reports, it really looked like core capital goods were stabilizing, and high-tech orders were stronger than they were three months ago, which we took to be pretty significant," he said.
The durable goods report, excluding transportation, followed an increase of 2.9 percent in October, the first back-to-back gains in almost two years. But overall orders fell 4.8 percent in November.
Both Mr. Logan and Mr. Mellman said they still expected the economy to expand at a slow pace next year, perhaps only 2 percent. Economic growth can come from spending by households, companies and the government or from improving the nation's trade balance. Yet none of these areas look particularly strong, Mr. Logan said.
"The recession was pretty much caused by a very sharp drop in business investment spending," Mr. Logan said. "Given that the last two months have seen a pickup in orders for capital goods, that suggests that we might be coming to the end of that process." But although businesses' spending will stabilize, Mr. Logan said, investment is unlikely to reach the levels of the late 1990's.
Do not look to consumers for extraordinary buying, either, Mr. Mellman said. Consumer spending has remained fairly strong all year, he said, and he predicted it would probably not rise enough to ensure a strong recovery.
After previous recessions, he recalled, the economy grew by 5 or 6 percent -- well above average -- in the first two years of recovery. "Usually that was because consumer spending on durable goods and autos got clobbered, and they came back at double-digit strength." This time, Mr. Mellman said, "they haven't got clobbered, so they can't come back."
Though military purchasing has been higher than anticipated because of the war in Afghanistan, the Republican-controlled House has refused to include much new spending in any economic stimulus package.
The trade balance faces perhaps the worst prognosis. "The rest of the world is in recession, or at least growing at a sub-par rate," Mr. Logan said. "Exports are likely to be very weak."
Adding to the problem, the dollar has lately shown unusual strength against Japan's currency. Its value has risen steadily, to 131.24 yen from 116 yen, in the last three months. Last year, when the rate averaged 108 yen, Japan exported $2 worth of goods to the United States for every $1 it imported from America. The change in the exchange rate is likely to worsen the ratio.
A rebound in oil prices, which usually shows up as an increase in imports, may also be on the horizon. Yesterday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed a production cut of 1.5 million barrels a day, and other major producers said they would also curtail production.
"They're looking to stabilize prices," said Ann-Louise Hittle, senior director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "If that's their goal, then they will achieve it."
But Ms. Hittle added that prices were unlikely to rise enough to do the economy much harm. She said that West Texas Intermediate crude oil, an industry benchmark, would probably sell for $21 a barrel in the next few months. "That would not have a large depressing effect on the economy, because that's still lower than where we were for almost all of 2001," she said.
Moreover, Mr. Logan said, it's never too early to get excited about promising numbers. "The data's always telling you something about the direction of the economy at the margin," he said. "Even if it's minor changes, it's giving you some sign."

Dow Reaches Highest Point Since Sept. 11 Attacks
With only one more trading session left in 2001, the Dow Jones industrial average finished at its highest level since the terrorist attacks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.68 points, to close at 10,136.99 -- the Dow's best close since the terror attacks, which caused the blue chips to drop to a yearly low of 8,235.81 on Sept. 21.
 The broader market was also higher. The Nasdaq composite index gained 10.84 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,987.26, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.89 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,161.02. Share prices rose in response to some hopeful signs on the economy, including a big increase in consumer confidence last month. Also, sales of new homes soared 6.4 percent in November, the largest increase in nearly a year, according to the Commerce Department. C4. 

TV Forms Bond With Bereaved
A handful of people whose loved ones were killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have been drawn into a mutually beneficial relationship with television, feeding the 24-hour news networks' need for fresh material about the attacks and their need to keep the coverage focused on the victims and their families. B1 .

N.Y. Lures Different Type of Tourist
Those who market New York City as a tourist destination are facing a new sort of visitor: those here mostly, sometimes only, to view the ruins of the World Trade Center. These more somber tourists are in little mood to spend, and the city does not want to market itself around the tragedy. B1.

Xerox Receives Additional Money
Xerox said it had received $340 million in financing from GE Capital, secured by part of the company's receivables. The funds are in addition to the $835 million Xerox received last month from GE Capital, with more financing expected in February. C4.

Japan May Help Banks, Again
The government of Japan said that it was considering injecting more cash into the banking system to help it address its burden of bad debt, which totals $1 trillion. The comments, by Taku Yamasaki, secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, were the first direct acknowledgment from Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's inner circle that the industry cannot solve its problems alone. C3.

Deutsche Bank to Cut 2,100 Jobs
Deutsche Bank said that it would eliminate 2,100 jobs in its corporate and investment-banking unit, part of a 10 percent reduction in jobs this year. About 900 workers in the United States would be laid off. C3.

French Unemployment Reaches 9%
Joblessness in France rose 0.1 percent, to 9 percent last month, the seventh consecutive monthly rise, the government said. The finance minister, Laurent Fabius, said France was facing the effects of the slowing economies of Germany, Japan and the United States. C2.

Ernst & Young Settles Investor Suit
Ernst & Young's Bermuda affiliate has settled with investors who brought a $400 million suit against Manhattan Investment Fund Ltd., Michael Berger's bankrupt hedge fund. C3.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: TOURISM; 
Pilgrimage to New York City: Paying Respects and Spending Little

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
Those who market New York City to tourists face a delicate problem. The city is desperate to attract visitors to spend money, especially downtown, where businesses have been suffering since the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. But the biggest tourist attraction downtown, and probably in the city, is the site of that attack. And the thousands of people who visit it every day are proving to be tourists of a sort that the city has never seen before.
 "It's a sad tourist," explained Rachelle Friedman, co-owner of J & R Music and Computer World, across Broadway on Park Row not far from the disaster site. "It's not the same kind of tourist at all." 
 They are not exactly happy to be here, and many say they are not interested in splurging on shopping and entertainment for themselves -- especially within blocks of such an unnerving landscape. 
Officials in the tourism industry are unnerved, too. They know the disaster site is the sole reason many of these people visit New York, but they dare not market the city that way. Advertisers are squeamish about making pitches to the growing numbers of tourists at ground zero, urging them to spend money once they are here. Many businesses are reluctant to be seen as profiting from the tourists' presence, and, indirectly, the tragedy of the terrorist attack.
Granted, even the thriftiest visitors need to eat and sleep, so they must be spending money somewhere in the city. But businesses near the site say they have seen no big increases in sales, and tourism officials are convinced that the ground zero tourists represent an untapped market.
Apart from estimates, it is unclear how large this market is. Hard figures are hard to come by, because there is no entry point to the area around ground zero in which to count visitors. There are no turnstiles, tour guides or information booths. 
The closest thing might be St. Paul's Chapel, where Trevor Bleedorn, a volunteer, hands out colored markers to people who want to sign memorial sheets hung along a stretch of Broadway. He estimates that he talks to 2,000 people a day, and that thousands more pass by silently.
The perimeter snakes a jagged path around 16 acres. Because of the sprawling nature of the site, keeping an official tally of visitors would be impossible, according to the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, the New York City Police Department and NYC & Company, the city's tourist and convention bureau.
Simply put, "they're coming in from too many different directions," said Cristyne L. Nicholas, the president of NYC & Company.
Some officials guess that to date, millions of people have visited the site, and they say there is enough anecdotal evidence to support the claim. The World Trade Center towers were the top tourist destination downtown before the attack, and Ms. Nicholas and others say the place where they fell retains that status.
"I would venture to say that would be the case," she said, "even without having any way of counting the people."
All it takes is a look at the throngs who gather around the perimeter every day -- often to the dismay of residents trying to put their lives back together. People spill off the sidewalks and into the street. There are church groups in matching jackets, and families who show up with grandparents, cousins and toddlers. And always, there are the individuals, standing alone, crying, thinking, filming. Moving quickly through the main gathering spots on Broadway is close to impossible.
For Lower Manhattan businesses with sales down as much as 30 percent from what is normal for this time of year, the opportunity to reach such an untapped market might seem irresistible. Still, many have resisted. 
David Morrow, the assistant general manager of the South Street Seaport, has not seen sales completely rebound since the attacks. But he agreed that reaching out to the ground zero tourists would be in bad taste. It is as if they are close, but untouchable. 
"I'm not sure we've seen much activity from them," he said, "not that we expect to or want to try to. We respect very much that they're here to offer condolences."
Businesses directly on the path to ground zero have not fared much better.
Mitchell Graber, the manager of Edwardo Galleries Ltd., a store on Broadway near Beekman Street that sells figurines, sees the crowds of people passing, cameras around their necks, guidebooks in hand, "but they keep passing," he said. "They don't stop and buy anything."
Even among some businesses, like tour organizers, that have stood to gain from the upswing in visits to ground zero, there has been a tendency to shy away from profiteering.
"I have trouble with the idea of making money off the tragedy," said John Pascale, the owner of NYC Tours, who added that he had refused most requests for organized excursions exclusively to ground zero. He does, however, include the site as part of a standard tour of downtown. 
"Initially I was weirded out when people started requesting to see it at all," he said. "I thought it was sort of gross. But I have been overwhelmed by people's reverence and respect for the site. Certainly it is now part of the city's history and I need to show it, just like Grant's Tomb. In that way I think we have a responsibility, but only in the context of a tour of the city. I also think people need to see the rest of the city coping and surviving." 
The city continues to cry out for tourists to fill theaters and restaurants in nationwide commercials and campaigns, but the disaster site -- despite its popularity -- is not something anyone will see used in that effort, at least for now.
"It's not appropriate; it's still too tender a situation to discuss in terms of marketing," Ms. Nicholas said. "I think the natural course is that people will flock down there to ground zero. That's a bold leap then to market it. I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that."
In an unlikely twist, the owners of some small businesses in the area have actually begun to complain about the high number of tourists.
"This whole area is getting too much attention," said David Cohen, who owns Chelsea Jeans, a clothing store on Broadway near the corner of Fulton Street. A glass-enclosed corner of the store offers a grim reminder of Sept. 11, preserving stacks of clothing covered in ash and debris. "My manager complains about the tourists because they block the store and customers find it hard to get access. The tourists, they look, take a picture and leave."
Then Mr. Cohen sighed. "We're learning to adapt." 
Tourists roaming through residential streets, mainly in Battery Park City, angling for the best view, have drawn the ire of many residents, who view them as intruders.
The number of ground zero tourists in Battery Park City became an issue in the design and placement of a temporary pedestrian bridge crossing West Street in the neighborhood. Residents were concerned that if it offered too good a view, it would serve less as pedestrian bridge than as a viewing platform.
"It's a big issue, and many people are concerned because tourists make it very hard for the community to function as a living community, especially for children," said Jane Bock, a lawyer who lives in Battery Park City. "Many people would like the tourists and viewing stands to stay in commercial areas. I think there must be a solution that fits everyone's needs."
For now, the city's attempt at giving structure and organization to the crowds at ground zero is in the form of four proposed viewing platforms around the disaster site.
The first temporary structure is on Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, just south of St. Paul's Chapel, which may open to the public as early as today. The entire structure will support more than 1,000 visitors at a time.
The platforms will make it easier to see what is going on at the site and to take pictures as the work moves deep into the ground. Without the height the platforms offer, it is hard to see anything. But people take pictures anyway.
"I feel like it's disrespectful, like I shouldn't be taking pictures," said Megan Coffey, a former New Yorker who now lives in St. Louis. She was visiting the site on Christmas Eve with her husband, Sean, wondering if she should "just absorb" it. 
"I don't want to treat it like it's a tourist site," she said, pausing to think, looking around, "but I guess that's what it is."

HEADLINE: At Odds With Harvard President, Black-Studies Stars Eye Princeton 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 28 

 BODY:
The academic stars of Harvard's Afro-American Studies department are considering leaving for rival Princeton, in an open challenge to the new president of Harvard University, Lawrence H. Summers. 
 Princeton is seeking to lure the professors, including Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Cornel West, in hopes of building an instant department that might rival Harvard's in its popular and scholarly appeal, officials at both universities said. Speaking mostly through surrogates, the professors say they have been willing to consider leaving because Mr. Summers, a treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, has yet to speak out forcefully enough in favor of affirmative action and diversity. 
 But people close to the professors and to Mr. Summers say the critical moment was a private meeting between Dr. West and Mr. Summers in October. 
At that meeting, first described over the weekend in The Boston Globe, the Harvard president suggested that Dr. West embark on a new work of serious scholarship befitting his elite designation by Harvard as one of only 14 University Professors. In recent years, Dr. West, a noted author, has recorded a rap CD and been an adviser on Bill Bradley's presidential campaign. 
Mr. Summers also encouraged Dr. West, whose classes draw hundreds of students, to become a leader in tamping down grade inflation at Harvard, where one of every two grades awarded in recent years has been an A or A-. Mr. Summers has had similar conversation with other professors, his aides said. 
In what an aide to Mr. Summers characterized as a "terrible misunderstanding," Dr. West walked away insulted, and inclined to consider a formal offer that had been made more than a year ago by Princeton, where Dr. West taught before being lured by Dr. Gates to Harvard in 1994. 
In an interview here today at his official residence, Mr. Summers declined to provide any details of his meeting with Dr. West, but challenged the contention that he had not publicly declared his energetic support for a diverse Harvard community since being named the institution's 27th president in March. 
Mr. Summers referred to his inaugural address, delivered on Oct. 12, in which he said: "A century ago this was an institution where New England gentlemen taught other New England gentlemen. Today, Harvard is open to men and women of all faiths, all races, all classes, all states, all nations. As a result, we offer a better education to better students who make us a better university."
But Charles J. Ogletree, a professor at Harvard Law School who is representing Dr. West in his dealings with the university, said Mr. Summers had not gone far enough.
"It's absolutely critical that the president make an unequivocal public statement in support of affirmative action," Mr. Ogletree said. "That would be encouraging for those scholars who came to Harvard and were recruited because this was going to be the premier institution of black intellectual inquiry."
In the interview, Mr. Summers said he had met privately with Dr. West just after the professor had returned from a one-year leave that he had taken for personal reasons. In recent days, Dr. West, 48, has requested and received another leave, effective immediately, to prepare for and recuperate from treatment for prostate cancer, officials said.
Dr. West's standing offer to return to Princeton was extended again as recently as Oct. 14, when Shirley M. Tilghman, the new president of Princeton, spoke briefly with him at the inauguration of Ruth J. Simmons as president of Brown University. 
In addition to pursuing Dr. West, Princeton is seeking to hire others in the 16-member Harvard department, including Dr. Gates, who is its chairman and a specialist in African-American literary criticism and history, and Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosopher. 
Neil Rudenstine, Mr. Summers's predecessor, had laid the groundwork for creating the powerhouse department by hiring Dr. Gates away from Duke University in 1991. Among others Dr. Gates later hired or helped to hire were Dr. West; Dr. Appiah; the sociologist William Julius Wilson; and the legal scholar Lani Guinier.
Dr. Gates did not respond to telephone messages left for him today at home and at his office, as well as via e-mail, but a person close to both him and Dr. West said Dr. Gates would be unlikely to remain at Harvard if Dr. West departed. Dr. Gates, who has been contacted by Princeton representatives, a person familiar with the recruitment effort said, would consider following his colleague there. Efforts to reach Dr. Appiah today through his office, which was closed, were not successful.
Marilyn Marks, a spokeswoman for President Tilghman of Princeton, said that the effort to lure scholars of the caliber of Dr. West and his colleagues was part of a wider effort by the university, which is weighing whether to expand its African-American studies program into a full department that would award bachelor's degrees, as Harvard's does. 
"Obviously, these are very well-known scholars who are very distinguished in their discipline," Ms. Marks said. "Anyone would want them."
That a university, like a professional sports team, would seek to raid the locker room of a competitor is hardly unusual. Nor is it unusual for professors who are being pursued by a rival institution to seek to use that interest as leverage with their current employer. 
Still, Mr. Summers of Harvard said he was taking the challenge seriously and would rise to it. 
"We are proud of the Afro-American Studies program at Harvard, collectively and individually," Mr. Summers said. "We would very much like to see them stay at Harvard and will compete vigorously to make this an attractive environment."

HEADLINE: A Nose for Opportunity; 
Air Travelers' Safety Fears Are Boon for Charter Company

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
There have been many stories of business misfortune in this postdisaster New York: companies that have been displaced, or shuttered as the recession looms and pocketbooks tighten. 
 This would not be one of them. 
 Todd M. Rome II, the owner of Blue Star Jets, a private plane charter company, does not try to hide the fact that he is taking advantage of some of the fears that came out of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
Indeed, Mr. Rome has been marketing his company as the safe and secure alternative to commercial airlines since the weekend after the attacks, joining private security firms, military supply stores and lawyers who prepare wills as some of the businesses benefiting from New Yorkers' fears. 
One thing that makes Mr. Rome's success so intriguing is that before the attacks, his business had all the makings of a start-up failure -- not to mention that, while it promises safety and security, Mr. Rome is a blunt-speaking founder with an interesting past.
Now, Mr. Rome says, Blue Star is flooded with requests from corporate executives, wealthy families and others looking for the sense of control and security that comes with being able to fly privately.
Mr. Rome's claims cannot be independently verified, but the National Business Aviation Association, a trade group for private jet owners, says that charter company sales are up by as much as 10 percent since Sept. 11.
The subtext of Mr. Rome's business model is not subtle. "When you are flying with your family and your loved ones," he says, giving a carefully honed sales pitch, "there is very little more important than security. If you are not willing to pay the price, well then, who knows what could happen?"
His principle is where there is a fear, American capitalism will find a way for profits. 
And how is he going to guarantee his clients' safety? Is this just another smooth talker? Maybe, but Mr. Rome does not hesitate to point out to clients that he has hired as his security chief a former official at the Israeli airline El Al, which has the best safety record of any airline in the world (he declines to name the official for security reasons). He will put bodyguards on the plane if that makes his clients feel better. And secrecy is a key, he points out.
All information, he says, including times, locations and customers' identities, are kept secret. 
"Nobody will know who's in the air and when you are leaving but my staff," Mr. Rome explains to a client who is paying $23,284 -- not including catering -- to fly 14 friends and family members from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to Los Angeles. "We strive to be the best not only in our prices, but also in our safety measures."
Mr. Rome says he does his best to give customers a sense of control. Safety records? He gives customers his pilots' Federal Aviation Administration dossiers and other flight records, as well as the safety record for the plane. Background checks? Each passenger must be cleared by private detectives. Searches? Every bag can be searched by hand at the request of the client or pilot.
"People want to have control, and I give it to them," Mr. Rome says.
Mr. Rome, 32, says he is a former Wall Street trader. He avoids questions that divulge detail by repeating statements that do not answer them.
"Where did you work before this?" he is asked.
"On Wall Street," he says.
"Where on Wall Street?"
"On Wall Street."
Mr. Rome has reason to be discreet about his past. In April 2000, during the dot-com boom, N.A.S.D. Regulation Inc., a subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers, filed a complaint against Mr. Rome and a Manhattan company where he was the president, the Millennium Securities Corporation. Mr. Rome and the company were accused of fraud and illegal manipulation of the initial public offering of stock for a company that it was underwriting, Translation Group, a company in Haddonfield, N.J., which offered software to translate text in different languages.
N.A.S.D. officials said that Mr. Rome and others at Millennium illegally made more than $5 million from their handling of the public offering.
Mr. Rome denied the charges. In May 2000, without admitting liability, Mr. Rome and his colleagues signed a settlement in which the firm promised to leave N.A.S.D., not do business with any of its members for two years and Mr. Rome had to pay a $100,000 fine. Mr. Rome says that the Translation Group initial public offering, which was in 1996, has no bearing on his present business.
In March of this year, Mr. Rome incorporated Blue Star, which he operates from an Upper East Side office less than a minute away from the apartment he shares with his wife, Carol, and their two daughters.
The business, he admits, was not doing well when the economy began to weaken over the summer. Then came Sept. 11. Suddenly, well-heeled families started doing the same thing chief executives, athletes and music stars had been doing for decades: renting their own planes.
Mr. Rome says the first calls came from people who had been stranded after the attacks by the F.A.A. decision to shut down the commercial airlines. Charter jet operators were back up in the air several days before the commercial airlines.
Then, as Congress and President Bush debated airline security, Mr. Rome says calls began pouring in from people wanting to fly. 
Federal data shows that the nation's private jets are just as safe as airlines. But critics note that charter companies that use private terminals are not required to run passengers through metal detectors or have their baggage scanned, a point that airlines say makes companies like Mr. Rome's more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.
Also, established charter companies say that start-ups like Blue Star cannot offer the same menu of options because they do not own their own fleets and must get in line to lease planes from others.
Blue Star customers say that while Mr. Rome can generally get access to a plane at most airports in the United States, it is not always the size they need. Mr. Rome says he has access to 1,400 planes, ranging from a 737 that can carry nearly 300 people to an eight-seat Bombardier Learjet that can go for less than $1,500 an hour. 
Heavy jets, like the Bombardier Challenger 604 or the Gulfstream IV, can take 14 passengers to Los Angeles from New York for about $21,000. Lighter planes, like the Learjet 31A/ 35, carry seven and cost under $2,000 an hour.
Blue Star offers candy, snacks and coloring books for children free of charge. King crab, caviar, French wine and other items come for an extra fee.
Mr. Rome says that some of his recent clients included a family of five that paid $6,000 and made a round-trip flight between MacArthur Airport on Long Island and Montreal. Two families coming from Los Angeles -- with 14 people total -- picked up a student at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, and then flew to New York for Thanksgiving.
Looking ahead, Mr. Rome says he is preparing for a time when fear of flying is no longer the main motivator for his customers. His plan of attack is to sell people on the fear of waiting. 
"I'll take you there faster, with less waiting on the ground on both ends and closer to your destination," Mr. Rome says.
He is already preparing to pitch to college students who want to make winter ski trips to Vermont. He is offering a special on that seven-passenger Learjet: about $1,800 an hour.

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Unemployment in France rose 0.1 percentage point to 9 percent in November, the seventh consecutive monthly increase, the government said. 
The number of jobless people rose by 33,000 from October's levels to slightly more than 2.2 million, the Labor Ministry said. Joblessness stood at 8.9 percent in October. France's unemployment rate had declined steadily from 1997 to early 2001, before the trend began to reverse. Unemployment was at 9.1 percent a year ago in November. The finance minister, Laurent Fabius, said he is "not surprised" by the rise from October to November, saying France faces the effects of economic downturn in Germany, Japan and the United States.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL; 
These Budget Caps Can Fit All Sizes

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Records, everyone knows, are meant to be broken. Policies, as the Oakland A's learned to their regret with Jason Giambi and his request for a no-trade clause, are meant to be broken. Baseball budgets? Now that's an interesting question.
 The Mets have budgeted $95 million for their 2002 payroll. With the acquisition of Mo Vaughn, they say they are at about $93 million. Simple subtraction suggests they don't have enough room to add Juan Gonzalez. 
 But fans seem to expect the Mets to sign Gonzalez, a free agent, anyway. Damn the budget, full speed ahead.
Fred Wilpon, one of the Mets' co-owners, was not in the city, or the country, yesterday to discuss the team's payroll. However, whenever he has been asked in the past about exceeding the payroll limit he has set, he has said that if his general manager wants to do that, he need only to make his case and the owner will say yes or no.
That has been in the past. This is the present, and there is a theory, or a suspicion, among some on the players' side of the labor tracks that this winter clubs will not be permitted to exceed their budgets. They suggest that the clubs have created a payroll cap that is cleverly disguised and virtually impossible to prove.
(A moment's digression: salary cap is the popular term used in sports economics, but it is a misnomer. No sport has placed or wants to place a cap on anyone's salary; it's a cap on payrolls, the collection of players' salaries.)
Management officials and lawyers have not been asked about this theory because their denial is a foregone and understandable conclusion. The owners and their lawyers scoffed at the idea that they were acting in collusion against free agents in the latter half of the 1980's, but two arbitrators found them guilty. To this day, Fay Vincent, the former commissioner, on whose watch collusion did not occur, is the only management person who uttered the words collusion and guilty in the same sentence.
The conspiracy theorists on the players' side believe that the clubs set their payroll budgets and reported them to central baseball with the knowledge that they could not exceed them once they were established. The budget trick was linked, in their minds, to an owners meeting in Chicago on Nov. 27 at which two of baseball's bankers appeared and put the fear of Dudley Debt in them.
Baseball teams have had the ability to make loans at extremely favorable, below-market rates. But the bankers, at Commissioner Bud Selig's invitation, told the owners in no uncertain terms that they had to get their finances in order so they could be the beneficiaries of the loan mechanism. That includes, the theory goes, sticking to a budget.
That practice can be called fiscal responsibility, but if the theorists are correct, it can also be called collusion, subject to treble damages under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
The suspicious minded have arrived at their view by watching and experiencing the free-agent market. It has been a repressed market. Just ask Gonzalez, Barry Bonds, Aaron Sele, Moises Alou or Bret Boone.
Again, the owners can make the case that they have come to their senses and are not going to throw tons of dollars at players, but are they all really capable of such enlightened behavior?
Bonds has already been forced to remain in San Francisco, whether he wanted to or not, because no market developed for him. Gonzalez does not appear to have much of a selection either. That is apparently why he has suddenly developed an infatuation with the Mets. The Mets? Gonzalez very likely doesn't even know where Shea Stadium is.
A supposedly close friend of Gonzalez -- could his name be Jeff Moorad, the outfielder's agent? -- was quoted in The Star-Ledger of Newark yesterday as saying, "Juan has never wanted anything more in his life than he wants this -- to play with the Mets."
A wise man would make a wager that two months ago Gonzalez wanted to play for the Mets as fervently as Alex Rodriguez 14 months ago wanted to play for the Texas Rangers. So far the Mets have not fallen for the Gonzalez flirtation. Steve Phillips, the general manager, said Thursday night it continued to be "very unlikely" that they would sign Gonzalez. Yesterday he continued to say it was more likely that the Mets would add an outfielder in a trade.
"We're in a position now with acquiring Mo that we can wait and play it out a bit and let it come to us," Phillips said, discussing the possibility of a trade.
But couldn't that also be Phillips's strategy in secretly coveting Gonzalez? Let him sweat out the barren market and yearn for the Mets so avidly that he will greatly reduce his asking price?
Gonzalez and Vaughn have the same agent. That has not been too evident, has it, in Vaughn's campaign for the Mets to sign Gonzalez. Vaughn had not been a member of the team for 24 hours, and he had already twice thumped the tub for his stablemate.
"This is just a tremendous opportunity for everyone involved," Vaughn said yesterday of Gonzalez's availability. "This is unbelievable." He also said: "Jeff and Steve are working on another piece, too. I don't think it's done yet." Vaughn was either pumping up the idea of signing Gonzalez, or he knew something that Phillips had not disclosed.
Whichever, if the conspiracy theorists are right about the budget cap, the Mets will have to shed a salary or two to be able to hire Gonzalez. Todd Zeile's $6 million would do nicely as a starter, but for the Mets to move Zeile, their new utility man, Vaughn may have to help Phillips as he has been trying to help his agent.

HEADLINE: Key to Russia's Future 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman is right ("Russia's Last Line," column, Dec. 23). The key to Russia's future security is in the rapid development of the country's economy and its integration into the trade and investment order of Europe, the United States and other open societies. 
 The fastest way to reach this goal is not through continued state control over the means of production but by encouraging the middle class's entrepreneurial energies and by motivating the oligarchs to create added value out of their privatized assets. 
 President Vladimir V. Putin has started to put in place the necessary legal and tax reforms that will provide the foundation. As the Russian economy continues to grow, it will help provide Russia with the resources to finance the social and security needs of its people.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Adds Six To His Team 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg announced another bevy of appointments yesterday, including Daniel L. Doctoroff, who headed the effort to bring the 2012 Olympics to New York, as deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding.
 Mr. Bloomberg also named Verna Eggleston, a campaign consultant whose appearance in a Bloomberg advertisement caused a spat in the mayoral race, as commissioner of the Human Resources Administration. And he appointed Gretchen Dykstra, who was president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs. 
 As deputy mayor for economic development, Mr. Doctoroff will oversee the city's economic policies and will be responsible for coordinating efforts to attract, retain and expand businesses. He said yesterday that he would step down from his position as president of NYC2012, a nonprofit group authorized by the city to compete for the Games, but would continue as the city's main representative in furthering the plan. 
In announcing the appointments, six in all yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg again took the opportunity to praise Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and to say that he would continue many of his policies. But at least one of Mr. Giuliani's pet initiatives is headed out: Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that he would dismantle the decency commission, created by the mayor to set standards for cultural institutions receiving public money. 
With just a few days to go before taking office, Mr. Bloomberg apologized for taking so long "to get it all done." He praised Mr. Doctoroff's efforts to land the Olympics and promised that the city would continue to do whatever it could toward that goal.
"But this city needs an awful lot more than just the Olympics," Mr. Bloomberg said. "There are five boroughs; there are enormous needs as we go forward."
Mr. Doctoroff, a managing partner of Oak Hill Capital Partners, a private equity investment firm, has worked as an investment banker and a pollster. He echoed Mr. Bloomberg's sentiment, saying that after Sept. 11, he had thought the Olympics were more important than ever for the city. 
"I saw in the Olympics a catalyst for change as well as hopefully a celebration," he said. "But I've also realized over the past several weeks that if we don't do the right job of rebuilding both downtown and our economy in general, there's not going to be anything to celebrate and there's not going to be anything to catalyze."
One of those things is the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. Mr. Doctoroff, who said he would not accept a salary for his post, said that it was premature to discuss how the administration would develop a relationship with the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation. Mr. Bloomberg does not control an appointment to the commission. But, he added, he shares an office building with the corporation's chairman, John C. Whitehead, and has already met with him.
Mr. Doctoroff also said that it was premature to comment on the idea, suggested by Mr. Giuliani in his farewell address on Thursday, that the site be used as a memorial rather than for economic development.
"Clearly a memorial is going to be a very important part of whatever happens down there," Mr. Doctoroff said. "I'm sure we, as well as the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation, will take a very hard look at all of the options."
Announcing another major post, Mr. Bloomberg appointed Ms. Eggleston, a social services advocate and administrator, to the H.R.A. Ms. Eggleston, recently the director of the Hetrick-Martin Institute, a nonprofit agency serving gay youth, came to prominence during the mayor's race when she appeared in an advertisement praising Mr. Bloomberg. Identified only as a "child welfare advocate," she was also a paid consultant to the campaign, prompting criticism from Mark Green's campaign. 
Mr. Bloomberg said that he had known Ms. Eggleston for about five months and that she had experience with the H.R.A. "I think Verna is a product of the Bronx," he said. "She's lived here all her life; she knows exactly the problems that people have, and she also knows how to get things done."
Asked to describe her background, Ms. Eggleston said she had spent 27 years in the human services field, "working with children to families and adults." As for her goals in running the agency, which is facing thousands of welfare recipients who are reaching their limits for receiving benefits at a time when the city has lost thousands of jobs, she said, "Right now my primary goal is to finish this conference and make my way down to H.R.A. and meet with staff so that we can get busy and do some work."
She offered no details on her approach on issues like welfare-to-work, saying that she wanted to "hold off" until she talked to H.R.A. employees, "because I'm really interested in hearing their ideas."
For his part, Mr. Bloomberg said that he intended to continue "Rudy's attempts to get people jobs, and keep people from needing welfare." He also said that he would continue efforts to keep homeless people from sleeping on the streets, as well as the city's court battle with a Manhattan church that has long allowed people to sleep on its grounds. Still, Mr. Bloomberg said, he will also try to reach an agreement with the church.
Mr. Bloomberg also named Ms. Dykstra, who led the Times Square Business Improvement District and worked for the Charter Revision Commission as commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, suggesting that the role would expand beyond its consumer activist roots into the area of economic development.
Ms. Dykstra, currently an independent consultant, is divorced from the head of Mr. Bloomberg's transition committee, Nat Leventhal. Mr. Leventhal recused himself from the decision on whether to appoint her, said a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg.
Bill Cunningham, a campaign strategist known for a feisty relationship with reporters, was named director of communications. Mr. Cunningham said jokingly that in addition to the team already assembled, he even looked forward to working with the assembled reporters.
Edwin Mendez-Santiago, who heads the Spanish Speaking Elderly Council (Raices), a Brooklyn-based social services agency, was named commissioner of the Department for the Aging, and Gino P. Menchini, an account manager at Cisco Systems, was named commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications.

HEADLINE: IN BOTTOM OF 9TH, GIULIANI PRESENTS DEAL ON STADIUMS 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Trying to seal an 11th-hour deal on one of his most cherished projects, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he had entered into tentative deals with the New York Yankees and the New York Mets to build stadiums for a combined $1.6 billion in the backyards of the teams' current ballparks.
 Mr. Giuliani, who insisted that Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg was on board with his plan, held a news conference yesterday and displayed models of the proposed new stadiums, retractable roofs and all. Appearing with George M. Steinbrenner 3rd, the chief owner of the Yankees, he seemed to be trying to make Mr. Bloomberg, who has repeatedly expressed ambivalence about the projects, an offer he could not refuse. 
 "It's not a question of whether he is going to do it, but how and when," Mr. Giuliani said, relaying his interpretation of talks with Mr. Bloomberg about the city's commitment to the new stadiums.
But Mr. Giuliani, whose last day in office is Monday, acknowledged that his agreement with the two teams was nonbinding on the mayor-elect, who was noticeably absent from the gathering late yesterday afternoon. 
In fact, Mr. Bloomberg had made it clear at his own news conference earlier in the day that stadiums would not be among his initial priorities. "I have said that I think we should have great cultural and athletic facilities, and the issue is really can we afford them, and I will have to take a look at that down the road as the economy develops," he said.
The financing for the stadiums has not been settled. City Hall officials said yesterday that construction would be paid for in part by issuing $800 million in tax-free municipal bonds for each stadium, on which no payments would be made for four years in the case of the Mets, and five years for the new Yankee Stadium. It is unclear whether Mr. Bloomberg will sign off on the new bond issue, which would be handled by a local development corporation yet to be formed. 
Mr. Giuliani said that no new taxes would be needed and that the cost to the city would be quickly offset by increased revenues that he has insisted new stadiums would bring, and by a rise in sales taxes from tickets and other sales at the ballparks. "The city can recoup its investment and make money every time," he said.
The agreement would require each team to make payments in lieu of taxes of $23 million annually for the first 20 years of their 35-year leases to cover their portions of the debt service on the bonds. In the final 15 years of the leases, the payments would increase annually.
The city would also receive 4 percent of gate receipts from Mets and Yankees games and 35 percent of net revenues from nonbaseball events, excluding parking fees. The teams would assume all maintenance and operating costs of the new stadiums, which the city currently pays at Shea and Yankee Stadiums.
Mr. Giuliani said the city would save the rising cost of repairs needed annually to make each stadium safe, particularly Yankee Stadium, where a 500-pound steel expansion joint crashed onto loge seats hours before a game in 1998.
If Mr. Bloomberg approves the plan, the financial contributions from the teams will be the largest ever by a baseball team. But the city's payments would be one of the largest ever by a municipality for a baseball stadium.
"The fundamental reason you need the highest private contribution and the highest public contributions to a stadium is that it simply costs more to build something major in New York," said Marc Ganis, the president of Sportscorp, a consulting firm in Chicago.
New baseball stadiums were the last and perhaps most important piece of unfinished business that Mr. Giuliani had sought to clean up as he entered his final weeks; negotiations were stalled after Sept. 11, and the mayor's aides have worked tirelessly to keep the Mets and the Yankees even at considerable cost and despite the absence of any credible threats by the teams to leave the city. 
Mr. Bloomberg has been briefed several times on the development of the plans, as has Gov. George E. Pataki, who has professed guarded support for the stadiums, even though Mr. Giuliani said that he had more or less signed off on the deal yesterday.
Mr. Pataki reiterated earlier this week that while he supported building roadways and other kinds of infrastructure needed to make the stadiums viable, the state would not contribute to the building costs. Further, the governor may be hard pressed to make the case for capital projects that support the stadium when he has gone to Washington seeking substantial financial aid for myriad items after Sept. 11. 
"The governor has been clear in his support for infrastructure," Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman, said. "We look forward to discussing the deal with the new administration."
Officials from the Mets and the Yankees expressed enthusiasm yesterday. "We were happy to be able to do this for New York," Mr. Steinbrenner said. "When 3.3 million people come out and support us," he added, they ought to have shorter lines at the restrooms and concession stands. 
The proposed new stadium for the Mets would be built on the site of the parking lot adjacent to the current stadium, and Yankee Stadium would go up on Macomb's Dam Park, across the street from the old stadium, which was built in 1923. 
Under the plan, which the mayor did not make binding so that Mr. Bloomberg could decide for himself whether he actually supports it, construction of the Mets stadium would begin in 2003, and work on the Yankees' ballpark would begin in 2004. 
Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday at his own event to announce new appointments only that he would consider the mayor's deal. 
The 45,000-seat stadium proposed for the Mets would be nearly 10,000 seats smaller than Shea Stadium. But with up to 90 luxury suites and 5,000 club seats, it is intended to generate substantially more revenues for the team.
With a capacity of 47,000 seats, the proposed new Yankee ballpark would be 8,775 seats smaller than the current Yankee Stadium. But Randy Levine, the Yankees' president, said there would be fewer higher-priced seats, in order to preserve the number of cheaper ones.
Referring to the city's need to recover economically after Sept. 11, Robert Baade, a longtime critic of public financing of stadiums who is an economics professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois, said the city's involvement in new stadiums "strikes me as insensitive and ill-timed at this particular juncture."
. But Mr. Levine, a former deputy mayor under Mr. Giuliani, said, "This is a major investment, maybe one of the largest investments of a private entity in the Bronx, and a commitment to stay there. There's no deal more fair."

HEADLINE: Mexico Lower on Bush's List Since Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER and GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
Not long ago, President Bush called Mexico America's most important friend among the world's nations.
 He met with President Vicente Fox more often than with any other leader. He spoke of a "special relationship" with Mexico, a phrase traditionally reserved for Britain. 
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell cited "the special place Mexico holds in our national priorities." The two countries were forging agreements that would have forever altered their political and economic relations, and changed the lives of millions of migrants. 
But for the moment, Mexico has fallen off Washington's foreign policy agenda.
Though President Bush has reiterated his commitment to Mexico, and President Fox has expressed support for the American campaign against terrorism, serious talks on every important issue uniting and dividing the two countries -- trade, drug trafficking, immigration -- have been all but suspended since Sept. 11.
And like a bride left standing at the altar, Mexico is starting to wonder how long it will have to wait.
"For us, Sept. 11 did not change the pace of our work," President Fox said in an interview. "We have kept our focus. The United States has changed. They have had to pause. For them the focus on terrorism has forced them to put less attention on our bilateral issues.
"I understand that necessity. But at the same time, I would like to see that once their work is done we can advance on our pending issues."
Mr. Fox said he hoped that the United States and Mexico could reach agreement on sweeping immigration reforms by next summer. Among other things, the Mexican government is pressing the United States to expand current guest worker programs and give legal status to some three million Mexicans staying illegally in the United States.
But "the events of Sept. 11 put things on hold," said Mexico's foreign minister, Jorge Castaneda.
Hopes for a more open border, freer immigration and new United States investment in Mexico have been buried under the weight of the attacks, the heightened interest in border security to weed out terrorists and the economic slump in the United States.
Mr. Fox's "dream of an open border between the United States and Mexico is counted among many of the losses caused by the attacks of Sept. 11," said Peter Andreas, a political scientist at Brown University.
Without concrete progress toward a common agenda between the two countries, and without a strong American economy to bolster Mexico's, much of what Mr. Fox hoped to achieve in his six years as president may become a distant vision.
"There is no country in the world that's suffered more from the eclipse of Sept. 11 and the laser focus of the Bush administration on bin Laden than Mexico," said Robert A. Pastor, a former National Security Council staff member and a longtime expert on Mexico, who is now at Emory University.
Before the attacks on New York and Virginia, the two neighbors were working on new safety plans for the 2,000-mile border, where hundreds of immigrants die each year from exposure to heat and cold crossing illegally into the United States through trackless deserts.
The two presidents even broached issues considered taboo by past governments, including United States investment in Mexico's energy industry and permission for American law enforcement officials to operate on Mexican soil. All remain on the to-do list.
Mr. Fox spoke of his desire to achieve new agreements with the United States during a trip to the border last week -- the same border that Mr. Powell, in his first news conference as secretary of state, said was "no longer a line that divides us, but a region that unites our nations."
For now, the line once again is a wall. "The voices that once clamored for open borders have quieted," Mr. Andreas writes in a forthcoming edition of Foreign Affairs in Spanish. In Washington, he says, "anguished and somber conversations about perimeters of security and defense of national territory" have replaced animated conversations about a united frontier, and "defenders of an open border are ridiculed."
One million people still cross that line every day, Mr. Fox said. Foreign-owned factories generate millions of dollars in tax revenues and tens of thousands of jobs each year, and help drive what last year was a quarter-trillion-dollar economic engine of cross-border trade.
But some 300,000 Mexicans illegally enter the United States across that same border each year. Other foreigners can also cross it. And that is now, in many American eyes, a national security issue above all.
Senior Mexican government officials say the terrorist strikes should make it easier to win political support for the legalization of undocumented Mexican immigrants, a centerpiece of Mr. Fox's proposals. 
The officials argue that giving the immigrants United States identification cards, Social Security numbers and driver's licenses would pull them out of society's shadows and into the light of governmental oversight.
That argument has not won any visible support at the White House. So President Fox struggles to keep his dream alive, to stay on the United States foreign policy radar by capitalizing on Washington's new national security priorities, with the aim of renewing American interest in Mexico's hopes.
He has pledged unconditional support for the campaign against terrorism, offering to freeze bank accounts of people or organizations suspected of supporting terrorists and placing new visa restrictions on travelers entering Mexico.
"Mexico will be neither a residence for terrorists nor a transit stop for terrorists to enter the United States," he said. "We will fulfill that commitment."
Not all of Washington has forgotten the first nine months of 2001, when Mr. Fox was a darling of politicians left and right, and the two nations' plans seemed so in sync.
The Democratic leaders in Congress, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri, visited Mexico last month to emphasize their support for President Fox's immigration proposals. Kenneth W. Dam, the United States deputy Treasury secretary, said during a visit to Merida this month that Mexico remained a priority for Mr. Bush.
"Nothing is more important to President Bush than this partnership" with Mexico, Mr. Dam said. Though "the whole world changed" on Sept. 11, he said, "one thing did not change, and that is the importance to the U.S. of this partnership."
But the progress the two partners achieved in the last three months fell short of what once seemed possible. Mexico has "come back full force to the bilateral agenda," Mr. Fox said, even if the United States has not. And next year, he said, "we will have the advances we want."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: MILITARY STRATEGY; 
Gains and Limits in New Low-Risk War

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
The military campaign in Afghanistan was a striking success for a new style of warfare, in which American commandos took center stage and played a vital role in organizing the Afghan resistance and directing punishing airstrikes. 
 The novel strategy enabled the United States to topple the Taliban, install a friendly government and ensure that Al Qaeda could no longer use Afghanistan as a base for terrorism. 
 Those ends were achieved with a small number of American ground troops, with little political backlash in the Muslim world about an "occupying" Western army and with a very limited loss of American lives. 
Having brought important gains at modest cost, this is an approach the Pentagon may be tempted to repeat as it plans military campaigns against Iraq or terrorist organizations around the world. 
But the American strategy also had a decided drawback: the decision to let proxy forces bear the brunt of the ground fighting may have allowed many Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, and possibly Osama bin Laden himself, to escape. 
Their elusiveness, so far, denies the United States an important goal, which President Bush enunciated one week after the attacks on New York and Washington when he said he wanted Mr. bin Laden brought to justice, whether he was captured "dead or alive." 
When it came to capturing the Taliban stronghold in Kandahar, the Pentagon allowed its Afghan allies to take the lead. But the Taliban's surrender failed to yield Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, or other top figures.
Later, in Tora Bora, the United States again relied on its Afghan proxies, mainly fighters commanded by Hazarat Ali, and the Pakistani soldiers who patrolled the border. Washington did not dispatch an American ground force to cut off Al Qaeda's escape routes, and hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters managed to slip across the border, according to reports from Pakistan.
After the battle of Tora Bora, the Pentagon considered sending in hundreds of ground troops when it appeared that Afghan forces might be unable or unwilling to scour the area for Al Qaeda leaders. But American officials remain reluctant to do so, and now hope that incentives like money and winter clothing will encourage more Afghan cooperation. 
If so, that would still leave the matter in the hands of Afghans who are not fully motivated to search caves in cold weather for Al Qaeda leaders who in many cases have fled, sometimes with help.
According to new United States intelligence, some low-level militia commanders have smuggled Arab fighters, perhaps dozens, out of Afghanistan for up to $5,000 a head. One defense official said that a handful of midlevel commanders were running the network, but that Commander Ali had stopped it. 
American military officials insist they will eventually catch their main quarry: Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders. It may also turn out that Mr. bin Laden and his top aides were killed in the thunderous bombing of Tora Bora, though without precise information on his whereabouts such a development would be no more than a result of a lucky hit. 
"In a perfect world, we would have liked the forces of Hazarat Ali and the Pakistan forces to have been a little more efficient in stopping the flow," said a senior American military official. "But nothing is perfect. It did not work out that way, but it was not without some success. Sooner or later we will get them."
While final judgments must await a clearer determination of Mr. bin Laden's fate and those of his aides, some experts say it was a mistake to be so heavily dependent on Afghan proxies and not to involve American ground troops in the final and potentially decisive chapter of the war at Tora Bora. 
With many leaders of Al Qaeda and the Taliban still at large, the war that began in early October with around-the-clock bombing raids now appears to be sputtering to a vague and potentially inconclusive end.
"Did we really do everything we could to nail these guys as they ran away?" asked Eliot A. Cohen, a professor of strategic studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. "I don't understand why we didn't have light conventional forces to intercept them as they fled."

A Novel War
Elusive Enemy, Wavering Friends
President Bush has called the battle against terrorism the first war of the 21st century. From the start, the conflict in Afghanistan was a most unorthodox war.
The goal was not just to destroy Al Qaeda's terrorist network in Afghanistan. It was also to upend the Taliban government, which sheltered Al Qaeda, and thus send a message to governments around the world that there is a heavy price for supporting terrorists.
In military terms, the enemy was ill equipped. 
Though the Taliban was effective against the opposition Northern Alliance before the American intervention, and though some Qaeda troops who fought alongside the Taliban were schooled in terrorist tactics, the Taliban had only a primitive air-defense system, a far cry from the stiff defenses the United States faced in Yugoslavia, or in Iraq during the Persian Gulf war.
Taliban troops rode to the front in pickup trucks laden with Kalashnikovs. 
Neither they nor their Qaeda allies had any experience with modern American airpower and they did relatively little to conceal themselves, not realizing how accurate the airstrikes were. 
Their fighters' formative experience came in battling the Soviet military and its blunderbuss use of force, and in the relentless civil wars of Afghanistan.
Another weakness of the Taliban and Al Qaeda was that their fighters were largely cut off from external support. 
The mujahedeen who resisted the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980's had weapons and other materiel funneled through Pakistan by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
But this time, after Washington prevailed on President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan to turn against the Taliban, Mullah Omar's forces found themselves largely isolated. One of the few sources of external support were the thousands of fundamentalist students from the religious schools of Pakistan who crossed into Afghanistan; many had no military experience and little training. 
Politically, the Taliban were vulnerable as well. 
Their base of support was in the south, in Kandahar, and they extended their reach to the north with intimation and fear. As a result, much of their control was brittle.
"This was the most incompetent adversary the United States has fought since the Barbary pirates" in the early 1800's, said Wesley K. Clark, a retired general who led the NATO alliance during the Kosovo war in Yugoslavia. "They had no understanding of U.S. military capability."
Still, the war was anything but simple. 
The Pentagon had to contend with a shortage of military bases in the region. Pakistan did not welcome the arrival of large numbers of American troops. Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, to the north, were firmly within the Russian sphere of influence.
There was also the problem of forbidding terrain, a population with a deep suspicion of foreign forces and an anti-Taliban resistance that was not a coherent insurgency, but an array of bickering and ethnically diverse factions.
These factors shaped much of the American military planning. With only limited access to bases near Afghanistan, the air campaign had to rely primarily on long-range Air Force bombers operating from Diego Garcia, a British island in the Indian Ocean, and from the United States, and on Navy warplanes from aircraft carriers in the Indian Ocean.
Anxious about stirring up deep-seated resentments about the intervention of foreign forces, and fearful of becoming ensnared in an Afghan quagmire, regular Army troops were used to defend airfields in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan. Marines established a forward base in Afghanistan but were largely kept out of the fray. 
Faced with a new and unexpected war, the Bush administration took time to find a formula that worked.
The administration initially feared that open alignment with the Tajik- and Uzbek-dominated Northern Alliance would upset Pakistan as well as the Pashtun tribes in southern Afghanistan. 
Taliban and Al Qaeda frontline troops facing the alliance fighters were spared the full brunt of American airpower while the administration debated internally over what to do. 
But the surprising tenacity of the Taliban and Al Qaeda defenders and fears that the war could drag on well into 2002 finally led Washington to put aside those reservations. It also led to a new strategy.

The New Strategy
Wooden Saddles, Lasers and Laptops
Special Operations forces are a standard part of the Pentagon's repertory, but they played a far more important role in Afghanistan than in previous campaigns. 
The basic idea was for American commandos to help arm the Afghan resistance, assist them in planning their attacks and support them by calling in airstrikes, which involved some of the most advanced weapons the Pentagon has. 
The use of Special Operations forces enabled the American bombing to shift from fixed targets like airfields and command posts to mobile targets like enemy troops and to defensive positions that were difficult to discern from the air.
The Afghan resistance groups were to do the main fighting on the ground. The British pitched in with Special Air Service commandos and a small number of cruise missile strikes, but by and large there was not much of a Western military coalition, giving the Pentagon enormous leeway in deciding the strategy. 
"New and old techniques were brought together," a senior American official said. "It involved Special Forces riding on horses and slogging on foot. And it involved high-tech weapons, sensors and surveillance. Those parts had to work together.
"You had some of this in Vietnam. Special Forces called in air strikes against the Vietcong, but you did not have this as the centerpiece of your effort. What was new here was that Special Ops and air power were married together and the opposition forces were occupying the ground." 
There was a panoply of commandos. Army Green Berets organized weapons shipments to the disparate Northern Alliance factions and whatever Pashtun resistance could be organized in the south. The Special Forces rode with Afghans on horseback (using wooden saddles until leather ones were airlifted in) and traveled by pickup truck to help the Afghans to plan their attacks.
The Green Berets called in airstrikes, using radios and laptop computers to transmit bombing coordinates to American pilots, and laser designators to pinpoint other targets. Air Force Special Tactics units performed a similar role.
Navy Seals, hiding in the countryside, carried out long-range reconnaissance. The C.I.A. also deployed its Special Operations Group, a small unit that worked with the Afghan resistance and conducted operations in both northern and southern Afghanistan.
The arrangement was a marked improvement from the last war: the NATO campaign to force the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo. 
In that battle, no Special Operations forces were deployed in the province, leaving the Americans without spotters to call in airstrikes.
There was an important synergy in Afghanistan between the air and ground campaign. With their attacks, the Afghan resistance forced the Taliban and Al Qaeda to take up defensive positions, which were highly vulnerable to airstrikes. 
The air raids, in turn, accounted for most of the Taliban and Al Qaeda casualties and enabled the Afghan resistance to move forward.
The results are clear on the highway that runs from Bagram, a much-fought-over air base built by the Soviet Union, south to Kabul. The burnt-out hulks of Taliban armor frame the road, testimony to the precision bombing of the Americans and the Taliban's failure to understand the need to conceal their heavy weapons from American warplanes.
Effects of the bombing are also felt in the bleak hospital ward in Jalalabad where wounded Arabs, who were lured to Afghanistan by Mr. bin Laden, are being kept as prisoners. 
Abdul Wakil, a young translator at the hospital, said the Arabs often speak of how accurately the Americans were able to hit their positions as Al Qaeda volunteers tried to hold out with little food and no real way at striking back at the planes.
He said they often have nightmares about the bombing, an indication that it broke the morale of many of Mr. bin Laden's men. Many were never prepared for this kind of war.
Significantly, the Special Operations forces played a far more important role than the more heavily equipped and better publicized regular forces. 
Despite their firepower, regular ground troops, like the Army 10th Mountain Division and the Marines, played a minor role.
Troops from the 10th Mountain Division were deployed in Uzbekistan and later a small number went to Bagram and the airfield at Mazar-i-Sharif. As the war entered its second month, marines established a forward base south of Kandahar, a site code-named Rhino, and eventually deployed forces at the Kandahar airport. Cobra attack helicopters were deployed, along with light armored vehicles.
The marines may have made their main contribution by increasing the psychological pressure on the Taliban and by emboldening the Pashtuns and other tribes in the south in the siege of Kandahar. The marines' combat role was largely limited to a single attack in which Marine Cobra helicopters and Navy jets blasted a Taliban convoy. 
The marines' primary task now is to build a jail for Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners who have been captured by the Afghan resistance and Special Operations forces.

Unknown Battles
On Tirin Kot Road, Tactics Worked
Many of the victories by the American-led coalition are unsung because the operations of American and British commandos are generally classified and because the Pentagon kept the news media well away from the action. What is known about them illustrates the military potential of the American approach.
A glimmer of the fighting was provided by Capt. Jason Amerine of the Army 5th Special Forces Group. His men were deployed with troops commanded by Hamid Karzai, the Pashtun leader who was sworn in last weekend as chairman of the transitional Afghan government.
Three of Captain Amerine's men were killed by an errant American bomb, and Captain Amerine spoke of the fighting to ensure that his 12-man Green Beret A-team was remembered for the mission it carried out, not just for the accident.
Those were the only three American military deaths during combat. (Two G.I.'s were killed in the crash of a search-and-rescue helicopter in Pakistan. A C.I.A. operative died during a prison uprising near Mazar-i-Sharif. Four Americans died in truck, ship or helicopter accidents, and a soldier from the 10th Mountain Division died from a noncombat gunshot in Uzbekistan, possibly a suicide.)
The Nov. 17 battle began when Mr. Karzai decided to move his forces to Tirin Kot, the capital of Oruzgan Province and a town in the Taliban heartland. Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, was born in the area.
Seeing that the Taliban's days seemed to be numbered, the townspeople of Tirin Kot had deposed the local Taliban leaders. Mr. Karzai wanted to move his field headquarters to the town, to protect it from retribution from Mullah Omar's forces in Kandahar and to use it as a base to recruit new fighters. 
Just hours after Captain Amerine and Mr. Karzai reached the town, however, the Taliban tried to retake it. The assault involved a force of 500 soldiers, Taliban troops as well as Arab and other foreign fighters, who piled into an armada of 80 pickup trucks and other battered vehicles. They were racing from Kandahar, 50 miles to the south.
Taking positions on a ridge outside the town, the Americans began calling in airstrikes on the vehicles. Captain Amerine's team was confident that airpower could do the job, but Mr. Karzai's forces had less experience with precision bombing. Worried that the bombing would not be effective, they began to retreat. That left Captain Amerine's men no choice but to commandeer four cars and follow. 
Captain Amerine was concerned that he would have to evacuate Mr. Karzai, whom the Americans were already counting as a future friendly leader. But if the Americans left, Captain Amerine feared the townspeople in Tirin Kot would be slaughtered in a round of reprisal killings by the Taliban. 
So the Americans helped the Afghans set up new defensive positions near the town and resumed calling in airstrikes. Like Mr. Karzai's men, the Taliban underestimated the lethal power of the bombing and pressed ahead. "It was kind of strange, because they just kept coming into the valley and we just kept bombing them," Captain Amerine said.
Then the Taliban jumped off their vehicles and tried to outflank the American and Afghan defenses. But Mr. Karzai's fighters sprayed them with automatic weapons fire to beat them back. "The first couple of hours I had my doubts as to whether we'd be able to hold the town and hold the valley," Captain Amerine said. 
"It actually went through my mind that we might need to start thinking about getting Hamid Karzai out of there for his own safety. But through the successes of the airstrikes and through my soldiers' really taking charge and getting the anti-Taliban fighters situated, we were able to pretty quickly take charge of the situation and we were able to turn the balance and start causing the Taliban to retreat."
The combination of Special Operations forces, Afghan proxies and American airpower was to prove itself.
"In Afghanistan the Special Operations forces and airpower are a combination that the defense intellectuals are going to have to digest over the coming months and years," said Robert Andrews, principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. 
Working with local forces, he said, "the Special Operations forces dramatically increased the effectiveness of the air campaign, and on the ground, they turned the Northern Alliance into a conquering army."

Tora Bora
Forbidding Caves Offer Final Test
But there were some situations that could not be so easily handled by this trinity of Special Operations, airpower and Afghan allies on the ground. 
The foreign Taliban fighters were dedicated battlers, but their allies in the Taliban preferred negotiated surrenders and back-room amnesties to last stands. As the American proxies wheeled and dealed, many of the Taliban's top leaders slipped away, possibly with the acquiescence of the anti-Taliban Afghans. The list of the missing include Mullah Omar, who is high on the American's wanted list but who, along with many other top Taliban officials, managed to evade the siege of Kandahar.
Tora Bora was another case where the strategy appears to have produced something less than a complete victory. 
The problem was that the area is vast and wild, and borders Pakistan. Sealing it off was more than the Afghan resistance could do, even when they were aided by about 100 Special Operations forces and backed up by Pakistan troops on their side of the border.
"Even with the snow, the way to Pakistan is open," Gen. Muhammad Fahim, now the defense minister of the Afghan government, warned as the battle unfolded. "Bin Laden is constantly changing his location. He can cross the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan and go back again." 
Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders, three anti-Taliban forces from the Eastern Shura, which is centered on Jalalabad, mounted the assault on Tora Bora. Two contingents were led by Hajji Muhammad Zaman and Hajji Zahir. The third group had the main responsibility -- blocking Al Qaeda fighters seeking an escape to Pakistan -- and was under the command of Hazarat Ali.
Once again, the mix of the American air strikes and the largely Afghan ground assault was on display. As the Eastern Shura troops maneuvered through the valleys, Al Qaeda forces climbed the ridges in search of defensive high ground, only to make themselves vulnerable to American air strikes. 
In one 24-hour period, said Gen. Tommy R. Franks, chief of the United States Central Command, American warplanes and Afghan artillery "put literally hundreds of pieces of ordinance, bombs and artillery shells into these bunkers and cave complexes."
The attacks sent columns of smoke into the sky and thunderous blasts echoing through the valley below. Al Qaeda's dead numbered in the hundreds and many appeared to have been killed by the airstrikes. A visit to one bombed-out Al Qaeda camp found bits of clothing scattered in the trees and the empty casings of American cluster bombs.
Hazhar Gul, 30, who served under Commander Ali, said the American strikes played a critical role in helping his forces advance. "We asked the Americans to bomb them and they were right on target," he said.
Still, there was only so much that bombing could do. Many Al Qaeda fighters were determined to fight to the end. Hamid Kahn, a commander under Hajji Zahir, said some Arab fighters rigged themselves with explosives, preferring to blow themselves up rather than be handed over to the Americans. And while some Al Qaeda fighters tried to mount a defense, others ran. 
Afghan fighters said they did their best but it was not possible to seal all the escape routes. "There are many mountains and a big forest beyond them," said Gul Karim, a deputy to Commander Ali. "There are many paths, and it was not possible to block all of them." 
As the battle drew to a close, it was apparent that the Afghans and Americans had overlapping but different objectives. Commanders Zaman and Ali came down the mountain, announced they had seized the high ground, chased Al Qaeda fighters from the Nangarhar Province and all but declared victory.
But seizing Tora Bora was not the Americans' goal; trapping Al Qaeda leaders and their fighters was. 
Three senior Al Qaeda officials, including Muhammad Atef, the terrorist network's chief of military operations, are believed to have been killed by American bombs during the war. But at Tora Bora, several hundred Al Qaeda fighters may have crossed the border, according to reports from Pakistan.
A senior American military official defended the strategy. Throughout the military campaign, he said, the United States did not want to seen as an occupying army, as the Soviet Union was in its failed 10-year intervention. 
"We wanted to avoid the perception of being yet another foreign conqueror who had come to take ground in Afghanistan," he said. "We did not send troops in there for the same reason we did not bring in the U.S. Army to roll across Afghanistan."
But it is also true that in a climatic fight with the United States' nemesis, the military did not use all of its capabilities. One retired American officer said the deployment of helicopter-borne and light infantry troops might have enabled Washington to "tighten the noose about bin Laden." 
Indeed, if Mr. bin Laden and other senior Al Qaeda leaders remain at large, the Bush administration's decision not to use ground troops in Tora Bora may loom as one of the most debated aspects of the war.
"I would agree that had we been more aggressive, we might have obtained our objective of getting the leadership," said Michael Vickers, a former Green Beret, C.I.A. officer and director of strategic studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington. 
"But one thing I would say in defense of the strategy is that the Taliban are really fugitives. It is the same with Al Qaeda's forces in Afghanistan. 
"They have been stripped of their security and do not have the support they had before. We may not have 100 percent, but we may have 95 percent. The real test will be what happens in the month ahead."
With the Taliban out of power, Mr. Karzai at the helm of a new government, terrorist camps destroyed and Qaeda leaders on the run, American commanders had much to be proud off. American casualties were kept to a minimum, which despite Pentagon assurances about being prepared to accept losses, still appears to be a priority. 
But with many Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders unaccounted for, the war lacks the closure the American public had expected. 
President Bush once declared that the United States was in "hot pursuit" of Mr. bin Laden. As the war entered its twilight, a senior United States official was more cautious, saying, "The trail has gone cold."

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Bitterness Is Sugar's Legacy

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER with GRAHAM GORI

DATELINE: CORDOBA, Mexico 

 BODY:
EVERY morning at dawn, through the winter and spring, the cutters of Cordoba come to the sugar cane fields.
 They labor with their machetes, each one cutting more than a ton of cane before dusk, taking home $7 for a backbreaking day's work, the same as last year and the year before, with little hope that life will offer more. Their work creates a product that has almost no value: it costs about as much to buy a ton of raw cane in Mexico as it does to buy a ton of refined sugar on the world market.
 If that makes little economic sense, consider the big picture of Mexico's sugar industry. It is as bitter as the raw smell wafting from the sugar mills. 
 The mills are antiques, better suited to the 19th century than the 21st. Yet they produce far more sugar than anyone wants to buy, including the nation's most important customer, the United States. The glut has left Mexico's sugar industry all but bankrupt.
 Their near-collapse has compelled President Vicente Fox -- who learned all about the economics of sugar and sweeteners as Cola-Cola's chief executive in Mexico, and who ran for office as a businessman first, a politician second -- to a counterintuitive coup, albeit one aimed at saving the industry. In an era when governments all over the globe have been privatizing national industries, he has ordered a government expropriation of half the nation's mills.
 The sad state of affairs in Mexico was created in large part by the old political regime, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which lost the presidency last year after seven decades of unbroken rule. The party subsidized growers, cutters, refiners, unions and their leaders, spending billions to buy political loyalty as it propped up the industry, which employs roughly two million Mexicans, mostly peasant farmers.
 Things started collapsing last year. The federal agency that supported the mills shut down, leaving $2 billion in unpaid loans. Thousands of sugar farmers started marching on Mexico City, demanding that Mr. Fox's government force sugar processors to pay nearly a half-billion dollars owed to producers.
 THEN, in September, the government moved to expropriate nearly half the nation's mills, 27 out of 60, trying to save hundreds of thousands of jobs, forcing the industry's hopeless cases out of existence and preserving the salvageable ones. It may prove a last-ditch effort to make the industry work. For now, there are few signs that the bold move will pay off any time soon.
 ''The federal government didn't have another alternative,'' said Rodolfo Perdomo Bueno, president of Grupo Perno. The company grew from the sugar mill founded by his great-grandfather more than a century ago. The business has survived independent of political largess. ''It either took the decision it took,'' he said, ''or allowed the industry to completely bankrupt itself.
 ''At this moment, Mexico is facing a critical situation,'' added Mr. Perdomo, a past president of Mexico's sugar industry association. ''The world, the United States, isn't growing. The environment is very complex. You can't just let people die of hunger while you fix a long-term problem. Given the economic situation of the country, it was more important to maintain the industry, which is a large source of employment, especially in areas like Mexico's rural sector, where there are no other sources of employment.''
 Many Mexicans contend that the cause of the industry's near-collapse lies in a disputed footnote to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico says Nafta allows it to ship 500,000 tons of sugar to the United States. But the United States says a ''side letter,'' added to Nafta at the last minute to protect the American sugar industry and to win crucial votes in Congress to assure the trade agreement's passage, limits Mexico's exports to 116,000 tons. The United States contends that the language is lawful, but Mexico disputes that.
 This means that the 11 sugar mills in and around Cordoba cannot sustain the tens of thousands of people who have depended on them for their livelihoods. This part of Mexico, in the foothills of the Sierra Madre in Veracruz state, has been producing sugar for nearly five centuries, ever since the conquistador Hernan Cortes set up a small refinery in 1524. The area produces 20 percent of the nation's sugar. Some 40,000 small landowners, 30,000 cane cutters, 6,000 mill workers and 4,000 truck drivers -- along with their families, roughly three-quarters of the local population -- have known no other way of life. There are no other jobs.
 ''It's the only source of money,'' said Antonio Dominguez Martinez, a magistrate in Cordoba, the second most powerful man after the mayor, and a member of Mr. Fox's political party, National Action. 
 Now, as sugar's economic harvest dwindles, the young men of Cordoba are leaving for the United States. Every year, there are fewer able-bodied young men in the cane fields. Today the cutters are older men and their younger sons, joined increasingly by their wives and sisters.
 The unspoken strategy behind the Fox administration's expropriation of the weakest mills seems to be a postponement of the inevitable closures. The longer the weeding-out takes, the fewer people may be hurt.
 Mr. Dominguez defines the crisis bluntly: Mexico's sugar production keeps rising, while the United States floods Mexico with a cheaper sweetener, corn syrup, and refuses to import Mexico's sugar surplus. Closing half the country's mills immediately, rather than propping them up temporarily, as Mr. Fox has done, would cause social chaos, he said. But many mills are doomed.
 ''I don't think they'll die 100 percent,'' Mr. Dominguez said. ''How many of them will close? Probably 50 percent. The small ones will go.'' And if the United States will not buy more of Mexico's sugar surplus, he said, ''they'll have to accept more Mexicans crossing the border.''
 That strikes Jack Roney, an economist at the American Sugar Alliance, as an unacceptable solution. ''From an economic and a social point of view, the Mexican government decided they can't let these companies go out of business,'' he said. ''It's none of our business how Mexico sorts out its social and economic issues. The part we're concerned about continues to be the surplus sugar, and that we not be expected to pay the price for those problems.''
 He said Mexico could not simply keep its mills afloat at any cost, continuing to produce mountains of sugar and then trying to ''dump it on the U.S. market and make it a U.S. problem.''
 FOR Mr. Fox, the conundrum of the cane fields is growing.
 He has vowed to make Mexico an economic meritocracy, to end the tradition of political subsidies for agriculture. His treasury secretary, Francisco Gil Diaz, says the owners of the expropriated mills have ''milked the subsidies for their own personal interest.'' And the largest of the sugar mill operators, Consorcio Azucarero Escorpion, or the Scorpion Sugar Consortium, is already under criminal investigation into accusations that it faked exports to keep its government subsidies flowing under the last administration.
 The mills' debts to the government largely cancel out the costs of expropriation, and Mr. Gil Diaz says the mills can be refurbished and sold in the next year or two for several hundred million dollars. But if they cannot operate economically, who will buy them? And if no one does, what will become of the hundreds of thousands of peasant farmers, cane cutters, truckers and mill workers?
 These are the questions that expropriation has postponed. Mr. Fox's decision to delay the day of reckoning has averted ''a tremendous social problem,'' Mr. Perdomo said.
 If the 27 seized mills had closed, ''we would be talking about uprisings in 15 states,'' or half of Mexico, he said.
 Thousands of people would be asking: ''How am I going to live, what am I going to eat, what alternative do you give me, what do I do, where do I go? Do I go to the United States?'' he said. ''There wasn't a real alternative.''

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN REVIEW: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
The Deadly Importance of Making Distinctions

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
ARCHITECTURE is a protagonist in the public realm. Often, it is called upon to enact the primal drama of loss and compensation. When the loss is great, compensation is often visualized in terms of civic grandeur. The losses this year were incalculable.
 The attacks on the World Trade Center were felt across many dimensions of space and time: from the neighborhood to the globe; from the televised real-time moment to history's multiple points of view. The attacks' target was modern civilization. Civilization fought back, not just with weapons and slogans, but with the capacity to contemplate its highly complex self. The attack drove home the importance of discriminating between modern, progressive outlooks and oppressive, feudal ones. 
 Discrimination was the big story in architecture this year. This matters; that doesn't. This is useful; that's a waste of time. This feeds into the future; that is stuck in a dead end. Clarity itself came into sharper focus. This is an idea; that is a box of orange Jell-O. This is architecture; that is etc., etc., etc. Such distinctions are not easily made, but they are worth the time and effort it takes to form cultivated opinions.
The need for more penetrating analytic tools became urgent before Sept. 11. In March, a team of real estate developers organized a competition to select the architects to plan an office and residential complex for the so-called Con Ed site, a nine-acre property on the East River waterfront just south of the United Nations headquarters. Announced with great fanfare as an international search for architects of major talent, the competition invited submissions from three winners of the Pritzker Architecture Prize and other noted figures on the world stage. It ended with the choice of two local firms of lesser distinction.
During the selection process, Richard Meier and Peter Eisenman withdrew after they were asked to play a subordinate role as consulting architects. Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti, Boston architects who had agreed to participate as consultants, later resigned as well.
In the past, episodes like this tended to fall beneath a critic's radar. On the premise that all architects are created equal, it is often assumed that only fully realized designs should be subject to critical appraisal. Actually, all phases of the building art -- including zoning, economics, politics, context, history, aesthetics and ideology -- fall within the traditional scope of critical interpretation.
To these factors must be added the inflated and inflationary pressures of professional marketing. Architects operate in an increasingly competitive market and in an aesthetically eclectic period that is not guided by educated consensus on matters of taste or style. The profession benefits from the myth that its members cannot be qualitatively ranked.
The Con Ed competition illustrated H. H. Richardson's belief that the first law of American architecture was to "get the job." The developers didn't want to pay for architecture. But Richardson never suggested that marketing should be the only law. Concepts other than social Darwinism should make an appearance from time to time. Architects can't buck the market system and shouldn't try. They should use the system as an intellectual as well as an economic framework. They should make vivid architecture from the system's inherent contradictions.
"How can you criticize people for doing what they think is right?" I was asked that question, in one form or another, many times this past year. My routine answer: "I read a lot of history."
In the weeks following the attacks, the Con Ed competition came to seem like a warm-up for the full-dress performance of an anxious status quo. The city's leading corporate architecture firms linked arms with their developer-clients to devise strategies for turning a catastrophe into a business opportunity. An ad hoc group, the N.Y.C. Rebuild Infrastructure Task Force, convinced its members that they had earned the moral stature of firefighters, medical personnel, emergency volunteers. Onlookers were less persuaded.
The attacks required the entire city to draw on its deepest resources of historical awareness and imaginative reflection. But it did not entitle architects to assume that they had been awarded a special franchise to answer the call. Survivors, philosophers, firefighters, shopkeepers, musicians, window dressers and dentists have at least as much right to the public's attention. All of us have had to fight feelings of helplessness.
Quite a few projects did deserve the limelight this year. In New York, they included the American Museum of Folk Art, designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien; the Prada store in SoHo, by Rem Koolhaas; the Neue Galerie New York, by Annabelle Selldorf; and the Melrose Community Center in the Bronx, by Diana Agrest and Mario Gandelsonas. There were also promising designs for future projects by Norman Foster, Jean Nouvel, Gwathmey & Siegel and Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio. Preservationists rallied to prevent the disfigurement of Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy Airport.
Out of town, there were openings of new buildings by Mr. Koolhaas, Tadao Ando, Santiago Calatrava and Rafael Vinoly. I wasn't able to cover most of those works. The unfolding of events in the politics of New York architecture was a story I couldn't overlook. This story was not, in any case, so divorced from the aesthetics of architecture as you might think. The political story went far toward explaining why the city's architecture so seldom registers on the artistic scale.
From my window at home, I have a good view of the Secretariat building of the United Nations. It was completed just half a century ago. It was my beacon on the skyline throughout 2001.
This was a year in which many, including those of us who are not pacifists, decided that world peace wasn't too corny a topic to think about. The architects of the United Nations headquarters were among the heroic figures of a great generation. Like the members of the United Nations, they were not afraid to face the contradictions of their time, particularly those that emerged from conflicts between global and regional perspectives.
Nor were they afraid to be criticized for doing what they believed was right. As they understood it, generating conflict was essential to the development of discrimination. Looking back at contemporary commentary on the United Nations, much of it hostile, you will realize that great architecture seldom reinforces preconceived ideas of normalcy. It parts company with them, and, in the process, reveals conflicts that have long been lurking underground. Such revelations provide the fuel that drives public life forward.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN REVIEW: MUSIC; 
Of Necessity, Thoughts Turned To Purpose And Relevance

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
THE year in classical music was fraught with organizations everywhere reeling from the national economic downturn. By the summer, the very survival of the respected St. Louis Symphony Orchestra came into question. Even the renowned Chicago Symphony grappled with financial setbacks.
 Then came the horror of Sept. 11. The first reaction of classical-music ensembles and companies, like arts organizations everywhere, was to go through a crisis of relevance. What is the role of music in a newly insecure world? How best to respond to brutality and loss? 
 The New York City Opera had been scheduled to open its season with a new production of Wagner's "Fliegende Hollander" on Sept. 11. Urged by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to get under way as soon as possible for the sake of the city's morale, the City Opera found the inner strength to regroup. Four days later, on a Saturday afternoon, singers, staff members and administrators, led by the company's general director, Paul Kellogg, appeared on the stage of the New York State Theater to sing the national anthem before presenting the new Wagner production. In the evening the company continued as scheduled with, of all things, the director Jonathan Miller's zany take on "The Mikado."
In a way, for me, that was the most meaningful day of music in 2001. By just showing up, let alone performing so valiantly, the company made it safe again -- not physically safe (no New Yorker will ever take that for granted again) but emotionally safe -- to let ourselves enjoy music, to be stirred by Wagner and amused by Gilbert and Sullivan.
As other companies opened their seasons, some decided to alter their programs in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks. Kurt Masur conducted the New York Philharmonic and the New York Choral Artists in a noble performance of Brahms's "German Requiem" in September. Other organizations thought that the right response was to go on with challenging programs as planned. One such was the Miller Theater at Columbia University, which opened another adventurous season in September with the Absolute Ensemble in a riveting performance of Mark-Anthony Turnage's visceral and grating orchestral work "Blood on the Floor."
Various visiting ensembles struggled with what to perform for their first appearances in New York. Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic, in three concerts that opened the Carnegie Hall season in October, decided to replace Mahler, Webern and Wagner with several Beethoven symphonies. The orchestra gave a thematic reasoning for the shift: in a time of chaos, Beethoven provides certitude. Actually, you could argue that Mahler's tormented Seventh Symphony and Webern's haunting Six Pieces for Orchestra might have been even more appropriate. But the Beethoven performances were utterly distinguished.
Of course, the questions of relevance that were forced on classical-music organizations in the aftermath of the attack are the very questions they should be addressing anyway. In this regard, it was particularly dismaying to watch the constituents of Lincoln Center struggle toward some consensus over a major redevelopment plan that remains uncertain. Still, on their own, the individual organizations did memorable work.
Though Mr. Masur has not done enough to introduce new works, especially by American composers, into the Philharmonic's programs, he was in his element in February, conducting the premiere of Hans Werner Henze's impressive Symphony No. 9, scored for orchestra and chorus. The Philharmonic debut of the dynamic young American conductor David Robertson, in a thoughtful program of Wagner, Schoenberg and Beethoven in April, hinted at what might have been had the orchestra acted more boldly in choosing its next music director. That appointment went instead to Lorin Maazel.
At the Metropolitan Opera in the spring, James Levine could do no wrong, it seemed. From the amazing Met orchestra, he elicited remarkable performances of Wagner's "Parsifal," with the tireless Placido Domingo still extraordinary in the title role; Berg's "Lulu," with Christine Schafer as Lulu in an impressive Met debut; and Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos," with Deborah Voigt just wonderful in her signature role.
And as if in answer to the accusation that the Met operates on a lower level when Mr. Levine is not on the podium, two of the company's most stunning productions in years were non-Levine events. In the spring Valery Gergiev, with a brilliant production team brought mostly from the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg, offered a gripping account of Prokofiev's "Gambler." And just this month, two Germans, the conductor Christian Thielemann and the director Herbert Wernicke, in his American debut, collaborated in a musically and dramatically enthralling production of Strauss's long and difficult "Frau Ohne Schatten," with Ms. Voigt surpassing herself as the Empress.
Carnegie Hall was, once again, an exemplar of balanced, innovative and important programming. When Pierre Boulez conducted three concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic in March, his modernist inclinations and the orchestra's time-tested elegance blended fascinatingly in works by Bartok, Stravinsky, Webern, Bruckner and Mahler. The mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, with the excellent period-instrument ensemble Il Giardino Armonico, offered a revelatory program of little-known arias by Antonio Vivaldi in February. Ms. Bartoli is single-handedly altering the general perception of Vivaldi as a human concerto factory. Daniel Barenboim's three concerts with the Chicago Symphony in October offered some compellingly performed Wagner: lots of it, including Act I of "Die Walkure" and the complete "Tristan und Isolde." For me, the memorable work in those programs was Elliott Carter's engrossing and ingenious new Cello Concerto, written for and performed by Yo-Yo Ma. It was the most exciting new work I heard this year.
The French pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, best known for his work in contemporary music, gave the recital of the year at Carnegie Hall this month. In an intelligently fashioned program, Mr. Aimard made striking connections between Berg, Beethoven, Liszt, Debussy and Ligeti. They all emerged, rightly, as radical voices. The young Christopher Taylor deserves special mention for his transfixing performance of Messiaen's "Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jesus," nearly two and a half hours of staggeringly difficult music, at the Miller Theater in February.
A notable appointment this year was Mr. Levine's as the next music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It makes sense both for the orchestra and for him. But everyone in the business will be watching to see what happens when he takes the helm full-time in 2004, for Mr. Levine extracted, on a two-year trial basis, a potentially important concession from the musicians.
Invoking the simple principle that some works are harder than others, he asked for flexibility in the union-enforced weekly rehearsal schedule. He did not want more total hours, just the ability to add sessions one week in exchange for cutting back in another, depending on the programs. What could be more sensible? But traditionally, unions have resisted any tinkering with their regular workload.
It could be a significant step toward opening up American orchestras to more experimentation and challenge, and in helping these tradition-bound organizations to address questions of mission and relevance that they must ponder, now more than ever.

HEADLINE: OPINION; 
The Gulotta Legacy: His Version

BYLINE:  By THOMAS S. GULOTTA; Thomas S. Gulotta's term as county executive of Nassau County expires on Tuesday.

 BODY:
IT has been a privilege and an honor to serve the residents of Nassau County for the past 14 years. Working with our residents since 1987, we have built upon our strengths and addressed our weaknesses. County property taxes have been controlled, the crime rate has been dramatically cut, unemployment is at an all-time low, commercial vacancy rates are at record lows and residential property values have soared. Today, Nassau County is a far better place to live, work and raise a family than it was in 1987.
 Nassau County is a safer place to live and raise a family. In 1987, 44,465 major crimes were committed in Nassau County. Virtually every year since then, the number of major crimes has steadily declined. Today, major crime in Nassau County has been cut by more than 50 percent and has reached a 25-year low. It should also be noted that despite the increased vehicular traffic since 1987, drunken driving-related deaths have been cut by 44 percent. 
 Our local economy is stronger and much more diverse than it was in 1987. Earlier this year our unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.3 percent, the lowest in the state and one of the lowest in the nation. Nassau's commercial vacancy rate has been cut to 4.3 percent, the lowest in 10 years, compared with a 6 percent commercial vacancy rate in 1987. The low unemployment and commercial vacancy rates have been achieved despite the creation of thousands of jobs and a dramatic growth in office space.
Between 1987 and 2001, Nassau County-assisted projects resulted in the retention of 25,134 jobs with a payroll of more than $829 million and the creation of 16,386 new jobs with a payroll of $447 million. The transformation of Nassau's economy was not easy, as the early 1990's witnessed tremendous cutbacks in the defense industry on Long Island. While defense technology remains an important component of our economy, our local efforts to diversify have created greater stability for our work force. More than ever, our children have reasonable job opportunities.
Nassau County's property taxes have been kept under control. Despite the fact that 75 percent of Nassau County's budget consists of spiraling mandated costs, the county has successfully cut discretionary spending to levels that have enabled us to consistently cut or freeze the county's portion of property taxes. For instance, by modernizing, streamlining and computerizing we have cut the county's work force by 41.2 percent since 1987 without compromising the high quality of government services our residents receive.
Some have suggested that the failure to increase property taxes contributed to the county's fiscal woes. The property tax is the single greatest burden sustained by many of our residents. As property taxes increase home values decrease, older Americans on fixed incomes are forced to move elsewhere and young couples are prevented from establishing families here. Accordingly, it was our objective to keep money in the pockets of our taxpayers. Any loss of revenue in property taxes would be compensated for by increased revenue in sales taxes.
Unfortunately, as county property taxes were being controlled, property taxes assessed by other taxing entities were increasing. As a result, the taxpayer was realizing minimal positive effect in increased spendable dollars through the county's efforts and sales tax revenues were not compensating for the loss in property tax revenues. Working in a bipartisan fashion with the County Legislature, steps have been implemented that ensure the county's fiscal health.
To preserve our county's natural resources, we enacted the Perpetual Preservation law, designed to protect our parks, green spaces and water recharge basins. Nassau County was the first municipality in our region to adopt a countywide comprehensive water management and conservation program. By accessing federal financing, Nassau County has the largest fleet of natural gas-fueled buses east of the Mississippi. Soon the entire fleet will be retrofitted to natural gas. Stringent anti-graffiti laws and beautification programs have significantly reduced visual pollution.
Our quality of life is enhanced by a network of county parks, where family cultural, educational and athletic activities abound. Today the New York Power and the New York Rough Rider soccer teams call Nassau County their home. The Women's Sports Foundation has relocated to Eisenhower Park, which also serves as the site of the newly constructed aquatic center, the largest indoor aquatic facility in the United States. Coupled with a new sports complex at Mitchel Field, Nassau County has become a major sports mecca in the Northeast, holding major national and international sporting events. Not far from Eisenhower Park you can witness the construction of Museum Row, a series of world-class museums that will serve as a major educational, cultural and tourist attraction in the Northeast. The Cradle of Aviation Museum, the pivotal facility at Museum Row, is scheduled to open this spring.
It is no wonder that national surveys cited in Money magazine, Places Rated Almanac and Forbes magazine have listed Nassau County as one of the best places to live, work and raise a family.
I have always cared deeply about the people who live in our county. While there might have been differing opinions about policies, I have always done my best and have worked tirelessly placing the interests of our residents first. I sincerely hope that our joint efforts have provided the hope and opportunity for our children to share in the same dream that caused many of us and our parents to call Nassau County our home.
I offer a parting piece of advice to the young men and women reading this essay. While you may not get rich through a career in public service, your riches will manifest themselves in other ways -- by realizing that you have made a meaningful difference in other people's lives. For this opportunity, I am grateful and thankful to the residents of Nassau County.

Those Were the 'Drop Dead' Days

BYLINE:  By Mark Jacobson 

 BODY:
Amid the neoapocalyptic iconography of 1970's urban decay -- the graffiti-strewn IRT car, the South Bronx 2/3 Fort Apache, Gerald Ford telling us to "drop dead" -- Abe Beame, Carroll O'Connor and Joey Ramone form a distinctly outer-borough triptych. In the context of their mutual heydays, the three can be seen as ghosts of New York past, present and what then passed for a (postmodern) future.
 The city's 104th mayor, and probably its shortest, the 5-foot-2 Beame was clearly a man out of time when he was elected at the advanced age of 67. Chosen in 1974 as the gray accountant antidote to the failed patrician extravagance of the Lindsay years, Beame was supposed to know the buck. Yet he wound up presiding over the city's near financial collapse, portrayed on the cover of Time as a Dickensian hobo looking for a handout. 
 It is a cruel twist of fate, Abe Beame as New York's Herbert Hoover. After all, it was people like Beame -- New York's first Jewish mayor -- who had built the city into a great immigrant empire. Arriving at Ellis Island in 1906, he grew up on the Lower East Side as the son of a Eugene V. Debs Socialist, graduated from C.C.N.Y., taught bookkeeping at Richmond Hill High School during the Depression and lived in Crown Heights with his wife, Mary, while unmeteorically working his way through Democratic Party clubhouse politics. Yet, in charge of a metropolis teetering toward ruin, Beame found himself dismantling the dream mechanism that made possible his unlikely rise to power. He fought with unions, raised the transit fare, ended open enrollment at City University and, perhaps most gallingly to Beame himself, engaged in a contest of vicious racial politics in his 1973 runoff with Herman Badillo, then a liberal democrat -- a campaign during which trucks blaring salsa mysteriously appeared in Jewish neighborhoods in the middle of the night.
By most accounts a decent man who was not without his successes (the 1976 Bicentennial celebration among them), Beame was rarely heard complaining about the sea change that drowned his administration. Venting over shifting contemporary conditions was left to cranks like Carroll O'Connor's well-named Archie Bunker, who waged verbal siege warfare with the newer, scarier New York from his pillbox Queens living room. Upwards of 50 million people tuned in to "All in the Family" to hear the Nixon-loving Archie's weekly rages against "woman's lubrication," "birth patrol," "ecrology" and "minororities." For many, Archie's pre-John Rocker screeds, whether taken with the intended Norman Lear satire or not, amounted to bulletins from the urban crisis front. However, to O'Connor, who was born in the Bronx, grew up in Queens and taught in city public schools for years, Archie Bunker was never simply a bigot.
He was "a human being who is also a bigot," said O'Connor, who felt playing Bunker was primarily "a reporting job, because Archie is a reactor, reacting to his time and place." This was the reason, remarked O'Connor, that he didn't mind being typecast as Archie Bunker. "He was real," O'Connor said.
While Archie has grown increasingly cuddly on Nickelodeon (declawed at least partly because of the vibrant multinational immigrant Queens that supplanted the one he was supposed to represent), the punk world of the Ramones, and their emblematic singer, Joey Ramone, remains eternal. Straight outta Briarwood, straight offa the F train, the Ramones were beyond the prosaic confines of municipal-bond failure. If the world was coming to an end, they opted for low-tech fast-forward time travel, reimagining themselves as leather-clad cartoon citizens of a Bowery-like planet somewhere on the other side of Judgment Day.
Singing about beating on brats with baseball bats and fueled with a disco-eschewing ethic built entirely on three chords, the Ramones were the Beatles of urban decay. Joey, all hair, legs and rose-colored granny glasses, was everyone's favorite. A surprisingly sweet crooning compendium of every adolescent fear, not wanting to go into the basement because of "something down there," Joey, ne Jeffrey Hyman, laughed at grisly Fate because, like, what other response was there, huh, pinhead?
The Ramones played more than 2,000 shows, all at the same breakneck 1-2-3-4 pace, 20 songs in 35 minutes. But a personal favorite, scheduled for CBGB's, remains one that never happened. It was that famously hot July night in 1977 when Con Edison blew up, centerpiece of the yet-unnamed Summer of Sam. Since there can be no rock, much less punk rock, without electricity, the Ramones were canceled, a vast disappointment. As stores were looted by people The Post called "animals" and fires raged around Yankee Stadium, a need for reassurance arose, someone to say everything would be all right. But when the TV finally came back, Abe Beame (no Rudy, he) was nowhere to be seen, not in our house at least. Instead, there was Archie Bunker, fuming about how he would not give blood because his bodily fluids might end up inside a black man. Even that was a rerun, which is how it was, the last time the city was on the brink.

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED: ROGER STARR, B. 1918; 
The Contrarian

BYLINE:  By Jack Rosenthal 

 BODY:
Roger Starr, a restless bear of a man, brimmed with expertise. He knew where to find the best jewelry on 47th Street, the best fly fishing on the Beaver Kill and the most memorable conch stew in Islamorada, Fla. He loved tennis, bridge and pool. He knew classic architecture in Sicily and unusual words like "trunnion" and "gudgeon" (both referring to bus parts and the latter also to fish). 
 He also mastered a series of careers, as an intelligence officer in World War II, head of his father's barge company, director of an important civic association and New York City housing administrator. Then, at 59, he took up the career his son Adam thinks he loved most, as an editorial writer for The New York Times. Occasionally, his opinions were more provocative than persuasive. But invariably, when he spoke from real knowledge, he taught. Here are some examples, in his own words. 
 The Living End. In his 1966 book of that title, he twisted the tails of celebrated urban commentators like Jane Jacobs, who had more prescriptions than experience:
"Concentrate on the urban crowding recommended by Mrs. Jacobs, and you fly in the face of the shrunken populations ordered by Lewis Mumford; put low-income families into middle-class developments, to take the suggestion of Herbert Gans, and you confront Marya Mannes with an even greater loss of the city's tone; refuse to construct truck highways, in response to the pleas of Victor Gruen, and you may be contributing to the very growth of unemployment feared most by Michael Harrington."
Planned Shrinkage. In 1976, Starr contemplated the abyss of fiscal crisis and the blocks of broken bricks in places like the South Bronx. In this magazine on Nov. 14, 1976, he wrote: 
"Planned shrinkage is not a popular idea -- for simply suggesting that the Department of City Planning study it, I was denounced as a genocidal lunatic and enemy of man. . . . Much of the expressed hostility was based on a genuine fear that somehow the poor would be victimized by this policy. But the opposite is true. The poor, who need the greatest service from the city government, would be worst hurt by a failure of the city to use its resources economically."
The Blessings of Public Housing. Starr was often drawn to conservative positions in his later years, but nothing ignited him faster than glib criticism, from left and right, of public housing. Here's what he wrote early in Reagan's second term:
"Does the administration not have ears? Does it not hear the national call for programs to house the homeless? Of all the programs that have emerged over the years, the most effective has been well-managed public housing like New York City's. One in every four public housing apartments is now thought to contain an additional family doubling up with relatives or friends. Each would otherwise be part of the homeless flood."
Westway, R.I.P. One of his great public disappointments was the 1985 death of Westway, the sunken freeway and park proposed to replace the West Side Drive. In four swift sentences, he made the case anew:
"Far from being fatal to cities, automotive traffic brings them to life. There is no sweeping it away in romantic illusion. Westway may have been an ambitious, complicated and expensive solution. It is survived by the problem."
Love of the City. A 1983 heat wave drove people to the air-conditioning of the F train and prompted him to reflect on another time: 
"Back then, everyone except beer barons with bulletproof Packards went by subway. Poets slept in them. Carefully nurtured children took their first independent voyages on the subway (to look at the dinosaurs in the Museum of Natural History). If lucky, they took over the front window of the first car and peered ahead at stations suspended in the darkness while the tracks unrolled like the future itself."

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
Partners Who Run a Different Sort of Steakhouse

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
BEFORE they decided to build the Boulder Creek Steakhouse chain together, its founders considered whether their nearly lifelong friendship could survive the challenges that a business partnership inevitably brings. They decided it could.
 "We are like family," Mario Sbarro said, describing his relationship with Anthony Scotto. "We both like to work and like what we do. We even go on vacations together." 
 In fact, they have piloted several expeditions through Europe, each involving dozens of people of different ages from both families. 
The easy camaraderie stems from similar backgrounds, values, working style and years of familiarity. Mr. Sbarro and Mr. Scotto are both natives of Naples who immigrated to the United States as teenagers. Both were raised in Bensonhurst by families in the food business who knew each other. The Sbarros ran a salumeria, the Scottos an Italian restaurant. Both became family business patriarchs whose operations rely heavily on an extended clan in pivotal positions. 
Mr. Sbarro's name is familiar: his name is on 950 Sbarro restaurants. Mr. Scotto runs four major Long Island catering halls -- Chateau Briand in Carle Place, Fox Hollow in Woodbury, Westbury Manor and the Watermill in Smithtown -- and various spinoff ventures, including the Inn at Fox Hollow, which is scheduled to open in Woodbury next month.
Their operating styles are similar; both men shy from the spotlight, preferring to involve themselves in the endless culinary and managerial details of running their empires.
Harold Kestenbaum, a franchise lawyer in Garden City who knows both men and who is a director of Sbarro Inc., described them as adroit entrepreneurs very much at home in the highly competitive restaurant industry. "They complement each other very well," Mr. Kestenbaum said. "Tony knows the industry from the catering and the fine dining side, and Mario from the fast-food side and the location side."
In 1995, the men went into business together, forming Boulder Creek Holdings with a third partner, Sal Moscato, the owner of the Erga Bakery in Bethpage. The first fruit of their collaboration opened the following year in East Norwich. The eighth Boulder Creek Steakhouse opened recently in Linden, N.J.; the ninth is scheduled to open next year in Brooklyn.
The partners said that they intended for the chain to keep growing, both on and off Long Island. "We definitely aren't finished yet," Mr. Scotto said.
The chain's concept, Mr. Scotto said, fits into the growing category the restaurant industry calls "themed casual." The idea was to create an environment in which women and family groups would feel as welcome as men. 
In contrast, the traditional steakhouse has long been viewed as a kind of male clubhouse, with imperious waiters, limited menus and an atmosphere in which children were not welcome.
"The traditional steakhouse chain, such as Morton's of Chicago and Ruth's Chris, gives off a kind of macho feeling," said Milford Prewitt, a staff writer at Nation's Restaurant News, a weekly trade publication. 
At Boulder Creek Steakhouses, the two founders said, they want to deliver the message that everyone is welcome. "If your kid kicks the back of a chair or spills a glass, it's O.K.," Mr. Sbarro said over lunch with Mr. Scotto at the Boulder Creek Steakhouse on North Broadway in Hicksville.
Mr. Scotto added, "Boulder Creek is not intimidating to anyone." 
While running a steakhouse was new to Mr. Sbarro, it was a case of "been there, done that" for Mr. Scotto, who in the early 70's a founded a Long Island chain called the Steer Barn, which closed nearly 20 years later, a victim of changing consumer tastes, Mr. Scotto said.
By the mid-90's, steakhouses were becoming popular again. "I said, 'Tony, I think red meat got a bad reputation back then'," Mr. Sbarro recalled. "How about we try it again?" 
As for prices and atmosphere, the model the partners had in mind were chains like Bennigan's and Ruby Tuesday. The idea was to foster an easygoing environment where customers could order fish, salads or other light fare without fear of eliciting sneers from staff members. 
"We wanted to create a steakhouse with plenty of food choices and an atmosphere that was fun," Mr. Scotto said. 
In inventing Boulder Creek, they designed a Gold Rush decor quite different from the traditional clubby steakhouse interior. Signs on the wall proclaim the goods and services of such real and mythical businesses as the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, the Boulder Creek Hotel and the Colorado Paint and Pickaxe shop.
The menu sends a similar message. Diners who select Doc Holiday's Primavera might suspect that Doc has returned to the gulch after a visit to Ischia, one of the partners' favorite vacation destinations in the Bay of Naples. Among the steaks, the leader of the pack is the Outlaw, a 32-ounce porterhouse with garlic and rosemary, a gustatory clue to the chain's Italian heritage. 
The family-friendly nature of the chain is underscored by the so-called "Yee-hah Man" advertising campaign begun nearly two years ago. The ads, in print and on television and radio, include a stylized cowboy shouting "Yee-hah!" The campaign, developed by George Lois, the Madison Avenue legend, in conjunction with the EGC Group in Hicksville, seeks to emphasize freshness by depicting a herd of steers roaring through a Boulder Creek restaurant.
"We created something that as soon as you hear it, if you're on Long Island, you think of Boulder Creek," Mr. Lois said.
Along with the Boulder Creek Steakhouses, Mr. Sbarro and Mr. Scotto have begun two traditional steakhouses, Burton & Doyle in Great Neck and Chas. Rothman's in East Norwich, as well as the Baja Grill, a Tex-Mex spot, and Waves, a low-key tropical restaurant. 
In all, the restaurants pull in $45 to $50 million a year, Mr. Scotto said, and the Boulder Creek Steakhouse chain accounts for the bulk of those revenues.
The decision to enter that category, represented nationally by chains like Outback and Lone Star, was a smart move, Mr. Prewitt, the restaurant industry reporter, said. "The price point is manageable to most people, and they are well positioned to come out of this recession pretty strongly," he said. "The only thing that's limiting their growth now is saturation. At this point real estate costs are rising, and there are only so many more affordable locations where they can expand."
Mr. Scotto and Mr. Sbarro said that they both continue to enjoy their partnership, which has involved what Mr. Scotto called the occasional compromise, although never, he emphasized, involving food quality.
"When you have a partner, you have to learn give and take a little," Mr. Scotto said, smiling broadly. 
Mr. Sbarro nodded. "He's a great partner," he said. "Of the two of us, he's the people person."
Mr. Scotto smiled again.

HEADLINE: Going Out of Business? They Can Help 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL 

 BODY:
ON Nov. 30, 125 conservatively dressed men and women gathered to bid on some of the choicest real estate in the metropolitan area. Because Lechters Inc., the housewares giant, had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, DJM Asset Management of Melville was conducting a "going out of business" auction of all 315 of its stores. The sale, held in Manhattan at the crowded offices of Lechters's lawyers, was a controlled and orderly event, evoking the low-key sophistication of Sotheby's and Christie's.
 DJM and Keen Realty Consultants of Great Neck are two of a mere handful of companies that financially troubled retailers turn to when they need to unload their stores as expediently as possible. 
 DJM and Keen are sometimes referred to as the "repo men of retailing," and when companies go bust, they are on the scene faster than the "everything must go" signs are posted. Armed with expertise in bankruptcy law and real estate, these liquidators can assess a property's value, from its rent and location to its electrical system and ceiling height. Both companies seek to raise cash for their debt-ridden clients and help them avoid paying rent on faltering stores. 
Often, properties are disposed of through a highly publicized auction. Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection allows failing companies to hold on to their stores' leases until they expire, and subletting, particularly for choice locations, can bring in millions. For their efforts, brokers like DJM and Keen get commissions ranging from 3 percent to 7 percent on the cash they raise.
The economy's slide has meant big business for these brokers. DJM has liquidated a record 50 million square feet of retail space this year, compared with 18 million last year.
"Every year there's one sector that gets clobbered, and this year it was anything to do with housewares," said Andy Grazer, DJM's co-president. "We had no problem selling on Long Island. Businesses still want to come here, and real estate is still desirable." 
Mr. Grazer auctioned off a total of 80 Lechter leases, and the remaining 235 or so will revert to their landlords. Of the chain's 15 Long Island locations, 11 were sold at the November auction: Lechters stores in Freeport, Oceanside, Bridgehampton, Riverhead and Massapequa were snatched up by well-known retailers like Strawberry, Coconuts, the Children's Place and Payless. Mr. Grazer estimated that about 90 percent of the $6.5 million raised at the auction came from stores on Long Island and in New York City. 
Keen held its own auction in November to sell the leases of Cosmetics Plus, after the chain, based in New York, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August.
In contrast to DJM's low-key auctions, Keen's are exercises in "sheer craziness" and not "prim and proper like Sotheby's," said its president, Harold Bordwin. He said the recent Cosmetics Plus auction was not as successful as he had hoped, and he attributed the inability to sell all 21 leases to the terrorist attacks.
"The auction didn't go well," he said. "It was hard to find a lot of prospects. People are more conservative in the aftermath of Sept. 11." 
While the lease for a store on Fifth Avenue was sold to Coach for $725,000, there were no bidders for the 5,700-square-foot store at the Source mall in Westbury. . Control of the property reverted to the landlord, the Simon Property Group, the largest mall owner in the country, whose holdings include Roosevelt Field and the Walt Whitman Mall as well as the Source.
Because bankruptcy law allows companies to retain their leases, landlords will often bid for the leases on their own property. 
Typically, the liquidation process runs smoothly under the supervision of federal bankruptcy courts, which generally send a court reporter to lease auctions to record the proceedings. Often a company will attempt to restructure itself under Chapter 11 and emerge from bankruptcy in fiscal health. But few companies actually accomplish this. Area stores like Loehmann's, Pathmark and the Wiz, which was saved from bankruptcy by Cablevision in 1998, are notable exceptions. 
In the last several years, Long Island has seen some familiar retailers, from Pergament to Caldor, go out of business. In January, DJM expects to hold an auction for McCrory's, one of the country's oldest discount stores. It is closing its remaining 200 locations permanently, including a store in Holbrook. In in its heyday, McCrory's owned 1,300 stores nationwide. 
DJM also helped dispose of the remaining Grand Union supermarkets. Kimco Realty of New Hyde Park, the owner of 500 strip malls around the country including many on Long Island, often buys leases and then sells them to other retailers. It replaced a Grand Union in Plainview with a Fairway store and a Caldor in Bridgehampton with a Kmart. 
Many of the retailers in a variety of sectors have suffered from the success of retail wonders like the Home Depot, Wal-Mart, Target and Bed Bath & Beyond. These stores are what brokers refer to as "category killers."
Harold Bordwin of Keen called Cosmetics Plus a "terrific franchise" that got eaten away by the increase in discount drugstores like Duane Reade and the vast brand selection at Sephora. 
Earlier this year, Keen handled a bankruptcy auction for Family Golf Centers, based in Melville, which had been the country's largest operator of driving ranges. At a large auction in Manhattan, Keen disposed of 60 Family Golf properties, including sites in Syosset, Farmingdale and Lake Grove. 
Family Golf's 169,000-square-foot Sports Plus Center in Lake Grove was the single biggest money maker in the $103 million auction, fetching $10 million for the 42 years remaining on its lease. The center, which never closed, has an ice-skating rink, bowling alleys, 200 video arcade games and a rock-climbing wall. 
While the brokers are concerned with the dollars-and-cents aspects of their transactions and with raising as much money for their clients as possible, they are not immune to the human toll that a bankruptcy filing takes on a company and its employees. 
"There's a lot of difficult emotion," Mr. Bordwin said. "Any time companies are liquidating, people are fired. Others are left behind to do the work of many."

Animals as Art
The myriad ways in which artists portray animals in paintings, sculpture and illustrations is being explored in a family exhibition at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich through March 10.
 By comparing several artists' concepts with taxidermy mounts of real animals, children get a first-hand experience with creative imagination at work. 
 "The Real and the Imagined: Animals in Children's Book Illustration," as the display is titled, contains 27 animal mounts from the museum's natural history collection.
They include comparing an 8-foot-tall grizzly bear, say, to the Paddington Bear. Preserved foxes, wolves, mice, raptors, woodland birds and city swallows are matched with 70 pieces of original art by William Wallace Denslow, Wendell Minor, Grace G. Drayton, Fred Banbery, Nancy Carol Willis, John Schoenherr and others. 
The books for which the artwork was done are on display as well, and children are invited to sit at leaf-shaped tables on mushroom-shaped stools to read them.
The museum, at 1 Museum Drive, near Exit 3 of I-95, is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission for adults is $4; students and people 65 and older pay $3. Children under 5 are admitted free. Admission is free for everyone on Tuesdays.
For more information, call (203) 869-0376.

Designers Highlighted
Two fashion designers are being celebrated in an exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford called "Architects of American Fashion: Norman Norell and Pauline Trigere."
While both Mr. Norell and Ms. Trigere were icons of elegance, simplicity and timelessness, they worked in very different ways.
Mr. Norell, who died in 1972, drew his designs, sometimes with notations and fabric swatches attached. Ms. Trigere cut and draped fabric freehand on a live model.
They were both recipients of two Coty Awards each and one Hall of Fame Award each.
Ms. Trigere closed her atelier in 1992, but today, at the age of 92, she continues to design accessories, perfume, $125 pill boxes, $25 hearing aid cases and $95 walking sticks.
She was awarded the medal of the Legion of Honor in ceremonies held at the French Embassy in New York on Dec. 16.
Ms. Trigere was born in Paris, but achieved her reputation as a preeminent American designer in New York from the 40's through the early 90's.
Visiting hours at the Atheneum are Tuesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $7, students and adults 62 and older $5, ages 6 through 17 $3. Admission is free on Thursdays and before noon on Saturdays. Information: (860) 278-2670.

Anyone for the Beach?
One can take some deep breaths and unwind from the holidays during a nature walk along the beach and among the dunes with Colleen Noyes, naturalist educator at the Connecticut Audubon Coastal Center in Milford. 
The group will walk south from the center at 1 Milford Point Road on Saturday at 2 p.m., headed for the sandy shore.
To register at $6 for adults, $4 for children: (203) 878-7440.

Toy Train Exhibition
There was a time when the mention of toy trains was synonymous with the name of A. C. Gilbert, a Yale man from Oregon who enrolled at the college in 1903 and remained in New Haven to build his internationally celebrated toy train company.
When real railroads took a back seat to planes and automobiles in the 1960's the passion for toy trains ebbed, but it is regenerating along with renewed interest in train travel.
This is the 16th consecutive year that the Eli Whitney Museum has mounted a holiday exhibition of Mr. Gilbert's Railroad. This year's display features his famous American Flyer trains of the 40's; they are still running like new along an elevated platform 12 feet wide and 30 feet long.
Circus cars, Pullman sleepers, freight cars and coal cars are pulled by locomotives through a re-creation of New Haven, from coal mines to Yale to downtown to outskirt farms. 
Visitors can operate the trains by pushing buttons placed along the edge of the platform at 15 locations. They can also craft trains with interchangeable parts, view Mr. Gilbert's Erector sets and browse the gift shop.
The museum, at 915 Whitney Avenue in Hamden, just over the line from New Haven, is open Wednesday through Friday from noon to 5 p.m.; Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m.
Admission is $3 for adults, $2 for children.

Lectures in Darien
"Turkey, Bridging Two Worlds," a series of five lectures, will be given by a roster of speakers beginning this week in Darien.
Peter Awn, from the Department of Religion at Columbia University, will kick off the series on Thursday at 10 a.m. His topic will be "Turkish Culture -- A Balancing Act."
The lectures, organized by the Darien Community Association at 274 Middlesex Road, will continue on subsequent Thursdays through the end of January.
"Architecture and National Identity in Modern Turkey" will be discussed by Sibel Bozdogan of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's School of Architecture, on Jan. 10, followed on Jan. 17 by Stephen Kinzer, a former New York Times bureau chief in Istanbul, speaking about "Crescent and Star." 
Two speakers are scheduled on Jan. 24 when Oner Ayan of Raymond James Financial talks about "The Turkish Economy and the European Union," and Tosun Aricanli of the Department of Community Economic Development at Southern New Hampshire University explores "U.S.-Turkish Relations, Yesterday and Today." The final subject will be "Turkey's Long Struggle for Human Rights Reform," addressed by Neil Hicks, a member of the Lawyers Committee on Human Rights.
With the exception of the program on Jan. 17, which takes place with a reception at 7:30 p.m., all the lectures begin at 10 a.m. The cost is $50 for the series and $15 for individual sessions.

HEADLINE: Memories And More 

 BODY:
Every day the memorials continue, as they should, for the dead of Sept. 11.
 This article is not about those memories. It's about other lives that ended in the year 2001, lives that ended as many of them were lived: without fanfare, without headlines in the local paper, let alone the national press. 
 Marcelle S. Fischler has written a collection of vignettes about lives that changed Long Island for the better in ways large and small. In a year when so much was lost, here are other memories worth preserving.

Helping the Outcasts
Teresa Kennedy and Sister Mary Waters worked as a team, founding Mercy Center, which operates homes for homeless and unwed pregnant teenagers on the South Shore of Suffolk County. 
It was the early 1980's and the cases poured in. A mother who had recently remarried wanted her teenage daughter to move out. The new husband didn't want her. The girl needed a place to live.
Sister Waters, who worked at a parish outreach program in Blue Point, sought help from Mrs. Kennedy, who was a dedicated volunteer case workers and also a friend. In 1983, they opened a shelter in Patchogue for 16- to 20-year-old girls. 
Two years later, after being approached for help by the Suffolk Network for Adolescent Pregnancy, they opened two community residences for unwed pregnant and parenting teenagers, and later, three other homes as part of a supervised transitional independent living support program. Since then, the homes have taken in 1,000 young women. 
Mrs. Kennedy, known as Tee, made the Mercy Center her mission. Her own children were nearly grown and she threw herself into volunteerism. Full of spunk, determination and political savvy, Mrs. Kennedy made connections and allayed fears in Islip and Sayville that the homes would be disruptive. As president of the board she was instrumental in setting policy for the agency. 
"A lot of the credit and the development of the programs and the ambience that the center brings to these girls was very much due to her influence," Sister Waters said, recalling how Mrs. Kennedy often was able to help the teens reconcile with their parents.
Mrs. Kennedy died of brain cancer on Aug. 22 at age 66.

A Force for Integration
The draft had begun but James Davis volunteered to join the Army during the Korean War. Like all the recruits, he was proud to be able to serve his country. Off he went, from Glen Cove to Hempstead and then on to Fort Dix, N.J., without a hitch. But when the new recruits left Fort Dix, the whites were sent to one rail car and the blacks to another. 
The experience of discrimination shaped his future. After his discharge in 1951 as an Army sergeant, Mr. Davis joined the Glen Cove N.A.A.C.P. and became a civil rights leader on the Island. Later he was director of the Long Island Regional N.A.A.C.P.
Schools in Glen Cove were segregated in the early 1950's. South Elementary, where his daughter, Sheryl, was enrolled, was predominantly black. The three other schools in the district were white. Mr. Davis filed suit, naming Sheryl, then 6 or 7, now Sheryl Goodine, as the plaintiff. After much resistance, Ms. Goodine recalled, the Board of Education relented, and the children from South were bused to the other schools. 
"He really did help to change the face of Glen Cove," Ms. Goodine said. "He forced the integration of the Glen Cove Volunteer Fire Department and the Glen Cove Police Department." 
As president of the Glen Cove N.A.A.C.P., Mr. Davis was instrumental in passing open housing laws in Glen Cove and Nassau County. The branch established a not-for-profit development fund and opened 54 units of low- and moderate-income housing on Dickson Street in Glen Cove. 
In 1964, Mr. Davis ran for mayor of Glen Cove. He didn't win, but that wasn't the point. He managed to draw attention to the needs of the minority community. He also took part in voter registration drives in Mississippi in the late 1950's and early 1960's and marched with Martin Luther King Jr. from Selma to Birmingham. 
After he retired in 1984, Mr. Davis volunteered for the Glen Cove Child Daycare-Head Start Center and secured financing for the center to relocate. It was later dedicated as the James Davis Glen Cove Child Day Care/Head Start Center. For many years, he was chairman of the Martin Luther King Commission in Glen Cove. In the 1990's, Mr. Davis had a Sunday morning radio show on WHLI, "Focus on the Black Community," that was broadcast in the tristate area. 
Mr. Davis died of kidney failure on Nov. 13. He was 74.

Death and Taxes
F. Daniel Moloney had a positive outlook and a great sense of humor. He had to. He dealt with the only two certainties in life: death and taxes. And he took a lot of ribbing for it.
Mr. Moloney, Brookhaven Town's tax receiver for the past 22 years, was also a mortician, the founder and owner of five local funeral homes and a multifaith tribute center that bore his family name. "I tell people who complain that I don't raise taxes, just collect 'em," he once said. "Same in the funeral business. I have nothing to do with people dying. I just bury them."
Mr. Moloney never wanted the bereaved to feel like they were coming to a funeral home. Instead, he created park-like settings with gazebos, fountains and bronze statues of children at play. "They were coming down to Dan's place," said one of his eight children, Peter Moloney. "We got away from that dreary, dark atmosphere of funeral homes past." 
To create Irish cheer, Mr. Moloney placed cuddly stuffed sheep, pigs, dogs and other farm animals on the lawn outside his Lake Ronkonkoma funeral home. Inside, he painted the walls bright colors, lining the shelves and tabletops with Hummels and porcelain figurines and putting out stuffed animals and dolls for children.
His style once earned him a national "Pursuit of Excellence" award from the Funeral Directors Association for "special in-house activities." That included tours of the facilities -- the other homes are in Holbrook, Bohemia, Central Islip and Hauppauge -- and a crematory that offered closed-circuit viewing for the deceased's family. And he piped in uplifting music: Liberace and traditional Irish folk tunes, not dirges. 
When Mr. Moloney opened his first funeral home in Lake Ronkonkoma in 1962, he had only $24 in the bank. Trying to develop a customer base, he drove a woman to the hospital every day to see her husband. When he died, she went somewhere else. He joined every organization that he could, trying to get his name out. That eventually led to politics and to the Moloney family funeral homes becoming the largest family-owned and operated funeral chain on the Island. (There was also a power boat named Gonna Getcha).
"The toughest campaign for tax receiver I ever had was 18 years ago when I was running against a psychologist who claimed I didn't take the job seriously enough," Mr. Moloney said in an interview in 1996. "At a public debate in Patchogue, someone asked him if he was elected would any of his patients visit him on the job. He said that would rarely happen. Then I got up and said: 'I'm Dan Moloney, owner of the local funeral parlor. I can guarantee none of my clients will ever show up at Town Hall.' The place broke up and I won running away."
Mr. Moloney died of cancer on Aug. 26 at age 63. 

Law Enforcement Innovator
Every boulevard in Long Beach abuts the beach and teenagers like to hang out under the 2.2. miles of boardwalk. As police commissioner, Thomas Browne realized it would be easier to patrol there if his officers were on bicycles rather than in cars. 
The program was an instant success, one of a series of policing triumphs that Mr. Browne instituted during his 27-year law enforcement career. Mr. Browne also started the department's domestic violence unit and a Drug Abuse Resistance Education school program.
"He did more than any police commissioner with more interaction with the police department and the schools," said Kenneth Cohen, who succeeded him. 
Under Mr. Browne's leadership, officers participated in career days, read stories to schoolchildren and got to know the youngsters from elementary through high school. And he instituted community policing, assigning certain officers to particular neighborhoods at certain times to create familiarity. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Browne aggressively recruited minority police officers for the 77-member force. He even started classes with his wife, Jeanne, to tutor minority applicants to better prepare them for the civil service examination.
"He enjoyed being in the community and working with the people on a more personal level," Mrs. Browne said. "He was very determined. He was always, always, always looking to help someone else. He thought any position of power should be used to help." 
He died of cancer on April 1 at age 57. 

Pioneering Cardiologist
When a heart attack occurs, the quickest way to open the blocked artery is angioplasty, passing a wire through the artery to the heart with a balloon and stent.
Until Robert Rubino, a cardiologist, launched the primary angioplasty programs at Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip and Southside Hospital in Bay Shore last May under a New York State program, using that technique wasn't possible in the area.
Dr. Rubino was the first interventionalist to join South Bay Cardiovascular Associates in West Islip and the first to do primary angioplasty at both hospitals. Having Dr. Rubino working the catheterization lab meant that South Shore patients would receive the treatment of choice, with less damage to the heart than the alternative of using drugs to dissolve the clot causing the attack. He also did elective angioplasty at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, where he had completed a fellowship in interventional cardiology. 
"He brought the standard of cardiac care for this community to the premier level, so the people in this community now can receive on an emergency basis a treatment that is exactly the same that they would receive in any tertiary care hospital, St. Francis or Manhattan," said Dr. Larry Altschul, director of cardiology at Good Samaritan. "If they came in with a heart attack, they have an equal chance of living."
Dr. Rubino, of Manhasset, was a gentle, soft-spoken physician with a good bedside manner, able to put patients at ease. 
"He had that rare ability to bring a certain level of calm to a highly stressful situation," Dr. Altschul said. "In the catheterization lab, he had the kind of personality where he could take a high stressful situation and bring down the level of anxiety to a very workable, comfortable level." 
Because of the success of the program Dr. Rubino launched, 23 other hospitals in New York State have been given permission to do primary angioplasty.
Dr. Rubino, 40, died in a car accident on Aug. 5, the 11th anniversary of his marriage to Debra Guzov.

Starting a College
It was an adventure for Thomas F. Irvine to start a college from scratch.
When the State University of New York system was created 40 years ago, Dr. Irvine was hired to start the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences for the State University at Stony Brook. Before the campus was built, the college was housed in temporary quarters at the Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay. 
He would take prospective professors out to Port Jefferson and tell them, "I can't offer you much money, but how can you turn down this view?" said his son Thomas Alexander Irvine, surmising that as a landlocked child from Pittsburgh, his father was drawn to take the job for its proximity to the water. 
Dr. Irvine, who was dean for 10 years and then became a professor of mechanical engineering, set the school on a path to become top-ranked nationwide, "the Cal Tech and the Berkeley of the east," said Fu-Pen Chang, a professor in the department of mechanical engineering.
Dr. Irvine's specialty was heat and mass transfer and he was a vigorous advocate of international cooperation in his field. He held appointments at laboratories in Germany, Yugoslavia, Britain and Italy. In 1972 he founded a technical journal, "Heat Transfer: Soviet Research," which led to direct cooperation between American and Soviet scientists.
Though many of the applications of his work are in the atomic energy industry, his personal political stance was pro-conservation, his son said. He rode a moped to work, rain or shine, and cut an interesting figure on campus with his tweed suit, knickers and tie. An avid amateur recorder player and collector, he practiced during lunch hour and loved to listen to and sing hillbilly music, accompanying himself on the harmonica.
Dr. Irvine built his own fiberglass houseboat, never venturing past the landlocked waterways of the North Shore. "We never went on vacation, but sat in the mud in East Setauket harbor," Thomas A. Irvine recalled.
Dr. Irvine, of St. James, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on June 2 at age 78. 

Helping the Victims
Before the 1970's, there were neither shelters nor services for abused spouses. Crisis centers for rape victims didn't exist and there were no mandatory arrest policies or preventive education.
Millie Steinberg, who was one of the first women elected to the Suffolk County Legislature when she took office in 1973, raised her voice. A mother of three from Setauket, she dared to say that domestic violence and sexual assault were unacceptable crimes. In 1976, she helped create the Victims Information Bureau of Suffolk, which provides counseling, legal advocacy and other services to victims of domestic violence and rape, sexual assault and elder abuse and community education, said Pamela C. Johnston, executive director of the nonprofit organization.
"You really had to be a strong advocate to be heard back in those days," Ms. Johnston said. "Her spirited and intelligent advocacy paved the way for major changes in the way Suffolk County law enforcement and the courts respond to domestic violence and sexual assault. Nearly three decades later, Suffolk County still leads the way in public policy and service provision for victims." 
A liberal and a feminist long before it was popular, Ms. Steinberg also worked for women's rights, civil rights and reproductive freedom. Long before anyone took up the no-smoking charge, Steinberg wore a T-shirt proclaiming "Lungs at Work: No Smoking" to the legislature. 
Ms. Steinberg died on July 9 of complications from a fractured hip. She was 91. 

A Late Bloomer
Roger Wunderlich, the historian who founded and edited the Long Island Historical Journal, received his bachelor's degree at the State University of New York at Stony Brook at age 68, a master's at 69 and a doctorate at 71. 
"He always said he went to life in order to go to school," said his daughter, Elizabeth Ewen, a history professor at SUNY-Old Westbury. "He was like a self-taught man."
Dr. Wunderlich was always enchanted by history, literature and philosophy, but it wasn't until he retired that he was able to pursue his passion full time. When Ms. Ewen received her doctorate, it inspired her father to do the same. His doctoral thesis was on Modern Times, an obscure libertarian village established 140 years ago in what is now Brentwood. "Low Living and High Thinking at Modern Times, New York," was published when he turned 78.
Upon graduation, Dr. Wunderlich joined Stony Brook's history department, becoming a research associate professor. On campus, he was known as the "sage of Long Island."
"He felt the way Long Island history had been studied before was ancestor worship," Ms. Ewen said. "He wanted to create a social-political history of Long Island. He thought the history of Long Island was a microcosm of America."
He said the key to its history was the three-tiered evolution from rural (1640-1910), to suburban (1910-1965) to postsuburban (from about 1965 on). Students clamored to get into Dr. Wunderlich's Long Island history course, which was always overenrolled. The Long Island Historical Journal was also an immediate hit. 
Born in Manhattan, Dr. Wunderlich spent a year at Amherst but had to drop out because of the Depression and went to work for the family's greeting card business. He married Frances, his wife of 60 years, and enlisted in the Army. In 1945, they moved to New Hyde Park, purchasing a house under the G.I. bill, later settling in Port Jefferson and working as a traveling salesman, selling books and stationery for a small company and enjoyed his work.
Dr. Wunderlich died May 19 at age 86.

Shaping a Museum
Though it didn't change names from the Museums at Stony Brook to the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages until long after her tenure as director, it was Susan Stitt who initiated the switch.
Ms. Stitt brought the museum out from the doldrums of a sleepy small town museum and into the late 20th century. She was the one who was responsible, in the early 1980's, for expanding the carriage collection established by Ward Melville, the tycoon who spent millions on historic preservation in Stony Brook. She also oversaw the construction of the new, climate-controlled building to house the vehicles, garnering acclaim for the structure and its contents. She expanded the museum's American painting collection, including works by William Sidney Mount, who painted in Stony Brook. 
To keep the collection in one location, Ms. Stitt closed the craft museum in the village. When she hired a professional educator, the department started to teach docents how to explain the collection to visitors. 
"Before that, there wasn't much of that at all," said Sue Wallen, a former director of education at the museum. "Because she was museum trained she was able to lead the museum into a new way of thinking." 
For her achievements, Ms. Stitt received a national award, the Katherine Coffey Award, which has been called "the Oscar for museum administration." 
Ms. Stitt, a native of Virginia, made her own clothes, and loved gardening, travel, cooking, mystery stories and her Abyssinian cats. She had a 30-year-career in museum management, and after leaving Stony Brook became president of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.
Ms. Stitt died March 21 of cancer. She was 59.

An Environmental Mayor
Richardson Pratt Jr. was on the train by 6:45 each morning and returned home to Lloyd Harbor by 7 each night. By day, he was president of the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn as well as managing director and, until he retired last year, chairman of Charles Pratt and Company, which was established in 1891 to oversee the Pratt family interests.
But it was by serving as mayor for 16 years in Lloyd Harbor that Mr. Pratt made his mark. In this quiet, upscale community of 9.2 square miles on a North Shore peninsula, he had a deep commitment to historic preservation and the environment. He wanted to make sure the 3,500 residents were aware of the importance of the wetlands, open space and trees. 
Lured by the open space quickly disappearing in Nassau County, Mr. Pratt bought land in Lloyd Harbor in 1949, and moved there with his wife, Jan, in 1963. Elected mayor in 1983, Mr. Pratt was determined to protect the village's natural beauty and pushed for the creation of a local waterfront revitalization program to help keep control over areas such as Caumsett State Park, Target Rock National Wildlife Preserve, Coindre Hall and West Neck Beach.
Lloyd Harbor finally adopted the program in 1996, making it one of only a few villages with access to powerful legislation that gave local government influence, and in some cases control, of capital projects and permits issued by state or federal agencies.
Mr. Pratt died of pancreatic cancer on May 1. He was 78. 

A Lover of Elms
Every morning, rain or shine, Charles Edgar Whitmore was out on his bicycle, riding without socks as he pedaled around the village of East Hampton to check on the trees, particularly his beloved elms. 
While Dutch elm disease devastated most of the Island's elm population in the last half century, Mr. Whitmore, an arborist and entomologist known as Doc, helped the massive old trees that shade Main Street withstand the beetle-carried blight. 
"He was instrumental in developing a program to save the elms in East Hampton," said Mr. Whitmore's son, Jack, who with his father built the largest landscaping company on the East End. "He instituted a program out here that kept the elms viable and kept the legacy of the elms. The elms and the main street of East Hampton have both gone hand in hand."
Mr. Whitmore knew every tree on every property, his wife, Eleanor, said, cycling 25 to 30 miles on his daily tour, always ready to gab with their owners, whether they were clients or not. "He did all his business on a bicycle," Mrs. Whitmore said. "He said he wasn't going to get dressed up or take anyone to lunch." 
It never affected the landscaping, horticulture and lawn work business, which now has 325 employees, and 180 East Hampton and Orient acres where evergreens and trees are raised.
East Hampton had more than 300 elms at one time, one of the largest concentrations on the East Coast. Some were lost to hurricanes. Then the others began getting sick. Working with the Ladies Village Improvement Society and using a fungicide, Mr. Whitmore numbered the elms, identified them and saved just about all of the 135 left. Once he started the program in 1976, the mortality rate went from 25 to 30 trees a year to 1 or 2. 
Last year he received the first Long House Reserve gold medal for his work with East Hampton's trees and for excellence in horticulture.
Mr. Whitmore died March 17 at the age of 81.

Saving a Species
The banning of the insecticide DDT in the United States and many other countries is one of the environmental success stories of the 20th century. It started in 1967 with Dennis Puleston, a naturalist, boat designer, yachtsman, skilled painter of birds and modern-day explorer from Brookhaven. Mr. Puleston was one of the 10 founders and the first chairman of the Environmental Defense Fund, now one of the most powerful environmental organizations in the world, with 300,000 members and an annual budget of about $42 million.
Mr. Puleston, a keen ornithologist and the head of science and public information at Brookhaven National Laboratory, came from England. Ospreys, birds of prey that live off fish, hadn't nested there for 100 years. The opportunity to study ospreys at the privately owned Gardiners Island on the East End was one he couldn't pass up, said Art Cooley, a trustee and co-founder of the Environmental Defense Fund. 
"It was his studying of ospreys on Gardiners Island that led to our understanding that their reproductive abilities were dropping off dramatically in the 1960's," Mr. Cooley said. "Because of the ban of DDT, a whole series of species of birds have been able to return in numbers." 
Mr. Puleston concluded that the ospreys were becoming reproductively extinct as a result of dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane, or DDT, being sprayed in the area to keep down mosquitoes. The insecticide weakened the shells of the birds' eggs to the point that they broke when an adult bird sat on them. In 1966, Mr. Puleston and several colleagues won their first action, a lawsuit against the Suffolk County Mosquito Commission for its use of DDT. 
With Mr. Cooley, Mr. Puleston would take groups of students from Bellport High School on informal field trips nearly every weekend. At Montauk, they watched the seals and sea ducks in winter and in spring saw the annual migration of warblers deep in the Pine Barrens at Warbler Woods on the Carman's River, a piece of Yaphank property that Mr. Puleston ultimately persuaded the county to purchase as part of the protected lands along the river's watershed.
He gave slide shows at garden clubs all over the Island and taught ornithology to adult education classes at Patchogue High School for many years. Mr. Puleston had a "wonderfully gentle way of helping people understand what they were looking at," Mr. Cooley said.
After retiring from the lab in 1970, Mr. Puleston embarked on a second career as a lecturer and a guide, accompanying tourists on more than 200 seafaring journeys around the world, including more than 35 to Antarctica. Every morning at first light he'd be on the ship's bridge looking at albatrosses and other seabirds, quietly helping others spot the wildlife. 
"He was always out on deck," said his son, Peter Puleston. "He never wore a hat. There was always snow freezing in his hair. He seemed to be impervious to heat or cold. He wore the same clothes, winter or summer."
Mr. Puleston studied biology and naval architecture at London University, then, in 1931, set out across the Atlantic with a friend in a small sailing sloop and was shipwrecked at Cape Hatteras. "I staggered to your shores," he once told a reporter.
Undaunted, he completed a six-year odyssey down the eastern seaboard of the United States, around the Caribbean and across the South Pacific, arriving in China just as the Sino-Japanese War was beginning.
Working with a naval architecture firm in New York in 1942, he helped design the DUKW amphibious landing craft used by the Allies.
Mr. Puleston's home was always filled with pets and injured animals, Peter Puleston recalled. He kept dead birds in the freezer to use as models for his painting, sitting down at his easel in the evenings while the children did their homework. And he had a pet vulture named Alger with a six-foot wingspan that rode on his shoulder.
Mr. Puleston died on June 8. He was 95.

A Hispanic Leader
When he was 30 years old, Paul Irizarry realized he had to turn his life around. He knew he had leadership qualities, but being leader of a gang in Spanish Harlem was not taking him where he wanted to go. He was into drugs and into trouble, with a six-month stint in a Kentucky jail for possession of heroin. 
What he needed was an education and a fresh start. So when his brother Frank and his wife invited Mr. Irizarry to join them on Long Island, he jumped at the opportunity.
The lad who cut class, gambled his lunch money and regarded gangsters as role models became a respected Hispanic leader on the Island. He helped build Adelante of Suffolk County Inc. from a Brentwood-based cultural and civic organization known for its annual Puerto Rican Hispanic Day Parade into a multiservice agency for Hispanic residents. Mr. Irizarry was the president and first executive director of Adelante, which means to go forward. 
"My husband believed a lot in education," said Mr. Irizarry's wife, Hilda. "He came from a very poor family. His parents never encouraged education on him. They wanted him to work. He realized without education you are nobody." 
After landing a job as an orderly at the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center, Mr. Irizarry enrolled in its nursing school and became a registered nurse. While working full time, he went to the State University of New York at Stony Brook, earning a bachelor's degree in liberal arts, then a master of arts and a master's degree in public administration. He was 51 when he received his doctorate from Nova University in Florida. 
"He spent most of his life studying," Mrs. Irizarry said. "He said: 'Going back to school is really very hard for me. I have to read and read and read things over and over to really grasp it in my mind. It is not as easy as when you are young. That is why young people should stay in school.' " 
Mr. Irizarry worked his way up from R.N. to staff nurse to head nurse to deputy director of administration at Pilgrim and was a consultant for United Way on the Island.
To make Pilgrim part of the Brentwood community, he brought 1,200 patients to see the Puerto Rican Hispanic Day parade every year. He got the people in the community involved in Adelante and Adelante involved in the hospital. He helped form a bilingual ward for Spanish-speaking patients.
When Adelante was formed in 1966, it was a civic and cultural club. Mr. Irizarry became active as a volunteer in the mid-1970's, and dreamed of building it a home. The high-ranch house with upstairs offices and a conference center in the basement opened in 1989. 
A few months later, he retired from Pilgrim and became Adelante's first executive director. Mr. Irizarry brought in educational services, including computer training programs, English as a second language and a youth leadership program. His vision included supported housing for the mentally disabled, a mental health drop-in center, vocational training, a nutrition program for the elderly and a seasonal lawn service program for the elderly and disabled citizens in Islip town. This year, Mr. Irizarry was the grand marshal for Adelante's signature event, the Puerto Rican/Hispanic Day Parade, the second largest in New York State, after New York City. 
He was 70 when he died of colon cancer on Aug. 11. 

A Painter of Stature
Two years ago, Anne Cohen DePietro, chief curator of the Heckscher Museum of Art in Huntington, stopped by Esteban Vicente's Bridgehampton studio. The artist was painting, working the edges of a canvas filled with clouds of evanescent green. Tables were covered with Dixie cups filled with paints in the vivid pinks, brilliant yellows and lime greens of his wildflower garden. He brushed a horizontal stripe of mint green, and paused. Ms. DePietro remarked that he had been hard at work. "No, I've been painting," Mr. Vicente replied. 
Mr. Vicente, a Spanish-born artist who has a museum devoted to him in Segovia, Spain, and a street named after him in his birthplace, Turegano, was at the forefront of the New York School of abstract expressionism in the 1950's. 
"My culture is Spanish, but I am an American painter," he told his archivist, Ellen Russotto, time and again. "People make a mess out of the world. It takes artists to put it in order."
Mr. Vicente didn't know how to drive, swim or ride a bicycle, recalled his wife, Harriet. When they rented a pond-front home in Sagaponack in 1963, he covered the windows in brown paper so he wouldn't be distracted by the view. The following year, they purchased a simple Dutch colonial farmhouse on Montauk Highway in Bridgehampton, recognizable by the playful, multicolored sculpture on the front lawn.
Mr. Vicente was one of the founders with Elaine de Kooning of the annual Artists and Writers softball game. He was the pitcher. Instead of just throwing balls, he lobbed two oranges, a grapefruit and a coconut that he and the De Koonings had painted white to resemble a baseball; when hit, they burst in the air. One batter was showered with juice, the next with coconut chips.
Mr. Vicente painted seven days a week, Mrs. Vicente recalled, but always had time for visits from children and artists. He taught until he was 96. From the time he was 12, Mr. Vicente drank two glasses of wine every day, very often at the picnic table under the arbor at lunch with anyone who may have dropped in. He used to walk daily to the post office and the Candy Kitchen in Bridgehampton, where he held court with the rich, the famous and the poor, from the mayor of New York to the local plumber.
"Everyone knew the season had started because he walked from the house to the post office," Mrs. Vicente said.
As an artist, Ms. De Pietro said, Mr. Vicente's work spanned the 20th century.
His style changed through a career that included sojourns in Paris, Barcelona and New York.
"What he took from the East End was this amazingly beautiful palette from his garden," Ms. De Pietro said. "Once he came here he brightened his palette. Long Island transformed his palette. His work became increasingly luminous. Everyone talks about the light of the East End and you certainly see that in Esteban's paintings."
Mr. Vicente died on Jan. 10 at age 97.

A Lighthouse Savior
Her headstone reads "Keeper of the Light." 
Giorgina Reid saved the Montauk Point Lighthouse. Wind, rain and the seas were eroding the bluffs around the 200-year-old beacon at the rate of more than a foot a year, threatening to eventually topple the sentinel into the waves. A 700-foot stone revetment constructed at the base of the cliff by the United States Army Corps of Engineers after World War II diminished but didn't stop the erosion.
In the 1960's, when federal officials decided they were going to abandon the lighthouse and erect a steel tower half a mile inland, the publisher Dan Rattiner rallied local sentiment in his weekly papers and held protests and a candlelit vigil to save the light. His crusade caught Ms. Reid's attention. 
A textile designer and photographer, Ms. Reid was fluent in five languages but had neither engineering nor environmental training. After a 1962 nor'easter snatched part of the bluff her waterfront cottage in Rocky Point was built on, she created a terracing system. It halted the beach erosion and she started helping other homeowners. Ms. Reid patented her method in a book, "How to Hold Up a Bank."
She called Mr. Rattiner and volunteered to build a series of terraced steps filled with layers of sand and dead reeds on the lighthouse's bluff face where beach grasses could grow. Coast Guard officials were skeptical but allowed her to try it, Mr. Rattiner recalled, provided she take out an insurance policy in case she was injured. She started the project on Earth Day 1970 and soon expanded across the bluff. After two years, the Coast Guard engineers dropped plans to demolish the lighthouse and began drawing up plans to further her work on a larger scale with federal funds. Ms. Reid continued her terrace building as a volunteer and consultant. 
The stabilized bluff rises about 70 feet above sea level, at a steep angle of roughly 45 degrees. The lighthouse stands 100 feet from the edge. Because of Ms. Reid, the erosion has slowed.
"The nerve of this lady to think she could stabilize the bluff," said Gregory Donohue, erosion control director of the Montauk Point museum, who has continued Ms. Reid's work. "She was a feisty woman, all of four-foot-eleven, with the heart of an elephant."
Ms. Reid died on June 16. She was 92.

A Forthright Publisher
Robert Richner was never a writer or an editor. He went into the newspaper business to make money; the product may as well have been widgets. But throughout his career as the publisher of a chain of award-winning community newspapers, Mr. Richner never let himself be influenced by anyone with a political agenda or an ax to grind. Threaten to pull advertising or publish the legal notices in a competitor's paper? No matter. Mr. Richner stood his ground.
"My dad was a really straight arrow," said Stuart Richner, who with his brother Clifford took over the helm of Richner Communications after their father's health began to fail in 1987. "Extremely hardworking, extremely honest. My dad did not let people sway him even when it came to economics." 
Mr. Richner, of Hewlett Harbor, was a C.P.A. by training. After opening an accounting office in Lawrence, Mr. Richner decided to invest in The Nassau Herald and The Rockaway Journal, which were just down the block and doing poorly. 
"He felt the papers had been under absentee management so long he felt if somebody paid a little bit of attention that there was potential to make some money," Clifford Richner recalled. Before he knew it, Mr. Richner and his wife, Edith, also an accountant, were ensconced at the paper full time.
And though the initial venture was through Republican contacts, Mr. Richner was very independent.
"There is a certain irony," Clifford Richner said. "He got his back up. He immediately started to have fights with the local Republicans out here who expected to control him and get their pictures in. They still do, but they're not quite as surprised anymore if they don't." 
Mr. Richner also started running political endorsements, not a particularly safe move economically for a small paper, and ran an unflattering cartoon about Ralph Caso, who eventually became the county executive.
"He stood up to them," Stuart Richner said. "For someone who would claim he was just in this to make money as a business, this wasn't going along and getting along, which was what the party expected you to do. To this day we still get accused by the Republicans that we're Democrats and we get accused by the Democrats that we're Republicans."
By 1987, he had seven papers, including The Rockaway Journal, The Nassau Herald and The Oceanside Island Park Herald, an advertising shopper with a 100,000 circulation and a commercial printing division. Today, Richner Communications owns 14 community papers and 9 editions of PrimeTime, a free shopping guide. Total circulation is about 200,000.
"He was very progressive in his thinking," recalled Leatrice Slote Spanierman, his editor of 30 years. "He was the kind of person who let a woman take over in those days. When editors had ideas, he backed us."
Mr. Richner approved an open-forum youth section written by high school and college students. And when someone proposed a radical feminist section, he ran a weekly section called "Sisterhood" for about a year.
Mr. Richner was in the forefront of the fight against building the Rockaway Expressway, which would have divided Queens and Nassau. And he was very supportive of Morris Kramer, whose dispute with the Lawrence school district landed in the United States Supreme Court and ended a variety of restrictions on voting rights.
"His integrity and his principles stuck," Ms. Spanierman said. "A lot of politicians put pressure on him. There were rocks through our window and he never bent."
Mr. Richner died Sept. 18 at age 79.

A Coliseum Mover
Joseph Jaspan was known as the "architect of the coliseum."
A hardworking lawyer, he was named county attorney after Ralph Caso was elected county executive in 1971. The Nassau County Memorial Coliseum was close to completion. It was Mr. Jaspan who was responsible for negotiating contracts and bringing in the Islanders, a new franchise at the time, and the Nets, the basketball team that now makes its home in New Jersey. 
Mr. Jaspan hired Peter King as deputy county attorney, giving the future congressman his start in public life. In 1974, Mr. Jaspan became an acting state Supreme Court justice on the Court of Claims. Later he was of counsel to Jaspan, Schlesinger & Hoffman, a Garden City law firm where his son, Arthur Jaspan, is a partner. 
Before becoming county attorney, Mr. Jaspan was counsel to State Senator Norman Lent, who later was elected to congress. He was involved in writing Medicaid legislation for the Joint Legislative Committee on Health. A family man, Mr. Jaspan discussed politics and the law at the dinner table. Both of his sons became lawyers. 
Mr. Jaspan died of cancer on April 5. He was 88.

HEADLINE: The View From/East Lyme; 
The Tale of a Children's Museum Without a Lease

BYLINE:  By JOE WOJTAS 

 BODY:
OVER the last decade, the Children's Museum of Southeastern Connecticut in East Lyme has attracted more than half a million visitors, but it may soon be a museum without a home.
 The Board of Selectmen voted to end the museum's $1 annual lease and to sell the building early next year to the highest bidder. The museum had hoped to extend its lease to 2004, when it plans to open a much larger museum along the Thames River in New London. 
 Andrew Pappas, a local restaurant owner who is one of the founders of the museum, said that he, like some other residents, was bitter that the museum will be moving. He said the founders' intent was to have a small local museum, not the large regional operation that board members now envision. 
"There are some hard feelings among residents here," Mr. Pappas said. "They wonder why we are giving them a dollar a year rent when they are bailing out on us."
First Selectman Wayne Fraser said the town decided it did not want to be in the rental business anymore and could use the proceeds from the sale to build badly needed athletic fields.
The building is valued at $350,000. A new tenant would also generate tax revenue for the town, because the nonprofit museum pays no taxes. The 4,500-square-foot building is situated at the west end of Main Street in the Niantic business district.
"They've decided to move," Mr. Fraser said. "We wish them well, but we're not going to keep subsidizing them when they're moving out of town. It may come out like we're adversaries, but it's not like that. We just want to sell the property and move on."
The town plans to accept bids on the property until February. The museum's lease extension is expected to expire at the end of April. Although Mr. Fraser said the town was willing to sell the building to the museum if it were the high bidder, it is unlikely the museum will submit a bid.
Tony Mollica, the museum's executive director, said the museum cannot wait until February or March to find out if it is the successful bidder because it would not have enough time to get a temporary location before April. 
Although both town and museum officials have expressed displeasure with each other over the last several months, Mr. Mollica and Mr. Fraser are playing down any controversy.
"It's their prerogative; it's their choice," Mr. Mollica said. "You have to respect people's choices. One of the things we haven't lost sight of is that they gave us a great start here. We've done well here and their support has been instrumental in us doing well.
Mr. Mollica said the museum had made a standing offer for the property that he said "is in the ballpark" of the town's $350,000 appraisal. He declined to be more specific. He said the museum had also offered to pay the town $8,000 a year, the amount the property would generate in taxes, if the lease were extended through 2004. 
"Is there really any interest in keeping us? That's a question for the town," he said. "If there is, then that has to be passed on to us. If not we understand that they need to move on to other things. We've tried all kinds of things. I think it just might be time. It's sad, but I have no ill feeling." 
Mr. Fraser said that since the original lease expired in October, the museum had not paid the $2,500 monthly rent that the Board of Selectmen established and then lowered to $1,200. Mr. Mollica said paying the rent would take a big chunk out of the museum's $350,000 annual budget.
Mr. Fraser said the rent was less than the market rate of $3,600 and would help pay some of the transition costs. Still, he said, the town does not want to be a landlord.
"That's not our business," he said. "Unless we're making a reasonable return for the taxpayers we should look at where our funds can be better spent."
Since the museum opened in 1992, it has provided a wide range of hands-on activities, classes and exhibitions for children ages 1 through 12. 
One section of the museum is devoted to science, history and music. There are microscopes that children can use and instruments they can play. There is also a human skeleton, preserved human heart and lungs, meteorites and live snakes, newts, fish and a tarantula. Outside there is a six-ton, two-person research submarine. 
Mr. Mollica said that by the museum's second year of operations, officials knew the building was too small. A consultant predicted that the museum's annual attendance of up to 60,000 had the potential to climb as high as 250,000 if it were in a larger building.
Mr. Mollica said that there were days when the museum had to turn away visitors because it would exceed its capacity of 195 people. "We knew we had to do something to accommodate people," he said.
The museum began looking for a new site, and the town offered property, including a former post office and a piece of undeveloped state land across from a state prison here. The town had hoped the museum would maintain a satellite facility here even if it moved to New London.
"The town has bent over backward looking for a site for them," Mr. Pappas said.
Not everyone sees it this way.
"It's awful that the town has made things so hard on them," said Heidi Messina of New London, who was visiting the museum this month. "They don't want to leave this town. The kids will lose out and that's not fair."
While teaching a preschool class at the museum, Lisa Harden of Clinton said that if the museum moves, the local economy would suffer because visitors would no longer spend money in the nearby restaurants and shops. 
During the museum's search for new location, New London officials offered land in rundown Riverside Park between the United States Coast Guard Academy and Connecticut College. The city offered to improve the park and build a walkway linking it to the downtown waterfront, which is in the midst of a revitalization project. The city has agreed to a 50-year lease at $1 annually.
"It was a tough site to say no to," Mr. Mollica said.
Meanwhile, the museum has begun an $11 million fund-raising campaign and has already received a $500,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Plans call for a 29,000-square-foot building that includes a preschool. One of the design highlights is a recreation of a Charter Oak tree that children will use to climb through the roof of the museum room to an outside viewing platform.
Until then, museum officials were hoping they had a home in East Lyme, especially since in September 1999 the Board of Selectmen approved a lease extension to 2004.
Mr. Fraser, however, did not sign it, something that surprised museum officials a few months later when they found out. Mr. Fraser said that when he learned of the museum's plan to move to New London he decided it was not in the town's best interest to extend the $1-a-year lease. 
Mr. Mollica said: "We don't want to talk about that. We don't want to make things any more difficult than they are. I think there were mistakes made by both parties." 
When the museum's lease expired in October, the board first extended it to the end of December and is now expected to extend it until April when a sale is completed.
The town first put the property up for sale in November and required that the minimum bid be the appraisal price of $350,000. There were no bids so the board decided to seek new offers, with no minimum.
As the town fields the offers, Mr. Mollica said he hopes to announce the location of the museum's temporary home by mid-January.
"It's a shame it had to come to this," he said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS; 
Fee Hike Rankles Some Golfers

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
THERE was no shortage of controversy surrounding Westchester's budget for 2002, which was finalized this month at $1.3 billion.
 The Westchester County Executive, Andrew J. Spano, said that the county, facing tough economic times, must do some "belt-tightening," including a 3.8 percent property tax levy, a freeze on social program spending, as well as hiring and salary freezes. 
 But a smaller item in the budget -- an increase in greens fees at the county's five public golf courses -- has raised hackles among golfers, particularly seniors, who enjoy special rates. People 60 years old and up now pay $11 for a round of golf during the week and the regular county resident rate of $21 on weekends. The new budget raises fees $5 on weekdays and $6 on weekends. 
"I know a $5 increase doesn't sound like a lot to someone making a regular paycheck, but a 40 percent hike is steep for us," said Tom McPhillips, 70, who has played on the county's courses for more than 50 years.
Mr. McPhillips, a retired banker from Scarsdale, said that with the fee increases, courses would lose business.
"There are guys I play who just won't play as much," he said, loading his golf bag into his trunk last Wednesday at Sprain Lake Golf Course in Yonkers. 
Marty Capobianco, president of the Dunwoodie Senior Golf Club, which has about 65 steady members who play regularly at Dunwoodie Golf Course in Yonkers, said "a lot of our guys have been bellyaching about the fee increases" and may go instead to New York City courses in the Bronx.
"They feel they've worked hard their whole lives and now in their retirement, golf is one of the few things they can still afford to do," said Mr. Capobianco, who, at age 90, can still shoot in the low-90's. "We have guys who say they can't afford this, that they'll quit playing altogether."
Joseph A. Stout, first deputy commissioner for the county's parks department, said that fee increases are necessary to pay for renovations of county courses, and for the construction of Hudson Hills, a course currently being built in New Castle.
But, he added, the parks department only recommended a $2 weekday raise for 2002, and $3 on the weekends. Any fee increases must be approved by the parks board, which will take up the issue at its Jan. 17 meeting. The county will have invested about $30 million between 1996 and 2006, he said.
The county's five golf courses close today for the winter and will reopen March 29, weather permitting.

HEADLINE: Fast Tracks To the Past 

BYLINE:  By DIANA MARSZALEK 

 BODY:
IN its glory days, the Yonkers train station was an elegant hub for prosperous commuters traveling along the Hudson River. Designed by the same architects who created Grand Central Terminal, the Beaux-Arts-style building was encrusted with decorative metal and woodwork, crowned with a partially copper roof and lighted by chandeliers. 
 When the station opened in 1911, Yonkers was already a prosperous city in its own right. Copper magnates, businessmen, entertainers and philanthropists were among those attracted to its palatial homes and thriving waterfront industries, as well as its proximity to Manhattan. 
 The large, ornate station was built to serve these people, as well as Yonkers' immigrant population. New York Central Railroad tycoons, who owned and operated the Hudson Line at the time, were determined to create the premier railroad of its time. They built the Yonkers station, with its stylish waiting rooms and covered platforms, to impress. 
Time, though, has taken its toll on the riverfront structure. A casualty of the Northeast weather, wear and tear, and Yonkers' economic decline, restoring the station, which Metro-North Railroad has recently undertaken, requires far more than a good paint job.
"We are trying to bring it back to its original glory," said Mari Miceli, who as assistant director of facilities engineering for Metro-North, is overseeing the project.
That's where Lynn Drobbin and Wesley Moroz come in. 
The pair, who work in Pelham and together make up Lynn Drobbin & Associates, have made a career of keeping the history of the area's public buildings alive. Part preservationists, part experts and part sleuths, Ms. Drobbin and Mr. Moroz have the job of identifying the finest architectural details of historic buildings and structures, and then finding ways to make sure they are retained or restored when the structures are renovated. 
Ms. Drobbin and Mr. Moroz work primarily on transportation projects. Some, like the planned $26 million restoration of the Yonkers train station, are high profile. The station is the first piece of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's and Metro-North's three-and-a-half year, $87.4 million project to rebuild nine Hudson Line stations, including four in Yonkers and five in the Bronx. 
Other projects, however, stretch the imagination of those who are not transportation buffs, who may fail to see the historic or architectural value in pedestrian overpasses, viaducts, roadways and retaining walls throughout Westchester County.
But federal and state law require public agencies to make sure they aren't tampering with anything historically significant when they begin projects such as road reconstruction, repairing infrastructure or tearing down bridges. Ms. Drobbin and Mr. Moroz have to figure out how to do that. It may mean recreating the design of a window, finding an exact tile match or restoring waiting room benches.
Sometimes, Ms. Drobbin said, a structure may be deemed historic because the method or tools used in its construction may be significant. In other cases, the history of a structure is measured more by the role it played in county life or the influence it had on its surroundings and community.
The allure of train stations in Westchester County dates to the early 20th century and the golden age of railroads. Train travel was already such a part of New York area living that George M. Cohan wrote about the New Rochelle train station in his 1906 song "Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway." The New York Central Railroad, which operated the lines that run through Westchester County, was owned by the wealthy Vanderbilt family.
The architectural firms Warren & Wetmore and Reed & Stem, which designed Grand Central Terminal for New York Central, designed the Yonkers and Poughkeepsie stations as well, which echo Grand Central's high ceilings and arched windows.
"Grand Central Terminal was designed to be the symbol of the greatest railroad of the 20th century," said Dan Brucker, a Metro-North spokesman. "Suburban stations were some very close relatives, which replicated that symbol on a smaller scale."
In the intervening years, and as car culture blossomed in America, many stations, including Yonkers, fell victim to neglect. 
Now, however, train stations around Westchester County are getting new lives, not only serving their original purpose but housing other facilities as well.
The Mount Kisco, Valhalla, Hartsdale and Cold Springs stations all house successful restaurants. In Cold Springs, Depot Restaurant has recreated some of the romance of railroading by placing tables on the outdoor platform, allowing patrons to watch the trains roll past.
Neither Ms. Drobbin, 49, nor Mr. Moroz, 44, were particularly fascinated by train travel until their work led them to it.
Ms. Drobbin, whose interest in architecture was initially sparked during a summer college internship in New Orleans, spent the early part of her career working as a preservationist on a variety of projects. Mr. Moroz worked on a computer, which he used to draft architectural drawings.
The two, who were married but have since separated, started focusing on transportation about 12 years ago, when Ms. Drobbin started her own firm after four years as a historical and environmental specialist at NJ Transit. 
Today, the company is in a historic Pelham building that was home to the Sanborn Map Company, which designed insurance maps of buildings that Ms. Drobbin and Mr. Moroz use in their work today.
"The railroads are scenic and romantic and have a sense of history," Ms. Drobbin said. "They are so tied into how this country was built."
Three years ago Ms. Drobbin and Mr. Moroz were charged with finding a way to modernize the Woodland Viaduct, a 1920's bridge on the historic Bronx River Parkway in White Plains that was strained by today's traffic, while maintaining its historical integrity. Because of its historic status, engineers were not permitted to knock it down. With Ms. Drobbin and Mr. Moroz's guidance, they found a way to reinforce the existing structure and improve the roadway while retaining the bridge's original appearance. 
And then there are those gems that pique just about anyone's interest. Most notable has been Ms. Drobbin's and Mr. Moroz's work to preserve Coney Island's parachute jump, a 1939 World's Fair ride that is the only remaining element of Steeplechase Park, closed long ago. Long gone are the days when thrill-seekers would plunge with parachutes from atop the 250-foot steel tower. After years of neglect the structure was filled with roosting pigeons. Its future uncertain, Ms. Drobbin and Mr. Moroz dug into the parachute jump's past to discover how the original ride was constructed and how best to preserve it. 
The idea of recapturing a bit of Coney Island's past was realized as work crews repaired, painted and stabilized the ride to make it a standing (but not functioning) keepsake next to the new Brooklyn Cyclones' KeySpan baseball stadium.
The demand for experts like Ms. Drobbin and Mr. Moroz has grown over the last 35 years, since the enactment of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which was established after the demolition of the old Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. The law requires agencies overseeing federally financed projects to preserve historically significant structures when feasible. States followed suit, passing their own regulations. New York State passed its historical preservation law in 1980. 
Whether a project is governed by the federal or state law generally depends on who is financing it. Since many projects, including the railroad renovations, are financed by a mix of state and federal grants, the overseeing agencies are often required to meet both state and federal standards.
The Hartsdale train station posed a particular challenge for Ms. Drobbin and Mr. Moroz. Their task was to ensure that the building remained true to its past even though a Starbucks Coffee shop was moving into the property. 
The building has been restored in such a way that it retained its character.The Starbucks, which opened in late 2000, sells not only lattes and mochaccinos but train tickets as well.
In Yonkers, city and railroad officials are banking on the renewed train station to be the centerpiece of a riverfront revival, which will also include a new library and park. 
Not only will the improved train station have access to the adjacent river, but also officials hope the project draws private developers to build offices and renovate other buildings nearby.
In doing so, officials said, restoring the train station may help bring back life to an aging area -- and perhaps recapture some of its glory.

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS; 
Truth in Advertising

BYLINE:  By DAVID CORCORAN

DATELINE: RIDGEFIELD 

 BODY:
THE dish is called, simply, Shanghai casserole. On a menu that otherwise bristles with useful information, its entry is unadorned. You choose medium ($13.95) or large ($19.95). We chose large. 
 There were seven at our table that evening, and our leftovers would have fed everyone else in the restaurant. It was an extraordinary dish, at once bracing and comforting, a giant ceramic crock of sturdy chicken broth with pork, scallops, cellophane noodles, salty fish balls and fist-sized chunks of Napa cabbage. All of it was suffused with the insistent, curative aroma of ginger. It was a soup you could get lost in, like a great novel. 
 And while it may have been the best dish we tried in two long evenings at China 46, it was far from the only unexpected pleasure. The place hardly looks like a restaurant, at least one worthy of the name. It squats at the side of Route 46, in a converted diner next to a truckers' motel. Its tall, blaring sign, probably visible from the international space station, promises "Authentic Chinese Cuisine" -- usually a guarantee that the cooking is anything but authentic. 
In this case, however, it's the simple truth. Cecil Wang, the 50-year-old owner, came to the United States 22 years ago from Shanghai. He ran a Chinese restaurant in Lancaster, Pa., then the Beijing Duck House in Edgewater. Last spring, the old diner on 46 -- most recently Phoenix Garden Too, a Cantonese seafood place -- became available, and Mr. Wang seized the chance to present the food of his home city.
I have never been to Shanghai. I'm told it exerts a powerful pull on those who have. Stephen Wong, a writer and consultant on Chinese food based in Vancouver, British Columbia, speaks of a cuisine whose roots far predate the city's powerhouse new-economy ambience and shimmering skyline -- cooking based on mild and balanced flavors, on soy sauce and fermented bean paste and mild doses of ginger and garlic, with much seafood and plenty of braising.
Mr. Wang, of China 46, is particularly proud of a dish called superior ruby pork, which the menu describes as "a giant pork shoulder with mixed herb simmered for hours; served very tender as melt in your mouth." I'm sorry I didn't try it; I take the description at its word. Certainly the entry for seaweed-dipped flounder is on target: "a large flounder filleted, lightly breaded with seaweed powder, then fried . . . our own unique one fish for two taste." More like seven or eight: this platter weighed down the table of an extended Chinese-American family, who took in my pleading glances and offered me a bite. The flounder was crackling and greaseless, like first-rate fish and chips, and the seaweed gave it a haunting maritime tang.
Of many fine appetizers, the most dazzling is a platter of tiny snails, towering over the table like a ski run made of black olives. The way to eat these babies is to place them between tip of tongue and roof of mouth, close tightly, and draw out the meat -- along with a thimbleful of delicate soy-garlic-ginger sauce -- with a single sucking motion. 
Other dishes draw on the Shanghai fondness for gelatinous ingredients -- jellyfish, tripe, sea cucumber, shark's fin -- which are considered particularly nutritious and are prepared in ways that emphasize the spicing rather than the main ingredient. Tripe meets ox tongue in a lovely, vibrant appetizer; the meats' contrasting textures play off against each other, and most of the flavor comes from a hot pepper sauce cooled by cilantro. Chewy, slippery cellophane noodles get similar treatment in a lively sauce powered by capsicum, or hot red pepper. 
Thin-sliced beef marinated with star anise is so soft it almost doesn't need chewing -- an odd sensation at first, but agreeable. Its texture was yin to the yang of a cool, crunchy cabbage in a surprisingly mild dressing of hot pepper, rice wine and vinegar. Familiar appetizers like sesame pancake and pork dumplings were no better or worse than the versions in a thousand Chinese restaurants from here to Lancaster.
Noodles are another specialty of Shanghai, and here they're hearty and unrefined -- snack-cart food. We enjoyed the vegetable chow fun -- broad noodles that drew a pleasant smoky taste from the wok -- and dense, earthy Northern China beef noodle soup. 
Beijing duck is offered here, probably as a crowd pleaser. A specialist emerges from the kitchen with the whole bird on a cart; he is dressed all in white -- apron, T-shirt, Howard Johnson-style cap -- and has the deadpan tableside manner of a taxidermist. He slices with unnerving dispatch. The final product is reassuring, though. The duck is rich, crunchy and ample, the pancakes fresh, the plum sauce dark and unctuous. Another familiar dish, General Tso's chicken, is respectable and forgettable. The only awful dish we tried was sweet and sour chicken, a 1960's relic whose dubious charms have evaporated with time.
The menu at China 46 is bewilderingly long, with more than 200 items (though some were not available on either of our visits, and others must be ordered in advance). This is true of many Asian restaurants, of course. But there are two important differences. The dishes here are genuinely unusual, in a style few Americans have encountered. And they are good -- so good they make you want to come back and see what fresh pleasures await. Fish maw, anyone?

HEADLINE: The Great Red, Green and Blue Way 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
THEY say the light-emitting diodes are bright on Broadway. Just when it seemed Times Square could not get much more dazzling, several new supersigns were switched on recently, transforming a half dozen office towers and stores into colossal, kinetic video monitors and digital displays.
 Though not as charming as the vintage Little Lulu and her Kleenex box or as insouciant as the puffing Camel smoker, they have enough candlepower to be visible at high noon. Millions of brilliant diodes have turned Times Square from an after-dark showcase into a round-the-clock spectacle. Their immediacy was evident on Sept. 11, when hundreds of pedestrians stood transfixed watching the collapse of the World Trade Center on the giant screens. For a moment, Times Square felt once again like Manhattan's town square, with people gathering for bulletins as they had during World War II. 
 Even when the content is far less compelling, the effect of two dozen jumbo screens playing simultaneously and inaudibly -- as if some cosmic "Mute" button had been pushed -- can be utterly mesmerizing. Individual commercial messages are subsumed in the marvelously discordant visual symphony. 
Buildings now wear signs as a second skin. At 745 Seventh Avenue, which is to be occupied by Lehman Brothers, the architects of Kohn Pedersen Fox sandwiched windows between spandrel panels of light-emitting diodes that wrap around and animate the entire base, from 49th to 50th Street. The Reuters and Instinet sign at 3 Times Square breaks the boundary between inside and outside with panels that seem to transmit images from the sky into the building.
Architecture might take an even wilder turn in the future with light-emitting polymers, flexible sheets that could wrap or wallpaper whole buildings, said John Mayo-Smith, vice president of technology at the R/GA Media Group of Manhattan, which developed the software behind the Reuters sign.
Not long ago, owners and tenants fought -- or at least questioned -- the signs required by the city and state to preserve the visual character of Times Square. Now, they exceed the guidelines. At 3 Times Square, the state required 14,000 square feet of signage. A total of 33,938 square feet was created: 15,169 for Reuters and Instinet; 12,769 for the Rudin Organization, developers of the tower; and 6,000 for the Prudential Insurance Company, the original owner of the site.
"It came down to our desire to push that envelope," said Glenn J. Elliott, senior vice president of real estate services at Reuters America Holdings. Edwin Schlossberg Inc. designed the Reuters sign, working with Fox & Fowle, the architects of the tower.
Although the latest Times Square signs are almost exclusively devoted to their sponsors, the owners recognize the commercial potential of giant video and digital displays that can be changed far more easily and rapidly than neon spectaculars, painted walls or even vinyl sheets. In the near term, however, the recession and a growing concern about light pollution may dampen demand for the supersigns.
"The sign industry is not what it used to be," said Douglas Durst of the Durst Organization, developers of 4 Times Square, which just mounted a big green "4" on the east face of the four-sided sign atop the tower. "We'd much prefer to have a tenant," Mr. Durst said, "but besides Teligent, we haven't had a tremendous amount of interest." And Teligent, a wireless communications company that took the west face, filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.
A bill to limit excessive outdoor illumination and "light trespass" across property lines has passed in the Legislature but not yet been signed by Gov. George E. Pataki. Among his concerns, his aides said, are that the lights of Broadway might be affected.
WHATEVER happens, though, it is clear that the little diode -- a semiconductor device that emits light when electricity passes through it -- has conquered Times Square.
"It's a world of L.E.D. components," said Kenton Jenkins, vice president and general manager of W.W.F. New York, which spent $7.9 million to recreate the bow-shaped marquee on the landmark Paramount Building at Broadway and 43rd Street and the arch around it. The marquee leads to the World Wrestling Federation store and restaurant.
While the arch was covered in a hoarding during reconstruction, the federation hung vinyl banners. It cost $30,000 to change them, Mr. Jenkins said. "You're money ahead, 10 years down the line, to put in an L.E.D. board," he said. "They're huge revenue centers in Times Square."
The sign was made by ADF Steel in South Plainfield, N.J., then trucked across the George Washington Bridge. Plans for a gala inauguration were overtaken by the September attack, which left sign operators scrambling to figure out what to display. Mr. Jenkins envisioned a billowing American flag. The diode sign manufacturer, Multimedia of Rancho Cordova, Calif., created the programming overnight and e-mailed it. On Sept. 12, the flag was unfurled.
The Paramount sign sets three new diode boards in a painstakingly recreated 1927 marquee. The original adorned the Paramount Theater, which closed in 1964, and was lost without a trace, said Robert Mark Parnes of Tobin + Parnes Design Enterprises, architects of the simulacrum.
To satisfy the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the new sign had to follow the signature bow of the old Paramount marquee. "This is the first L.E.D. sign to curve in the Y direction," said Andrea B. Dibner of Tobin + Parnes. "Seven or eight L.E.D. manufacturers said, 'You're crazy.' "
Mr. Parnes said that the original had been altered over time and that there was precedent for what seems to be the incongruous contrast of a Baroque frame around pulsating electronics.
The previous existence of another Times Square marquee, over the former Criterion Theater at 44th Street, provided the necessary precedent that allowed Toys "R" Us to build a sign over the sidewalk outside its store, which includes the space occupied by the Criterion. (The sign was made by Saco Smartvision of Montreal, which was also responsible for the Nasdaq sign.)
The electronic sign is not the real scene-stealer, though. That distinction goes to a scrimlike mechanical sign system that changes the store's facade constantly. "It's low tech in theory, but after that, it's more complicated than an L.E.D," said Philip Lenger of Show & Tell Productions of Manhattan, which created the Toys "R" Us signs. The store was designed by Gensler.
The chamfer-cornered sign is a grid of 165 sections, each 30 square feet, behind a glass curtain wall. Within each section is a 48-foot-long scroll between motorized rollers made by the Diazit Company, better known for blueprint machines. The scrolls, changed monthly, are imprinted with seven different images and also have one clear panel, so that the entire facade can be made transparent. Elliott Wahle, vice president and general manager of the Times Square store, said that the sign would eventually become a profit center on its own as a showcase for toymakers and that it would repay the investment, which he did not disclose.
Mr. Elliott, of Reuters, said his company might consider commercial use of its 290-foot-8-inch-high sign, which should be fully running next month. Its chief function, though, is as a "big window into the building," said the designer, Edwin Schlossberg.
"I wanted to create a metaphor for the sign: information coming from the top, from the ether and sliding into the building," Dr. Schlossberg said. Rather than eye candy, he said, it is to be a "vehicle by which the public could see into Reuters."
The sign, which cost more than $20 million, is shared by Reuters and Instinet, an electronic stock trading concern in which Reuters has a majority stake. "We provide data to clients but this is the first time we're able to present it to the public," said Calvin Mitchell III, senior vice president for global marketing and communications at Instinet.
What may be the most talked-about feature of the sign will be a news thermometer indicating whether it is a red hot news day or a cool blue one. Passers-by will be able to look up and quickly gauge whether they should be paying attention to bulletins.
"Hopefully, it will be useful," Dr. Schlossberg said. "We're in such a weird moment where people are desperate for more information but inured to so much."
The "temperature" would be established through a formula incorporating factors like the concentration of stories coming from one part of the world -- say, Kandahar -- and the number of hits that the stories are registering on the Reuters Web site.
Shaped like an inverted T, the Reuters sign is ideally suited for use as a thermometer, since it has an exceptionally tall and skinny stem, 13 by 169 feet, under which is the balcony of the Instinet president's office and a 28-by-46-foot screen. The horizontal crossbar is formed of nine more screens, cascading toward and into the lobby.
It is programmed automatically to draw news, pictures, videos, financial data and graphics from 27 sources; standardize the information; store it in a database; and schedule its display, coordinating images so they move seamlessly across the face of the signs and the voids between them. "Think of the sign as a cable news program on autopilot," said Mr. Mayo-Smith of R/GA. 
The sign was made by Diamond Vision Systems of Lawrenceville, Ga., a division of Mitsubishi Electric and Electronics, and has 5,660,672 light-emitting diodes.
Impressive as that sounds, it is less than one-third the number -- 18,677,760 -- of light-emitting diodes in the Nasdaq tower sign across Broadway. Only two years ago, Nasdaq was the shiny new kid on the block: a quarter-acre cylinder 120 feet tall.
Lately, however, it has been showing its age. As panels burned out because of water damage, those in the center were swapped for good panels on the edge, leaving a blank border. Nasdaq expects that the full array will be back in place early next year.
Nasdaq also intends to improve the imagery, which does not look as sharp as that on the newer signs, by commissioning graphics specially for the sign rather than borrowing and reformatting videos.

HEADLINE: Ballroom Dancing With a Russian Flair 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA VOWINKEL 

 BODY:
ELENA GRINENKO, a Russian ballroom dance champion, left her home in Moscow in 1998 to go to America. In September, she and her boyfriend opened the Dance Zone studio in Old Bridge.
 Peter Vaco emigrated to the United States seven years ago after revolution turned his life in Kosice, Slovakia, upside down. In 1999, Mr. Vaco, who began learning ballroom dancing when he was 9, opened the Indigo Ballroom in Somerville with his wife, Clea. 
 And then there are Alex and Tanya Koulik, who left Russia nine years ago and own the Royal Ballroom dance studios in East Brunswick, Millburn, Rockaway and Ridgefield. The Kouliks, European dance champions who live in Springfield, opened their first studio seven years ago. Their 20-year-old son, Vitaly, is a four-time United States ballroom dancing champion.
Ballroom dance in New Jersey is seeing a small renaissance. About half of the roughly 60 studios that teach ballroom dancing in the state are less than 15 years old, said Mary Wethington, president of the Garden State chapter of the United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association. And along with this growth has come an influx of top ballroom dancing talent from the countries of the Soviet bloc.
"There are definitely a lot of Russians and they're very, very high-level dancers," Ms. Wetherington said.
Other dance studios that have opened since 1998 include the Grand Ballroom in Midland Park, owned by Kathy and David Porro, and the Fred Astaire Dance Studio, a franchise in Englewood owned by Amy Cousins, who said many of her instructors were Russian.
Though Americans have generally been more likely to take classes in ballet or tap and to send their children for lessons in those disciplines, the Eastern European instructors said ballroom dance here seemed to get a boost a few years ago after a Gap commercial touched off a craze for swing dancing. More recently, hit songs by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony have sent people to dance studios to learn Latin steps like salsa, merengue and cha-cha.
The interest in ballroom dancing in New Jersey is reflected in the membership of the Garden State chapter of the dance group. The chapter was founded in 1991 with 200 members, Ms. Wethington said, but in 10 years has doubled, to 400. The national group was formed in 1965 to promote the acceptance of ballroom dancing as an Olympic sport, an effort that has not met with success.
The Indigo Ballroom has four instructors in addition to Mr. Vaco: Andrei Semenov from Russia, Eulia Baranovski from Belarus, Oksana Tryakina from Uzbekistan, Irina Sarukhanyan from Armenia. Two more Russian instructors are on the way.
Competitive ballroom dancing is categorized as either international or American style. The international style is broken down further into standard or Latin, while the American style is either smooth or rhythm. Dancers from outside the United States usually learn the international style.
Mr. Semenov and Ms. Baranovski, who are married and dance partners, took first place this year in the international standard category in a San Francisco competition. They finished in the top 10 this year in that category in a Montreal event. Mr. Vaco and his dance partner, Ms. Sarukhanyan, also took top 10 honors this year in American dance categories in a Boston competition.
"We all start dancing as kids," Mr. Vaco, 29, said. "That was thanks to Communism."
He added: "The government paid for all of my training. Maybe for this reason, Communism collapsed. They have to pay for all the ballroom dancing."
The Dance Zone's owner, Ms. Grinenko, who is 25, started dancing when she was 7. She was the 1994 Russian youth champion and, with Michael Nadtochy, was a semifinalist at the world championships that year. This year, they were semifinalists in a Latin dance category in the United States National Championship.
Most instructors say they immigrated to the United States for economic opportunities, made even more enticing after the 1998 financial crisis in Russia.
"In Russia, you cannot rely on your future," Ms. Grinenko said. "If you are a top couple, you can make money. If you are not a top couple, you do not make money."
Then there is the intangible pull.
"Every time in the world, there is some cultural center," Mr. Vaco said. "At this moment, it's New York. It's the center of the world."
Mr. Vaco said he came to New Jersey because of its proximity to New York and to join his mother and friends who lived here. Ms. Grinenko and the Kuliks said they came to the state because that is where they found work.
Still, ballroom dancing is not as culturally widespread in the United States as it is in Russia and other European countries. 
"People in America, the whole thinking was ballroom dancing means old folks," Mr. Vaco said. "In Europe, it's not like that. It's called dancesport."
He and other instructors said Americans were not as serious about ballroom dance as Europeans and Russians.
"At first, it's very difficult and hard to learn," Mr. Vaco said. "Some people just want to dance for fun. They don't want to become world champions."
The Dance Zone advertises in several Russian language newspapers in New Jersey, and is attracting clients from a large Russian community in the Old Bridge area, said George Falcone, Ms. Grinenko's boyfriend, who owns the studio with her. 
Dance Zone opened on Sept. 12. The studio held an opening party on Oct. 13, which attracted about 200 people, Ms. Grinenko said, adding, "I wasn't expecting that many."
At the Indigo Ballroom and the Fred Astaire dance studio, business slowed immediately after the terror attacks on Sept. 11. But Mr. Vaco said his business had rebounded.
"Not too many people lately want to go to New York," he said. 
At a recent session at the Indigo Ballroom, patrons said Sept. 11 inspired them to take up dance.
"After Sept. 11, it refocuses your priorities on the things you always wanted to do," said Patty Wilson, a 37-year-old from Somerville, who took her first lesson in mid-December and has signed up for more.
"How could you not want to dance?" she said. "It's nice to not have to do something where it's alcohol and bars."

HEADLINE: MY MONEY, MY LIFE; 
To Be Young, Eager and Unwanted

BYLINE:  By ANNA BLUMENTHAL; The writer, who lives in Manhattan, wrote "The Graduate Meets the Slowdown" for My Money, My Life on July 27.

 BODY:
IN May, I graduated from college with four years' worth of information, a half-dozen awards and a lot of self-confidence to go with a decent-sized ego. After taking a few weeks off, I started contacting employers from part-time jobs that I had during school. I thought they'd be thrilled that I was back in town and ready to roll up my sleeves full time. Instead, many said they just weren't hiring. 
 Perplexed, I began to browse the help-wanted ads and send out my resume. It didn't take long for me to realize that the job market had changed drastically since I last looked for work in New York, only a year before. This time around, it seemed that work was nearly impossible to find, especially for a recent college graduate with little experience. 
 After an anxious month and a half of sending out resumes and going out on interviews, I found a job selling advertising at a local weekly paper. Although ad sales was not a field I would have chosen, I really liked my job. Many of the people there were close to my age, and we got along well. The atmosphere was relaxed, and the hours -- strictly 9 to 5:30, and no working at home -- were just fine.
So I should have known that something was wrong.
If the job market was shaky before Sept. 11, it only became worse after. But once the shock and horror of those events wore off, I felt at least fortunate to have already found a job. While many of my friends were still desperately seeking work, I felt safe at my little desk in my office in SoHo.
Occasionally, after hearing about a friend who had lost a job at another company, I would ask co-workers what they thought about the security of our jobs. They would assure me that we were fine. 
"We're the ones bringing the money in," one colleague reasoned. "If they lay anyone off, it definitely won't be the ad reps."
Less than a week later, one of the publishers marched into our department.
"Meeting!" she announced. She said that she had been laying off people all day, and that in my department, the most recent hires had to be let go. About a half-hour later, I was out of work.
I figured, however, that my situation was not so unfair, compared with those of some others who had been let go -- department heads and people who had been with the company since the beginning five years ago. One man who had been there from the start had just married and was on his honeymoon. The day he returned, he had a message on his answering machine that said he should not come back on Monday.
Of course, layoffs are not really news these days. I've become part of a growing sector of the economy. On any given weekday, it's easy to find people to join me for a night on the town; fewer and fewer of my friends have to be at work in the morning (although fewer of us can afford more than one drink). When people I meet tell me they're unemployed, I greet them with a jovial high-five instead of the somber condolences I might have used a year ago.
Initially, being out of work is like a vacation that you didn't ask for; you have no choice but to enjoy the time off. But what's next?
Last summer it was hard enough to find work; finding reason for optimism about the job market post-Sept. 11 is nearly impossible. 
MORE and more, people are scrambling to piece together an income.
One friend poses for figure-drawing classes at art schools during the day, picks up a few shifts waiting tables at a nearby restaurant and posts a friend's coin collection on an online auction site for a base salary plus commission. An artist I know does freelance graphic design and works at night at clubs as a cigarette girl for a marketing company.
In these times, in this city, it seems that creativity -- not a master's degree or great connections -- is the key to success, or at least the way to pay the rent.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Turnaround Prospects After Two Bad Years

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
FOR many investors, the end of 2001 won't come a minute too soon. 
 Unfortunately, many were saying the same thing at the end of 2000. Major stock market averages have fallen for the second year in a row. 
 Steve Galbraith, the new chief investment officer for the United States strategy group at Morgan Stanley, took some time last week to talk about the new year and the odds that the market will hit a dubious trifecta. Following are excerpts from the conversation: 

Q. What are the key lessons of 2001?

A. If you had told me at the end of last year that corporate earnings were going to be down over 20 percent, that Enron was going to implode, that we would be attacked on our own soil but the Standard & Poor's 500 index would be down only 11 to 12 percent, I would have said you were crazy. It shows the resilience of the United States.
The key point to take away from 2001 is that there was no place to hide. Nine of the 10 S.& P. 500 sectors were down, the exception being consumer discretionary companies. 

Q. What does the market's strong recent performance tell you about 2002?

A. My basic pitch is that I don't want people to get too bearish on earnings and too bullish on stocks. The bears think earnings are going to stink, and the bulls think recovery in the economy will be huge. We will get some earnings growth, but it doesn't mean Nasdaq 5,000 all over again.

Q. Why do you part with the bears on corporate earnings?

A. First, earnings in 2001 will be down by a record amount. The reduction has been unbelievable. And, second, managements have had record restructurings, on the order of $130 billion. Plants are being closed and people are being fired, which should help the bottom line.

Q. Do you think technology stocks can continue their strong run of the last three months?

A. Technology stocks right now are trading at 48 times forward earnings. That is a little rich for my blood. I'm not saying not to play in the technology space. It is too big a part of the market. But you can say no to the speculative stuff, or areas where there is massive excess capacity, like telecommunications.

Q. What sort of investing approach would you advise?

A. The message we are sending to clients is to throw out a lot of traditional playbooks. The market this year has been really funky: the two worst-performing sectors were utilities and technology. I don't think that has ever happened.
We are taking an eclectic approach. I would own health care, which is not eclectic, but also industrial commodity stocks, like paper and chemicals, and a combination of retailers, some media companies and some auto suppliers. Three of those sectors are cyclical. The fourth, health care, is acyclical. 
The other message is that people have to get more creative. There are opportunities outside the mainstream, big-cap stuff. People need to look at small-cap stocks, at international markets, at corporate or high-yield bonds. 
Emerging markets are very cheap. It would not be dumb to look there, particularly if we get any kind of global recovery. 

Q. What asset mix would you recommend for 2002?

A. We think it is pretty traditional -- 65 percent stocks, 35 percent bonds.
Over the last 18 months, bonds outperformed stocks by a greater percentage than during any similar period since the Great Depression. 
Bond prices are not going to rally much further, but we take the low yields literally: the market is sending us a message that we are in a low-return environment. That is why I think stock returns in 2002 will be in the mid- to high-single-digit range. 

Q. What developments might make you change your outlook?

A. If Japan, Europe or Argentina get a lot worse, that will hurt, because about one-third of S.& P. 500 earnings come from abroad.
On the upside, if the fourth quarter turns out to be good and we don't get a slowdown early in 2002, then there will be upside through the year. That said, if we don't get really decent earnings gains by the third and fourth quarter, when the year-over-year comparisons are going to be much easier, we are in serious trouble.

Q. Which stocks do you favor?

A. Industrial companies like Caterpillar and ITT Industries, Schlumberger in oil services, International Paper and Eastman Chemical in the industrial raw material area. Airline stocks like AMR. A hotel stock like Starwood. And retailers like Barnes & Noble and Abercrombie & Fitch.

Black Is the New Black

BYLINE:  By Penelope Green 

 BODY:
THE Thursday before Christmas was mild and sunny, yet if you squinted through the late afternoon sunlight, you might have discerned a somber pattern: At the Museum of Modern Art gift shop on Spring Street, three 50-ish women in black leather motorcycle jackets drifted past the felt coasters and bowls on the sale table. On Broadway and 44th Street, a rather conventionally dressed woman sported a black leather skullcap; a young man on West Ninth Street rushed by in black jeans, black T-shirt and black motorcycle jacket. This was not "fashion" black, but old-style urban black, the sort made by American companies like Schott and Walker.
 "Those things are our best sellers," said Lisa Lehar, a saleswoman at International Boutique on La Guardia Place, which sells Schott motorcycle jackets, United States Navy oxfords, Walker steel-toe boots and religious items like rosaries and menorahs. Sales have hardly dipped this fall. "If you're going to buy one thing, it will probably be in black," Ms. Lehar said. 
 New York City looks a little rougher these days, a little raw and dark, and all of a sudden, some New Yorkers do, too. After years of flirting with irrational exuberance in clothing, trying on the sorts of colors usually seen only in places like Texas or Palm Beach, New Yorkers have reverted to the all-black wardrobe that is their birthright, their armor and their sword. Never mind that for a regrettable moment even Giorgio Armani and Helmut Lang fell for the credo that "pink is the new black."
"I had to go to the A.T.M. the other night," said one of my friends, who was pondering his black steel-capped boots and black leather jacket, "and it was late and I was uneasy in a way I hadn't been in a long time." He stepped gingerly past an individual at the door who clearly had no more compelling place to spend the evening, and felt as if the last eight years had never happened. "You want steel-capped boots and your black motorcycle jacket in times like these," he said, not altogether kidding.
For her spring 2002 collection, Alice Roi, a young New York designer, made clothes exclusively in black and gray. "I had done all these really wild collections and colors and short skirts, and that disgusted me," she said. "I wanted to do something serious, and black is very, very serious."
Black is the color of change, said Cristina Bornstein, who is the Tina of Tony & Tina Vibrational Remedies, a makeup line that is one part conceptual art project, one part whimsy.
"In color therapy, black is considered the first color," Ms. Bornstein said. "In the Hopi tradition, the rainbow sprang out of the color black, thus implying to us that black encourages forward movement. Socially, black is a mask: nobody knows what mood you're in if you're wearing black." Ms. Bornstein, suddenly remembering her role as a cosmetics company executive, suggested contemplating a black nail polish called Dark Matter. 
Black has historical cycles, as hemlines used to. "Colors have a clear cultural resonance," explained Valerie Steele, a fashion historian and the acting director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. They are not just the result of whatever is trendy in a given season.
Ms. Steele can describe a century of black: Black as the color of mourning during World War I. Black in the 1920's, in Chanel's little black dress (designed, some say, to mourn the death of a lover) and as an appropriately serious foil to the new role of women. Black in the 1950's as a chic little uniform -- the black cocktail dress with pearls. "Black at this point had a lot to do with 'being correct,' " Ms. Steele said. 
"This was a period when fashion went mass in a big way," she continued. "It wasn't just the socialites and the upper middle class wanting to be fashionable; it was the housewife." Black was an easy solution; black helped you conform. In her book "Fifty Years of Fashion" (Yale University Press, 2000), Ms. Steele reprinted a men's wear ad from the period that warns: "You're being watched! Dress right -- you can't afford not to!"
Black was all things in the 1950's: it was serious and intellectual on the beats, sexy and dangerous on bad boys like Brando and James Dean. The 1960's were purple, and the 1970's were beige, at least until the very end. By 1977, black had returned. Black was punk, then, and black was gay, in the new macho-leather styles. In the 1980's, black was avant-garde, the favored color of the Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo, who declared that she designed in seven shades of black. Black was for career women, too, dressed by Donna Karan in black cashmere. By 1990, black was a cliche.
"Now the riffraff are wearing it," the Village Voice essayist Cynthia Heimel lamented at the time. "People who know what 'leveraged buyout' means wear black. Wearing black has lost its intrinsic meaning."
This is around the time Ms. Kawakubo issued her second color koan: "Red is black," she said simply, and shut the door on the whole subject for the rest of the decade.
Last spring, in Paris, a team of fashion designers named Viktor & Rolf held a runway show they called the Black Hole. They painted the models' faces and hands black and dressed them in beautiful and slightly kinky, slightly Victorian and utterly black clothes. If the models closed their eyes, they looked like 19th-century cut-paper silhouettes. Actually, a lot of the European designers made a lot of black clothes, and a trend seemed indicated.
Many in the business described the designers as sensitive and prescient, equating their black palette with the darkening economic picture. Stores like Bloomingdale's bought and displayed liberal amounts of the stuff. Had you wandered into the shops in those first few weeks of early fall, you would have noted an eerie and parallel sobriety that was in keeping with the hideous reality of the street. Of course, nobody did wander into the stores much back then, and this particular black look ended up in a real black hole, as a seriously underrealized chapter in recent fashion history.
Is the color worth reviving?
"I think it's still a cliche," Tonne Goodman, the fashion director of Vogue magazine, said the other day. "And in New York it feels inappropriate. I certainly don't want to wear black. Too many people are in real mourning."
Kal Ruttenstein, fashion director for Bloomingdale's, worried that his fall windows were too dark. "We felt it was an important fashion color for the fall season," he said, stressing the word "fashion." "And so we went for it in a rather big way. It wasn't because of the economy. We don't believe that when the economy is rough, black comes to the fore."
Sometimes, he allowed, "black is the brightest color of all." In any case, Bloomingdale's spring windows will be white.
"When we saw black coming back last season, it had to do with that corsety-kinky-Victorian look," Ms. Steele said, "with Nicolas Ghesquiere switching from angel white to black and Tom Ford doing a dark purple that was like black. And then the whole season was abortive because of the recession and Sept. 11. Now nobody knows or even cares where fashion is going. If you're seeing black at all, it has to be a vernacular movement coming up from the street."
Ms. Steele, it should be noted, was wearing black leather pants and a black knit shirt. "My shoes are green," she said, "but they were a mistake."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ELMHURST; 
In Little Argentina, Transplants Watch As Their Homeland Unravels

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
The intersection of Junction Boulevard and Corona Avenue in Elmhurst is the New York center for all things Argentine. That means a sizzling skirt steak at El Gauchito restaurant, a cup of steaming mate with flaky vigilantes at the Rio de la Plata Bakery and a haircut from Carlos Liberti's barbershop. (There's nothing particularly Argentine about the haircut, but the shop doubles as an informal employment office for newly arrived compatriots and as the local spot to watch Argentine television via satellite.) 
 These days, Argentine Corner is also where many of New York's 14,000 Argentines come to discuss the economic crisis in their homeland. The crisis has made international news over the last 10 days with televised images of looting and the resignation of President Fernando de la Rua. 
 "Of course we're all talking about it," said Roberto Moyano, a 28-year-old car painter who has been in New York for a year and a half. Mr. Moyano sends more than $1,000 a month to his wife and son in Buenos Aires -- the salary his wife earns as a seamstress does not go far -- and talks to them almost every day. "All jobs are affected," he added. "Every day, the same money buys you less."
In interviews the other day, many Argentines said their relatives and friends back home were desperate to leave. That raises the question of whether New York, which is often a way station or destination for people escaping political and economic turmoil, should expect a flood of immigrants from Argentina.
John R. Logan, a professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Albany and an expert on immigration, said the city should expect some immigrants, but not a flood.
"The economic problems have been building for such a long time," he said of Argentina. "And there hasn't been a substantial migration." 
Some local residents agreed, saying that even people who want to leave cannot afford the plane fare. But others said they had seen many recent arrivals. 
"Lots of people are coming now," said Paola Maldonado, 21, who works at the Rio de la Plata Bakery. "We have family in Argentina that is suffering. They ask us for money, or for help in coming here and getting settled." A customer, Yanela Pena, 17, added that her aunt had decided to come to New York because of the crisis.
Almost everyone agreed on one thing: that government corruption had caused their homeland's economic woes.
"What we discuss the most is the robberies committed by Argentine officials," said Guillermo Cortez, a plumber from the Mendoza province. Which official deserves blame is a question that leads to much debate.
It is easier to understand the harsh economic realities."I have friends who say they can't stand it anymore," Mr. Cortez said. "There is nothing to eat. They can only think of leaving."
He vowed never to return: "To return to Argentina is to return to nothing."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HUNTS POINT; 
Where Edible Flowers Are as Easy to Come By as Eggs

BYLINE:  By MATT SEDENSKY 

 BODY:
Baby artichokes on the Food Network, chocolate chip cookies at Dean & DeLuca and pink radishes at JoJo on the Upper East Side all have something surprising in common. They come from Hunts Point in the South Bronx.
 "Before, food was coming here from all over the world, but it wasn't exotic," said Josephine Infante, president of the Hunts Point Local Development Corporation. 
 The demands of supermarkets and restaurants began changing about five years ago, Ms. Infante said, reflecting the desires of both affluent, highly educated customers and emerging ethnic groups. As a result, all kinds of foods now pass through Hunts Point, including Japanese sweet limes, tofu and epazote, a Mexican herb.
More than 150 food businesses at Hunts Point import items from about 60 countries. One third of those importers sell fine foods, Ms. Infante said, and the number has been rising steadily. 
"This is a growing industry," she said.
"And the fish market is going to have a multiplied effect on these foods as well," she added, referring to the Fulton Fish Market, which has moved there.
Indian Rock Produce, a high-end food company from Quakertown, Pa., set up a satellite branch in Hunts Point in September.
"You'd be foolish not to move to New York," said Albert J. Buehrer, president of the company, which sells things like gooseberries and edible flowers to the Ritz-Carlton and others. Hunts Point was designated an economic development zone in 1994, and Indian Rock is one of 130 businesses there that receive tax credits and other incentives.
"It certainly wasn't the place I wanted to do business," said Jeff C. Lichtenstein, owner of Gourmet Guru, which sells specialty foods like organic cheese. "It doesn't have the romance of some other locations, but people in the know realize this is becoming the food hub of the area."
Hunts Point has a total of 800 businesses on its 329-acre site, an area that makes it one of the world's largest food distribution centers. It added about 100 new businesses in 2000, and an estimated 150 new businesses were added this year.
"What can't you buy here?" asked Mr. Buehrer. MATT SEDENSKY

Back to the Fold: From Dot-Com to Dad and Mom

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
AS a teenager growing up in Salem, Va., John Reynolds spent his summers working at Reynolds Siding, a remodeling company his parents have owned for more than three decades. He returned to work there after college, but he soon grew restless.
 "I wanted to do something different, to live in a different town and not work with my parents," said Mr. Reynolds, who is now 27. "I didn't understand how the working world worked, the demands, that people are expected to do work and have responsibilities. Also, having my parents as my bosses -- I didn't like that. They treated me like a kid." 
 In 1997, Mr. Reynolds left the family business to pursue a doctorate in theology at Duke University; he hoped to teach some day. But a year later, he changed his mind again and decided to work as a clerk for a law firm in Richmond, Va. 
Still unhappy, he returned to the family business in the summer of 2000. He is now a vice president for sales and marketing, and he is enjoying his work. "Once I worked for the attorneys I realized it doesn't matter who your bosses are, you're not always going to like them," Mr. Reynolds said. 
He said his parents welcomed his return. "They hadn't realized that I was an asset to them, and now they do," he said. 
Mr. Reynolds is among many young people who have decided to work at family-owned businesses. Some have grown disenchanted with the outside business world. Others have been forced to return after receiving pink slips or watching their new-economy dreams disintegrate, experts on family companies say. 
Nearly 90 percent of American businesses are family owned or controlled, according to the Institute for Family-Owned Business at the University of Southern Maine. (Among them are big-name companies like Cargill, Anheuser-Busch, Levi Strauss, Gap and Hallmark Cards.) Yet only 30 percent of the family-owned businesses in the country survive into the second generation, 13 percent into the second and fewer than 3 percent into the third, the institute said.
Whether the influx of adult children to family businesses will have a long-lasting effect on the companies remains to be seen. "I don't know where it's going to come out, but it's an interesting time," said Fredda Herz Brown, managing partner of the Metropolitan Group, a consulting firm in Tenafly, N.J., that works with family businesses. "It's so dependent on the economy and what's happening in particular industries. There's such tremendous, rapid change."
Many young people who come from families that own businesses return to the fold after a few years in the outside world, said Ann Dugan, founder and executive director of the Family Enterprise Center at the Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh. 
"Even though what they say is one thing, when they see what the reality is in the outside world in terms of salaries and status and perks, they usually reconsider," she said. "Also, as they get older, people understand that they really do want to make a contribution to the family business -- that usually the family name is somehow affiliated with it, if not on the name of the business itself. And there is sort of a pride and ego that kicks in at that point as well."
Although many adult children, like Mr. Reynolds, had once said they would never work for the family -- fearing that it would be nepotistic or a sign of personal weakness -- they are finding it necessary to return to the nest. Still others wish that their parents had a nest they could return to.
Bill Shapiro, the founding editor in chief of MBA Jungle, a magazine for aspiring young executives, said he thought that nepotism was slowly losing its stigma. In fact, he included a favorable article about nepotism in the magazine's September issue.
"Nepotism makes good business sense; you probably feel more pressure to perform if Dad is signing your paycheck and your family name is on the company stationery," he said in an interview. "Also, relatives are often more efficient in their daily dealings. Relatives perceive one another's thoughts and emotions so viscerally and so quickly that an arched eyebrow or nervous tapping of the pen can take the place of a three-page memo."
COMPANY loyalty is also a factor for those joining the family business. "Everybody at the company -- from the board of directors to management to the line employees -- knows that you're not going to leave the firm and go to the competition for a fatter paycheck," Mr. Shapiro added. 
Joining the family business is also a chance to reconnect with family members, as Patrick Amori is learning. In March 2000, Mr. Amori, 29, left his job as an advertising account executive to help his father run Il Covo Dell'Est, an Italian restaurant in the East Village in Manhattan. Although he had earned a decent salary as an account executive and had many people working for him, "it wasn't what I wanted to do," said Mr. Amori, who is now the restaurant manager.
"I wanted to see what my father does every day; I wanted to see a side that was different from what I saw as a kid, when he would work all day and come home at night tired," he said. "Now I'm able to be part of his life and try to do good for the family."
Others have also found their experience rewarding. Melissa Wilson, 24, had never imagined working at Tito's Tacos, the taco stand started 43 years ago by her great-grandfather in Culver City, Calif. It now employs 70 people. "My family is a bunch of entrepreneurs, and I felt like it would be the easy way out if I worked for them," she said of her initial hesitation to join the company. "Plus, the business has caused lots of problems in the family because it was so successful -- people fighting about who's going to inherit it."
Two years ago, during the Internet boom, she graduated from the University of San Francisco with a degree in international relations and took a position as a Bay Area office manager at Icon Medialab, a Swedish company that helps businesses develop Internet marketing strategies. She said she received incentives including a high salary, overseas training classes, four-week vacations and promises of a promotion.
But as the months unfolded, it became clear that she was not going to be promoted as quickly as she had hoped. Her peers were being laid off, she said, and she felt she was in a dead-end job. So she quit and looked for new work, living off credit cards and saddling herself with $10,000 in debt. The only available jobs were other office-manager positions, which she did not want. Finally, she began working as a manager at the taco stand last April. Much to her surprise, she said, she is happy.
"I have the freedom to do things here I wanted to do at my dot-com and didn't realize I could do at a restaurant," she said. "I'm in a management position at the most famous taco stand in Southern California, making more money than I could ever have dreamed."
Having relatives as bosses can be difficult, she conceded, because it can be hard to separate business from family. But mostly, she added, "it's a blessing in disguise."
Ira Bryck, director of the University of Massachusetts Family Business Center in Amherst, Mass., cautions family businesses not to hire newly unemployed relatives just because they worry about their futures. "A family business that's going to grow has to make sure it's hiring based on the needs of the business," said Mr. Bryck, whose own family owned a children's wear store, Barasch's Kidstore, for four generations.
"The proper thing for the family business to do is a need assessment and say, 'Despite the fact that this person is in need, does our business need that member?' " he said. "Family business is not just a place to hide out -- it's a place to make contributions, to add your skills and talents. It's important for family members to say: 'You're going to have to commit to this company as you would to any company. You're not here to hide out until the economy heals itself.' "
Mr. Bryck predicted that family businesses in general would undergo many changes in the next 20 years, particularly as family-business owners of the baby boom generation retire. Some will be looking to expand by buying other businesses, and others will be looking to sell. "So there is an opportunity for family members to help grow the business," he said.
Many young people say that is exactly what they plan to do. "I want to franchise the company all over the country," Ms. Wilson said of the taco stand. "Then I want to retire."

HEADLINE: The Fine Art Of Being A Homebody 

BYLINE:  By KATE BETTS 

 BODY:
It was the kind of party you can't write about if you ever want to be invited back. Oh, not because of drugs or lubricious goings-on. Here's the scene:
 After passing muster with a couple of list-toting doorkeepers, you enter the landmark six-story Greenwich Village town house. A party captain takes your coat, placing it in a large plastic bag that is passed bucket-brigade-style down to the basement. (Sackcloth or sable is whisked away with equal aplomb.) 
 Upstairs, past the Damien Hirst paintings, you enter the luxurious, Lee Mindel-designed family rooms, where amid a sea of children, the Grinch is rear-projected on a giant flat screen, waitresses ferry heaping plates of pigs in blankets and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a glamorous crowd of adults who used to meet at a corner booth in Balthazar is discussing mortgage rates and the joy of slippers. 
Can this be New York, the high-heeled city where people who couldn't afford living rooms exported their nightly socializing to bars, galleries and restaurants?
For years, New Yorkers have turned public places into private spaces with the help of velvet ropes, party planners and ruthless attention to every detail of class and status.
Now suddenly home is where the heat is, the private living room the sanctum sanctorum of the social scene. A whole new set of protocols is required: dress codes, food, even the rules of self-promotion. A best-dressed crowd that used to go out largely to be photographed is now seeking privacy, which is why this fiesta in Greenwich Village, given by an art-collecting couple, was strictly off the record. 
"Nobody wants to entertain in a restaurant or a public place," said Serena Bass, the owner of a catering company. "They want to be huddled around their fireplaces, and they want it to be personal. We get a lot of requests for the food to look homemade, not catered. They want shepperd's pie, meatloaf and grilled cheese." 
Some attribute the retreat to a craving for intimacy and familiarity, after the wrenching dislocations of Sept. 11. Others see a return to frugality and inconspicuous consumption in a recession. 
And there is the need for the safety of home, rather than the vulnerability some still feel in public places, a mood that is widespread as New Yorkers prepare to celebrate New Year's Eve more privately than in the recent past. Restaurants report far fewer bookings for tomorrow night than in previous years. 
Traditional year-end benefits like the New York Botanical Garden's Winter Wonderland Ball and the Metropolitan Museum Costume Institute's so-called party of the year, which brought out the city's swellest in their sequins, are not being held this year.
Instead of limousines purring outside the latest incandescent restaurant, people are marveling about the carefully set tables they see at friends' homes -- tables to rival those measured out inch by inch in Robert Altman's brilliant exercise in to-the-manner-born Anglophilia, "Gosford Park."
"I hate to say it, but we have seen incredible business because of 9/11, especially parties for 10, 12 or 15," said Steven Attoe, who with Robert Caravaggi owns RSVP, a new catering company. "People want to be at home, and they want to see their friends." The partners, who also own Swifty's restaurant, on the Upper East Side, encourage customers to bring their own casseroles dishes when placing catering orders. 
For the last 10 years, New York women have perfected a ubiquitous social uniform of spaghetti-strap dress with Manolo Blahnik stilettos. It has gone everywhere in public and has been above reproach. 
Now the look of the moment is very different. At the Greenwich Village town house, it belonged not to the adults but to one of the Grinchkins, a budding member of what's called the tween demographic, who was scampering around in a taffeta hostess skirt from Calypso, a cardigan and ballet slippers.
Anne Kennedy, an agent for fashion photographers, who gave a birthday party for the novelist Frederic Tuten at her downtown home, chose slippers and looked much more chic than the darlings still hoofing around in spikes. "For a minute, I thought about wearing heels, but I never would in my own house," Ms. Kennedy explained. "It has to be more casual, but you still want to be somewhat glamorous."
"Cozy is not the word from hell anymore," said the designer Michael Kors. "The look is very 'Ice Storm,' New Canaan dressing at home. I see Geoffrey Beene pajamas at a fondue party. It goes back to the roots of American evening dressing. You know, the Claire McCardell cozy glamour look."
Mr. Kors, who between business trips to Paris, Milan and Japan squeezed in two dinner parties of his own this fall, marveled: "There are people in New York who have known each other for 15 years, and they've never invited each other over until now."
Vladimir Kagan, who designed the furniture in Gucci stores, gave a dinner party with his wife, Erica Wilson, at their Upper East Side apartment last Sunday "for all my stray-dog friends," he said, hastening to add, "but the guests were not dogs." 
"For us, the home is an oasis, especially now," Mr. Kagan said. 
While some would argue that generations of couples, particularly those who came of age in the 1950's and 60's, have always entertained at home, there's a whole new generation of fashionable people who are opening their shoji screens and loft elevator doors to friends they never thought of inviting over.
"People who were using restaurants as extensions of their personal space have changed that and brought people into their homes," observes Ruth Reichl, the editor in chief of Gourmet magazine, who is devoting her February issue to the family. "The fear people had about opening their homes is gone. And we all just continually talked about not wanting to be in public spaces, so the family/home issue made sense." 
At Gallagher's book shop on East 12th Street, a coveted address for fashion designers and photographers looking for inspiration in old books and magazines, the hot seller is Gourmet magazine from the 1940's and 50's.
"It's very surprising, but we have seen a lot of interest in the interior stuff from that period and all of the entertaining books," said Mike Gallagher, who is more accustomed to requests for old copies of Vogue from that period. "I think fashion people are paying more attention to the home and to entertaining."
This year, the designers Mark Badgley and James Mischka gave their annual Christmas party at home instead of in a restaurant, and to give it an even more personal feeling, they whipped up all of the lamb chops, shrimp and duck canapes themselves. 
On a similar note, the handbag designer Kate Spade recently found herself cooking roast chicken and chocolate chip cookies for Eve, her sister, until 1 o'clock in the morning.
Does this mean aprons and oven mittens will be next year's successor to last season's Fendi baguette? How does the dress code for a night on the town change when the fashion flock migrates from the restaurant and ballroom to the living room (and maybe even into the kitchen)? Is it merely a matter of trading in a gown for a blouse and a pair of jeans? Or opting for ballet slippers instead of stilettos?
SOME prescient designers have already whipped up a couture-meets-Cuisinart look for spring. Miuccia Prada's favorite evening outfit offers gold brocade pajama tops complete with piping. And designers as diverse as Alberta Ferretti and Karl Lagerfeld for Fendi are championing a softer, gauzy nightgown look, which would curl up nicely in front of a fireplace. At Gucci, Tom Ford has swapped his signature tight, sexy second-wife silhouette for a slouchy pair of paper-bag-waist pajama pants, which could look just as chic driving the car pool as they could on the veranda at cocktail hour.
"I think special-occasion clothes could be driven by this now, much more than the red carpet," said Josh Patner, a designer of the Tuleh label, a favorite of the young Upper East Side social crowd. "People do want to get dressed up, but not in the scrutiny of the world. Everybody is feeling antihype. People do not seem interested in pumped-up fantasy. It seems unfriendly. It is about having people in your house whom you actually like. It's not networky and air-kissy."
Marc Jacobs, whose widely imitated Louis Vuitton collection for spring was inspired by embroidery and handicrafts, sees a continuing emphasis on all things homemade and comfortable. "We were all in a very craft mode, and we felt this is the right time for that kind of warmth, comfort and human feel," Mr. Jacobs said.
The designer, long a mainstay of fashionable drinking places, was spending the weeks before Christmas making his home in Paris cozy for a visit from an old friend and her son. "I really want everything to be perfect," he said. "I have to have the perfect tree, the presents, the food. I've become quite obsessive about it." 
Of course, homey and informal are concepts open to interpretation, and they can mean something very different, depending on the individuals and their addresses. At a Christmas party in the elaborately decorated Fifth Avenue apartment of the socialite Patricia Altschul, one guest noticed that most of the women, including Nan Kempner and Annette de la Renta, were wearing haute couture, even as the canapes being passed consisted of pigs in blankets and Krispy Kreme doughnuts.
"It's a compliment to the hostess to dress up a little bit," said Marina Rust Conner, a stylish fixture at charity galas and in the party pages of fashion magazines. "And when someone like Nan Kempner says very casual, very informal spaghetti dinner, you know that means you can wear velvet pants and the men should wear ties. And it also means that some people will be in couture."
Perhaps the biggest challenge to the style-setting crowd who are used to going out five nights a week is not what to wear and what to serve. It's figuring out what to say.
"When people are in your home, they actually talk," said Daniel Romualdez, an interior decorator. "They open up and talk about things that are personal. It's not that kind of mindless conversation you get at those benefit dinners where everyone just recites their recent travel itineraries." 
Here's a New Year's resolution for the reformed velvet-rope crowd: return the borrowed ball gowns and stop talking about fashion.
Oh, maybe next year.

HEADLINE: The Life Serene 

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE O'DONNELL 

 BODY:
IT was the day that Sister Mary of the Incarnation would take her final vows of chastity, poverty and obedience as a cloistered Dominican nun and bride of Christ. The small chapel of the Corpus Christi Monastery was full of female heads shrouded by veils and those whose uncovered hairdos had frizzed in the light December rain.
 With her back to the congregation, Sister Mary of the Incarnation stood before the priest on the altar and bowed. Her long black veil, worn specially for this occasion, stopped short of her white socks and sturdy dark shoes. 
 "Behold, dear sister, two crowns: one comely, the other of thorns," the priest said. A circlet of prickly branches and another of fresh roses and lavender were presented. 
As Sister Mary of the Incarnation gestured to choose the thorns, her face became visible: deeply flushed and smiling. The prioress, Sister Maria Pia, beamed as she wriggled the crown of thorns over Sister Mary's pink forehead.
"Are you resolved to give yourself to God alone, in solitude and silence, in persevering prayer and willing penance, in humble labor and good works?" the prioress asked.
Sister Mary of the Incarnation responded: "I am, with God's help and yours."
The wedding was over.
Afterward, Sister Mary mingled in the parlor with relatives who clutched cake plates and cameras. The next time they visited, she would stand in the cloister, the nuns' private domain, and greet them from the window that divided her world from theirs. But for now she moved happily among her guests, offering more cake and shyly posing for pictures. 
It was a festive day after a difficult autumn.
The year just ending has been a most trying one for New Yorkers. Many people felt that the enormous scale of the tragedy unleashed on Sept. 11 tested their inner strength more keenly than ever before. In the wake of such devastating loss, New Yorkers turned inward, seeking ways to stanch the emotional pain. Attendance at houses of worship rose, as did participation in yoga and meditation classes. 
The nuns of Corpus Christi Monastery, one of three such religious enclaves in the city, have long striven to lead spiritually centered lives. Since 1890, women who have sworn themselves to Christ have lived behind a high stone wall in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx.
This year tried the fortitude of the nuns, too, as they stood on the hill in the back of their garden and, from their postage-stamp view of Lower Manhattan, watched the great towers fall. They wept, dropped to their knees and prayed. They continue to pray daily for the victims, some of whom they knew, in a special evening session. Even now, they wince at the mention of the disaster.
And yet, a visit to the monastery during the holiday season still reveals the quiet centeredness that cloistered life has long cultivated. A monastery is a home for religious men and women who remove themselves from the outside world to pray. A cloister is the part of the monastery that only those who have taken vows may enter, to preserve the simplest form of material life and save one's mind and soul for God.
Now that the monastery, like the rest of New York, has been indelibly affected by the trade center disaster, it is the old routine of prayer that continues to give the nuns solace. Though deeply shaken, the nuns of Corpus Christi are still firmly rooted in their faith.
The monastery occupies an old gray building on Lafayette Avenue at Barretto Street surrounded by rambling, tree-filled grounds that seem to owe more to the enchanted realm of Harry Potter than to the long-troubled South Bronx. Inside the four-story structure is the cloister, the nuns' living and working quarters, which hug an inner courtyard and are off limits to visitors.
Inside the cloister, quiet and prayer are observed -- except for 30 lively minutes a day -- so the nuns can pursue contemplative life. There is no vow of silence, just an effort to speak no more than is necessary so the mind is free to roam toward God. Six times a day they meet in the chapel to recite Old Testament Psalms and standard Roman Catholic prayers, but it is contemplative life that allows individual prayer to develop subconsciously.
The very survival of this spiritual community is a small miracle: for more than a century, the nuns' way of life has withstood the monastery's unlikely site in a neighborhood infamous for drugs and prostitutes. For nearly half a century, the monastery has shared a block with the notorious Spofford Juvenile Center, once a home for troubled boys, now coeducational and topped with coils of razor wire. Four blocks away is the 41st Precinct station house, long known as Fort Apache in a nod to the crime that ravaged the neighborhood in the 70's and beyond. 
Things have improved in recent years, but statistics still paint a bleak picture: the rate of most crime has dropped, but this year the murder rate has more than doubled. What will happen as the current recession takes hold is uncertain, and some problems seem intractable. 
"You working?" the man behind the wheel of a gray Acura called to a young woman walking in front of the monastery one Sunday afternoon as he slowed down to match her stride. 
Despite efforts to close local strip clubs, prostitution still plagues the neighborhood; prostitutes work right next to the monastery's great stone wall. Cars with legitimate business in the neighborhood move quickly. The drivers of the slow ones are looking for women.
Not long ago, youngsters used to scale the wall and steal tomatoes from the garden. Addicts tossed needles over the wall and, once, a mattress with little spring left. The razor wire installed a decade ago has not kept drug dealers from lingering at the bottom of the hill, just outside the wall.
The nuns are not oblivious to these incongruities. They pass out food and blankets to those who ring their bell in need. But inside the wall, only the sounds of the South Bronx seep in. Corpus Christi is in the city, but somehow it is not really of the city.
From the hill in the garden, the city's flattened skyline appears gray and crowded, not particularly inviting compared with the monastery's rambling trees and gardens. Gnarled poplars and elms dwarf the towers of Manhattan, and the Empire State Building is a stickpin next to a statue of the Virgin Mary in the foreground.
Most people would say the nuns live cut off from the real world. Yet the nuns believe that within the cloister's walls they have found the real world and that silence allows them to maintain their prayerful way of life. 
"Silence humbles the mind and detaches it from the world; it would create a kind of solitude in the heart like that you court," Fenelon, the archbishop of Cambrai, wrote the countess of Gramont in 1690. "It would supply much that you need under present difficulties."
While the world outside the wall has changed from rambling country estates to a crack-ravaged neighborhood slowly brushing itself off, the world inside has had a subtler metamorphosis. In the old days, Corpus Christi, like other local monasteries, had a house full of nuns. Back then, they were divided into three categories: lay nuns who did the cooking and cleaning; extern nuns who dealt with the outside world; and choir nuns, the only ones who lived in the cloister and who did the creative chores of writing prayers and composing music.
But as the spring of vocations dried up, orders stopped segregating the nuns. Now the monastery has 18 nuns (down from 57 at the peak in 1919), 17 choir nuns and one extern, who share all the household work and support themselves by selling communion wafers to nearby churches.
The nuns are all avid gardeners, growing roses, herbs and vegetables that this year have thrived into December. Sister Roseanne, 83, is one of the most enthusiastic gardeners. Last year, she had heard of an earth-moving machine and decided to rent one for the dormant front garden. She called equipment rental companies and, in her lilting Irish accent, explained her gardening needs. 
Are you sure it's a backhoe you need? The rental company employees asked. Yes, it is, she answered. The questioning continued. Finally, someone guessed that what she really wanted was a rototiller. It was delivered, and Sister Roseanne, who entered the monastery as a choir nun trained in art and music, operated it herself.
Sister Mary St. John is the last extern at Corpus Christi. She is 75, and has been a nun for 48 years. For most of that time, she slept alone in a room just outside the cloister. During the day she bustled around the perimeter of the cloister answering the front door and tending the garden with the other nuns. 
As the externs died and no new ones took their place, the prioress had their rooms renovated into guest quarters for outsiders who came on retreat. 
Sister Mary St. John moved inside the cloister to sleep. But she still occupies the perimeter of the cloister, acting like the moat of a medieval castle. A door in the front hall leads to the extern basement, where she cares for Chrysostom, the monastery's shy Siamese cat. There is also the giant asparagus fern Sister Mary St. John tries to coax back to health, despite the needles it drops like a Christmas tree in January. The basement, neat and warm, suggests a feminine rec room, decorated with cut flowers, pictures of the pope and a prayer book from the 1960's inscribed "Sr. Mary St. John."
Chrysostom is domesticated, and, like his mistress, does not wander far from his quarters. The one time the nun opened the window for him to go out and roam, he came back with ear mites. Sister Mary St. John knows all the squirrels on the grounds and has been keeping an eye on the ripening pregnancy of a raccoon that has taken shelter in the crawl space under the chapel. 
One afternoon a busload of middle-age Catholics from Westchester arrived for Mass in the chapel. People do this occasionally: visit and pray in the small chapel attached to the choir that serves as the nuns' own cloistered chapel, separated by three sets of Gothic-arched doors. 
The Westchester parishioners appeared well off. The men were silver-haired retirees, and the women wore silk scarves and carried leather handbags. The lipstick of the women looked as if it had been freshly reapplied before they stepped off the bus. A lapel pin read, "Jesus is the reason for the season."
The nuns greeted them all warmly. They liked having visitors, which meant they could open the large windows of the cloister's parlor and chat with their guests before evening vespers.
Sister Mary St. John stayed outside the cloister with the guests. Her cheeks were rosy from laughing and entertaining. The contrast between her light polyester robe and the wools and silks of the visitors was almost as pronounced as their differing complexions. Sister Mary St. John has soft skin that is virtually wrinkle-free. The skin of the Westchester women, many in their 50's and 60's, looked made-up and tired. 
The women surrounded the nun, trying to understand what it was, exactly, that she did all day. Sister Mary St. John was in a teasing mood. "Besides feeding the pussycat?" she answered.
Mass was beginning, and the wools and silks streamed down the corridor to the chapel.
"Sometimes, because of the noise of the world in which we live, the longing of the human spirit is crushed," the priest said in his homily. "When we come to a place like this, it is a gift, isn't it?"
A typical day. The nuns rise at 5:30 and walk noiselessly into the chapel, filling it by 6:15 a.m. Six days a week their mornings begin this way. On Sundays they sleep for an extra hour.
Some stay up all night in the chapel praying. The nuns take turns adoring the perpetual display of the Blessed Sacrament, the body and blood of Jesus in the form of the communion host.
Over the years, contemplative life wears away at the words of formal prayer like water smoothing stones, and adoring the Blessed Sacrament provides ample time for contemplation. It takes experience to be able to pray that way. But when it happens, it brings the nuns joy, because that is the type of prayer that transcends everything material: words, music, everything.
Still, they follow the rule of St. Augustine and gather in the chapel six times daily for formal prayer. This morning, like all mornings, the 18 nuns sit in two groups on either side of the chapel facing one another as they sing the Psalms. The room is lighted by electricity and candles, and predawn darkness presses against the windowpanes.
"Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit," they sing, bowing deeply. "As it was in the beginning, is now and will be forever, amen." 
Sister Mary Dominick, the one novice, stifles a yawn. She is 21, is from Vancouver Island in Canada, has been at the monastery for a year and a half, and wears the white habit that means she has yet to take her final vows, when she will exchange it for a cream-colored gown and short black veil. She is young enough to have a teenager's imperfect skin and modern enough to have perfectly straightened teeth.
When she arrived at the monastery to meet the nuns, she was still a teenager in many ways. They had gathered in the courtyard to pose for the picture to put on their annual Christmas card, and Sister Mary Dominick wandered off and climbed the awning over the loggia. Leaping off, she landed in a heap on the grass. Heavens! The nuns rushed to her side, expecting every bone to be broken. Sister Mary Dominick grinned at them. She was fine.
A few minutes after 7, the Rev. Peter Bannan arrives. Every weekday, Father Bannan drives from Pelham in Westchester County to say Mass. On days when he cannot be there, a nun takes out the telephone directory and calls around to parishes to see who else can come. 
The Gospel this day is about the poor widow who gave two small coins to the temple and the rich man who made a larger donation. There is a click as Sister Mary Imelda presses play and record on her tape recorder, even though the noise sometimes bothers the nuns sitting around her.
Later, Sister Mary Imelda played back Father Bannan's homily, and wrote it out longhand to save with all of his other homilies she had saved over the years. She thought they were wonderful. Would make a wonderful book.
"Burn them," he said.
"Sometimes," Sister Mary St. John said quietly, "you get so wrapped up in yourself it's hard to find Jesus in here." She paused to consider how odd that sounds coming from a cloister. "I guess anywhere you are, you can get too wrapped up in yourself," she said.
Every day after lunch, there is a 30-minute recreation period when the nuns talk and play Ping-Pong and badminton. They can be quite boisterous, and they take a bit of pride in Sister Mary St. John's professing shock that these are the same choir nuns she knows. Then follows an hour of profound silence.
At 7 p.m., the nuns flow back into the chapel's choir for compline. They sing the Psalms as rain patters outside. A plane passes overhead. Then Sister Maria Pia, the prioress, reads the closing prayer. In a few minutes, profound silence will begin and last until morning prayer.
But the nuns do not leave the chapel. Someone rises to turn off the lights and blow out the candles. Formal prayer is over. In the dimness, the dull memory of light keeps barely visible the outlines of the habits. In the last three months, the nuns have been contemplating the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, praying for the victims but without using words. It is the most powerful way they know how to pray.
Then one by one, the figures silently leave the chapel.

HEADLINE: Even the Smartest Money Can Slip Up 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
"The more intense the craze, the higher the type of intellect that succumbs to it."
Benjamin Anderson,
"Economics and the Public Welfare," 1949
 THE year just ending has been painful for most investors. It has probably hurt even more for some big names who achieved fame on Wall Street for being a bit smarter than the average guy. 
 If 2000 was the year when lucky young Internet millionaires lost it all, 2001 was the year when the smart money looked a lot less smart. Many investors whose names have for years graced the Forbes 400 list of the world's richest people lost hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. 
Many of the superrich, in fact, got into trouble the same way so many little guys do: they got carried away by an investment fad at its very top, making ill-considered deals at the height of a market mania in 1999 and 2000 whose flaws became apparent as the economy softened. Others failed to diversify, or neglected to take profits in good times, holding on too long as highflying stocks plummeted to the single digits in price. And many who controlled companies were slow to cut back on debt when times were good. 
Though it's painful for any investor to nurse losses, it's even more embarrassing for these investors -- people like the Bass brothers of Texas and Paul G. Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, and Craig O. McCaw, the cellphone pioneer -- whose humiliation is often public.
One such investor, Abraham D. Gosman, a real estate and health care entrepreneur whose businesses have fallen on hard times -- but who is hardly a household name -- filed for personal bankruptcy protection in March. Soon after, he was mentioned by Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, as a deadbeat debtor who had shielded assets from creditors. 
Two companies that Mr. Gosman once ran -- Innovative Clinical Solutions, which provides support services to health care companies, and CareMatrix, which operates housing for the elderly -- had filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Proposing an amendment to the bankruptcy reform bill, Mr. Kohl said Mr. Gosman, once a member of the Forbes 400, had personal debts of more than $233 million but, thanks to favorable debtor laws in Florida, was hoping to hold on to his 64,000-square-foot mansion in Palm Beach. Mr. Gosman has valued the property at $40 million to $50 million, according to a recent court filing. A lawyer for Mr. Gosman did not return calls.
Most of the other centimillionaires or billionaires who got into trouble this year did not fall as far as Mr. Gosman, proving again that the rich do differ from everyone else. Many still seem to be quite wealthy -- though it is difficult to determine exactly where they stand. The rich are notoriously private and quick to punish advisers who do not maintain strict confidentiality about them. Virtually every money manager interviewed for this article declined to comment on the record, though some willingly described the behavior of customers.
"These guys are deal junkies," said one Wall Street investment banker who asked not to be identified because some of his clients were suffering. "But it's not like they bet their last nickel or anything."
THE fate of the Enron Corporation provides one example. As it plunged into bankruptcy a few weeks ago, employees were left largely without pensions because the company's 401(k) plan had invested heavily in Enron stock. But the Belfer family of New York, one of the largest individual shareholders, with stock once worth some $2 billion, retains substantial real-estate assets that cushion the blow.
Paul G. Allen, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates but left the company years ago, also had considerable setbacks in his investment portfolio this year. But he still ranked third on Forbes magazine's survey of the rich, published in October, with a net worth of $28.2 billion. 
Mr. Allen suffered big losses on his stake in RCN, a telecommunications company. In February 2000, he invested $1.65 billion in RCN, taking a stake in the form of preferred stock convertible into 26.6 million RCN shares. Today, the stake is worth $79 million.
Fortunately for Mr. Allen, his nest egg includes some 138 million shares of Microsoft, worth almost $9.4 billion. A spokesman for Mr. Allen's investment firm, Vulcan Ventures, declined to comment.
Mr. Allen's debt status is unknown. But some of these financiers -- like overextended individuals struggling to pay their credit card bills -- simply took on too much debt during the good times of the last decade.
Just last month, chemical companies controlled by Jon Meade Huntsman, a prominent donor to the Republican Party whose son is a deputy United States trade representative, announced that they could not make interest payments on junk bonds due this month and in January. The companies, which include the Huntsman Corporation and Huntsman Polymers, carry more than $2 billion in debt and have been hit by rising costs, a result of industry overcapacity and a spike in energy prices, particularly natural gas, in 2000 and early 2001. 
Mr. Huntsman will have to offer some concession to bondholders. That may dent his net worth, which Forbes estimated at $3.8 billion. It could also put a crimp in his considerable donations to charity. A spokesman for Mr. Huntsman's companies said he had donated $350 million over the last five years, largely with profits from his chemical companies. Most of that money went to a cancer research center he formed three years ago.
Dennis R. Washington, who made his fortune in the shipping, mining and railroad industries and who rescued the construction giant Morrison Knudsen from bankruptcy in 1996, suffered, too, after his Washington Group International, as Morrison Knudsen is now known, filed for bankruptcy this year.
Mr. Washington, who was recently worth $1.6 billion, according to Forbes, stumbled after his company acquired a division from Raytheon in 2000. Shortly after the deal closed, the Washington Group said Raytheon had overstated the division's assets and understated its liabilities. (The Washington Group sued Raytheon but has since settled the suit.) 
The acquisition ended up costing the Washington Group, which had taken on $1.2 billion in debt last year partly to finance the deal, twice as much as expected, said Joel Levington, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
"They wanted to take a stab at becoming one of the top-tier construction companies in the United States," Mr. Levington said. Instead, Mr. Washington suffered a rare setback.
Terrence Dwyer, a junk-bond analyst at KDP Investment Advisors, a research firm in Montpelier, Vt., said, "Dennis Washington is a respected entrepreneur and a really bright guy." But this latest deal was clearly a mistake, Mr. Dwyer said. "I think this was an overreach." 
A spokesman for the Washington Group, Brent Brandon, said Mr. Washington had been "fighting mad" about the outcome of the Raytheon acquisition. Mr. Brandon said, however, that the company's bankruptcy filing was hardly a personal disaster for Mr. Washington.
Though Mr. Washington lost the $200 million his shares were worth before the problems with the Raytheon acquisition were disclosed, he made at least that much this year among his other investments, Mr. Brandon said. "Basically, his net worth went sideways," he said.
Nor has Mr. Washington given up on the company. He reached an agreement with creditors that gives him options for 10 percent of the company's stock and could ultimately result in his buying a stake of 40 percent in the Washington Group, which should emerge from bankruptcy protection early next year.
Another longtime billionaire and prominent political donor, Carl H. Lindner, 82, who made his fortune in the 1970's and 80's in insurance and other investments, was hurt this year when his Chiquita Brands, the banana exporter, filed for bankruptcy protection. Mr. Lindner had expanded Chiquita's business aggressively in anticipation of increasing sales in Europe. But soon after the expansion, the European Union enacted import restrictions.
Mr. Lindner's Chiquita investment is not a majority of his net worth, but the year has also been rough for his insurance company, the American Financial Group, which faces losses related to asbestos claims and the World Trade Center attacks.
MORE than anything else, the treacherous telecommunications sector brought down the wealthy. Troubles in telecommunications, which ranked second only to the Internet in late-1990's hype, inflicted losses on several big investors who had no previous experience in the industry but who were attracted to the big leaps that telecom stocks were making in 2000. Other investors, like Craig O. McCaw, who made his fortune in cellular phones but lost billions recently on two telecommunications start-ups, should perhaps have been able to see the market overcapacity. But Mr. McCaw and others seem to have been persuaded that they had stumbled upon the next big thing -- one that had no bounds. 
In theory, these investments in telecommunications, unlike many of those in the Internet, were backed by tangible assets that could be sold if necessary for at least the value of the investors' original stakes. "People thought that if you put hard assets into the ground, at the very least you'd get your money back," one investment banker said.
In reality, there were so many telecommunications start-ups that the supply far exceeded the demand. One company, Viatel, a seller of phone and data services, had investors like Thomas O. Hicks, an owner of the Texas Rangers and chairman of the leveraged-buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst. Viatel filed for bankruptcy in May and could not muster any worthwhile bids when it tried to auction its assets in August.
To financial historians and others, the fact that so many smart people were blindsided following the crowd is not surprising. Rich people are tempted, too. They see huge profits being made by other mortals and want in on the fun. 
"If you look through history, after periods of great wealth creation, creative destruction happens," said one money manager about the big telecom losses suffered by some big names. "It makes sense that the people who did the best will be the most undisciplined. You get lulled into a sense of complacency by your success."
James Grant, publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a persistent market bear, had a similar take. "So thick in the air was the pixie dust of the new economy that everyone breathed it in," he said. After a bull market of more than 20 years, he added, "even smart people were programmed to suspend belief."
SID RICHARDSON BASS and Lee Marshall Bass are another example. In the 1980's, these brothers, based in Fort Worth, became legends thanks to their savvy investments in beaten-down stocks like Walt Disney. 
But after gazing at the much larger returns being earned in technology and telecommunications, the Basses suddenly began to buy stakes in highfliers like NTL Inc., a communications services company, whose stock has fallen from nearly $50 a share in October 2000 to just 93 cents on Friday, and GlobalStar Telecommunications Ltd., a satellite telephone concern that suspended payments on its long-term debt in January and sells for 17 cents a share.
The investments were made after Sid Bass, who for years had largely delegated his investments to others, decided to take a more active role. "Sid was feeling kind of out of things," said one investor close to the family.
In September, to cope with a cash shortage, the Basses sold a 6.4 percent stake in Disney for $2 billion. A spokesman for Mr. Bass declined to comment.
Speculation by sophisticated investors and financiers is hardly unprecedented: big names in business were crushed in the 1920's, too. William C. Durant, a founder of General Motors, left that company in disgrace in 1920 after losing a fortune in stock speculation. Apparently unchastened, Mr. Durant lost a second fortune in the markets in the 1929 crash.
"He assembled G.M., but he apparently didn't have superior insight into the stock market," said Martin Fridson, chief strategist in the high-yield bond department at Merrill Lynch. "Someone can have a particular insight into an industry or investment specialty, but that talent is not necessarily transferable."
Initially, the principals of Hicks, Muse, for example, made a fortune in leveraged buyouts in industries like food and radio and television. 
But over the last few years, intense competition in the leveraged-buyout world forced Hicks, Muse to venture into areas crowded with other investors. In 1998, it teamed up with Henry R. Kravis and his partners at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and paid $1.6 billion for Regal Cinemas, one of several theater chains acquired by buyout firms in the late 1990's. All of them opened theaters when movie attendance was shrinking. Regal filed for bankruptcy in September, and Hicks, Muse is likely to lose all of its investment in the company.
Then, at the peak of the market in late 1999 and early 2000, Hicks, Muse invested $1.3 billion in six publicly traded telecommunications companies: Globix, ICG Communications, RCN, Rhythms NetConnections, Teligent and Viatel. Four of them -- Viatel, ICG, Rhythms and Teligent -- filed for bankruptcy this year. Just last Thursday, Globix said it was considering a bankruptcy filing, as well. RCN's shares trade for less than $3 a share.
"What did Hicks, Muse know about telecommunications?" one analyst asked.
Clearly, not enough. A spokesman for Hicks, Muse declined to comment, although Mr. Hicks has promised investors that the firm will return to its original strategy.
THE successes of some of these investors in other industries make them reluctant to give up, even when the market turns against them. 
Over the last two years, Forstmann Little, which is led by Theodore J. Forstmann, has invested $2.5 billion in two struggling telecommunications start-ups: XO Communications and McLeodUSA. But in early December, even after their stocks fell to less than $1, Forstmann Little announced plans to invest more in both companies. It will put $400 million more into XO and is offering to buy McLeod's commercial-directory business for $535 million, convert its $1 billion in preferred stock into common stock and invest $100 million more in McLeod common shares. 
The investment represents a substantial percentage of the assets managed by Mr. Forstmann's firm, other investors said. "What is he trying to prove?" one money manager wondered.
A spokesman for Mr. Forstmann said that "in both cases, you have sound businesses with too much debt" and that Mr. Forstmann would be increasing his investment only after the companies reduced their debts.
For some investors, there's no shame in setbacks. Last month, Donald J. Trump -- eyeing the depressed economy and potential new rivals after New York passed a law expanding legalized gambling -- asked holders of junk bonds issued by his three Atlantic City casinos to renegotiate the terms of the debt, either cutting the interest rate or delaying when the bonds are due. 
In an interview last week, Mr. Trump said extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary measures, adding that bondholders understood that "the world has changed since Sept. 11." It is because of the terrorist attacks that New York is seeking the additional revenue that gambling would provide. 
With so many wealthy people diminished by all of the year's events, the state has plenty of company.

Yes, There Are Still Optimists in Japan

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
INVESTORS betting on a recovery in Japanese stocks are not easily discouraged. After three short-lived rallies in the 1990's, they are again hoping that the market will finally pull itself out of its decade-long funk.
 Fund managers with a mandate to invest here have some reason for quiet optimism for 2002. Many big names, like Nippon Steel and the Pioneer Corporation, are trading near 10-year lows, making Japan one of the cheapest industrialized markets. Bargain-basement prices are leading to mergers and takeovers that were previously unimaginable, as evidenced by a deal that would give Roche of Switzerland a majority stake in Chugai Pharmaceutical. Waves of companies are announcing revampings, encouraging investors. 
 As the year turns, though, the pessimists have the upper hand. Investors, encouraged by the election of a tough-talking prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, bid up stocks in April and May. When his reform bandwagon stalled, stocks resumed their decline, propelled by mounting banking problems, falling semiconductor prices and the events of Sept. 11. The Topix -- an index of all top-ranked companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange -- fell 19.6 percent in 2001, its eighth one-year decline since 1990.
Mutual funds that invest dollars in Japan fared even worse because of the yen's 16 percent slide against the dollar. Through mid-December, these equity funds were down more than 30 percent, the largest decline of any international category, according to Morningstar. 
As Koji Nishigaki, president of NEC, the electronics giant, said recently, "I want to forget this year as soon as possible." Unfortunately for Mr. Nishigaki, whose $44 billion company delayed listing on the New York Stock Exchange this year, 2002 does not look much better.
The economy has fallen into its fourth, and perhaps deepest, recession since 1992, pushing the unemployment rate to a high and sapping consumer spending. Exports and government spending are sputtering as the American economy falters and as Mr. Koizumi tries to rein in debt. The Bank of Japan expects the economy to shrink about 1 percent in both 2001 and 2002.
In recessions past, Japan ramped up exports, pumped taxpayer money into the economy and cut interest rates. With those options mostly exhausted and the banking system in shambles, investors hope that Mr. Koizumi, who wants to overhaul the tax code, deregulate crucial industries and force banks to write off bad loans, can overcome the forces allied against him.
BUT the prime minister will probably disappoint investors, whether he succeeds or fails. If he has his way, Japan will fall deeper into recession as deregulation and loan write-offs drive up bankruptcies. If conservatives kill Mr. Koizumi's program, investors are expected to sell stocks in the belief that lawmakers are not serious about fixing structural problems. Judging by the pace of reform in past administrations and the string of defeats that Mr. Koizumi has already suffered, the Japan bears have history on their side.
"Don't hold your breath for quick reform in Japan -- particularly of bank bad debts -- or you will both underperform and die before it," David Roche of Independent Strategy, an investment firm based in London, said in a recent report.
But there is a silver lining: because of their woes, banks, contractors and real estate companies make up only 11 percent of the Topix, about half of their weighting in 1998. So even if the government mismanages the bank cleanup, the effect on the broader market is more limited than it was during the previous recession.
More important, plenty of big Japanese companies are still partly insulated from the domestic economy, and many of their stocks are more affordable than at any time in the last 15 years. Matsushita Electric Industrial, Toshiba and Fujitsu are trading at well below their peaks, yet have little debt, strong brands and well-trained work forces. All of them have announced job cuts, factory closures and plans to spin off or trim unprofitable divisions. Mr. Nishigaki at NEC, for instance, announced plans to eliminate more than 10,000 jobs, close overseas factories and emphasize software and services over memory chips. Toshiba is also promoting high-margin networking and wireless products and moving low-end refrigerator and air-conditioner lines to China.
"Toshiba reminds me of General Electric 20 years ago," said Robert Sasaki, managing director at Bear, Stearns in Tokyo. "I don't know if they have the will to do what 'Neutron Jack' did," he said of John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s former chief executive, who scrapped unprofitable businesses and kept the winners. "But they definitely have the opportunity."
The cost-cutting is expected to nearly double Japanese companies' return on equity, to 2.8 percent next year. While that is just one-eighth of what American companies earn, estimates by Goldman, Sachs show that the change would be enough to lift the Topix above 1,200, about 20 percent.
Despite Japan's troubles, its consumers are still the world's second wealthiest, behind those in Luxembourg, on a per capita basis. Companies that can tap into these deep pockets have a good shot at weathering the downturn.
"Consumers have the spending power -- it's purely a matter of catching their fancy," said Mark W. Headley, portfolio manager of the $330 million Matthews Japan fund, based in San Francisco. Among his top 10 holdings are Monex Securities, a Japanese online broker; Belluna, a mail-order clothing company; and USS, which manages used-car auctions. The fund has lost more than 40 percent this year.
There is even promise in slow movers like Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which has lost more than half its market capitalization in 18 months. N.T.T., the former state-run monopoly, controls 88 percent of the local fixed-line market and dominates broadband, data and software services. The government's plan to sell off more of its 41 percent stake in 2002, some analysts reason, will force the company to make deep cuts to please shareholders.
AND then there are perennial winners like Toyota Motor, Honda Motor, Nintendo, Canon and other exporters that make the bulk of their profits overseas. Through the 1990's, these companies geared their operations to turn a profit even when the yen strengthened. The dollar's recent break through 130 yen means exporters will earn even more when they repatriate profits. Toyota and Honda make an estimated 10 billion yen ($77 million) for each one-yen increment above their break-even point of 110 to the dollar. These automakers have a huge impact on parts suppliers, materials makers and advertisers, so their success can cause broader rallies.
"Even though exports are a small part of the economy over all, the market needs something to turn it around," said David Semaya, president of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in Tokyo, which handles $10 billion of United States money in Japan.
The first half of 2002 will likely be rough. Analysts expect profits to plunge more than 30 percent in the October-to-March period, about twice as much as in the previous six months. Once those declines are out of the way, stalwart investors can again focus on the companies that can make their way out of Japan's economic wilderness.

HEADLINE: Recession, Then a Boom? MaybeNot This Time 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
IN decades past, the next step for an American economy in recession would be clear. It would boom.
 People would start spending again, and companies would quickly increase production, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and fattening paychecks. In a quickly widening spiral, these developments would lead to even more spending. 
 But the rules for recoveries may well be different today -- not because of Sept. 11, but because of fundamental changes in the economy. Even after a year-end flurry of good news on home sales, consumer confidence and jobless claims, the recovery likely to start in 2002 could be far weaker than those in other years that have followed downturns. 
A limited rebound would have a broad impact on the way people live and businesses function, whether because unemployment stays high, corporate earnings continue to be sluggish or the stock market is slow to rebound. It could also shape much of the political debate leading into the midterm Congressional elections.
The most basic change is that recessions are less common today than they were in the 1950's, 60's and 70's. The service sector, which is less prone to volatile swings than the manufacturing sector, has grown rapidly, and the Federal Reserve appears more adept at managing the economy.
But when downturns are infrequent -- roughly once a decade, rather than twice -- the often-overlooked price is that the ensuing recoveries are neither sharp nor simple. "Because we get smaller downs," said Van Jolissaint, the corporate economist at DaimlerChrysler, "we also get smaller ups."
The last three decades have included the long downturn of the mid-1970's, the double-dip recession of the early 80's and the short recession and weak recovery of the early 90's. Only severe downturns, like the second one in the early 80's, have produced rebounds as robust as those of earlier decades.
Not since 1970 has a strong recovery followed a brief recession -- and it is just such a sequence that would be necessary for the coming year to be a prosperous one.
Since 1980, the nation's number of jobs rose just 3 percent, on average, in the two years after a recession. From the 1950's through the 70's, the average increase was 7 percent.
In the old days, the American economy would slow to a crawl whenever consumers and companies decided they could squeeze a bit more life out of products and machines they already owned. When people began shopping again, factories cranked up quickly to meet the demand.
Today, technology allows factory stockpiles, and the spending swings they create, to be smaller. Service businesses, which need smaller inventories, make up a bigger share of the economy. And many tasks once done by the federal government have moved to the states, which often cut budgets just as a recovery begins.
THE trade-off is a good one over all, most economists say. A more stable economy allows companies and households to plan better for the future, making them more efficient. And volatility brings economic pain by making people constantly anxious about losing their jobs.
Of course, arguments still rage about just how small the next upswing will be, but the terms of the debate reflect the new realities.
Even Wall Street forecasters, who regularly err on the side of optimism, do not expect the coming year to resemble the recoveries of decades past. Most predict that the economy will accelerate only gradually. Its best performance will be in the year's final quarter, when it will grow 3.9 percent, at an inflation-adjusted annual rate, according to an average of dozens of forecasts compiled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter. 
In past decades, although the economy did not seem as strong as it is today, growth often reached 8 percent and higher in the wake of even mild recessions.
The two different messages coming from the Fed recently highlight the contrast. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has continued to trumpet corporate America's adoption of new technologies, which he says have increased productivity and will lift the long-term growth rate. Other Fed officials share that opinion, but many have also said recently that they expect the recovery to be slow.
Indeed, the slow recovery of the early 90's, rather than seeming to be an aberration, has become the reference point for the argument now confronting economists.
On one side of the debate is the cash crowd -- those who believe that the trillions of dollars recently injected into the economy will cause demand to surge soon for everything from clothing to workers. Pointing to the Fed's many interest-rate cuts, the tax cut of last summer and gasoline prices that remain lower than they were 5, 10 or 20 years ago, the cash crowd says the economy will do better in the next few years than it did in the early 90's.
"The economy is awash in a sea of liquidity," said David Littmann, the chief economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit, who counts himself an optimist. He is joined by many investors and, based on their public statements, Bush administration officials.
"People aren't comfortable with an unusual amount of cash, and the economy will be jump-started by the liquidity," Mr. Littmann said.
On the other side is the overhang crowd -- those who say that all that money will not be enough to counter the structural imbalances in the economy. These worriers say that many businesses still have more equipment than they can use profitably and that consumers, who cut spending far less this year than in previous downturns and still have high debt levels, may not raise their spending much in coming months. 
"This is a major, long-term balance-sheet adjustment that is long overdue," said David A. Levy, chairman of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. His concerns are shared by academic economists who rely on history as a predictor and by many executives, whose profits continue to fall amid sluggish sales and stagnant prices.
YOU cannot store a haircut. That fact goes a long way toward explaining why the nature of the business cycle appears to have changed.
When an economy slows, and households and companies start to reduce their spending, they often cut back most on manufactured goods. A family gets by with a creaky washing machine for a year more than it had planned. A business, expecting future sales to be slow, uses up the goods sitting in its warehouse.
Many services are harder to do without. Consumers cannot keep extra plumbers' visits on hand or postpone spending on child care. College tuition, doctor bills and car repairs cannot be put off. 
On the other hand, when good times seem to return, people do not get a few haircuts at a time. They might buy a new television, however, or, if they run a company, decide to build a factory. 
The implications for the economy are obvious: The service sector does not shrink, or grow, as fast as the manufacturing sector. And the service sector now accounts for about 80 percent of all jobs in the United States, up from 60 percent in 1960, as a result of the country's higher wealth and the move of manufacturing jobs to other countries. 
The manufacturers that have remained in the United States, and the retailers selling their and others' products, have also been able to decrease the size of their own stockpiles. Many -- most famously Wal-Mart -- have used enormous computer databases to match inventory and sales levels more accurately.
The technology industry itself plays a role. Its products last a shorter time than, say, a car, and its factories need less time to build up or wind down. "It's just a much shorter production cycle," said Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. "We will get an inventory bounce-back in 2002, but technology has less of an inventory cycle."
Even during the most optimistic days of the late 1990's, overall inventory levels remained about 10 percent lower than they did during the 1980's, relative to sales, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
"By tying everyone together, technology has given everyone the same information at the same time," said William S. Stavropoulos, the chairman of Dow Chemical. "You're not always looking back, saying, 'I wish I did this.' "
That lack of regret means that fewer companies are drastically increasing or cutting production in an effort to catch up with a trend they think they might be missing. As a result, economists say, the economy makes fewer sharp turns.
The thinning of inventories can still cause economic pain, as it has this year, when companies reduced their stockpiles by $55 billion, erasing a similar buildup in 2000, according to Goldman, Sachs. But given the size of the boom, analysts say the swing would have been even bigger in the past and might have produced a bigger rebound, too.
AS it is, the rebuilding of inventories will add to economic growth next year, forecasters say, but it will probably have to swim against the tide of lower state and local government spending.
As the federal government has shrunk over the last decade, states have become responsible for a larger portion of public spending. Unlike Congress, which can approve deficit spending to soften a recession's impact, most state legislatures are required by their constitutions not to spend more than they take in. Because tax receipts have fallen in the recession, many states will cut programs and employees next year.
"The states are not in the business of supporting the economy," said Peter Temin, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "They are in the business of balancing their budgets."
Add it all up, and the consensus forecast is for less economic growth in 2002 than in any year of the decade-long expansion, according to Blue Chip Economic Indicators.
As much of a change as that would be from recoveries of some recent decades, it would not be entirely new. From the Civil War to World War II, huge increases in investment -- in housing, railroads and other infrastructure -- were often followed by busts or uneven recoveries. Today, some economists believe that a slow recovery is just what the country needs to return to healthy growth down the line.
"The best thing is actually to go through a process where you're going to have some sluggish growth, working off these imbalances," said Mr. Levy of the forecasting center. "The worst thing that could happen is if we somehow got another boom going now."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Guns and Butter; 
Government Can Run More Than a War

BYLINE:  By JULIAN E. ZELIZER; Julian E. Zelizer, an associate professor of history and public policy at the State University of New York at Albany, is the author of "Taxing America: Wilbur D. Mills, Congress and the State, 1945-1975."

 BODY:
IN 1968, during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon B. Johnson decided that America had to spend its money on the military rather than his domestic agenda, the Great Society. "That bitch of a war," Johnson lamented toward the end of his life, "killed the lady I really loved -- the Great Society."
 As America prepares to enter the next stage of the war and President Bush plans to make homeland security the centerpiece of his fiscal 2003 budget when Congress reconvenes in January, many citizens are convinced that politicians will again make a similar trade-off. Commentators have predicted that there will not be any new government programs that serve a need other than war. Reflecting this fear, Professor Laura D. Tyson, former chief economic adviser to President Clinton, wrote, "Guns versus butter is elementary economics: a society that chooses to spend more of its resources on defense and security will have less available for things like education, health, retirement security, productive investment and consumption." 
 But American history reveals that Johnson's decision is not the only path the nation has taken. In fact throughout the 20th century, domestic programs have been created during the nation's most heated wars. Guns and butter often go hand-in-hand. Military crises have exposed areas where the federal government was needed and have generated broad public support in a country suspicious of government. 
Sometimes war has resulted in new styles of government intervention that were eventually applied to numerous areas of domestic life. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the federal government introduced a distinct type of regulatory board to help manage the economy. Rather than asserting direct control over business institutions and consumers, American politicians chose to have government officials cooperate with private industry representatives to solve wartime problems. World War I regulatory boards relied on incentives, voluntary codes and information.
One example was the Food Administration, headed by Herbert Hoover, which worked with industry representatives to ration food and to monitor prices. To limit consumption, for instance, Hoover instituted "meatless Tuesdays" and "porkless Thursdays and Saturdays." Under the direction of Bernard Baruch, the Wall Street financier, the War Industries Board worked with business leaders to coordinate military production and purchases.
While most of these operations were dismantled after the war, this cooperative approach to regulation survived. Indeed, the National Recovery Administration, the first major program created to end the Great Depression, was modeled after the World War I experiments. Most recently, government-business partnerships have been used to develop the Pentagon's consortium of semiconductor manufacturing.
Other wars led to the creation of permanent domestic programs. One of the most important policies to come out of World War II was the mass income tax. Until World War II, no more than 6 percent of the population had ever been subject to federal income taxation. But the crisis of World War II altered the political landscape. Confronted with a dire need for revenue, the federal government vastly expanded the number of wage earners required to pay.
To generate public support, the Treasury Department conducted a massive public relations campaign through radio, newspapers and film. In one cartoon commissioned by Treasury, Donald Duck and his friends told viewers it was their "duty and privilege" to pay the income tax when soldiers were sacrificing their lives abroad. As the legal scholar Carolyn C. Jones has discovered, radio programs such as Perry Mason and Abbott and Costello broadcast messages promoting the income tax, while Irving Berlin wrote a song for the Treasury called "I Paid My Income Tax Today."
The change brought by World War II was monumental. Between 1939 and 1944, the number of Americans paying federal income taxes rose from about 4 million to 44 million, while collections increased from $1 billion to $19 billion. Income taxes became a central source of revenue for many popular, and unpopular, domestic programs.
When the nation entered a cold war against Communism in the 1940's and 1950's, the expansion of domestic programs continued. With the Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in the White House, Congress passed the historic Interstate Highway Act of 1956, modernizing the nation's road system. This generous public works program, which allocated almost $30 billion over a 10-year period, produced a national highway system that linked much of the nation and facilitated long-distance travel. An entire industry of restaurants and motels would be built around these roads.
The highway program, promoted as a means to allow citizens and the military to leave major cities should there be a nuclear attack, became a centerpiece of national transportation policy. Government funds continued to maintain these roads. Citizens came to view this program as a responsibility of the federal government.
In a similar fashion, one year after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, an embarrassed American government poured money into higher education and academic research through the National Defense Education Act. The funds became integral to the financial infrastructure of private and public universities. Moreover, the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, started in 1958, turned into one of the most popular government programs and remained a massive research project that has shaped knowledge of outer space. 
CERTAINLY, there are imposing barriers to starting domestic programs in 2002 that did not exist in previous decades. First, the federal government now has large pre-existing spending commitments like Social Security and Medicare. The nation is also coming out of two decades of political conservatism. Indeed, the Bush administration is contemplating proposing cuts in energy, environmental and public works programs in the 2003 budget. Moreover, bitter partisanship has made it extremely challenging to pass legislation.
But American history shows that guns over butter is not the only choice that the federal government makes when at war. Indeed, recent polls have shown an increase in public trust of government, reversing a 30-year slide. Just in the past two months, the federal government has taken a stronger role in the nation's transportation infrastructure. With the airport security bill, the president signed a massive public works program that put airline security personnel under the federal umbrella and even included a tax increase -- called a "passenger fee." 
Though partisanship stifled the economic stimulus package, Congress, before breaking for the holidays, finished work on its appropriations bills that included substantial spending increases for education and biomedical research. Nor is it clear that President Bush will obtain cuts in existing programs. 
Given the multiple fronts on which the war is being waged, the widespread internal threats and political interests of both parties, it would not be surprising to see new federal programs created that deal with medical research, health care, food safety, computer technology, law enforcement, unemployment insurance, transportation, energy production and education.
While the programs would be launched under the banner of the military effort, they could create a permanent government presence in areas unimaginable on Sept. 10, 2001.

In Death's Shadow, Valuing Each Life

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
WHAT is a life worth? What is each of the lives that were lost in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks worth? 
 When asked, Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master of the federal fund created to compensate the families of those victims, could only answer, "You'd have to be a rabbi or a priest to try to answer that." 
 Spiritually, that may be so. But Mr. Feinberg has the final say in how much the fund will pay to each family and, as he acknowledged, the American court system places a monetary value on specific human lives almost every day in deciding cases involving car accidents, airplane crashes, workplace casualties and other private disasters. 
Juries weigh the victims' ages and annual incomes, deduct the money the victims would have consumed personally and adjust the future earnings to reflect their present value. They weigh how many dependents were relying on the lost paychecks. They factor in pain and suffering and other intangible injuries. Sometimes, they even weigh whether the victims were rising stars or complacent plodders and tilt their earnings forecasts accordingly.
And the results, experts say, are monetary awards that can vary widely from court to court, from case to case, from life to life. For example, the family of a 26-year-old wife and mother of two, killed in 1989 when a machine collapsed at the factory where she worked in Freeport, N.Y., settled after three years for $400,000, according to VerdictSearch, a legal information service. But the family of a 27-year-old nurse, married with no children, was awarded $890,000 four years after her death in the crash of a DC-10 at O'Hare Airport in Chicago in 1979. 
After almost seven years, a jury awarded $2.6 million to the family of a 21-year-old unmarried college student killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. The family of a young stagehand killed in 1985 on the Broadway set of "La Cage aux Folles" got a settlement of $1 million. The family of singer-songwriter Harry Chapin, killed in a traffic accident in 1981, was awarded $12 million by a jury, but the court trimmed it to $10.5 million.
Mr. Feinberg's attempt to wrestle with these matters has produced a table of "presumptive awards" that reflect economic losses -- essentially, future annual income adjusted for future raises and taxes -- as well as such hardships as lost companionship and emotional suffering. The economic losses vary with the age and annual income of the victim. The non-economic losses begin at $250,000 for everyone, with an additional $50,000 for a spouse and for each surviving child. 
The result is a grid from which families can roughly estimate what they would get in the absence of special circumstances and before the deduction of other income. The presumptive award for a 50-year-old bachelor who earned $80,000 a year would be about $615,000, for example. For a 40-year-old single mother who made $30,000 a year and left a 9-year-old child, the award would be just under $600,000. The award for a 30-year-old who made $175,000 a year and left a spouse and two young children -- $4.3 million. (This information can be found at www.usdoj.gov/victimcompensation/loss --calc.html)
From those sums, under the terms of the statute that created the fund, Mr. Feinberg must deduct life insurance, pension and death benefits and government assistance. But he has considerable discretion to vary the awards to reflect any "extraordinary" circumstances -- a low-income waiter who was a star acting school student at night, for example, or an entrepreneur who had been drawing a low annual salary but would have reaped a substantial payday when the company went public.
These calculations have provoked a loud chorus of criticism from victims' families -- so loud, in fact, that Mr. Feinberg announced on Thursday that he will not let any eligible family walk away from the fund empty-handed, even if the mandated deductions for insurance and other benefits reduces their award to zero.
But legal and economic experts also find much to complain about in Mr. Feinberg's reckoning.
Conrad Berenson of Woodbury, N.Y., an economist who has testified widely in wrongful death cases, says the fund is profoundly unfair to high-salaried victims. Once insurance is deducted, a $50,000-a-year victim's family is likely to receive more than the family of a $175,000-a-year victim, he said.
"It is merely objective to say that this is not a compensation package -- it is a welfare package," Mr. Berenson said. "The fund is saying to the high-income widow, 'You don't need the money, you have insurance.' That is not equitable."
But Donald L. Frankenfeld, a forensic economist in Rapid City, S.D., argues that the Feinberg formula "is so badly skewed that it effectively takes from the poor to compensate the rich." Moreover, he said, Mr. Feinberg has wildly overestimated the future growth in the younger victims' paychecks, making the awards for economic losses larger than they should be.
The question of how to put a compensatory value on the lives lost on Sept. 11 has become so contentious that the American Economics Association and the National Association of Forensic Economics, which meet jointly this week in Atlanta, have hastily added a special four-person panel on Friday to critique the Feinberg compensation plan.
The panel will be led by the co-editors of The Journal of Forensic Economics. The mood, one sponsoring economist said, "will be quite critical."
But while the economists argue, the lawyers are more resigned.
The law creating the fund requires that anyone who seeks an award must first waive their right to sue. But in fact, their right to sue has been taken away by the facts of life, not by an act of Congress, said Paul D. Rheingold, who specializes in personal injury and wrongful death cases in New York.
"Who are you going to take to court?" Mr. Rheingold said. "There is such questionable liability on the part of anyone you might sue. These would be very difficult cases to win." By those lights, the awards Mr. Feinberg outlines should be seen as out-of-court settlements offered in very "iffy" cases, he said.
"But don't try to console a widow with the logic I'm using," he added. "It doesn't work."

Small Gains in a Quiet Holiday Week

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Trading was subdued last week as many investors stepped back from the market to celebrate the holidays.
 Still, late in the week, stocks rose modestly on hopes that the worst of the recession was over. 
On Friday, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence rose in December after three months of declines. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes rose by 6.4 percent in November, the largest increase in almost a year. 
 Upbeat news from retailers also lifted investors' hopes for an economic recovery. TeleCheck Services, which publishes one of several holiday spending indexes, reported that pre-Christmas sales in stores open at least a year rose 2.2 percent over 2000. Wal-Mart and Yahoo also gained after each reported that a surge of holiday shopping had bolstered sales.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrials rose 101.65 points, or 1.01 percent, to 10,136.99. The Nasdaq composite gained 41.43 points, or 2.13 percent, to 1,987.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.13 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,161.02.
 Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 5.10 percent from 5.08 percent. SHERRI DAY

HEADLINE: MY FIRST JOB; 
From the Counter To the Computer

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PETROCELLI; Written with Julie Dunn.; Robert Petrocelli, 35, is co-founder, president and chief executive of Heartlab, a privately held company in Westerly, R.I., that produces cardiac information management systems.

 BODY:
THE year was 1981 and I was 15. The economy was awful and I was willing to do anything for work. 
I found a job at Sunrise Deli, a mom-and-pop Italian delicatessen in Westerly, my hometown. I turned beef into hamburger, cleaned the store, made sandwiches and put together take-out orders. The only thing I didn't do was run the cash register. 
 Working the night shift for two summers, I earned minimum wage, but the job taught me a work ethic. 
 During this time, I started a band, called Talsian, with high school friends and was more interested in my guitar than in college or technology. We played Top 40 hits by bands like Genesis and Journey in local bars and clubs, which was cool because we were under age. Luckily, the band broke up in my senior year of high school. Still, it was the start of my entrepreneurial streak because we were always looking for ways to get more work. 
 In my sophomore year at the University of Rhode Island, I was one of 15 people nationwide chosen for a summer undergraduate research fellowship in oceanography, or Surfo, sponsored by the Office of Naval Research. I had never really been in front of a computer before, and my first project was modeling the Gulf Stream flow. I was surrounded by a talented group of engineers from various colleges and universities as well as students from the Graduate School of Oceanography at Rhode Island. I worked at the Office of Naval Research for the remainder of my college years. 
 The experience taught me how to look at things from different perspectives. I still pull out my old dusty mathematics books, like "Numerical Recipes," when I'm looking for answers to problems.

A Los Angeles Laker in King Arthur's Dome

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner (COMPILED BY RICK GLADSTONE) 

 BODY:
 Philip F. Anschutz, the billionaire whose holdings include a stake in basketball's Los Angeles Lakers, has always been a contrarian. He continues to snap up soccer teams, recently taking control of New York's MetroStars, defying those who say the league is a dud. 
He bought the bankrupt Regal Cinema chain at a time when American movie theaters were struggling. And he has won approval for a $1 billion plan to create a 27-acre entertainment district in downtown Los Angeles, a gamble even in the best economic times. Now Mr. Anschutz has gone further: his latest project is to turn London's blighted Millennium Dome into a sports and entertainment complex. The dome, which resembles an upside-down wok, is a national joke, mocked for its dearth of visitors and attacked for its expensive upkeep. (Some $898 million of taxpayer money has been plowed into the project.) Now the government has given it away in return for a share of future profits. 
 The Anschutz Entertainment Group and Meridian Delta, a property developer, plan to turn the dome into a 20,000-seat arena. Timothy J. Leiweke, president of An-
schutz Entertainment, said its experience in concerts (the Britney Spears fall tour) and real estate (Staples Center) made it uniquely qualified. Mr. Anschutz, whose fortune was built on oil and railways, has turned disaster to advantage before. When an oil well he was drilling blew up, he sold the rights to film it for the 1969 film "Hellfighters" for $100,000. Suzanne Kapner

HEADLINE: Pecos Journal; 
Texas Desert Town Thirsts for Lost Jobs and People

BYLINE:  By ROSS E. MILLOY 

DATELINE: PECOS, Tex., Dec. 23 

 BODY:
When McCain Foods Ltd., the world's largest producer of frozen French fries, bought out Anchor Food Products, which has 700 employees in this remote West Texas town, few residents saw anything ominous in the company's motto: "One World. One Fry."
 But now that McCain is closing the plant here, which processed 65 million pounds of frozen onion rings last year, the company's employees, and others among Pecos's 10,000 residents, are angry and shaken, worried not just about their own careers but about the future of the town itself. 
 The loss of about 10 percent of Pecos's jobs presents a particular challenge because of the town's isolated location, several hundred miles from any major urban center in a flat desert landscape of sun-browned greasebush and tumbleweed. And now Pecos, an old stagecoach stop best known for its cattle, cantaloupes and lawless past, may become better known for housing federal convicts. 
"Everything is changing, not just for me but for the whole town," said Joe Anchondo, 32, a production supervisor at the Anchor plant. "How long can a town go on, losing people, losing jobs, before no one will even try to live around here anymore?"
Pecos has seen its share of economic setbacks before. Deserted streets and shuttered buildings offer evidence of decades of decline: warehouses abandoned when the aquifer that nourished huge farming operations here played out; oil-field service companies that shut down in the mid-1980's petroleum bust; empty ranch supply stores, victims of drought and low beef prices; and houses for sale or vacant after 40 years of declining population.
"This used to be a great place for families, filled with businesses and young people. Now it seems like the town is just sitting around waiting to die," said Karon Shelton, owner of a local steakhouse, who has lived here for 20 years.
In its Old West heyday, Pecos was a busy rail and cattle trail crossing, and even today a local museum honors the hanging judge Roy Bean -- "the only law west of the Pecos" -- and the mythical cowboy Pecos Bill, supposedly born here (and raised by coyotes), who could rope huge cattle herds with a single lariat loop.
Today, a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line and per capita income is less than half the national average. Pecos lost another large employer with the demise of a local sulfur mine three years ago. Many see themselves as victims of global competition and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"That mine had been here forever, but after Nafta passed, they could get sulfur cheaper out of Mexico and Canada and so they shut it down. The same thing's happening out at Anchor," Mrs. Shelton said. "They'll make those onion rings cheaper up in Canada, you just wait and see."
Pecos residents say they believe McCain, a Canadian company, bought Anchor to remove it as a competitor in the frozen food marketplace, but company officials say other facilities they own are simply more efficient than the local plant. Nafta played no part in the shutdown, they say. McCain will invest $10 million in its Nebraska operation, officials have said, to make up the difference in production.
That rankles people like Mr. Anchondo, who in addition to working at the plant himself has 10 relatives who work there. "We've got trained people here, experienced people here," he said. "Just give us the technology and we'll match or better anything they can do up there."
Local officials, resigned to the closing, say that housing federal prisoners may be Pecos's next growth industry. Reeves County officials recently voted to expand the detention center for federal convicts here to 3,000 beds from 2,000, bringing at least the potential of more jobs at the prison, which now employs 450. The city government is also getting into the prison business, with a 96-bed center to hold inmates for the United States Marshals Service expected to open early next year.
Many now employed at the McCain plant hope to find work at one of those prisons; others say they will be forced to move elsewhere in West Texas, or even out of state.
Some, like Mr. Anchondo, are considering jobs at one of the McCain plants in Nebraska or Wisconsin. "If I can get on up there, I think I'll do it," he said.
But still others, who enjoy the quiet pace of life in this dusty, barren spot, have vowed to stay. Mrs. Shelton, who bought her steakhouse, the Jersey Lily, when it went out of business, says she's not going anywhere.
"We've seen bad times before, and we don't turn tail and run from trouble," she said. "I'm going to stay right here and fight."

HEADLINE: Alaska Panel Has Suggestions For Improving Race Relations 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska 

 BODY:
The videotape showed Eskimos in downtown Anchorage flinching and shielding their faces as they were shot at with paintball guns by three young white men in a car, who laughed as they cruised the streets and filmed their search for victims.
 Out of that incident, which occurred last January and sparked discussion in Alaska about bigotry in a state where about 16 percent of the residents list themselves as Indian or Alaska Native, has come a new report by Gov. Tony Knowles's Commission on Tolerance, which listed nearly 100 recommendations for improving race relations. 
 Several of the 14-member group's proposals were economic, such as raising the state minimum wage or increasing money for programs in rural Native villages. Others were cultural, such as adding a verse to the state song to reflect the influence of Native cultures. The commission's 35-page report, issued Dec. 6, said the state's educational curriculum should include more emphasis on Native people, as Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts are known here. 
"The commission heard heartbreaking testimony of discrimination and injustice, expressions of frustration at a system in which many feel they are not full participants, and demands for action," the Rev. Chuck Eddy, who was chairman of the commission, said. 
The report included a Community Action Guide describing "ways each Alaskan can take personal responsibility to work toward a society that celebrates diversity."
How state lawmakers will deal with the report's recommendations is unclear. Republicans dominate the state Legislature and some have suggested that Governor Knowles, a Democrat, had exaggerated the extent of racial problems in Alaska by convening the commission. 
"I don't believe Alaska is a racist state, but I have seen this governor pick at the scab of racism until it's a festering sore," State Senator Pete Kelly, Republican of Fairbanks, said. "He told them to go around the state and find everything that's wrong with the state, sometimes in isolated examples."
However isolated the paintball attacks might have been, they clearly struck a chord of outrage among many Alaskans, who saw news accounts of the tape depicting the Eskimos, mainly men but a few women as well, as they were hit by the marble-size paintball pellets.
The youths, a 19-year-old and two younger teenagers, appeared to be looking for Eskimos.
"Shoot him! Shoot him!" one voice on the tape said. "You need to shoot that guy."
Another voice replied: "No. He's Chinese."
One man involved in the attacks, Charles D. Wiseman, who is now 20, pleaded guilty or no contest in July to three charges of misdemeanor assault. Mr. Wiseman admitted to filming the attacks, while one teenager drove and the other shot the paintball gun. The teenagers' cases have been handled in juvenile court, where proceedings are closed.
An Anchorage judge, who said Mr. Wiseman and the two boys had acted with "horrible glee," sentenced Mr. Wiseman to six months in jail and 300 hours of community service, and fined him $6,000.
"I feel horrible about how we behaved," Mr. Wiseman read from a statement in court and then apologized to the victims, several of whom attended the sentencing. "I didn't think about how wrong it was."
The sentence, as well as the judge's depiction of the act as a hate crime, was hailed by some Natives, but others said it demonstrated that the state should have much stronger laws to punish bias-related violence.
"A hate crime of any kind that involves violence certainly falls in line to be classified as a felony," the Alaskan Federation of Natives said after Mr. Wiseman confessed. "We are disappointed that plea agreements are coming down in an event that is one step short of using real bullets." 
The commission's report, while prompted in large measure by the paintball attacks, also dealt with economic disparities between rural villages, many of which are largely or entirely Native, and the predominantly white, wealthier cities. The commission said the legislature should halt budget cuts for a program that subsidizes electricity in rural areas and should increase spending for rural schools.
Lt. Gov. Fran Ulmer, a commission member, said that while the paintball attacks were disturbing, many Alaskans of all races had reacted with horror and said they did not represent how Alaskans feel about the diversity of their state.
"I think the time is right for Alaskans to brag about how rich our cultural diversity is and see it as a treasure," Ms. Ulmer said.

For New Head of a Family, Help With a Daunting Job

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
For some reason, 5-year-old Demetrius Porter could not sleep on a frigid evening in East Harlem in February. As his mother, Victoria Lopez, scrubbed his school clothes in her kitchen sink, Demetrius continued to try to get her attention.
 "Demetrius," she said, "please go to sleep." 
 After a few minutes had passed, he went to his room in their fifth-floor walkup apartment, put his head on the pillow and fell asleep. When she finished his laundry, Demetrius's mother did the same. 
But they were awakened less than an hour later. The phone was ringing with a collect call from Ms. Lopez's half sister in Reading, Pa.
"Mommy died," her sister said.
Ms. Lopez, 32, thought that her sister must be playing some kind of joke. Four days earlier, Ms. Lopez had seen her mother, Nadia Garcia, 51, who appeared in good health.
But it was no joke, and Ms. Lopez began to cry. Her mother had died in her sleep from a heart attack. "I was upset; I couldn't believe it," she said. "I had just talked to her on the phone the day before."
That phone call was the beginning of a very difficult period of several months in which Ms. Lopez would be called on to bury her mother, provide shelter for three siblings and take custody of one of them: her other half sister, Elizabeth Romero, then 14, who had had surgery and was undergoing physical therapy to correct the bone structure of her leg.
Elizabeth had fallen on a patch of ice four years earlier, breaking her right leg near the knee. "After it happened, I never told my mother." Elizabeth, now 15, said. "For a couple of years I was walking on my leg after I broke it."
The leg became bent sideways at an odd angle, and only after the pain became unbearable did she tell her mother what had happened and visit a doctor. "It started healing and I didn't get it fixed," Elizabeth said. "It grew deformed, and just started hurting. The doctors said if I never went to get the surgery I would have ended up never walking again."
After Ms. Garcia died, Ms. Lopez took in Elizabeth, as well as her other half sister, who is 18, and her 19-year-old half brother, all of whom had been living with their mother in Reading. Ms. Lopez refused to disclose the names of her other sister and her brother.
"It's hard for all of us," she said. "We all bicker, we argue. We're all living in a two-bedroom apartment."
Elizabeth's sole guardian had been her mother. Her father, she said, is not involved with her life and she has not asked him for child support. When Elizabeth's mother died, she had a choice. "It was either her," she said, pointing to Ms. Lopez, "or a foster home."
So Ms. Lopez went to court to obtain custody of her sister. "Look," Ms. Lopez said, "her father hasn't been in her life, and I wasn't going to let her go to foster care."
Ms. Lopez needed to travel between East Harlem and Reading twice for court appearances to gain custody of Elizabeth and to help her move her things. But Ms. Lopez, who is unemployed and receives welfare, did not have enough money for the trips.
She was able to go, however, with help from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Demetrius had been seeing a counselor at the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven local charities supported by the fund, for several years. When Ms. Lopez told his counselor, Emily Hansen, that her mother had died and that she needed to go to Pennsylvania, Ms. Hansen paid for her $21 bus ticket and the $10.50 ticket for Demetrius, with money from the Neediest Cases Fund.
Ms. Lopez was grateful for the help. "When I needed something they were there for me for something that I didn't have," she said.
When Ms. Lopez got custody of Elizabeth in May, Elizabeth did not immediately move in with her, but was transferred from a hospital in Delaware to one in New York for more physical therapy. She was released in August. 
Now that Elizabeth is living with her, Ms. Lopez has her hands full: it takes a half hour for Elizabeth, who walks with the help of a metal cane, to climb the stairs to their apartment. "If I had one wish it would be to have an apartment on the first floor, or a house," Ms. Lopez said, "because she can't keep walking up those stairs."
Despite her reluctance to be its leader, Ms. Lopez has succeeded in uniting a family. "I don't want to take the mother role," Ms. Lopez said, "except for my son."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Uncertainty Seems the Only Sure Thing

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Maybe it is the baseball version of whistling past the graveyard, circa 2001.
 "We're in better shape than 28 teams," Dave St. Peter, a Minnesota Twins executive, said. "We know if we play, we'll have a 30-team schedule." 
 St. Peter, senior vice president for business affairs, was referring to the uncertainty that has hovered over Major League Baseball this off-season like a suffocating smog. 
Less than seven weeks before the start of spring training, teams do not know if the schedule they have for the 2002 season is the one they will play under, if the tickets they are selling will have to be exchanged for different games under a new schedule and if they will be playing with 30 teams or 28.
One team, its identity as uncertain as other matters, even faces the prospect of playing in a different league.
"We're on course for the season," St. Peter said, outlining some of the business steps the Twins have taken in the face of extinction. "That said, anybody who says it's business as usual would be lying. It's not business as usual with the big 'C' word hanging over your head."
That word would be contraction, the strategy Commissioner Bud Selig has undertaken as the first step in his efforts to alleviate the economic hardship he and the owners say has inundated baseball.
With the strong support of the owners, Selig wants to eliminate two teams before next season. He continues to withhold their identity, but the Twins and the Montreal Expos are the teams he has targeted for extinction.
If he succeeds in his plan, Selig will balance the two leagues at 14 teams each by moving one team from the National League to the American. Although the Arizona Diamondbacks at one time would have been the easiest team to move because as a recent expansion franchise they have no veto power, the most likely candidate now is the Florida Marlins.
The fate of these teams depends on two legal challenges to contraction. One is by the Major League Baseball Players Association in a hearing before an arbitrator that is continuing. The other is in a lawsuit in Minnesota, where on Thursday a three-judge panel of the state court of appeals heard baseball's argument that it has the right to eliminate the Twins for the 2002 season.
Both challenges will stretch into next month, at least, but Selig is intent on pursuing contraction and waiting as long as he can, into February if necessary, before calling it off for next season.
"We'll play it day by day and see what happens," Selig said recently. Speaking specifically of the sale of tickets for games in 2002, he said: "You know you're going to play 81 home games. The worst will be you have to make some adjustments to the schedule. My father used to tell me life is a series of adjustments. In this case I'm going to put it to the test and see what happens."
But the schedule, ticket sales and other business needs -- advertising, sponsorships, marketing -- are not the only matters suffering from the effort to eliminate two teams.
The labor agreement between the owners and the players expired Nov. 7, and its replacement is not in sight. A new agreement is difficult to hammer out in the best of times. The contraction scrap has eaten up valuable negotiating time and has infected the negotiating atmosphere.
Negotiations for eight previous agreements have resulted in eight work stoppages, the perfect record that every player shoots for but never attains. As a labor record, however, it is not the envy of negotiators. These negotiations, once they start in earnest, perhaps next week, could extend the record to nine for nine, maybe as early as Feb. 15, when the clubs could lock the players out of spring training.
After an owners' meeting Nov. 6, Selig said he did not have any plans to lock the players out "at the present time." Asked three weeks later, after another owners' meeting, about that qualifying phrase, he said: "We have no plans to lock out players. It's not even on my radar screen. I still don't want to do it."
But the players suspect he will.
The core issues in the talks will be revenue sharing and payroll tax, and Selig is prepared to use last year's blue ribbon panel report as a bible in his effort to change the economic system. Based on the recommendations of the panel, which the commissioner appointed, Selig wants to raise the amount of local revenue shared among the teams from 20 percent to 50 percent and the tax on payrolls over a certain level from 34 percent in 1999, the last year the tax existed, to 50 percent.
The union, whose approval is needed to raise either rate, views those percentages as too high. It feels the revenue sharing rate would force the wealthier teams to share so much revenue that it could affect their spending on players, and the payroll tax would serve as a payroll cap, which the players have always opposed.
The union also disputes management's right to determine contraction unilaterally, which is why they are enmeshed in a hearing that will resume Thursday. The lawyers will present their cases while awaiting the outcome of the Minnesota appeal.
In that lawsuit, baseball and the Twins argue that the lower court judge, Harry Seymour Crump, erred when he issued a temporary injunction last month, requiring the Twins to play next season under terms of their lease with the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission and ordering baseball not to interfere with their ability to play those games.
The loser of the appeal will almost certainly will take the case to the Minnesota Supreme Court. But if the court of appeals overturns the injunction and if the sports commission does not get a stay of that order and if the arbitrator, Shyam Das, upholds management's right to eliminate teams unilaterally, then Selig could announce the demise of the Twins and the Expos.
In that event, management and union lawyers would still have to negotiate the status of the players on those teams, people like Vladimir Guerrero, Orlando Cabrera, Javier Vazquez, Brad Radke, Rick Reed and Eric Milton. Management agrees that it must bargain the effects of contraction.
When the two sides tried last month to negotiate terms of a dispersal draft, the lawyers got nowhere. One baseball official said that when the contraction venture began, management lawyers thought they could negotiate to impasse in 48 hours and impose their own terms for a draft. But the union's grievance stepped in the way of that strategy.
Despite Selig's staunch stance, contraction for the 2002 season grows less likely with each passing day. If the season proceeds with 30 teams, the Expos will most likely not have an owner.
Jeffrey Loria, who is the controlling owner of the staggering Expos, is expected to buy the Marlins from John Henry as soon as Henry and his group are approved as new owners of the Boston Red Sox. Major League Baseball would then operate the Expos, because no one has expressed an interest in buying them.
Loria would have liked to have moved the Expos to Northern Virginia. But Selig has blocked any such move for the immediate future, saying that it would only shift that set of problems from one area to another.
Under one proposal, the Expos would play in Washington next season because in Montreal they would be expected to draw even fewer fans than usual as a lame-duck team. But Selig will not allow that move, even if it is temporary, because a good show of attendance in Washington would enhance the case for a team in that area and undermine the reasons for eliminating the Expos.
Another potential snag in the contraction plans has arisen in the form of a wealthy Alabama banker who has expressed interest in buying the Twins and even privately financing a new park for them. He is Donald Watkins, 53, founder and chairman of Alamerica Bank of Birmingham, and he would be the first black owner of a major league team.
Carl Pohlad, the Twins' owner, has not said, at least publicly, if he would sell the team to Watkins. A wealthy banker himself, Pohlad has said he wants to get out of baseball and has agreed to allow his team to be eliminated. Until the announcement comes, though, the Twins prepare for the 2002 season, even though they have not named a manager.
"We have a winter caravan, where we go to 53 communities in the upper Midwest, and a Twinfest in January and February," St. Peter, the Twins executive, said. "We have to make decisions quickly about whether we can pull those off in 2002 and what kind of message we'll have for the fans.
"Our desire is to put the focus back where it should be, on our good young team. We were forecasting 2 million to 2.2 million fans. We've made some estimates about what contraction talk has done. There's no question it will have an impact."

Westchester Jobs Remained Steady in 2001

BYLINE:  By Jessica Kovler 

 BODY:
Westchester County's unemployment rate remained steady in 2001, according to the New York State Department of Labor.
 In November 2000 3.7 percent of Westchester residents were unemployed; that number was unchanged in November 2001 despite the recession and economic woes attributed to the events of Sept. 11. 
 The State Department of Labor released its annual unemployment report this month, reporting increased job loss throughout the state. New York's unemployment rate rose from 5 percent in October to 5.4 percent in November. In November 2000, state unemployment was 4.5 percent.
The national jobless rate went up from 5.4 percent in October to 5.7 percent in November. 
The majority of the losses were in New York City.
Salvatore J. Carrera, director of economic development and real estate for the county, said: "Real estate is notoriously expensive in Westchester, so we didn't have to grapple with a mass exile of big business," while elsewhere in the state there have been waves of layoffs at manufacturing plants. 
The unemployment figures are based on monthly surveys of 20,000 businesses, excluding agricultural workers, the self-employed and domestic workers in private households. Jessica Kovler

 ISADORA
A Sensational Life.
By Peter Kurth.
Illustrated. 652 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. $29.95.
 The most famous woman of the first quarter of the 20th century may have been Mary Pickford, but the most influential, and the most notorious, was Isadora Duncan. She was the progenitor and soul of a new art form, modern dance. She was the prototype of the uninhibited young American whose freshness and originality charmed jaded old Europe. And for decades she startled respectable society -- even as she helped transform it -- with her flouting of conventions, both onstage and off. You would have to go back to George Sand or Byron to find a comparably galvanizing figure. Early in 1927, in the fledgling New Yorker, Janet Flanner identified her as "the last of the trilogy of great female personalities our century produced," along with Duse and Bernhardt. But those two supreme actresses were dead ends; no one could follow in their footsteps. Isadora's accomplishments reverberate through the history of dance to this day.
Isadora Duncan was born in San Francisco in 1877, the youngest of four children. Her father regularly made and lost fortunes, and eventually was gone from the family (he was to die in a shipwreck -- nothing the Duncans did was ordinary). The children and their mother lived from hand to mouth; there is more than a touch of Micawberism in the way they got by -- high spirits in the midst of semipenury. But already Isadora was demonstrating the vigorous independence that was to carry her to world fame. 
In a new biography, "Isadora: A Sensational Life," Peter Kurth traces her blazing path. From the start she was clearly the Chosen One within what the family called the Clan Duncan. At 18, with her mother in tow and $25 in her pocket, she started east and soon wangled a job with Augustin Daly's prestigious stage company, spending months in various demeaning (to her) roles and developing "a perfect nausea for the theater." She confronted Daly: "What's the good of having me here, with my genius, when you make no use of me?" By the time she was 21, she was established in New York, appearing in concerts, dancing to Chopin at special matinees, providing entertainment in private salons (including Mrs. Astor's, in Newport). She was young, slender, very pretty with her vivid red hair and Irish button nose, and exceedingly charming -- a Botticelli figurine. She was also highly respectable, with her formidable mother at the piano and her brothers and sister accompanying her dancing with recitations, often from "The Rubaiyat." Yet she was already shocking people with her "unobscured limbs." And she was already lecturing -- hectoring? -- her audiences about The Dance. 
In May 1899, after the usual Duncan calamities (a near-fatal fire in their hotel), Isadora set out for the larger opportunities of Europe. Her reputation grew as she succeeded in London, then Paris, and was sealed in Budapest in 1902 -- 20 sold-out performances, ovations, roses thrown at her feet. She was also no longer a virgin. Oszkar Beregi, a handsome young actor, was performing Romeo, and very quickly she was his offstage Juliet, only without benefit of Friar Lawrence. She had waited a long while to discover sex -- she was 25 -- but she would make up for lost time. 
Not for long with Beregi, however; soon he tactfully suggested that she proceed with her career, and, having fantasized about marriage, she felt as if she had "eaten bushels of broken glass." On she went, though, to Vienna and Munich, where she had an even greater triumph. It was there, Kurth tells us, that "the German 'cult of Isadora' was born, a national craze that took her beyond success and notoriety into the realms of literature, philosophy, feminism and even science . . . as the realization of Darwin's dream, the 'Dancer of the Future,' whose coming proclaimed the triumph of beauty and the liberation of women in the final perfection of the race." In "My Life," her more readable than accurate autobiography, she recalls that it was in Berlin at this time that "on my return from performances where the audience had been delirious with joy, I would sit far into the night in my white tunic, with a glass of white milk beside me, poring over the pages of Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason.' " Her blue-stocking earnestness had found its perfect match in Germanic high-seriousness. It was also in Berlin that she was invited by Cosima, the Widow Wagner, to perform in the bacchanal from "Tannh* user" at Bayreuth. This experience proved to be a mixed blessing, but a passion for Cosima's son-in-law helped distract Isadora from the loss of Oszkar. 
Through these years, she was constantly studying the sources of movement and refining her own liberating approach to dance, which she claimed to have discovered in the waves breaking on California shores, in the art of ancient Greece, in the ideas of Whitman, Nietzsche and Wagner. Wherever she went, she proclaimed her aesthetic, both from the stage and in writing. Her costumes were scant, but she was shrouded in her lofty ideas: "Art which is not religious is not art, is mere merchandise." Within a short time she was being acclaimed everywhere as a profound revolutionary spirit. 
But what was her dancing really like? She never allowed herself to be filmed, so all our evidence is secondhand. In a 1992 article, Anne Hollander, having studied the numberless photographs and artistic representations that constitute the massive Duncan iconography, reported that they "tell a fairly consistent story, showing the thrusting knee, the bowed or thrown-back head, the open arms, the whirling colored stuffs veiling the torso. None show Duncan in midair. Along with running, she seems to have done a great deal of skipping and prancing, with her bare knees pushing up through slits in the drapery, but no high or broad leaping, no extended legs. Instead, she used the floor, kneeling and reclining, collapsing and rising. The face in the pictures is always blank -- attention is riveted on those flashing naked legs and feet, those sweeping bare arms, that rounded exposed throat." In other words, throw in Isadora's radical insistence that movement must come from the solar plexus, and here is modern dance. We also know how musical she was, responding spontaneously rather than analytically to her beloved Chopin, her Gluck, her Beethoven, her Brahms, her Wagner. In this, too, she was radical -- critics violently disapproved of her presumption in dancing to symphonic masterpieces. 
In 1903 Isadora temporarily abandoned her career so that the Duncans could fulfill their dream of setting foot in Greece, which -- in order to make the trip "as primitive as possible" -- they approached in a little sailing boat, at dawn. On the beach, Isadora and her brother Raymond knelt down and kissed the soil, Raymond declaiming poetry. "The inhabitants all came down to the beach to greet us, and the first landing of Christopher Columbus in America could not have caused more astonishment among the natives." Soon the clan had rejected their already unusual garments to don "tunic and chlamys and peplum"; they had already substituted sandals for shoes. (Isadora was to dress this way for much of her life, and Raymond for all of his.) They bought land and started to erect a temple, but alas, the land they had acquired had no water within two and a half miles. Still, "we were living under the reign of Agamemnon, Menelaus and Priam." (Priam, presumably, was on a visit from Troy.) After a year of the simple life, she was touring again, to the usual acclaim. 
Soon Isadora met the man who was surely the great love of her life, the avant-garde stage designer Gordon Craig, who was the illegitimate son of England's most treasured actress, Ellen Terry. Craig was handsome, he was brilliant, and he was a ruthlessly selfish womanizer. (He was not only married but was the father of eight children, only four of them with his wife.) Craig brought Isadora the sexual and intellectual companionship she craved, the satisfaction of being linked with a great man (as she and he both saw him), and her first child, Deirdre. He also brought her anguish, as their passion and their competing obsessions with their work turned them into characters out of Strindberg. (The evidence is all there in Francis Steegmuller's invaluable edition of their correspondence, "Your Isadora.") As usual, Isadora held nothing back: "O I tell you I have no caution or care," she wrote to him, "& if I don't see you soon I will pull myself up by the roots & throw myself in the Sea. . . . Come nice growly Tiger -- Eat me up . . . Come Eat me -- Put your lips to mine & begin that way." Her need to give too much had found its fatal counterpart in his bottomless need to take. 
Late in 1904, in the flush of her early happiness with Craig, she arrived in St. Petersburg on her first trip to Russia -- a crucial moment in ballet history, given the liberating influence her dancing was to have on the young Michel Fokine's experiments. There has been endless discussion as to exactly how great an influence this was, but according to Diaghilev, she dealt the Russian ballet "a shock from which it could never recover." Despite her animadversions against ballet -- an expression of degeneration, of living death" -- she was warmly welcomed by the ballet establishment and, of course, by the public. And she made a powerful impression on Stanislavsky, who later wrote, "It became clear to me that we were looking for one and the same thing in different branches of art." 
It was around this time that Isadora began her lifelong struggle to establish a school for children. The first one was in Berlin, and was run mainly by her sister, Elizabeth; there were to be others. Wherever she went, Isadora battled to convince not only rich patrons but governments to back her grandiose plans. These schools were Isadora's obsession, reflecting both her determination to spread her word -- that to live was to dance -- and her fierce need to mother. For years she spent the fortune in fees she was earning to support them. 
In her endless pursuit of money for the Berlin school, Isadora often joked about acquiring a millionaire, and as usual she had her way. In 1909, she encountered the astonishingly rich Paris Singer, an imposing, well-educated and generally amiable 40-year-old who was one of the heirs of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. She reports: "He entered, tall and blond, curling hair and beard. My first thought was: Lohengrin." A second thought: "I realized that this was my millionaire, for whom I had sent my brain waves seeking." Lohengrin was instantly smitten, and soon was providing jewels, yachts, a magnificent chateau in which she could start yet another school, and a second child, Patrick. She loved Singer, was grateful to him and then perversely and repeatedly treated him so badly that he backed away. The last straw came in 1917 when he offered to buy her Madison Square Garden. "What do you think I am, a circus?" she snapped. "I suppose you want me to advertise prizefights with my dancing!" At that, he was finally gone. 
But by then she was no longer the Isadora the world had celebrated. Four years earlier had come the great tragedy of her life. Deirdre and Patrick, 6 and 3 years old, were drowned when their car slid down a muddy embankment and into the Seine. It was a death blow to Isadora: "When real sorrow is encountered there is for the stricken no gesture, no expression. Like Niobe turned to stone, I sat and longed for annihilation in death." She fled to Greece with her brothers and sister; to Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, Paris, back to Italy, finding solace nowhere. 
What eventually brought her back to life was, of course, dancing. Her most famous work during this period was "Marseillaise," which ended with "her left breast bared in evocation of Delacroix's 'Liberty Leading the People,' " and she was to bare her breast in Europe and across North and South America throughout World War I. Agnes de Mille, who saw her at this time, described her as a "prematurely aged and bloated woman," yet added, "Isadora wore a blood-red robe which she threw over her shoulder as she stamped to the footlights and raised her arms in the great Duncan salute. . . . This was heroic and I never forgot it. No one who saw Isadora ever forgot her." 
After a period of relative calm, the final significant episode of Isadora's life began in 1921 with an extended stay in the Soviet Union, which had promised her an official school. (She now saw herself as a Communist, insisting on being called "Comrade" by the startled Russians.) This was the trip that kindled her last full-blown romantic liaison, with the brilliant but dangerously unstable poet Sergei Esenin. She was 45 when they met; he was 26. It was another case of love at first sight, followed at once by every kind of trouble -+yet, presumably to ensure Esenin safe passage to the West, she married him, after decades of proclaiming herself above marriage. 
To call this relationship a fiasco is to fail to do it justice. Disaster? Debacle? Catastrophe? He was violent, alcoholic and untrustworthy, but also extraordinarily talented and famous -- crucial for Isadora. Besides, with his baby face and golden hair, he reminded her of her poor dead little Patrick. (There's a recipe for marriage!) He loved her, needed her, sponged from her, abused her. They racketed around Europe and America creating bedlam wherever they went -- drunken scenes, unpaid bills. (As one observer put it, "Every intelligent person, in Moscow and everywhere else they went, from Paris to Kansas City, knew that this blind union was a disaster to them both, as well as to the hotel furniture.") She got him back to Russia, where he dumped her; she saw him only twice more. A year later, he hanged himself in a hotel room, having first slit one of his wrists so that he could write a final poem in his blood. 
By then she was back in France, and for the rest of her life she lived mainly in Nice and Paris. She was in a dire state. Friends loyally denied that she was a drunk, but she was one. And she was fat. The 17-year-old George Balanchine had watched her perform in Petrograd in the early 20's, and, with all the heartlessness of youth, saw her as "a drunken, fat woman who for hours was rolling around like a pig." (He did add, though, "She was probably a nice juicy girl when she was young.") 
She was equally far gone emotionally. She had grown sexually rapacious and undiscriminating, and was living precariously, with occasional handouts from friends and a few francs earned from makeshift performances. There were pawnshops, dispossessions; always one step ahead of the sheriff. (On a train trip to Paris -- the deluxe train, of course -- the porter had to pay for her dinner.) Then, flings and extravagant generosity when money came through. Economy and moderation were, needless to say, alien to her nature. In 1927, desperate for cash, she finally settled down to write her memoirs. (Her publishers had insisted that she spice them up; well, maybe they were right -- My Life" is still in print.) Her last lover in residence was a young Russian musician, but she also became involved with the notorious Mercedes de Acosta, who later took up with Garbo and Dietrich, among others. The evidence points to a passionate affair. (Until then, Isadora had presumably been too busy with men, as she lurched from the great and the near-great -- Picabia, Steichen, the pianist Harold Bauer, the war ace Roland Garros, to name a very few of her scores, even hundreds, of conquests -- to just plain Joes, like the stoker, the boxer and the gigolo she dallied with on the steamship that took her to South America in 1916.) 
By the fall of 1927 she had little to look forward to; at 50, and given her physical condition, she could not realistically count on a dance future. The famous death came swiftly. Flirting with a young garage mechanic from Nice, she demanded that he take her out in a racing car that she announced she was thinking of buying. (Isadora had always loved fast cars.) She stepped into the car, wearing a large shawl that her closest friend, Mary Desti, had designed for her. "Adieu, mes amis, je vais a la gloire," she cried. The fringes of the shawl caught in the spokes of the left rear wheel, the car started forward, and within seconds Isadora's neck was broken and she was dead. Desti confessed to her son, the director-to-be Preston Sturges, who was partly raised in the Duncan circle, that "actually it was a good thing. Isadora was drinking heavily, had become as fat as a balloon and was daily destroying the legends of her past loveliness and the dignity of her great position among the artists of the world." It is certainly tempting to see her instantaneous and painless death as a merciful release.
How to make sense of this immense, complicated, beautiful and grotesque life? Many have tried: the Isadora Duncan literature is a tidal wave of loving reminiscence, obfuscation, self-glorification, infighting and supposition by those who knew her, followed by a series of generally worthy biographies and extended commentaries on her work. And now there is Peter Kurth, sardonic yet appreciative, neither adoring nor denigrating. Manfully confessing in his preface that when he began, "dance was a field as foreign to me as physics or stock car racing," he has stylishly synthesized the literature to give us the fullest and most coherent account of the life to date. He is least useful, naturally, on Isadora's dancing; nor is he particularly insightful about her psychology. Fortunately, these are the two areas in which Frederika Blair's "Isadora: Portrait of the Artist as a Woman," published 15 years ago, is strongest: she believes in, and carefully places, Duncan's work, and she points gracefully, never heavily, to what she sees as the roots of Isadora's erratic behavior. 
Yet despite such excellent work as Kurth's and Blair's, we are left with questions. First, how good a dancer was she? There is so much testimony to her performing genius, her irresistible stage charisma, that they can hardly be doubted. Consider: Edith Wharton ("That first sight of Isadora's dancing was a white milestone to me. It shed a light on every kind of beauty"); the great Diaghilev ballerina Tamara Karsavina ("She moved with those wonderful steps of hers with a simplicity and detachment that could only come through the intuition of genius itself"); the authoritative music critic Ernest Newman ("The soul becomes drunk with this endless succession of beautiful lines and groupings"); Frederick Ashton ("I got an impression of enormous grace, and enormous power in her dancing -- she was very serious, and held the audience and held them completely"); Serge Koussevitsky ("She incarnated music in her dance"); Ruth St. Denis ("For Isadora, I would do battle. To reject her genius is unthinkable"); Rodin ("The greatest woman I have ever known. . . . Sometimes I think she is the greatest woman the world has ever known"). If we can't trust witnesses like these, whom can we trust? 
It is her life that presents the unanswerable question. Why did this glorious girl, with the world at her feet, turn into the ghastly wreck who could say toward the end, "I don't dance anymore, I only move my weight around," and "There are only two things left, a drink and a boy"? The easiest explanation is that the death of the children permanently unhinged her. But the seeds of her destruction must always have been there, and two of her New York friends suggest what they may have been. 
Arnold Genthe, who took superb pictures of her, wrote in his memoirs: "Where her work was concerned she had integrity and patience, knowing no compromise with what she felt to be the truth about beauty. In her personal life she had charm and a naive wit. Of tact and self-control she had very little, nor did she wish to have. She was the complete and willing tool of her impulses." 
And the socialist writer Max Eastman, who knew her early and well, confesses that "despite her beautiful and triumphant deeds," her "courage, kindness, wit and true-heartedness," he did not like her. "She had made a cult of impulse and impracticality, rapture and abandon. . . . She had confused caprice with independence, heroics with heroism, mutiny with revolution. . . . How embarrassed I always was by the admirable force of character with which Isadora insisted on being half-baked."
In other words, she demanded total, untrammeled freedom. "I am the spiritual daughter of Walt Whitman," she had declared, and indeed "Song of Myself" could stand as a motto for her entire life. She is an extreme example of the American spirit of self-reliance that believes only in itself and refuses all limits. For Isadora there were no rules, there was only the Song of Herself; she lacked the discipline, the emotional and moral resources, to keep liberty from collapsing into license. 
It was this that Max Eastman grasped and deplored. Yet he could also say, "All who have escaped in any degree from the rigidity and prissiness of our once national religion of negation owe a debt to Isadora Duncan's dancing. She rode the wave of revolt against Puritanism; she rode it, and with her fame and Dionysian raptures drove it on. She was -- perhaps it is simplest to say -- the crest of the wave, an event not only in art but in the history of life." 
Janet Flanner, who wrote while Isadora was still alive, understood it this way: "Great artists are tragic. Genius is too large; and it may have been grandeur that proved Isadora's undoing -- the grandeur of permanent ideals. She is too expansive for personal salvation."

New London Is Bustling After Pfizer Complex Opens

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THREE years ago when Pfizer announced it was going to build a $300 million, 790,000-square-foot research center in New London, it planned to occupy the complex in phases over several years. Instead, the three buildings, which opened last summer, are already filled, and the rest of the city is quickly changing as well.
 New London officials have approved a master development plan for a hotel, conference center, offices and housing that will get under way next year on an 90-acre parcel near Pfizer and have given preliminary approval for up to 220 condominium units on two acres on nearby Bank Street. 
 There are smaller projects around the city as well. Pfizer itself is constructing an 18,000-square-foot day-care center on a 3.1 acre site opposite its new research center, which will eventually accommodate 168 children. It also has a lease agreement with a developer that is planning a $3 million renovation of 42 waterfront apartment units on Pequot Avenue, to be used by employees temporarily assigned to New London or house hunting in the area. 
"There seems to be a general feeling and general uplifting of everything in the area, as a result of what's happening with Pfizer," said Bruce Hyde, director of the city's Office of Development and Planning. "The rest of the country is in a recession, but for the most part it doesn't seem to be affecting this area." 
Barry Weiner, chairman of the New London Redevelopment Authority, said: "It's a resurgence for our city, no question about it. And I don't think the people in New London and the businesses in New London have felt the full impact yet. I think it's going to enhance and improve our city's life and each year that goes by. It's like a new lawn -- it's going to get richer and more beautiful with time." 
But there is also development taking place that has no apparent connection to the pharmaceutical company, like the decision by Inncom, based in Old Lyme, a company founded almost 20 years ago to provide environmental and access control systems for hotel rooms, to construct a new plant and offices on a 4.3-acre parcel near the Adm. Harold E. Shear State Pier.
Julian Enterprises has proposed a 135,000-square-foot office complex at Shaw's Cove, a half mile from the Pfizer complex, but Andrew J. Julian Sr., president of the company, noted that his company's involvement in the city dates to the mid-1990's, with the purchase and renovation of large commercial buildings on Shaw Street and Eugene O'Neill Avenue. "We always felt New London was the place to be" Mr. Julian said." "But Pfizer has certainly had a positive impact on the city."
THE United States Coast Guard has also announced plans to develop its national museum in New London, and the Cross Sound Ferry Company has announced plans to invest $12 million in its terminal just north of City Pier.
Ned Hammond, the city's economic development coordinator, said, "I'm getting a lot more calls from commercial brokers from the Hartford and Stamford areas who have an interest in New London." 
New London was still reeling from the closing of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which once generated about 6,000 direct and indirect jobs in the city, in 1996 when Pfizer announced in 1998 that it would build a huge research complex in New London, as the headquarters of its Pfizer Global Research and Development program.
At the same time, the state announced a $78 million makeover of the entire Fort Trumbull area, adjacent to the Pfizer development. The fort, built to defend the harbor in the Revolutionary War, has been turned into a state historical park, a $19 million waterfront park has opened and roads and other infrastructure have been improved.
The development has not been without controversy. The New London Development Corporation was authorized by the City Council to oversee the development in the area, which required the taking of dozens of small properties. A group of seven property owners have filed suit to challenge the right of the development corporation to use eminent domain for economic development purposes. That court challenge is pending.
The emphasis of economic development planners has been to try to build an entire industry on the base that Pfizer has created. The state has started a 15-week professional-development program to train clinical data managers at the University of Connecticut, for instance. The program coordinator, Armelde Pitre, said that from the first class, which finished this fall, about half of the 13 students had been placed in southeastern Connecticut, including some at contract research organizations that do data analysis for Pfizer and other companies. "Part of our vision is to help build a bioresearch corridor in Connecticut, and to do that you have to supply a skilled work force," Ms. Pitre said.
But others think the amount of work thrown off by Pfizer might be limited. John C. Markowicz, director of the Southeastern Connecticut Enterprise Region, an economic development agency, said his office had done extensive marketing of the area as a biotechnology haven over the last few years.
"The first question everyone asks us is, 'Can you provide us with some contacts at Pfizer?' " Mr. Markowicz said. "There are a few biotechnology start-ups around, but they're not counting their employees in the thousands yet, and a lot of what happens in that sector is going to depend on what Pfizer wants to happen." 
The biggest impact, most expect, will involve not biotechnology companies that spring up around Pfizer but retail and service companies that come in to serve its 2,100 employees in New London. A Pfizer spokeswoman, Liz Power, said that the company supported other development in the city but that aside from the day-care center it was not planning to take an active role in it.
"One of the things attractive about New London is there was an infrastructure already in place, the dry cleaners and coffee shops and restaurants," Ms. Power said. "From the beginning, when we announced that we were moving to New London, we have always said we perceive our role as a catalyst. We hope the development proceeds and it is handled well, but it is in the hands of the city."
There has been considerable activity involving service companies that could benefit from the presence of Pfizer employees. Several new restaurants have opened or expanded on State Street, the main business district. And Mr. Hammond, the economic development coordinator, said there was more interest in the housing market, with projects that range from a two-man team renovating four large apartments in the business district to a plan by Oaktree Development and Design in Boston to construct 220 condominium units on Bank Street.
Gwendolyn G. Noyes, a partner in Oaktree, said that while the project was not tied to Pfizer, "the market conditions in New London have changed considerably since Pfizer made a commitment to be there."
Marty L. Jones, president of Boston-based Corcoran Jennison Company, which has proposed the largest development project in the area, said cooperation involving Pfizer, the state and the city had created the kind of momentum that would make the other projects possible. "It's a classic public-private partnership -- I don't think either side would have jumped in without the other, but together the investment, the commitments made a lot of sense," Ms. Jones said.
Corcoran Jennison will build a 100-room hotel, a conference center and marina in the first phase of a $115 million project. Planning will begin soon for the second phase: 100 units of rental housing in a six-story building on the waterfront and renovation of some offices that were abandoned by the Navy. The final phase will consist of new office construction.
Ms. Jones said Pfizer's speed in filling up its office complex had caught many developers by surprise and was one reason there are not more projects competing with hers.
"I think people are just starting to realize that Pfizer is actually there, not just planning to be there," she said. "Once people start to realize that, you're going to see a lot more interest in New London."

The New Year Is Bringing New Breaks for Taxpayers

BYLINE:  By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
THE passage of tax legislation this year has brought a reduction in most people's tax rates, along with rebate checks, and further breaks will kick in at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.
 "Jan. 1 is the best time of year to start your year-end tax planning," said Laurence I. Foster, a partner in Richard A. Eisner & Company, an accounting firm in New York. Mr. Foster is also chairman of the committee for personal financial specialists for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
 Two big breaks in 2002 will come to those who save for retirement and college. Contribution limits are rising on retirement accounts, and people who are 50 or older next year can also make "catch up" contributions to such accounts. Money withdrawn from state-sponsored education savings plans will be tax-free when used for qualified expenses. 
Here are a few other changes in store for taxpayers in the new year:
* The tax credit for people who adopt children will double to $10,000 a child. Credits reduce taxes dollar for dollar. Thus, a $10,000 credit reduces taxes by $10,000; in contrast, a $10,000 deduction for someone in next year's 30 percent bracket will reduce taxes by only $3,000.
* Employer-provided educational assistance of up to $5,250 a year will be excluded from income, meaning that it will not be taxed. And the coverage has been expanded to include graduate courses. So if you are thinking of going back to school, whether to take a course or two or to get an advanced degree, "talk to your employer -- make it part of the package," Mr. Foster said.
* People can give away more money with no tax consequences. The annual gift exclusion is rising to $11,000 per recipient from $10,000, so that a couple can give $22,000 to each of their grandchildren, for example, without having to file gift-tax forms. Also, the point at which the total of an estate and gifts above the exclusion becomes taxable will rise to $1 million from $675,000. Those who had already reached the limit can give away an additional $325,000. That can be especially important for people who own businesses and who give interests in them to their children, thereby transferring ownership gradually at today's values, instead of leaving everything in a will. 
* Tax rates fall an additional one-half of 1 percentage point for people in the 27.5 percent, 30.5 percent, 35.5 percent and 39.1 percent tax brackets. And everyone gets the benefit of the new 10 percent tax rate. It applies to the first $12,000 in income for married couples filing jointly and the first $6,000 for single filers. Each personal exemption, meanwhile, will be worth $3,000 on 2002 returns, up from $2,900. And the standard per-mile rate for business use of a personal vehicle goes up to 36.5 cents a mile from 34.5 cents.
People still have one day to make gifts for 2001, Mr. Foster noted, and "the check is in the mail" may be good for more than a sardonic laugh. If the charitable gift is postmarked by Dec. 31, or charged to a credit card by that date, you can take a deduction for this year. But for a personal gift, Mr. Foster warned, the I.R.S. looks at the deposit date, so don't just write a check to your grandson. Make sure he deposits it.
Many people plan to make gifts in 2002 by setting up state-sponsored education savings accounts, often called Section 529 plans after the section of the Internal Revenue Code that authorizes them. "Section 529 plans are very hot; our clients are rushing to get them established," said Joseph P. Toce Jr., partner in charge of Andersen's private client services practice in New York.
Many states allow residents a tax break on the money they put into their state's plan. Under federal law, people can "bunch up to five years of gift exclusions into one year" in these plans, Mr. Toce said, meaning that an individual can put in $55,000 in 2002 free of gift taxes, instead of waiting to put in $11,000 a year for five years, and a couple can invest $110,000. What is new for 2002 is that the account's earnings will be free of tax when distributed for qualified education expenses. Previously, the earnings were taxable at the beneficiary's rate, and they could be again after 2010, when the present tax law expires.
But taxes are not the only consideration in these plans. Investment performance is also important, and because most states contract with private companies to administer the programs, performance varies widely. Some accounts have lost money during the market slide of the last two years.
Another variable is how much money can be put into the plans. People can invest in plans outside their own state, so comparison-shopping can pay off. A good place to start is www.savingforcollege.com, maintained by Joseph Hurley, a certified public accountant who rates state plans.
Mr. Toce said Andersen liked several plans: an Alaska plan administered by T. Rowe Price and allowing contributions of up to $250,000; Colorado (Salomon Smith Barney, $235,000); Nebraska (Union Bank and Trust, $250,000); and New Hampshire (Fidelity Investments and until an account balance reaches $233,240). Most plans offer a menu of investment options.
New York provides a state tax credit to residents who invest in its plan, which is administered by TIAA-CREF and has a contribution limit of $100,000. A resident might consider establishing two plans, Mr. Toce said -- a New York plan to take advantage of the credit, and an out-of-state plan to achieve stronger investment results and to allow additional contributions, although the New York contributions might have to be subtracted from the other state's limit.
T. Rowe Price has calculated that annual contributions of $5,000 to such a plan for 18 years would grow to $278,000 if they compound at 10 percent. The earnings, $188,000, would escape taxation when used for qualified education expenses.
Another big opportunity for 2002 lies in tax-deferred retirement savings. Martha Priddy Patterson, national director of employee benefits policy at Deloitte & Touche in Washington, advised making the maximum allowable contributions to 401(k) or 403(b) plans. "It's a great way to save," she said. "It can also be an emergency fund because hardship distributions are allowed, and most plans have loan provisions."
The contribution limit will rise $500 in 2002, to $11,000, and will climb gradually to $15,000 for 2006. But for many people, changes in complex federal rules may mean that the allowable increase next year will be far more than $500. Many employers have limited employee contributions to 10 percent of salary, lest they run afoul of rules that could have caused them to be liable for an excise tax. But employers can now deduct up to 25 percent of payroll for retirement contributions and no longer have to include employee contributions in their deductions. As a result, they can let employees contribute up to the legal limit without adverse consequences.
"Watch what your employer is putting out in terms of plan changes," Ms. Patterson said. "Many may be putting them out during the year, not on Jan. 1."
People who will be over 49 during 2002 can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution, provided that the plan sponsor allows it. Individual Retirement Account limits are to rise to $3,000 from the longstanding $2,000, and $500 catch-up contributions will be allowed to those 50 and older.
AS in the case of the Section 529 plans, an important consideration is how to invest the money, and most plans offer a menu of choices -- stock and bond mutual funds, guaranteed investment contracts and, often, company stock.
David M. Stein, chief investment officer at Parametric Portfolio Associates in Seattle, which specializes in tax-efficient investing, suggested that people who have both a tax-deferred retirement plan and regular taxable accounts be broadly diversified. He recommended putting securities that generate ordinary income, like bonds, into the tax-deferred account because once it is time to withdraw money, it is taxed as ordinary income, even if some of it came from long-term capital gains.
He said people who like to trade actively, incurring short-term capital gains that are taxable as ordinary income, could also use the tax-deferred account for that part of their holdings. 
Mr. Foster of Richard A. Eisner had one warning for taxpayers. "If the economy doesn't improve, a lot of the tax breaks may be truncated," he said. When the 2001 tax law was passed, budget surpluses were predicted, he said, but given the recession and the cost of war in Afghanistan, the nation is now looking at deficits.
Ms. Patterson agreed, advising people to take tax breaks "while the getting is good."

HEADLINE: Closing the Trunk Lid On a Topsy-Turvy 2001 

BYLINE:  By JAMES G. COBB

 BODY:
THINK back to 1998. Chrysler was the hottest company around, with fresh products, a can-do attitude and an $8 billion hoard of cash.
 Two years later, Ford was on top of the auto world. It had plunged into the dot-com economy, built a stable of European luxury brands and seemed poised to dislodge General Motors as the largest carmaker. 
 Meanwhile, G.M. meandered, churning out rental-quality cars that enthusiasts loathed, bouncing from one reorganization to another, steadily losing market share and handing immense power to marketing gurus with scant automotive knowledge. 
Now, Chrysler is run by Germans and paddling in red ink, desperately trying to pawn parts of itself. Ford is closing one of its worst years, which included more of the Explorer-Firestone fiasco, its chief executive's departure, embarrassing recalls, bungled introductions and poor quality ratings.
Suddenly G.M., the industry's plodding mastodon, seems to have momentum. A perilous detour into Procter & Gamble-style brand management -- which coincided with a further drop in market share -- is ending. Interest-free financing bolstered G.M. sales and hurt weaker rivals. Detroit's favorite car wizard, Robert A. Lutz, is waving his wand in G.M.'s design studios.
And there were plenty of other upside-down events -- and vehicles deserving special notice -- in the year just past:

Ask the Talib Who Owns One
The truck of the year, at least in Central Asia, is surely the Toyota Hilux. The compact pickups (not sold in North America) have been everywhere in the war in Afghanistan, driven by Taliban friend and foe. (Leaders of Al Qaeda preferred Land Cruisers.) Putting the best face on a double-edged endorsement, Wade Hoyt, a Toyota spokesman, said, "It shows that the Taliban are looking for the same qualities as any truck buyer: durability and reliability."

Tread Lightly?
The Jeep Liberty has the right name for these patriotic times, but at least a few New Yorkers have squirmed at a commercial showing one climbing the Statue of Liberty. Aside from calling attention to a feat that no Jeep would dare attempt (at a time when two magazines have found the Liberty may be overly tippy in certain circumstances), is this a good time to send vehicles crawling over -- even with digital enhancements -- cherished national monuments?

Deals and Steals
Competition is intense, the economic outlook is murky and recent financing deals may have inflated 2001 sales at the expense of 2002. And because it costs so much for the Big Three to shut down plants -- the pension costs are enormous -- they pretty much have to keep cranking out cars and trucks, then offer generous deals to get them off dealer lots. It is a tough time to be a car company, but a good time to be a customer. 

The Best Get Better
I'd never buy a Toyota Camry, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. The '02 is seamless, and it helps to explain why Toyota is Detroit's worst nightmare (and why the Camry is the sort of Everycar that the Chevy Impala once was). Toyota could have dislodged Chrysler from the Big Three already, had it tried, and it soon will. Plus, its customers are loyal, and they progressively move up to more profitable cars.

Assault on Truckville
Trucks will outsell cars this year, but that is small comfort for the Big Three, whose last stronghold -- big pickups and S.U.V.'s -- is under assault from the Japanese, led by Toyota. Nissan, back from the brink of collapse, is newly energized. The Europeans, plus Lexus, have walked away with the luxury market. And not a single Big Three vehicle made Consumer Reports' "top picks" list for 2001.

New in the Neighborhood
As if things weren't grim enough, the Koreans are demanding to be taken seriously, with more than 600,000 American sales this year. And these are no longer marginal econoboxes. Kia is selling a bargain minivan, the Sedona, and its corporate cousin, Hyundai, has a convincing facsimile of a midsize luxury car, the XG 350. Aside from the styling -- call it Nouveau Soviet Apparatchik -- the XG is a nice piece of work.

Shiftless Wonder
Continuously variable "gearless" transmissions -- with ever-changing ratios set by moving belts -- have existed for a while, but Audi is the first company to put one in a powerful sedan. The Audi A4's multitronic is eerily efficient, with no pauses, lurches or noticeable gear changes.

Park That Big Thing
G.M. has made it a little easier to handle a mammoth truck: its GMC Sierra Denali comes with Quadra-
steer, a four-wheel-steering system that gives the big pickup the same turning radius as a small Saturn.

Bright Lights, Big City
Acura owners in New York reported a rash of thefts of high-intensity headlamps, often with costly fender damage. Young customizers put the blue-white beams on their hot rods.

Improved, With an Asterisk
Some new vehicles are undeniably better than their predecessors. But they can be better without being great. Here are some cases in point:

Ford Explorer: It is smoother, roomier and presumably safer, but it still feels like an ungainly truck.

Dodge Ram: The best-looking, least-polished big truck has received a polishing, and it now feels competitive with Ford's dated F-150. But old powertrains separate the Ram from the leaders, from Toyota and G.M.

Honda CR-V: Unlike other Hondas, the old CR-V felt tinny and cheap, and it committed a cardinal cute-ute sin: it wasn't much fun. The '02 is much improved, but it it still doesn't come with a laugh track.

Infiniti Q45: This big sedan is striking and fast, but it is saddled with irritating computer-screen controls and is short on luxury car refinement, with a noisy cabin and luggage-crushing trunk hinges.

Jeep Liberty: I like a lot about the Cherokee's replacement, especially its classy cabin and off-road prowess. But on pavement -- as opposed to trails -- it doesn't measure up to the car-based Ford Escape.

Declasse Luxury
"Entry level" has taken on new meaning since I heard a British executive refer to a future $140,000 model as an "entry-level Bentley," but there's no question that "entry luxury" cars make up the hottest part of the market. Jaguar has plunged in with its X-Type, a pleasant sedan with every big-cat styling cue the designers could toss at it. But while the X-Type seems nice enough, especially given its European Ford bones, it lacks the peculiar feline grace that makes a Jag a Jag.
Mercedes moved further downscale with its $26,000 C230 Sports Coupe. Unfortunately, that hatchback has an unexceptional engine, an oddly rounded rear end and a general lack of joie de vivre. The Acura RSX is more fun, for less money.

Topless Contrarian
I'm in the minority here, but the year's two hot convertibles left me cold. I couldn't get past the bulbous, love-it-or-hate-it look of the Lexus SC 430, which otherwise felt like the nicest Buick I'd ever driven. And by the time a local dealer got his supply of a dozen Ford Thunderbirds, they sat on his lot covered with snow. Two years of previews and production delays made the T-Bird seem like old news. Though the car looks great with its top down, its rough-road shake, soggy ride and Lincoln-issue dashboard kept reminding me that it isn't as special as it pretends to be.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
A Roster Of Awards Better Off Unawarded

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
MEASURED by its stock market action alone, 2001 was clearly a disappointment. But judge the year instead by the audacity of its corporate schemers, Washington scalawags and Wall Street rogues, and 2001 becomes tough to top. 
 Although most investors probably prefer to look forward and not back, the end of the year is always a splendid time to review with fondness the players and the moves that dominated the business stage. So it is time again to announce the Augustus Melmotte Memorial Prizes, named for the stock manipulator and arriviste at the heart of "The Way We Live Now" by Anthony Trollope. Mr. Melmotte, a man of uncertain fortune and lineage who nevertheless rose to the top of London society in the late 1880's, met his downfall when he was caught selling shares to investors in a railroad company that existed only in his imagination. 
 Come to think of it, didn't Enron, the year's grandest corporate disgrace, ultimately exist more in the imagination of investors than in reality? Yes, but even Mr. Trollope, a master of the fictional fantastic, could not have dreamed up the Enron story. 
Although the wealth-wrecking crew at Enron could walk away with every one of the Melmotte prizes this year, there were others whose actions should be noted and appreciated. 
Here are the prizes and their winners.

THE WHAT I DON'T KNOW CAN HURT YOU AWARD -- To Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of Enron, who presided over the loss of $61 billion in investor wealth in 2001 and one of the quickest corporate collapses ever. Claiming to be a somewhat bewildered bystander, Mr. Lay told a reporter, "You're getting way over my head," when asked about transactions Enron made with mysterious partnerships set up by company insiders. Mr. Lay seemed happy to let his underlings act without interference, a management style that hereafter may be known as Laysez-faire.

THE I ALSO HAVE A BRIDGE TO SELL YOU AWARD -- To Jeffrey K. Skilling, the architect of Enron's rise to stock market stardom but a man who takes no responsibility for its spectacular fall. Mr. Skilling, Enron's chief executive for a six-month period that ended in August, has said he knew nothing about the off-balance-sheet partnerships set up by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, which benefited Mr. Fastow but helped bring down the company. Mr. Skilling said he left his Enron post for personal reasons he declined to specify. Mr. Lay was more forthcoming; he said the reasons were "things with fairly short time fuses on them." Hmm.

THE HEADS I WIN, TAILS YOU LOSE AWARD -- To Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer at Enron, who pocketed more than $30 million from the behind-the-scenes partnerships he set up as vehicles for the company's trading businesses. While the partnerships enriched Mr. Fastow, they made paupers of Enron shareholders, who were ultimately on the hook for some of the partnerships' obligations.

A TURNAROUND IS MORE THAN TALK AWARD -- To Gary C. Wendt, who since arriving at Conseco as chief executive 18 months ago has told investors repeatedly that the company's revival is just around the corner. Most of his forecasts, made in folksy memoranda in which he attacked company doubters, have not transpired. Shares of Conseco, which rose 17 percent when he was hired to save the company, have lost almost 70 percent of their value this year.

THE ONLY THE LITTLE PEOPLE PAY TAXES AWARD -- To Republican lawmakers who actually voted to repeal a tax intended to ensure that wealthy corporations pay something in income tax. Never mind that -- thanks to the tax treatment on stock options -- some of the nation's largest and richest companies paid little or no taxes in recent years. Icing on this particular cake was billions of dollars in rebates to companies like I.B.M. and General Electric. Thankfully, this dumb idea died, a victim of partisan bickering.

THE OFTEN WRONG BUT NEVER IN DOUBT AWARD -- To Ron Barone, the research analyst at UBS Warburg who covered Enron, or perhaps more accurately, who through it all was one of Enron's loudest apologists. On Aug. 17, after analysts met with Mr. Lay, the Enron chief, Mr. Barone told Bloomberg News: "Ken met with us to reassure us that there is nothing wrong with the company. There is no other shoe to fall and no charges to be taken." Less than three months later, one of the biggest shoes in corporate history descended when Enron announced that it would restate earnings for the previous four years, eliminating $600 million. A believer until the bitter end, Mr. Barone waited until Nov. 28, when Enron's shares had more value as wallpaper than as stock, to replace his "strong buy" label on the stock with a "hold."

THE IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED AWARD -- To Henry Blodget, who will abandon his post as chief Internet analyst at Merrill Lynch tomorrow, after all but 2 of the 18 stocks he followed collapsed in a heap. A certifiable bull-market genius, Mr. Blodget learned how unfun bear markets can be -- and that worshipful investors who hang on an analyst's every word are far preferable to the tediously litigious sort who sued him and Merrill in July.

THE BALANCE SHEET DOES MATTER AWARD -- To Jack Grubman, the telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney who has lost investors so much money that he could give new meaning to the term "Neutron Jack." His breathless buoyancy on the sector drove investors into dicey telecom stocks. Now that many of his former darlings have dropped dead, victims of too much debt that his firm helped to pile on, he has taken a new approach. He now has a "neutral" rating on 16 of the 26 stocks he follows. But those who followed his advice are probably anything but neutral on him.

THE SELLER BEWARE AWARD -- To Henry Silverman, the chairman of Cendant, who finds his company once again pained by an accounting mess of someone else's creation. This time, the accounting irregularities showed up at Homestore.com, a real estate Internet site whose largest shareholder is Cendant and on whose board a Cendant representative serves. The affiliation began last February, when Cendant sold its Internet subsidiary, Move.com, to Homestore, producing a $525 million gain. Now, Homestore shares have stopped trading until the depth of the accounting faux pas is known. Of course, the impact of Homestore's woes on Cendant will be nothing like the nightmare that grew out of the company's purchase of CUC International in 1997. That deal resulted in the restatement of three years of earnings by Cendant -- which had to deduct a total of $640 million that prosecutors said was created out of thin air at CUC.

THE STYLE IS NICE BUT SUBSTANCE RULES AWARD -- To Carleton S. Fiorina, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, who can spin with the best, but whose delivery of the goods, a k a earnings, has been lacking. Even though she's one of the best C.E.O. cheerleaders out there, if she fails to complete her planned merger with Compaq Computer, she may go to the showers a loser.

HEADLINE: The World; 
A Business Plan For Islam Inc.

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TWO weeks after Osama bin Laden's operatives staged the Sept. 11 attacks, the Senate passed a bill approving a free trade agreement with Jordan, the first of its kind with an Arab nation.
 Every American knows about the terrorism. Few have heard of the trade deal. But some experts see in these events two possible futures for the Islamic world, and a role for the West in determining which one is realized. That role is to help Islamic countries create material hope for their people. 
 To many Westerners, Islamic nations often seem out of touch with, and hostile to, modernity. One billion Muslims from Algeria to Indonesia live in poverty. Corruption and illiteracy are endemic. Religious radicalism is on the rise. But in the economic realm at least, Islam presents a more diverse, and possibly more hopeful, picture. 
Today, Malaysia and Turkey stand as Muslim success stories at the geographical poles of the Islamic world. Both have weathered the financial crises that afflicted emerging market economies in recent years, and now have mostly open economies, diversified exports and a high degree of integration with neighbors.
Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have also become substantially more open in recent years, while Tunisia has led a reform drive in North Africa (it now has a women's day to promote equality in the work force). Indonesia and Malaysia today have more in common with East Asia than the Middle East. Egypt recently passed laws giving women some economic rights they never had before. Even Syria and Iran are to varying degrees seeking to simplify regulations, to expand trade and to attract foreign investment.
These are potentially optimistic developments for the United States and its allies, as they try to counter the appeal of Islamic radicals. That is because many development experts say that helping countries to manage their economies better is as important to challenging the terrorist vision as educational and political reform.
"We need to resist the idea that the Islamic world is somehow culturally incapable of development." said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a development expert at Harvard University. "There's a tremendous opportunity to bring globalization to places that have not seen much of it."
WHICH is not to say that all the economic news is encouraging. Far from it. The wealthiest Islamic countries, led by Saudi Arabia, are dependent on revenue from a single export, oil, much of which has been squandered. Other countries, like Sudan, appear to be moving backward, with hard-line fundamentalists exerting more control over all aspects of life.
Pakistan has long flirted with Western-style economic programs, but corruption and demands for religious orthodoxy have kept the economy in shackles. And Egypt has never shed the legacy of Gamel Abdel Nasser, who embraced national socialism and a state-controlled economy after the country emerged from colonial rule. 
Even Indonesia, the largest Muslim nation, has stumbled badly after a quarter century of rapid growth, and is struggling to contain rising fundamentalist and separatist movements. 
But while the problems are widespread, most experts contend that they are not somehow religiously preordained. Yes, Islam bans earning interest on loans. But, then, the Roman Catholic church had its usury laws. In fact, Islamic society was once at the forefront of economic life. In medieval times, it had more vibrant urban economies and a higher standard of living than Christian Europe. Muslims were the first to have a paper economy (a millennium ago, a check written in Baghdad could be cashed in Fez). 
Mr. Sachs suggests that to spur economic development, the United States and Europe should help more students from Muslim nations gain the technocratic skills their countries need by studying in the West. They were underrepresented in leading universities even before Sept. 11, and since then many returned home to avoid a police dragnet in the wake of the attacks. 
Afghan reconstruction presents another opportunity, Mr. Sachs said. Rather than focusing solely on restoring agricultural production and rebuilding roads, he said, the West should present a broad plan for easing the isolation of all of Central Asia, improving transportation, communications and increasing trade along the ancient Silk Road. 
STRENGTHENING the economies of Islamic countries will sometimes be politically difficult. For example, some economic experts have also pressed the United States to grant Pakistan a higher quota for textiles, its main export, despite opposition from the domestic textile lobby in Washington. And some Iran experts want to encourage the reform movement in that country by relaxing the sanctions imposed on it in the wake of the Iranian revolution. For its part, Turkey would like to be admitted to the European Union on an expedited schedule, despite problems with its human rights record. 
"The West in general and Europe in particular has made a major mistake over the past 15 years in sending signals that Islamic countries are not really part of their world," said Timur Kuran of the University of Southern California, who studies Muslim economies. "The West has to do more to encourage those people -- really the majority in many countries -- who want to integrate, not turn their backs.
"There may be a tendency after Sept. 11 to think of the Islamic world as monolithic," he added. "If we do, unfortunately, it will be the Malaysias, the Turkeys and the Tunisias that suffer the most."

HEADLINE: A Music Tradition That Plays On in the Key of D, for Diversity 

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: PURCHASE 

 BODY:
NO one remembers exactly how Music America began 10 years ago. 
 According to Elaine Palmer of Pepsico, who was there at the beginning, Pepsico wanted to sponsor a new community event at Purchase College after the demise of Summerfare, a critically praised arts festival that outgrew the campus. Jacqueline Millan, also of Pepsico, recalled that the company approached the Westchester Philharmonic (then called the New Orchestra of Westchester) about a concert that would celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King. 
 Paul Lustig Dunkel, music director and conductor of the orchestra, thinks it was his wife, Barbara, who proposed that the concert benefit nonprofit human service organizations devoted to Dr. King's goals of nonviolence and racial harmony. 
That idea stuck, and since 1992 groups like the Westchester Council on Crime and Delinquency, the Westchester Martin Luther King Jr. Institute for Non-Violence, the Union Child Day Care Center and the Westchester Holocaust Commission have joined together for a commemorative concert presented by the Westchester Philharmonic each January. Music America has become a cherished county cultural institution, in which nonprofit groups work side by side to raise money. 
"People are always calling us and asking when Music America will be," said Blanche Walker, executive director of College Careers Fund of Westchester in White Plains, which helps minority youth attend college. "It highlights racial interaction and nonviolence in a special, uplifting way."
This year's concert, to be held on Jan. 19 at 7:30 p.m. at the Performing Arts Center of Purchase College, will focus on jazz. The program, "Satchmo, Bird and the Duke: 3 Jazz Legends," which was planned by Mr. Dunkel, departs from the mix of classical music and spirituals presented at Music America in past years. The evening will feature the trumpet player Freddie Hendrix, the saxophonist Charles McPherson and the pianist Roland Hanna, 
Groups must apply to take part. Then each group (there are 15 this year) is obliged to sell a minimum of 60 concert tickets. Groups receive the tax-deductible portion of all $85 benefactor tickets and $70 patron tickets that they sell; proceeds from sales of tickets that are not designated for anyone are divided evenly among the groups. Benefactors and patrons are listed in the program book and also may attend a pre-concert reception at the Performing Arts Center. Other tickets are priced at $30 and $20. A dress rehearsal on Jan. 19 at 10 a.m. at the Performing Arts Center will be presented free, although a $5 donation is requested.
In recent years, Music America performances in the 1,300-seat Concert Hall have been sold out. Money, however, is not the main reason that some groups have been involved for 10 years. The concert "symbolizes the diversity of Westchester coming together in a community event," said Winston A. Ross, executive director of the Westchester Community Opportunity Program, a social service agency based in Elmsford. "The board feels good about being involved because of the program's goals."
Last year the undesignated share of the proceeds received by each of 14 groups was $230; in 2000, 15 groups each received $255 from the common pot. The total amount raised by most organizations is often under $1,000 (although last year the Mount Vernon Fire House Hip/Hop Museum made more than $5,000). Participants say raising prices to increase the pot would exclude many of the people Music America aims to attract.
"We fund-raise in other areas, so for us it's about anything but money," said Sylvia Bloom, director of communications for the Center for Preventive Psychiatry in White Plains. "This event represents diversity at its best. Never do you go to any event in Westchester at which you see such total racial and religious integration."
Ms. Bloom thinks the event should be a model for other cities, and has suggested that the Westchester Philharmonic invite orchestra leaders nationwide to the concert. 
Elaine Carroll, the new executive director of the Philharmonic, said she recently mailed invitations to selected orchestras in large metropolitan areas.
"There was no response, but it's a seed," Ms. Carroll said. "We'll send them the program afterward and tell them in plenty of time when next year's program will be."
Only once since 1992 was there no Music America. That was in 1994, when Pepsico, which had sponsored the event from the start, bowed out. 
"It was becoming a Pepsico event," said Ms. Palmer, manager of corporate information for the company. "It was very successful, but it was not achieving the goal of getting nonprofit organizations to work on their own with various corporations and the arts."
The event was missed so much that "it came back by public acclaim," Ms. Palmer said. 
Pepsico returned, and has been joined in major sponsorship by J.P. Morgan Chase & Company and the Abraham Fund/Alan B. Slifka Foundation. A breakfast is held at Pepsico's headquarters each fall where representatives of each group gather for a preview of the coming concert. At this and two other yearly meetings bonds have formed among the participants, but most say that the diversity of Music America has not spilled over to other cultural events in Westchester.
Ms. Walker said it was hard to talk about "lasting relationships" among the organizations when many nonprofit groups are struggling to raise money in a post-Sept. 11 economy.
Other sponsors this year are Consolidated Edison, Diversified Investment Advisors, Heineken USA, Verizon and First Union National Bank.
Besides the music of Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington, the concert will include a piece composed by Mr. Dunkel, who has conducted Music America each year. The work sets words by Dr. King to music, and will be narrated by an interfaith group of clergy.
For more information or tickets, the number is (914) 682-3707 ext. 10.

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED: 3,225 (AT LAST COUNT), D. SEPT. 11, 2001; 
Order of Magnitude

BYLINE:  By Margaret Talbot 

 BODY:
It took awhile to unlearn the number 6,000. Though the estimated death toll at the World Trade Center has been falling steadily since early October -- and has by now shrunk by half -- the smaller number proved hard to absorb. As late as Thanksgiving, the larger figure was still being cited by disc jockeys and pundits, by Northern Alliance fighters and admirers of Osama bin Laden. Maybe even now it remains embedded in the minds of Americans who have been paying less avid attention to the news than they did in September. And of those fully aware of the revised number, many seemed reluctant to adopt it. When lower death estimates were first reported, few Americans were in the mood for revisionism, even of the most benign and understandable sort. Nobody wanted to insert the word "only" in front of a new tally of the dead. Body counts often become a proxy measure of a tragic event's significance; as the historian Karel Bartosek has written, they are "a mathematical truth" that "transforms mass deaths into a kind of sacrament." Viewed in this light, insisting on precise new estimates can seem morally obtuse, beside the point. Lowering the body count can -- perversely, irrationally -- feel like a sad thing, as if it were an exercise in diminishing the weight of Sept. 11. 
 Although it soon became clear that 288 people died at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania, the World Trade Center body count was an unfolding narrative, a series of jagged highs followed by a staggered decline. In the first weeks following the attacks, wild numbers flew around like scraps of paper in a whirlwind. Almost all of the early predictions turned out to be overestimates, but in context they made sense. Eleven thousand body bags were ordered by the city on Sept. 12. Ten thousand people were feared dead in the first week. Seven thousand the next. Two or three hundred Britons alone had been killed, Tony Blair incorrectly predicted. On Sept. 21, after foreign consulates reported their missing citizens, the estimated death toll provided by the city stood at more than 6,300. By October, it had fallen to 4,500; by Nov. 21, to 3,948; by Dec. 20, to 3,011. At least one source, USA Today, has lowered the number further, to 2,800, which includes, as all the figures do, rescue workers and passengers on the hijacked jets. 
 The truth is nobody had ever made a calculation like this one, and coming up with an accurate total turned out to be devilishly hard. The initial estimates of casualties were reasonable mistakes based on known facts and brute realities. Although it was reported that 50,000 people worked in the towers at the height of the day, the World Trade Center was a vast public space; who knew exactly how many people might have been walking through the area when the planes hit? Making matters worse, investigators had no solid records, like a list of visitors cleared by security. There were other complications: so few bodies could be recovered relative to the number dead (only 550 had been identified as of Dec. 21); medical examiners would have to contend with tens of thousands of individual tissue samples; it took time to cull the multiple reports of the same missing persons and the misspellings of names from disparate lists. The events of that day were such a literal and grotesque embodiment of worst fears that worst estimates seemed entirely plausible. Indeed, to look at ground zero is to be shocked that so many people -- more than 12,000, it is now believed -- did make it out. Those who did were beneficiaries of their locations in the buildings -- above the 92nd floor of the north tower, no one survived -- of improved evacuation plans following the 1993 bombing and, most heartbreakingly, of the rescue workers who rushed in and who, we now realize, made up almost 15 percent of the dead. 
Behind the falling numbers there are other stories, though, that are disorienting because they have nothing to do with the larger story. They are not about terrorism and they are not tragedies; they open a door onto other destinies, smaller sorrows and, sometimes, tawdriness. There were, for example, people who lied -- not many, but a handful that we know of, who faked their way onto lists of the bereaved. Several, like 42-year-old Alan Braker of Orange, N.J., who has been charged with filing a false report, told stories about nonexistent, missing children. Indeed, a popular trope among the fakers -- or "sickos," as The New York Post succinctly described them -- was of parents and children separated, then reunited, then torn apart again by the cataclysm of Sept. 11. Braker's made-up daughter, Mya, was a 6-year-old supposedly visiting his former wife, who worked on the 107th floor of the World Trade Center. Waldo Fernandez conjured a grown son he'd just been in contact with for the first time and was about to go meet. Maybe they figured lost children garnered the most sympathy, and children parted from their parents in regret-ridden, postdivorce lives are a common enough story of our time, after all.
Speculation and rumors further muddied the conjectures about how many people died on Sept. 11. Think of the story popular in parts of the Islamic world, for example, that 4,000 Jews supposedly fled the towers ahead of time -- evidence" of Israeli involvement in the attacks. (Conspiracy theorists are like metaphysical statisticians, forever citing specific, random numbers.) And the myth of the World Trade Center Orphans -- as many as 15,000 of them, according to some estimates -- persisted for weeks, despite evidence that the city had not turned up a single case of a child who lost both parents in the attacks. Good-hearted souls from around the world volunteered to adopt one or more. It was as if the thwarted impulse to help innocent victims kept roaming around looking for a place to alight. Surely it was bad enough that many children did lose one parent, but that sort of loss seemed to leave fewer options for outsiders to set things right. As long as there were thousands of orphans to rescue, there was something to be done; that comforting thought alone held the myth aloft for a time.
Some real people reported missing by well-intentioned friends and acquaintances were never missing at all, just out of electronic communication in an era and at a moment when that alone could seem troubling. A 30-year-old New Yorker named Matt Heard, whose picture turned up on flyers after a casual friend said she thought he'd worked at the World Trade Center, did not work there and in any case was on vacation in France on Sept. 11, unaware of the anxiety about him at home. A woman who heads the New Jersey office that helps relatives of those missing after Sept. 11 was mistakenly reported missing herself. In the first few days, e-mail that went unanswered even for a few hours produced panic. The availability of instant communication allowed many people to obtain reassurance about their friends and relatives, but also meant that some of those who couldn't make contact jumped to dire conclusions. If you knew anyone in New York, you called them, and if you couldn't get through, you worried, even against your better judgment or your knowledge that they worked nowhere near the towers. So deep did Sept. 11 hit that it felt peculiar not to know someone directly affected.
All of these tendencies were compounded when it came to immigrants, whose relatives at home may have had only the filmiest notion of what their lives in America were like. One major reason that the initial estimates were so high is that other nations produced inflated reports of their missing citizens, based on frantic calls from relatives abroad. Indeed, the highest possible death toll cited came after these overseas reports were first tallied. The numbers for virtually all of these countries fell sharply, but in some cases, it took weeks for consular staff to follow up on all the leads and know for sure. The Mexican consulate, which initially received 1,000 calls or e-mail messages reporting people who might have been missing, has since winnowed the list down to 17. Britain now says 77. Newspapers in Colombia reported that 300 Colombians were missing after Sept. 11, but staff members at the consulate in New York tracked down all but 20 of them, many living far from New York City. Consular staff members think 10 more might be dead, but no more than 30 total. 
"A lot of people called who had never been in the United States," says Diana Garcia, the Colombian consul for legal affairs. "They know somebody who lives in the States, they haven't heard from them in a while, they're scared about them, but they don't know the geography, they don't know what life is like here, that upstate New York is not the city of New York or that Florida is nowhere near." The consulate of Turkey got 475 reports of people missing after the attacks, though only 50 Turks worked at the World Trade Center and only 1 is still missing. 
To their families at home, maybe there is always a sense in which immigrants are missing -- missed, long gone, leading novel lives the families can't quite imagine. The list of "disappeared people" reported to the Asociacion Tepayac, an advocacy group for Mexican immigrants in New York, is full of question marks, partial information, blanks. Eloisa Cruz Cabrera, 22, is listed as "a domestic worker. They don't know where." Felix Toto Cobaxin, 44, is said to "work in a restaurant, name unknown." Someone from Hidalgo simply "works in New York." Meanwhile, the fates of some undocumented immigrants who actually did work in the trade center or as delivery people servicing it may never be known because their employers won't come forward to prove their existence, says Brother Joel Magallan of the Asociacion Tepayac, and maybe family members won't either, despite the I.N.S.'s promise not to prosecute in such cases.
"The largest group of World Trade Center victims we'll probably never know the fate of are the undocumented workers," says Steven Stehr, a professor at Washington State University who studies disaster-relief efforts.
There are people who see the falling count less mercifully. These people argue that the higher numbers were useful for the war effort, and that that is why they stood uncorrected for weeks, and why everyone from Colin Powell to Don Imus kept citing them. Stephen Glover, writing in the British magazine The Spectator, refers to "a brutal calculus: the greater the number of victims, the easier it is to justify military action." Sometimes, of course, death tolls from disaster and war are overestimated (or underestimated) on purpose. During the Vietnam War, inflated estimates of Vietnamese killed became a substitute measure of American success in a campaign whose substantive objectives were proving elusive. For many years after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, city officials, anxious not to scare off tourists and investors, insisted on a figure of 674 killed or missing, almost certainly a gross underestimate. (Recalculations in the 1960's put the number at 3,000; some historians think the number is yet higher.) Before federal-disaster relief, there was little economic incentive to provide accurate numbers and considerable incentive to lower them. Besides, as the historian Ted Steinberg points out in "Acts of God: The Unnatural History of Natural Disaster in America," until the mid-20th century, few officials bothered to count some populations struck by calamity -- blacks in South Carolina hit by hurricanes, the residents of Chinatown in San Francisco. In those cases, the historical record had to be rescued from chroniclers with an interest in distorting it.
Sometimes, though, it's no one's agenda, but the nature of the event itself -- the scale of it, the lack of precedent, the details of destruction -- that makes calculating the precise death toll so hard and makes a larger number seem, for a time anyway, to make more sense. The truth is there are plenty of complicated, real-life exigencies that explain why the World Trade Center numbers fell and why a precise final figure may be a chimera. And in any case, an event's singularity, or its horror, is not measured only in numbers, nor should it be. For a while, journalists casting about for a context and a comparison kept citing Pearl Harbor or Civil War battles. At some point in later November, it was duly noted that Sept. 11 was no longer, in fact, the bloodiest day in American history. That distinction went to Sept. 17, 1862, when 3,654 soldiers died in the battle of Antietam. I suppose it was worth pointing out, but I'm not sure it struck many people as particularly salient. The attack on the World Trade Center killed American civilians, outside of wartime, and it killed them on TV, making most of the rest of us unwilling witnesses to a mass murder, and that places it in a context of its own. We watched the towers burn and collapse, in real time. And we watched the bodies drop from the sky -- a sight that most of us will never be able to forget.
In the end, the surprising thing about the lowered death toll is how little it alters our sense of Sept. 11. I don't mean that the task of getting it right should be abandoned, even if the likely presence of homeless people, undocumented workers and others means that total certainty is impossible. A careful count matters -- to families, in the allocation of funds, in what historians record. But whether the number is 6,000 or 3,000 does nothing to shrink the magnitude of the attacks in our minds or, for most of us, the justification for war.
"The count would have had to fall quite a lot more -- into the low hundreds, probably -- before we could have concluded that the terrorist attack wasn't magnitudes greater than anything we've experienced or ever could have expected," as James Burk, a sociologist of war at Texas A&M University says. "We do regard civilian deaths as a moral matter and almost beyond any kind of market calculus. How much money can we send to the victims? The thinking seems to be no amount is too much. How many people were killed? A bunch. The moral issue is overriding." 
Indeed, maybe the number that comes closest to right is the number Mayor Giuliani evoked on that first day, when reporters pressed him about what the death count might turn out to be -- more, ultimately, than any of us can bear."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Looking Into a Crystal Ball, Or Else a Rear-View Mirror

BYLINE:  By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE 

 BODY:
There's an old New Jersey saying, or ought to be: to see ahead, look back. No, not just that the traffic will get worse next year or that property taxes will go up or that public employee pension deals will get sweeter. But in politics, things to come are usually connected to, if not explained by, things past.
 So let's look back to see ahead. The big political story next year will be Senator Robert G. Torricelli's race for re-election, and the possibility that the Republicans borrow a page from the Democrats and shop around for a man rich enough to pay his own campaign bills. After all, Mr. Torricelli did that when he helped recruit Jon Corzine, the Wall Street millionaire, to run last year for Frank Lautenberg's former seat. 
 Mr. Corzine went on to spend more than $60 million to win, and the deep pockets who are getting bored sitting around their corner offices up and down the state these days must be asking themselves, "If a cuddly guy like Jon Corzine can write a check to move from the executive suite to the United States Senate without bothering with lesser offices, why can't a hard-grabber like me do it too?"
Lewis Eisenberg, the former chairman of the Port Authority and a very wealthy man, is probably the leading name being dropped by Republican Party leaders who are hopeful that he will take on Mr. Torricelli. Mr. Eisenberg is well known in the party and would be a powerful fund-raiser -- in the event he is willing to give it all up for a chance to jump into the pit with one of the Senate's canniest campaigners.
Two newcomers have also put their toes in the ring. Douglas Forrester of West Windsor, who runs a medical services business, and Kenneth Pasternak, the former head of a large Jersey City brokerage, have expressed interest in the race. In the unlikely event that all three got into a primary campaign spending spree against each other, the most likely beneficiary would be the guy without any money and who did bother with those lesser offices. Jim Treffinger, the Essex County executive, who ran last year and lost in the primary to Bob Franks, is popular and well known.
Mr. Treffinger has something that money can't buy, which is experience on the campaign trail. It is a commodity that wealthy first-time candidates particularly need, since they tend to be people who are used to being respected and obeyed, and correspondingly not used to having to beg and smile.
Mr. Corzine evidently knew this: he resigned as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs in March 1999 -- 15 months before the primary -- and immediately started putting out feelers and getting himself known. And what got lost in all the talk about Mr. Corzine's money was the fact that he turned out to be a very effective campaigner -- at ease, fluent and friendly. The latest crop of wealthy would-bes are getting a late start in learning those qualties.
The most interesting race from New Jersey for the House of Representatives will be the one to fill the Fifth District seat that Representative Marge Roukema is vacating next year after 22 years in office next year. If the seat stays Republican, Assemblyman E. Scott Garrett figures to be rewarded for the dogged primary challenges he has brought against Ms. Roukema in the 1998 and 2000 primaries. Earlier this month, Mr. Garrett won the endorsements of a long list of Republicans as a warning against other challengers. And given that he came within 2,000 votes of defeating Ms. Roukema in last year's primary, he should be a lock to win the nomination at least.
But Mr. Garrett is an unvarnished conservative from rural Sussex County, and most of the Fifth District voters in Bergen County -- just the kind of well-off, well-educated older suburb that, in New Jersey and elsewhere in the Northeast, has been leaning toward the Democrats lately. 
In November's gubernatorial race, James E. McGreevey outpolled another conservative, Bret D. Schundler, by 11 percentage points in Bergen, so both state and national Democratic parties are certain to make the Fifth a major battleground.
Another place to look backward for clues to the future is legislative, not electoral: will the new Governor McGreevey have to resort to raising taxes to fill the huge gap between recession-depressed revenues and the state budget?
There are plenty of liberal Democrats in the Legislature -- Democrats Mr. McGreevey needs to keep control of an ideologically unbalanced Legislature -- who would like to see another Florioesque grand gesture: new taxes to plug the deficit and pay for the many social programs, from child health care to education to social services, that they believe were neglected during eight years of Republican governors.
But Mr. McGreevey didn't get where he is by repeating the mistakes of others. He knows that Jim Florio's tax increase upon taking office a decade ago threw the Democrats into outer darkness for the rest of the 90's, so he will look somewhere else for the money? Where?
Well, millions from the tobacco settlement are headed toward Trenton each year, Stephen Salmore, a Republican campaign consultant, noted.
"McGreevey has said he won't do it," Mr. Salmore said, "but I bet the Legislature wouldn't mind."

HEADLINE: What New Yorkers Want From Their Next Mayor 

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg becomes mayor on Tuesday at one of the most difficult moments in New York's history. He must also follow an incumbent who has become a national hero. Mr. Bloomberg says he is optimistic and enthusiastic, ready to take on the challenges and make his own mark. Below, New Yorkers of different backgrounds and interests offer some suggestions about where he should concentrate his energies.

Wendy Wasserstein,
playwright, author of "The Heidi Chronicles."
 New York needs both healing and a master plan. But what was so indelibly proven on Sept. 11 is that we have courage and heart. It's crucial that the new mayor keep his finger on the pulse of that impressive heart. 
 We are a city of working people. The new mayor needs to commit to the education and culture of all five boroughs to serve the families of all New Yorkers. So many people voted for "Mike" Bloomberg because he "wasn't a politician." Then let him be a man of the people.
New York City is more than Manhattan and the Upper East Side, where Mr. Bloomberg spent most of his time as a businessman. A mayor should take the subway to the Avenue M station in Brooklyn, around the corner from Edward R.

Whatever one thinks of Rudy Giuliani or Ed Koch, each of them was one of us: characters straight from Characterville. Each had a New Yorker's individuality. Some Bloomberg supporters have said to doubting Democrats, "Oh listen, he ran as a Republican but he's really a Democrat." I don't particularly care, as long as he's genuine. New Yorkers can always tell when someone isn't.

Diane Ravitch, research professor of education at New York University.
Mr. Bloomberg has a historic opportunity to reshape the public schools by negotiating new contracts with teachers and principals. Both unions are now operating without contracts. In addition to providing for competitive salaries to attract and retain top-notch teachers and executives, Mr. Bloomberg must insist on new working arrangements to deregulate the schools and ensure that principals have the authority to make decisions. The city should abolish the provision in the previous contract that relieved teachers of the obligation to monitor students at lunch, on the playground and in homerooms. Teachers should be responsible for students throughout the school day, not just when they are in the classroom.
The contract with principals should give them greater control over their schools' budgets, staffing, purchasing and meals by shifting authority from the bureaucracy at central headquarters to individual schools. In the new contracts, the city should guarantee that both teachers and principals will receive the professional training they need to meet their responsibilities.

Charles Schumer, senator from New York.
One of the first and most important things Mr. Bloomberg needs to do is marshal support for additional federal funding for New York from Washington, especially among Republican leaders. While the stream of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds -- which reimburse the city government for disaster-related expenses like the cleanup and rebuilding of the subways -- seems to be largely assured, lower Manhattan desperately needs new tax breaks to help existing businesses survive and to lure new ones, both large and small, below Canal Street.
There are also many nonprofit agencies, hospitals and individuals that were affected by the Sept. 11 attacks and need aid but are not eligible for assistance from FEMA. Mr. Bloomberg is clearly familiar with these issues and the city's needs. During his first month in office, he should meet with President George Bush, Speaker Dennis Hastert and House Whip Tom Delay, as well as Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott and Minority Whip Don Nickles, to persuade them of the urgency and immediacy of New York's cause.

Thelma Golden, deputy director for exhibitions and programs at the Studio Museum in Harlem.
Our new mayor needs to make artists and arts and culture an essential part of his vision of New York City. The city's spirit, as well as its physical spaces, must be rebuilt. The vibrant arts community can help with that job.
The drop-off in visitors and donations to cultural institutions, large and small, after the shock of Sept. 11 showed how fragile the arts economy in this city is. The new administration must create and finance support services that can help bring people into the city's cultural institutions. The city also needs to create a public cultural endowment fund, unhampered by bureaucracy and politics, to expand the creation and presentation of the arts throughout the city for all New Yorkers. This support should reflect the range of voices, cultures, and opinions found in every neighborhood in this richly diverse city. Cultural institutions are vital social and educational anchors in communities. Mr. Bloomberg should make innovative cultural policy part of his agenda.

Richard Parsons, incoming chief executive, AOL Time Warner.
The city's future is in the extraordinary brain power gathered in offices, theaters, studios, banks, libraries, universities, digital start-up companies and long-established businesses.
The effort to repair the damage inflicted on Sept. 11 can't begin and end with new structures, office space and monuments. In the long term, New York's recovery depends on building and maintaining an education system that trains literate, technologically proficient graduates who can secure this city's place in a global economy.
The performance of the city's schools will determine whether a chasm separates a privileged elite from masses of underemployed and unemployed. Only with successful schools can New York retain and expand its middle class and maintain a tax base sufficient to modernize a fraying infrastructure.

Alfonse M. D'Amato, former senator, now managing director of Park Strategies, a business consulting company.
Mr. Bloomberg must ensure that lower Manhattan remains the financial capital of the world. If there is a single first step in this gargantuan task it is this: to have in place by Sept. 11, 2002, a suitable memorial, a place where all Americans and all people can come to see that New York City will rise from the ashes.
New York's position at the pinnacle of the world's financial markets is what allows it to be the cultural and communications capital of the world. We must rebuild the infrastructure, but more important, we must repair and restore the spirit of this city.
The terrorists' target was intentionally symbolic. We must be equally symbolic in our response. We must build a memorial that both pays respect to those who lost their lives and demonstrates the awesome economic and human strength of the world's greatest city.

Dennis Rivera, president of 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's Health and Human Service Union.
Mr. Bloomberg's first priority should be to pass a living-wage bill. In more than 70 cities and counties across the country, a living wage is now required by law. Private businesses contracting with local government or receiving public subsidies must pay their employees enough so they can afford food, shelter and other necessities. In New York City, they need far more than the minimum wage, currently $5.15 per hour.
Such legislation would be a huge boost to the city's 50,000 home-care workers -- mainly women, and many single heads of households -- who bring aid and comfort to our frail elderly residents. They now make an average of $7.65 an hour. This is a scandal for such a rich city. These workers perform a valuable service and save the city money because home care is cheaper than that provided in a hospital or nursing home.
The huge disparity between rich and poor is sure to be exacerbated in the current recession. New Yorkers want fairness for people who work hard, and a living-wage law can help ensure that fewer workers live in abject poverty.

Donald Trump, real estate developer and author, with Dave Shiflett, of "The America We Deserve."
To many people, New York City represents the pinnacle of the American dream. Maintaining this ideal is a huge responsibility for anyone who becomes mayor. My advice to Mr. Bloomberg is to be aware of, yet not intimidated by, the position he will be taking on. It is not an enviable position, but it could become a heroic one. 
It has often been said that real estate is to New York what oil is to Texas. In these difficult economic times, it is especially important that the mayor encourage not only the construction of new buildings but also the redevelopment of existing ones. Modernizing buildings can lure people to New York even more quickly than constructing new ones can, and to further expedite the recovery, the mayor needs to get rid of the city's infamous red tape on zoning applications and tax abatements.
This could turn out to be an important time when we look back historically. One cannot be a hero in easy times, and a city cannot prove itself in purely affluent times. Our city has dealt with a very difficult situation, and our new mayor will show us how to take the next step and rebuild.

Jennifer J. Raab, president of Hunter College.
As a businessman, Mr. Bloomberg was not afraid to put his name on his product. The same fearlessness and accountability is needed to transform the city's public school system. Currently, six different elected officials (the mayor and the borough presidents) select seven people for the Board of Education -- leaving no one person accountable. The mayor must then funnel billions of dollars into the school system while having no direct control over how the money is spent.
Mr. Bloomberg should push hard for state legislation to end this structure and replace it with one that gives the mayor real authority to run the public schools. As we have seen in the last eight years in areas like public safety and children's services, when the mayor selects his executives and holds them accountable, great improvements can be achieved.

Andy Darrell, New York regional director, Environmental Defense.
The quality of the downtown environment is important to families and businesses deciding whether to stay in lower Manhattan or relocate. Reconstruction at the World Trade Center site may take six years, and Mr. Bloomberg can make downtown air much safer by requiring that contractors working there install filters on engines of their pollution-spewing cranes and bulldozers and use low-sulfur fuel. Boston has similar requirements at its Big Dig redevelopment project.
To reduce downtown traffic and the pollution and congestion it brings, the new mayor should make Mayor Giuliani's limits on single-occupant vehicles permanent or add congestion pricing, now in use on Hudson River crossings, to East River crossings. More ferries and water taxis could get people across the rivers.
The new administration should also be vigilant about guarding open space downtown. Projects like Hudson River Park and parkland in a reused Governors Island should not be threatened by fiscal cuts and political uncertainties.

John Wang, president of the Asian-American Business Development Center in Manhattan.
The Sept. 11 attack made Chinatown, a community already on the decline, even more vulnerable. Not only was tourism virtually halted, but severe traffic restrictions because of the cleanup at the World Trade Center threaten to bankrupt some garment businesses and wholesale and distribution operations.
To revitalize Chinatown as an important economic and political center for Chinese-Americans and as a major tourist attraction requires some bold thinking. Mr. Bloomberg should have city planners work with the community to produce a zoning study that analyzes the best and most appropriate land use for Chinatown. A major aim should be to preserve the garment industry businesses now in Chinatown while also exploring the feasibility of eventually relocating them to the outer boroughs as Chinatown diversifies its economic base. Chinatown itself needs a comprehensive program to turn underutilized space into a mixture of market-rate and low- and moderate-income housing.

Mark Green, outgoing public advocate and Mr. Bloomberg's opponent in the November election.
New York should develop and nurture a national reputation as a city that uses information technology well, both for internal efficiency and to expedite services to businesses. If so many of us e-bank from home, why not e-government from home? Professional and business licenses and permits should be obtainable via the Web; the city should take service requests and receive complaints by e-mail. Responses can be faster if city agencies and officials do more of their own work on computers and online as well. Now most city workers don't have access to the Internet or e-mail. And most city agencies are miles behind the Police Department in collecting data and using it to hold managers accountable for their departments' performance.
Mr. Bloomberg should appoint a high-profile chief technology officer, reporting directly to him, to work with every agency for higher productivity, lower costs and better service.

Myron Magnet, editor of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal.
Upon election, the first thing Michael Bloomberg declared was that New York was open for business. That's the message he should embrace as mayor: that he will make New York the Opportunity City, in which a growing private economy offers jobs for all.
The no-new-taxes promise Mr. Bloomberg made in his campaign is a fine start, but as the recession ends, he should institute tax cuts significant enough to encourage businesses to expand and to attract new businesses. Mr. Bloomberg should junk the city's income-tax surcharge and the commercial rent tax in Manhattan's central business districts. Then he should move to eliminate the city's income tax altogether, to make clear that he means business about economic growth. Cutting a tax on wealth creation is better than cutting the sales tax, a tax on consumption, and it would benefit not just retailers but all businesses, especially job-creating small outfits.
A bigger economy will ensure that city revenues will fall by little or nothing. And Mr. Bloomberg's promise to make city government smaller and more efficient will pave the way for further tax cuts and still more private job growth.

Deal Makers Are Hoping for a Livelier 2002

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
IT has been a tough year for the corporate takeover business. 
 A slumping economy, financial reverberations from Sept. 11 and an unwillingness by the European Union to approve some large multinational corporate marriages -- most notably General Electric's proposed $45 billion purchase of Honeywell -- combined to depress the appetite for mergers and acquisitions. The volume of announced deals this year is about $1.6 trillion, versus the $3.4 trillion for all of 2000, according to Thomson Financial. Money & Business asked four prominent professionals who make at least part of their living from takeover deals to give their prognosis for 2002. Following are their predictions, which do not add up to a revived boom. But some see glimmers of a rebound. 

HENRY R. KRAVIS -- A founding member of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the buyout firm, which helped to foment merger mania in the 1980's.
For financial buyers, it's back to basics. Chasing the fads -- telecom and dot-coms -- that's over. At the moment, the firms that care about their longevity are paying attention to their portfolios. Everyone has had one problem or another in recent years, and it takes a lot of manpower off the deal-making field to make fixes at portfolio companies. So there is a lot of inward focus to create value right now.
For those of us that have cash, it's still very expensive to make acquisitions; companies are still trading at exceptionally high values today. And then there's the whole issue of visibility: I haven't talked to very many C.E.O.'s who know what the earnings will look like next year. I wouldn't even venture to guess when the economy turns. I just don't know. But let's assume that it does turn -- what does that really mean? There's still a real question about the quality of a company's earnings due to the pressure to show improved results.
Of course, there will continue to be consolidation in telecom, energy and financial services. I think financial buyers will look at industrial manufacturing, retailing and other back-to-basics, high-cash-flow companies. Having said that, we're not just buying 100 percent of a company these days. We're also working more and more with corporations to solve their capital structure issues by providing equity capital which will help de-lever a balance sheet. I think increasingly you'll see more of that.

DAVID BOIES -- A lawyer who helped represent the Justice Department in its antitrust case against Microsoft. He is a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner in Armonk, N.Y.
If you look at the trends in antitrust enforcement, although there have been ups and downs with different administrations, there has been a remarkable consistency over the past two decades that I suspect will continue: the government will look at markets and competition more globally and broadly.
One thing we do not yet know is whether this administration will be as ready to tailor merger deals the way the Clinton administration did. It's a relatively demanding approach and requires that the people looking at the mergers really understand every facet of it. You usually see a willingness on the part of Democratic administrations to do that. While there are still political overtones, they are only likely to influence people at the margins. 
I gave a speech at the beginning of this year in which I predicted the center of gravity might have shifted to the European Community. The problem is, the European Community is about a decade and a half behind us in terms of policy -- you saw that with G.E.-Honeywell. The lesson there is that American companies have to understand the importance of the European Community and take it seriously. In G.E.-Honeywell, they may not have appreciated the role of the European Union's will.

FRANK QUATTRONE -- Managing director in charge of the technology group at Credit Suisse First Boston, which became a powerhouse in the underwriting of emerging technology companies in the late 1990's but has since been hit by the dot-com collapse and a scandal over how public stock offerings were sold.
In the current tech M.& A. environment, there are a lot of sellers but very few buyers. For M.& A. activity to pick up, there needs to be more stability in the business outlook for companies doing the buying. We don't necessarily need a bull market, but we do need confidence.
I expect an increase in M.& A. activity in the capital-intensive sectors of technology such as contract manufacturing and semiconductors. Contract manufacturers are likely to merge in order to achieve the necessary scale to stay competitive, mirroring the consolidation of their customers. Semiconductor companies will merge because fewer and fewer companies can afford to pay $4 billion for a wafer manufacturing facility, and deep submicron technology and 300-millimeter wafers raise the stakes considerably.
Other sectors are not so clear. Information technology services and software companies are typically hard to merge because of either people or technology integration issues. With I.T. services, because it's a people business, you pay a premium to buy the company and then pay again with adequate equity incentives to retain the talent. In a software merger or acquisition, products that may appear to be compatible often need to be rewritten to work within the buying company's overall architecture.
The reaction by large investors to the Compaq-Hewlett Packard proposed merger will make boards more cautious about proposing similar transactions. Future tech M.& A. deals will need to show a strong strategic, cultural and financial fit.

JACK LEVY -- Co-chairman for mergers and acquisitions at the Goldman Sachs Group, the leader this year in dispensing advice on mergers, with a market share of 34.6 percent, according to Thomson Financial.
Previous downdrafts in the equity markets of moderate duration have been followed within 6 to 9 months by a flurry of hostile deals. Companies often take advantage of a dip in the equity markets to launch unsolicited bids once they have confidence in their own share price and the prospects for a market recovery. The stigma of making an unsolicited offer is far less of a concern for many boards today, nor is it considered "poaching" someone else's deal to top an announced transaction by making a competition bid.
Nevertheless, one of the greatest difficulties facing a hostile bidder is the lack of due diligence that can be completed prior to and during the bidding process. A hostile bidder's level of knowledge about a target is often a real stumbling block from a valuation perspective. In an environment where top- and bottom-line growth is tough to achieve and where P/E multiples are probably under pressure, I would expect that many companies will get aggressive hoping to buy themselves more certain prospects for the future.

Taking on Republicans, But Not Their Leader

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AT long last, many Democrats say they can shed the conciliatory straitjacket that has constrained them since Sept. 11 and engage in genuine partisan politics. After all, 2002 is an important midterm election year. And now that the intense crisis environment has abated a bit, the Democrats may have an opening to criticize Republicans and not come off as unpatriotic.
Yet even if Democrats are ready for a fight, there's one big problem: Whom do they fight against? 
 In virtually every midterm election over the last few decades, the party out of power sought to portray the president as the villain. Remember the "Reagan Recession" in 1982? 
 Still, with control of the House, Senate and a third of the governorships at stake next year, the problem for Democrats is how best to blame the Republicans' $1.35 trillion tax cut for the slow economy and for the disappearing federal budget surplus without seeming to take on President Bush, who remains enormously popular in the polls.
The White House is doing its best to make the president untouchable by wrapping him in a flag of bipartisan unity, even as his aides portray Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, as an obstructionist who blocked the economic stimulus plan.
When he arrived in Texas for a respite at his ranch last week, Mr. Bush proclaimed 2002 as "a war year." (Translation: Democrats better not attack me because I'm staying above politics for as long as I can.)
"It's been a difficult period because all of a sudden George W. Bush is the star of a Frank Capra movie," said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist in Chicago. "It's important that we not get mesmerized by his poll numbers." Asked, then, if Democrats should directly attack Mr. Bush, he replied, "I'm aggressive but I'm not insane. The guy's numbers are stratospheric!"
Thus, the conflict. Democrats generally agree that they should not challenge Mr. Bush on the war but that they need to be more energetic in challenging him on domestic issues. Some have also called on the party to make a forceful case that not only Republicans can effectively manage national security issues.
"Most Democrats in Washington are afraid to say anything that sounds as if they're criticizing the president," said Robert B. Reich, a labor secretary under President Bill Clinton who is weighing whether to run for governor of Massachusetts next year. "The domestic agenda is in shambles and we need to begin to make the case that we can only be a strong nation if the working middle class and the less fortunate are brought along."
Some Democrats say a safer target is the conservative Republicans in the House. "The important thing is to get at the Congressional Republicans," said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a liberal research group. 
But the question is whether Democrats can wage an effective battle against Republicans without personalizing it to one person. Such an approach does not always work; the more the Republicans ridiculed Mr. Clinton in 1998 for his personal conduct, the more it seemed to benefit Democratic candidates.
Even so, as targets, Congressional leaders are more amorphous than presidents. There are Republican lightning rods in Congress, like Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, who hopes to move up to House majority leader next year. Yet Democrats still long for House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a symbol of what they said was misguided about the Republican Party.
Before Sept. 11, Democrats were counting on rebuilding Democratic majorities in the House and Senate on the back of Mr. Bush. 
After the president's first 100 days in office, Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic Party, published a thick -- and scathing -- critique. But now, in his year-end report, Mr. McAuliffe has only mentioned the president in passing.
Mr. McAuliffe said the Democrats' success in wresting the governorships in New Jersey and Virginia from Republicans in November -- despite Mr. Bush's popularity -- demonstrates that the party can do well by emphasizing domestic issues even in wartime. "We don't have to sit around and talk about President Bush," he said. "He didn't have coattails in 2000, didn't have them in 2001 and won't have them in 2002."
Yet Mr. McAuliffe suggested that Mr. Bush's State of the Union address in January could give the Democrats fodder to personalize the elections against Mr. Bush. "The dynamic could totally change in the next three or four months," he said.
Adding to the Democrats' difficulty is a lack of figureheads beyond two Congressional leaders, Mr. Daschle and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. Former Vice President Al Gore, the standard bearer in 2000, has all but vanished, leaving other elected officials with designs on the White House to vie for attention. Former President Clinton is so frustrated to be on the sidelines that he has talked about mounting a public relations offensive to press his agenda.
Some analysts counsel the Democrats to do what does not come natural to many politicians: be patient.
"If they just keep cool, there is a good possibility that circumstances will give them an advantage in the 2002 election," said Stuart Rothenberg, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter. "You find consultants and political operatives in the party itching for a fight. That's what they do for a living. But the Democrats can afford to sit back for a while and wait for the focus to turn back to the economy."
Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist in Los Angeles, said terrorism may be barely an issue next November. "Sept. 11 happened a year before the campaigns get going," he said, "so there may be enough distance to keep it from being the overwhelming political influence." But, he conceded, "Who knows?"
One Democrat who has not been so patient is Representative Nita M. Lowey of Westchester County, chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, who last month chastised the White House for the "Bush recession."
While some Democrats cheered her, many complained that the remark was gratuitous -- and gave the White House an opportunity to depict Democrats as partisan. Mr. McAuliffe, for one, refused to endorse Ms. Lowey's remark, saying, "I don't need to get into that one."
But as the election season proceeds, Democrats who badly want to regain the House and hang on to the Senate, may not be so reticent. And if the president's popularity dips -- it has nowhere to go but south -- comments like the "Bush recession" will seem hardly threatening.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PRESIDENT; 
At First Year's End, Bush Cites Both Victories and Challenges

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Dec. 29 

 BODY:
President Bush said today in his weekly radio address that his first year in office was ending with progress on foreign battlefields and accomplishments at home, but he said the coming year "will require our sustained commitment to the war against terrorism."
 "We cannot know how long this struggle will last," he added. 
 Mr. Bush, in what amounted to a brief radio review of his triumphs and disappointments in 2001, said that American forces were successfully fighting "a new kind of war" in Afghanistan and that Americans were safer at home because of actions his administration had taken. 
But he acknowledged that he had failed to push some of the most important parts of his domestic agenda through Congress. Mr. Bush blamed the Democratic-controlled Senate.
Mr. Bush, in remarks delivered from his 1,600-acre ranch here, said he was "disappointed" by what he said was the failure of the Senate to act on an economic stimulus package.
"I outlined these proposals in October, more than 800,000 lost jobs ago," Mr. Bush said. "My ideas passed the House of Representatives. And according to the Council of Economic Advisers, they could save 300,000 endangered jobs. But the Senate would not schedule them for a vote. I hope that we can resolve in the new year and put politics aside and get the job done for the American people."
A proposed deal, which both sides agreed would have provided low-income workers with $300 checks, collapsed in a final round of partisan Washington combat on Dec. 19. Democrats, led by Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, could not agree with Republicans on how to provide health insurance benefits to the unemployed. Both sides have said they will take up the issue next month when they return from their holiday recess.
On the Afghan battlefield, Mr. Bush said that the men and women of the United States military have applied new tactics and new technology to "rout a new kind of enemy." Mr. Bush was referring to the use of new technology like the Predator, the pilotless craft that can fire Hellfire antitank missiles and send live battlefield video to the cockpits of AC-130 gunships. Mr. Bush was also referring to the use of C.I.A. officers and Special Operations forces early in the war to help Afghan forces on the ground.
On domestic security, Mr. Bush said his administration had made flying safer after the Sept. 11 attacks, although he did not refer to an airport security bill, passed in November, with provisions that will not take effect for at least six months. 
Mr. Bush also said that his administration was "upholding our constitutional liberties." He did not mention a presidential order creating military tribunals or sweeping efforts by his administration to investigate the lives of people suspected of terrorism, including expanded government wiretapping and the monitoring of communications between some people in federal custody and their lawyers.
Mr. Bush also urged the Senate to take up bills that would give him a stronger hand to negotiate trade agreements, allow federal money for religious charities, create a patients' bill of rights and provide tax breaks and subsidies to energy companies. Versions of the bills that Mr. Bush supports have passed the House, but have run into opposition in the Senate. Mr. Daschle has stopped committee action on Mr. Bush's energy bill, which would allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Mr. Bush said his major legislative accomplishments were a $1.3 trillion tax cut, passed in May, and an education bill, passed this month, that would greatly expand the federal role in public education, mandate annual testing of children in grades three to eight and provide tutoring for children in persistently failing schools.
Mr. Bush called it "the boldest reform of the federal education program in nearly four decades," although he had to make major concessions to get the bill passed. Those included giving up on a voucher program for private schools.
"We look back on 2001 with sadness and with pride," Mr. Bush concluded. "We must look forward with determination and with resolve."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Looks Back With Just One Regret 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has very few regrets about his eight years in office -- in fact, the only thing he wishes he did is win his fight to abolish the Board of Education. 
 On Friday, in his last sit-down interview with reporters, Mr. Giuliani listed many of his administration's achievements, including what he said were improved race relations despite protests by many in minority communities against the police and the mayor. 
 Most of all, he said, he had no regrets other than being unable to persuade the State Legislature to put the schools directly under mayoral control, a goal he pursued for both of his terms. "I honestly think I did the best I could," Mr. Giuliani said. "I'm a human being, I have my limitations." 
"You in the press spend a great deal of time figuring out the things I do wrong," he said. "I always figured I should reserve myself for the more positive approach to things. I don't approach life that way. I realize that you make mistakes. Maybe it comes from having been a baseball player. If you make an error, if you spend your time thinking about the error, you make another one."
This was the final last chapter in a series of tightly scripted events designed to commemorate Mr. Giuliani's departure. The mayor agreed to the interview on the condition that resulting articles be held for publication in the high-circulation Sunday newspapers.
Mr. Giuliani was often criticized for his relations with black residents and declined to meet with most black elected officials and community leaders during his term, but he said that he believed race relations improved during his service, and that even before Sept. 11 his fairness was apparent to all.
"The degree of ethnic, racial and religious tension in this city on Sept. 10 was considerably less than it was eight years earlier or back in 1989 when I first ran for mayor," he said. "Polls would actually show that." 
Shortly after he dropped his Senate run to take care of his prostate cancer, Mr. Giuliani said he wanted to try to bridge the gaps that he believed some New Yorkers felt separated them from the mayor. On Friday, though, he brushed off questions about whether he had met that goal, saying he had worked hard to serve all neighborhoods, ethnic groups and constituents throughout his term.
"Perhaps most people understand that I relate to people as New Yorkers," he said. "I don't see minorities; everyone is a minority. Nobody is the majority in New York City. It hasn't been that way for a long time. I treat everybody equally. Everyone was treated the same way, with respect, unless they show they don't deserve it." This was more clear, he said, after the terrorist attacks. 
"The same thing that happened to the Police Department happened to me," he said. "I think people say that I work equally hard for all the people of the city," he added, citing lower crime rates in poor neighborhoods as the cornerstone of his law enforcement policies, which included job creation and economic development, he said.
Noting that he disagreed with what he called the "prevailing politically correct view as how you should relate to minorities," he said he hoped people would not take that view to mean that he did not have "the same love, respect and caring for people who regard themselves as minorities -- because I don't -- as I do for everybody else in that city." He continued: "I thought that in that political correctness was actually a form of racial prejudice and ethnic and religious prejudice, that there was a condescension in it that I found to be very damaging."
He said he had no interest in challenging Gov. George E. Pataki, whom he has repeatedly said he would support, nor in opposing Vice President Dick Cheney, which has been suggested several times. But Mr. Giuliani did not rule out running for elected office again. "These things are never planned out," he said.
He further praised all elements of his administration, and noted that the press had not given enough attention to the accomplishments of his deputy mayors and commissioners, whom he called "the most talented group that has ever served in city government." Under Mr. Giuliani, deputy mayors and commissioners were actively discouraged from speaking to reporters except during news conferences where he presided, and were usually given dual billing with the mayor for their accomplishments. 
Mr. Giuliani also said on Friday that the short-term budget news was not as dire as he had predicted earlier this fall. There will be $322 million more in the pot for the fiscal year ending June 30, in part from $150 million in unanticipated revenue and in part because the City Council did not pass the income tax reduction he had sought; that returned $172,000 to the budget for this year and millions more for future years. 
He gave careful answers to several questions. When asked if he would seek therapy for the trauma he endured as a result of the terrorist attacks, he said he thought others who needed help should certainly seek it. He also declined to specify what he wished for his legacy. "I don't think you get to determine how you are remembered," he said.

HEADLINE: New York Changes Command; 
Mayor Giuliani Bows Out

 BODY:
Each of New York's legendary mayors is captured in the city's collective memory by a singular, powerful moment -- Fiorello La Guardia reading the comics over the radio, John Lindsay walking through Harlem. Edward Koch may be remembered standing on the Brooklyn Bridge, urging on the pedestrian commuters during a transit strike. When this year began, most New Yorkers could have suggested any number of nominations for Rudolph Giuliani's defining portrait. For those who watched him carefully, this mayor was perhaps most himself during his budget and state-of-the-city speeches -- didactic but entertaining lectures of up to two hours that he delivered without notes, controlling the stage like the prosecuting attorney he used to be. When it comes to sheer memorability, it would be impossible to top the public performances in drag, when he appeared as a blond bombshell, an Italian grandma or, most recently, a leggy Rockette.
 Now we know that Rudy Giuliani will be remembered in a more heroic posture. In our minds he will always be standing at ground zero, his back to the towering shards and smoke from the World Trade Center. In history, he will appear as the singular presence who walked unflinchingly through the falling ash and debris, consoled the bereaved families, attended an unbearable number of funerals and exemplified the best stubborn spirit of a vital but stricken city. 
 Helping New York survive Sept. 11 was a mission that actually occupied only a few months of Mr. Giuliani's eight years in office, but it seems as if he had been in training for it all along. He always ran the city like a warrior king. His greatest successes were not the times he fought hardest, since this mayor always fought as if he were single-handedly protecting a room full of babies from a fire-breathing dragon. His finest victories came when he chose a target worthy of his implacable passion.
Before the World Trade Center fell, Mr. Giuliani was already nationally known as a crime-fighter, the man who proved New York could not only be safe, but polite and orderly as well. New Yorkers, whose view of Mr. Giuliani is fuller and more complicated than that of most other Americans, were eternally grateful for that gift of freedom from fear. But they also knew his quest for order could take him further than they necessarily wanted to go, like his wars on jaywalking and street vendors. They appreciated his funny, biting press conferences, in which everything seemed to eventually be eulogized as "very, very important" or dismissed as "very, very bad." But they also saw the ones in which he stonewalled on a tough question or insulted the questioner. He had, they learned, little gift for seeing the other person's point of view. His emotional talents were blunt, and they betrayed him when the moment called for a sense of humility and accommodation. That was particularly true in his relations with the city's minority communities, and in his response to incidents of police brutality. He had boundless sympathy for bereaved victims who turned to him for solace. But he was not very good at calming anger or listening to criticism. Even his staunchest supporters knew that much of his success was due in part to good timing. His greatest achievements -- the drop in crime, the reduction in welfare cases, the economic boom -- were mirrored in other cities that had milder-mannered chief executives. With a different mayor the city would still have done well during the 1990's. But without Mr. Giuliani, it might not have undergone the phenomenal turnaround that transformed a city that had been a byword for civic disorder into the emblem of urban renaissance. He made New Yorkers believe it was possible for New York to be secure and clean and under control, and he made the rest of the world believe it, too. The economic boom was a national phenomenon, but for New York, the surge in the tourism industry owed a great deal to Mr. Giuliani's determination to create a new and unfamiliar spirit of civility.
Mr. Giuliani did other things well besides fight crime. Some city agencies, such as the Department of Correction, became more efficient under his watch. He focused hard on child welfare, recruiting his friend Nicholas Scoppetta to rebuild the tottering bureaucracy that was in charge of identifying and protecting children at risk. But Mr. Giuliani seemed much more interested in defending children from abusive parents than in finding day care for those with struggling working mothers. Corruption in local school boards seemed to energize him more than the infinitely messier issue of low test scores.
He was fascinated by the city's budget problems in the early years of his administration, when finances were extremely shaky. Characteristically, Mr. Giuliani seemed buoyed by the challenge -- the larger the budget gap, the more he assured the public that the latest bad news was actually a good development that would lead to more efficiency over the long run. Hardheaded, unstoppable, he sliced the number of city workers and brought the budget under control. But it ballooned again in the later years of his tenure.
It would be easy to go on about the things Mr. Giuliani failed to do -- New York City has so many problems and crises and needs that all mayors leave office with far more losses than wins. The most its residents can expect of a mayor is that he -- or someday she -- accomplish one big thing, as Mayor Koch did in restoring the city's financial health. If that one achievement is important enough, it will come to stand for everything. When measured in that way, Mr. Giuliani more than did the job. He restored New Yorkers' confidence in their ability to control the city's destiny. The long years he spent fighting crime and disorder became the platform from which he showed us how to fight terrorism and Osama bin Laden.
As Jan. 1 begins, Mr. Giuliani marches off into a new career, assuming, as he said in his farewell speech, "the much more honorable title of citizen." But no matter what he does, he will always remain the Mayor of Sept. 11, standing in the battle zone, ready to lead his troops into the fray.

HEADLINE: New York Changes Command; 
Mayor Bloomberg Bows In

 BODY:
Michael Bloomberg, who becomes our 108th mayor on Jan. 1, already knows that the success or failure of his administration will depend on how well he responds to the economic crisis brought on by the national recession and Sept. 11.
 Mr. Bloomberg is still an unknown quantity for New Yorkers. His campaign, a maiden voyage into politics, was expensive but relatively smooth sailing. The distracted city and the quarrelsome Democrats barely noticed he was there until the last minute, and he comes into office unscathed by the normal slice-and-dice nature of New York City elections. As he pointed out frequently during the campaign, since he paid all the bills himself, he has few political debts outstanding. Having run as a Republican when both his history and ideology suggest he is a Democrat, he is well positioned to deal with elected officials of both parties. His lack of experience in city government is not a plus, but it will certainly allow him to make judgments with a fresh eye. 
 Mayor Bloomberg is going to need every advantage. New Yorkers are going to expect him to build on Rudolph Giuliani's legacy of a safe and orderly city. But next year's budget is going to contain gaps so huge that only some new sort of city-state partnership is likely to save the city from falling under state control. The restoration of Lower Manhattan is off to a sluggish start. The Police Department is facing a wave of retirements and recruitment problems. The firefighters, police officers and public school teachers are all waiting to settle contracts, and at a time when every New Yorker would agree that raises are due, Mr. Bloomberg will find himself with very little money to offer.
The two greatest challenges for the new mayor will be to find creative ways to give city workers higher salaries without driving the budget deeper into the hole and to work with Albany and Washington to get the help New York City will need to recover. The city has had little opportunity to analyze Mr. Bloomberg's talents as a negotiator. But his early efforts to reach out to Gov. George Pataki and to organize the city's lobbying efforts in Washington are encouraging, as are his choices of top aides who have the experience in city government that their boss lacks. It is impossible to guess the course of an administration from the things that happen before it really begins, but all the early signals from Mr. Bloomberg look promising.
One of the many useful legacies Mayor Giuliani leaves his successor is, ironically, Mr. Giuliani's history of feuding with everyone from Mr. Pataki to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The outgoing mayor had a genius for terrorizing politicians, officials and agencies with whom he disagreed. But he was less skilled at closing a deal. As a result, there are many long-delayed projects, such as the expansion of the Javits Convention Center, that could fall into place relatively easily if the next mayor proves to be a more cooperative partner. Since Mr. Bloomberg's attitude toward baseball appears to be less emotional than Mayor Giuliani's, he should be able to take an objective look at the deal for two baseball stadiums his predecessor came up with during his last week in office.
Mr. Bloomberg will find that all of the city's pressing problems cannot be a top priority. We hope that education is not one of the issues that winds up being relegated to second place. Mr. Bloomberg needs to be clever about making the maximum use of the school system's limited funds, and appoint members to the Board of Education who believe in teamwork rather than self-aggrandizement. 
Mr. Bloomberg will be sworn in moments after the ball drops in Times Square on Jan. 1. It will be a dramatic handover, from the most famous mayor in the world to a man many New Yorkers would still not recognize on the street. But they will get to know him soon enough. For the city, the new year will be only as good as Mr. Bloomberg's leadership. Wishing him the best is a hope for New York as well.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE RESPONSE; 
Planning for Terror but Failing to Act

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Judith Miller, Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr. and written by Ms. Miller. 

 BODY:
 Inside the White House situation room on the morning terrorism transformed America, Franklin C. Miller, the director for defense policy, was suddenly gripped by a staggering fear: "The White House could be hit. We could be going down." 
 The reports and rumors came in a torrent: A car bomb had exploded at the State Department. The Mall was in flames. The Pentagon had been destroyed. Planes were bearing down on the capital. 
The White House was evacuated, leaving the national security team alone, trying to control a nation suddenly under siege and wondering if they were next. Mr. Miller had an aide send out the names of those present by e-mail "so that when and if we died, someone would know who was in there." 
Somewhere in the havoc of the moment, Richard A. Clarke, then the White House counterterrorism chief, recalled the long drumbeat of warnings about terrorists striking on American soil, many of them delivered and debated in that very room. After a third hijacked jet had sliced into the Pentagon, others heard Mr. Clarke say it first: "This is Al Qaeda." 
An extensive review of the nation's antiterrorism efforts shows that for years before Sept. 11, terror experts throughout the government understood the apocalyptic designs of Osama bin Laden. But the top leaders never reacted as if they believed the country was as vulnerable as it proved to be that morning.
Dozens of interviews with current and former officials demonstrate that even as the threat of terrorism mounted through eight years of the Clinton administration and eight months of President Bush, the government did not marshal its full forces against it.
The defensive work of tightening the borders and airport security was studied but never quite completed. And though the White House undertook a covert campaign to kill Mr. bin Laden, the government never mustered the critical mass of political will and on-the-ground intelligence for the kind of offensive against Al Qaeda it unleashed this fall. 
The rising threat of the Islamic jihad movement was first detected by United States investigators after the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. The inquiry into that attack revealed a weakness in the immigration system used by one of the terrorists, but that hole was never plugged, and it was exploited by one of the Sept. 11 hijackers.
In 1996, a State Department dossier spelled out Mr. bin Laden's operation and his anti-American intentions. And President Bill Clinton's own pollster told him the public would rally behind a war on terrorism. But none was declared.
By 1997, the threat of an Islamic attack on America was so well recognized that an F.B.I. agent warned of it in a public speech. But that same year, a strategy for tightening airline security, proposed by a vice-presidential panel, was largely ignored.
In 2000, after an Algerian was caught coming into the country with explosives, a secret White House review recommended a crackdown on "potential sleeper cells in the United States." That review warned that "the threat of attack remains high" and laid out a plan for fighting terrorism. But most of that plan remained undone.
Last spring, when new threats surfaced, the Bush administration devised a new strategy, which officials said included a striking departure from previous policy -- an extensive C.I.A. program to arm the Northern Alliance and other anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan. That new proposal had wound its way to the desk of the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and was ready to be delivered to the president for final approval on Monday, Sept. 10.
The government's fight against terrorism always seemed to fall short.
The Sept. 11 attack "was a systematic failure of the way this country protects itself," said James Woolsey, a former director of central intelligence. "It's aviation security delegated to the airlines, who did a lousy job. It's a fighter aircraft deployment failure. It's a foreign intelligence collection failure. It's a domestic detection failure. It's a visa and immigration policy failure."
The Clinton administration intensified efforts against Al Qaeda after two United States Embassies in Africa were bombed in 1998. But by then, the terror network had gone global -- "Al Qaeda became Starbucks," said Charles Duelfer, a former State Department official -- with cells across Europe, Africa and beyond.
Even so, according to the interviews and documents, the government response to terrorism remained measured, even halting, reflecting the competing interests and judgments involved in fighting an ill-defined foe.
The main weapon in President Clinton's campaign to kill Mr. bin Laden and his lieutenants was cruise missiles, which are fired from thousands of miles away. While that made it difficult to hit Mr. bin Laden as he moved around Afghanistan, the president was reluctant to put American lives at risk.
But a basic problem throughout the fight against terrorism has been the lack of inside information. The C.I.A. was surprised repeatedly by Mr. bin Laden, not so much because it failed to pay attention, but because it lacked sources inside Al Qaeda. There were no precise warnings of impending attacks, and the C.I.A. could not provide an exact location for Mr. bin Laden, which was essential to the objective of killing him. 
At the F.B.I., it was not until last year that all field offices were ordered to get engaged in the war on terrorism and develop sources. Inside the bureau, the seminars and other activities that accompanied these orders were nicknamed "Terrorism for Dummies," a stark acknowledgment of how far the agency had not come in the seven years since the first trade center attack.
"I get upset when I hear complaints from Congress that the F.B.I. is not sharing its intelligence," said a former senior law enforcement official in the Clinton and Bush administrations. "The problem is that there isn't any to share. There is very little. And the stuff we can share is not worth sharing."
Officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency said that they had some success in foiling Al Qaeda plots, but that the structure of the group made it difficult to penetrate. "It is understandable, but unrealistic, especially given our authorities and resources, to expect us to be perfect," said Bill Harlow, a C.I.A. spokesman.
The reasons the government was not more single-minded in attacking Al Qaeda will be examined exhaustively and from every angle by Congress and others in the years ahead. 
In an era of opulence and invincibility, the threat of terrorism never took root as a dominant political issue. Mr. bin Laden's boldest attack on American property before Sept. 11 -- the embassy bombings -- came in the same summer that the Monica Lewinsky scandal was engulfing President Clinton. A full fight against terrorism might have meant the sacrifice of money, individual liberties and, perhaps, lives -- and even then without any guarantee of success.
Mr. Clarke, until recently the White House director of counterterrorism, warned of the threat for years and reached this conclusion: "Democracies don't prepare well for things that have never happened before."

The First Warning
A Horrible Surprise At the Trade Center
On Feb. 26, 1993 -- a month after Bill Clinton took office, having vowed to focus on strengthening the domestic economy "like a laser" -- the World Trade Center was bombed by Islamic extremists operating from Brooklyn and New Jersey. Six people were killed, and hundreds injured. 
Today, American experts see that attack as the first of many missed warnings. "In retrospect, the wake-up call should have been the 1993 World Trade Center bombing," said Michael Sheehan, counterterrorism coordinator at the State Department in the last years of the Clinton presidency. 
The implications of the F.B.I.'s investigation were disturbingly clear: A dangerous phenomenon had taken root. Young Muslims who had fought with the Afghan rebels against the Soviet Union in the 1980's had taken their jihad to American shores. 
The F.B.I. was "caught almost totally unaware that these guys were in here," recalled Robert M. Blitzer, a former senior counterterrorism official in the bureau's headquarters. "It was alarming to us that these guys had been coming and going since 1985 and we didn't know." 
One of the names that surfaced in the bombing case was that of a Saudi exile named Osama bin Laden, F.B.I. officials say. Mr. bin Laden, they learned, was financing the Office of Services, a Pakistan-based group involved in organizing the new jihad. And it turned out that the mastermind of the trade center attack, Ramzi Yousef, had stayed for several months in a Pakistani guest house supported by Mr. bin Laden. 
But if the first World Trade Center bombing raised the consciousness of some at the F.B.I., it had little lasting resonance for the White House. Mr. Clinton, who would prove gifted at leading the nation through sorrowful occasions, never visited the site. Congress tightened immigration laws, but the concern about porous borders quickly dissipated and the new rules were never put in effect. 
Leon E. Panetta, the former congressman who was budget director and later chief of staff during Mr. Clinton's first term, said senior aides viewed terrorism as just one of many pressing global problems. 
"Clinton was aware of the threat and sometimes he would mention it," Mr. Panetta said. But the "big issues" in the president's first term, he said, were "Russia, Eastern bloc, Middle East peace, human rights, rogue nations and then terrorism."
When it came to terrorism, Clinton administration officials continued the policy of their predecessors, who had viewed it primarily as a crime to be solved and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies. That approach, which called for grand jury indictments, created its own problems. 
The trade center investigation produced promising leads that pointed overseas. But Mr. Woolsey said in an interview that this material was not shared with the C.I.A. because of rules governing grand jury secrecy. 
The C.I.A. faced its own obstacles, former agency officials say. In the wake of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the agency virtually abandoned the region, leaving it with few sources of information about the rising radical threat. 
Looking back, George Stephanopoulos, the president's adviser for policy and strategy in his first term, said he believed the 1993 attack did not gain more attention because, in the end, it "wasn't a successful bombing." 
He added: "It wasn't the kind of thing where you walked into a staff meeting and people asked, what are we doing today in the war against terrorism?" 
Two years later, however, terrorism moved to the forefront of the national agenda when a truck bomb tore into the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people. 
President Clinton visited Oklahoma City for a memorial service, signaling the political import of the event. "We're going to have to be very, very tough in dealing with this," he declared in an interview.
Mr. Panetta said that plans to reorganize the government's counterterrorism efforts were quickly revived. Senior officials recognized that the United States remained vulnerable to terrorism. The bombing proved to be the work of two Americans, both former soldiers, but if Oklahoma City could be hit, an attack by terrorists of any stripe could "happen at the White House," Mr. Panetta said. 
Two months after the bombing, Mr. Clinton ordered the government to intensify the fight against terrorism. The order did not give agencies involved in the fight more money, nor did it end the bureaucratic turf battles among them.
But it did put Mr. bin Laden, who had set up operations in Sudan after leaving Afghanistan in 1991, front and center.

Diplomacy and Politics
A Growing Effort Against bin Laden
As Mr. Clinton prepared his re-election bid in 1996, the administration made several crucial decisions. Recognizing the growing significance of Mr. bin Laden, the C.I.A. created a virtual station, code-named Alex, to track his activities around the world. 
In the Middle East, American diplomats pressed the hard-line Islamic regime of Sudan to expel Mr. bin Laden, even if that pushed him back into Afghanistan. 
To build support for this effort among Middle Eastern governments, the State Department circulated a dossier that accused Mr. bin Laden of financing radical Islamic causes around the world. 
The document implicated him in several attacks on Americans, including the 1992 bombing of a hotel in Aden, Yemen, where American troops had stayed on their way to Somalia. It also said Mr. bin Laden's associates had trained the Somalis who killed 18 American servicemen in Mogadishu in 1993. 
Sudanese officials met with their C.I.A. and State Department counterparts and signaled that they might turn Mr. bin Laden over to another country. Saudi Arabia and Egypt were possibilities. 
State Department and C.I.A. officials urged both Egypt and Saudi Arabia to accept him, according to former Clinton officials. "But both were afraid of the domestic reaction and refused," one recalled. 
Critics of the administration's effort said this was an early missed opportunity to destroy Al Qaeda. Mr. Clinton himself would have had to lean hard on the Saudi and Egyptian governments. The White House believed no amount of pressure would change the outcome, and Mr. Clinton risked spending valuable capital on a losing cause. "We were not about to have the president make a call and be told no," one official explained. 
Sudan obliquely hinted that it might turn Mr. bin Laden over to the United States, a former official said. But the Justice Department reviewed the case and concluded in the spring of 1996 that it did not have enough evidence to charge him with the attacks on American troops in Yemen and Somalia. 
In May 1996, Sudan expelled Mr. bin Laden, confiscating some of his substantial fortune. He moved his organization to Afghanistan, just as an obscure group known as the Taliban was taking control of the country. 
Clinton administration officials counted it as a positive step. Mr. bin Laden was on the run, deprived of the tacit state sponsorship he had enjoyed in Sudan. 
"He lost his base and momentum," said Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser in his second term. 
In July 1996, shortly after Mr. bin Laden left Sudan, Mr. Clinton met at the White House with Dick Morris, his political adviser, to hone themes for his re-election campaign.
The previous month, a suicide bomber had detonated a truck bomb at a military barracks in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 American servicemen. Days later, T.W.A. Flight 800 had exploded off Long Island, leaving 230 people dead in a crash that was immediately viewed as terrorism. 
Mr. Morris said he had devised an attack advertisement of the sort that Senator Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, might use against Mr. Clinton and had shown it to a sampling of voters. Seven percent of those who saw it said they would switch from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Dole.
"Out of control. Two airline disasters. One linked to terrorism," the advertisement said. "F.A.A. asleep at the switch. Terror in Saudi Arabia." Mr. Morris said he told Mr. Clinton that he could neutralize such a line of attack by adopting tougher policies on terrorism and airport security. He said his polls had found support for tightening security and confronting terrorists. Voters favored military action against suspected terrorist installations in other countries. They backed a federal takeover of airport screening and even supported deployment of the military inside the United States to fight terrorism. 
Mr. Morris said he tried and failed to persuade the president to undertake a broader war on terrorism.
Mr. Clinton declined repeated requests for an interview, but a spokeswoman, Julia Payne, said: "Terrorism was always a top priority in the Clinton administration. The president chose to get his foreign policy advice from the likes of Sandy Berger and Madeleine Albright and not Dick Morris."
On July 25, Mr. Clinton announced that he had put Vice President Al Gore at the head of a commission on aviation safety and security. Within weeks, the panel had drafted more than two dozen recommendations. Its final report, in February 1997, added dozens more.
Among the most important, commission members said, was a proposal that the F.B.I. and C.I.A. share information about suspected terrorists for the databases maintained by each airline. If a suspected terrorist bought a ticket, both the airline and the government would find out.
Progress was slow, particularly after federal investigators determined that the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800 resulted from a mechanical flaw, not terrorism. The commission's recommendation languished -- until Sept. 11, when two people already identified by the government as suspected terrorists boarded separate American Airlines flights from Boston using their own names. 
That morning, no alarms went off. The system proposed by the Gore commission was still not in place. The government is now moving to share more information with the airlines about suspected terrorists. 
"Unfortunately, it takes a dramatic event to focus the government's and public's attention, especially on an issue as amorphous as terrorism," said Gerry Kauvar, staff director of the commission and now a senior policy analyst at the RAND Corporation.

Focusing on Al Qaeda
A Clearer Picture, A Disjointed Fight
As Mr. Clinton began his second term, American intelligence agencies were assembling a clearer picture of the threat posed by Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda, which was making substantial headway in Afghanistan. 
A few months earlier, the first significant defector from Al Qaeda had walked into an American Embassy in Africa and provided a detailed account of the organization's operations and ultimate objectives. 
The defector, Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl, told American officials that Mr. bin Laden had taken aim at the United States and other Western governments, broadening his initial goal of overthrowing Saudi Arabia and other "infidel" Middle Eastern governments. 
He said that Al Qaeda was trying to buy a nuclear bomb and other unconventional weapons. Mr. bin Laden was also trying to form an anti-American terrorist front that would unite radical groups. But Mr. Fadl's statements were not widely circulated within the government. A senior official said their significance was not fully understood by Mr. Clinton's top advisers until his public testimony in 2000. 
The war against Al Qaeda remained disjointed. While the State Department listed Mr. bin Laden as a financier of terror in its 1996 survey of terrorism, Al Qaeda was not included on the list of terrorist organizations subject to various sanctions released by the United States in 1997.
The F.B.I.'s counterterrorism experts, who were privy to Mr. Fadl's debriefings, were growing increasingly concerned about Islamic terrorism. "Almost all of the groups today, if they chose, have the ability to strike us in the United States," John P. O'Neill, a senior F.B.I. official involved in counterterrorism, warned in a June 1997 speech.
The task, Mr. O'Neill said, was to "nick away" at terrorists' ability to operate in the United States. (Mr. O'Neill left the F.B.I. this year for a job as chief of security at the World Trade Center, where he died on Sept. 11.) 
As Mr. O'Neill spoke in Chicago, the F.B.I. and C.I.A. was homing in on a Qaeda cell in Nairobi, Kenya. 
The National Security Agency began eavesdropping on telephone lines used by Al Qaeda members in the country. On several occasions, calls to Mr. bin Laden's satellite phone in Afghanistan were overheard. The F.B.I. and C.I.A. searched a house in Kenya, seizing a computer and questioning Wadih El-Hage, an American citizen working as Mr. bin Laden's personal secretary. 
American officials counted the operations as a success and believed they had disrupted a potentially dangerous terrorist cell. They were proved wrong on Aug. 7, 1998, when truck bombs were detonated outside the United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injuring more than 5,000.
Stunned by the plot's ambition and precision, Mr. Clinton vowed to punish the perpetrators, who were quickly identified as Al Qaeda adherents. "No matter how long it takes or where it takes us," the president said, "we will pursue terrorists until the cases are solved and justice is done." 
The political calculus, however, had changed markedly since the president's triumph in the fall of 1996, and Mr. Clinton was in no position to mount a sustained war against terrorism. 
His administration was weighed down by a scandal over his relationship with a White House intern. Mr. Clinton was about to acknowledge to a grand jury that his public and private denials of the affair had been misleading. Republicans depicted every foreign policy decision as an attempt to distract voters. 
Thirteen days after the embassy bombings, President Clinton nonetheless ordered cruise missile strikes on a Qaeda camp in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that officials said was linked to Mr. bin Laden and chemical weapons. 
But the volley of cruise missiles proved a setback for American counterterrorism efforts. The C.I.A. had been told that Mr. bin Laden and his entourage were meeting at the camp, but the missiles struck just a few hours after he left. And the owner of the pharmaceutical factory came forward to claim that it had nothing to do with chemical weapons, raising questions about whether the Sudan strike had been in error. 
The Clinton administration stood by its actions, but several former officials said the criticism had an effect on the pursuit of Al Qaeda: Mr. Clinton became even more cautious about using force against terrorists. 
Unfortunately, the quarry was becoming more dangerous. In the two years since leaving Sudan, Mr. bin Laden had built a formidable base in Afghanistan. He lavished millions of dollars on the impoverished Taliban regime and in exchange was allowed to operate a network of training camps that attracted Islamic militants from all over the world. In early 1998, just as he declared war on Americans everywhere in the world, he cemented an alliance with Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a ruthless and effective group whose leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was known for his operational skills.

The Battle Intensifies
Struggling to Track 'Enemy No. 1'
In the years after the embassy bombings, the Clinton administration significantly stepped up its efforts to destroy Al Qaeda, tracking its finances, plotting military strikes to wipe out its leadership and prosecuting its members for the bombings and other crimes. "From August 1998, bin Laden was Enemy No. 1," Mr. Berger said.
The campaign had the support of President Clinton and his senior aides. But former administration officials acknowledge that it never became the government's top priority. 
When it came to Pakistan, for example, American diplomats continued to weigh the war on terrorism against other pressing issues, including the need to enlist Islamabad's help in averting a nuclear exchange with India.
Similarly, a proposal to vastly enhance the Treasury Department's ability to track global flows of terrorist money languished until after Sept. 11. And American officials were reluctant to press the oil-rich Saudis to crack down on charities linked to radical causes. 
Still, the fight against Al Qaeda gained new, high-level attention after the embassy attacks, present and former officials say. Between 1998 and 2000, the "Small Group" of the Cabinet-rank principals involved in national security met almost every week on terrorism, and the Counterterrorism Security Group, led by Mr. Clarke, met two or three times a week, officials said.
The United States disrupted some Qaeda cells, and persuaded friendly intelligence services to arrange the arrest and transfer of Al Qaeda members without formal extradition or legal proceedings. Dozens were quietly sent to Egypt and other countries to stand trial.
President Clinton also ordered a more aggressive program of covert action, signing an intelligence order that allowed him to use lethal force against Mr. bin Laden. Later, this was expanded to include as many as a dozen of his top lieutenants, officials said. 
On at least four occasions, Mr. Clinton sent the C.I.A. a secret "memorandum of notification," authorizing the government to kill or capture Mr. bin Laden and, later, other senior operatives. The C.I.A. then briefed members of Congress about those plans.
The C.I.A. redoubled its efforts to track Mr. bin Laden's movements, stationing submarines in the Indian Ocean to await the president's launch order. To hit Mr. bin Laden, the military said it needed to know where he would be 6 to 10 hours later -- enough time to review the decision in Washington and program the cruise missiles. 
That search proved frustrating. Officials said the C.I.A. did have some spies within Afghanistan. On at least three occasions between 1998 and 2000, the C.I.A. told the White House it had learned where Mr. bin Laden was and where he might soon be. 
Each time, Mr. Clinton approved the strike. Each time, George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, called the president to say that the information was not reliable enough to be used in an attack, a former senior Clinton administration official said. 
In late 1998, according to former officials, intelligence agents reported that Abu Hafs, a Mauritanian and an important figure in Al Qaeda, was staying in Room 13 at the Dana Hotel in Khartoum.
With such specific information in hand, White House officials wanted Abu Hafs either killed or, preferably, captured and transferred out of Sudan to a friendly state where he could be interrogated, the former officials said. 
The agency initially questioned whether it could accomplish such a mission in a hostile, risky environment like Sudan, putting it in the "too hard to do box," one former official said. An intelligence official disputed this account, saying the C.I.A. made "a full-tilt effort in a very dangerous environment."
Eventually, the C.I.A. enlisted another government to help seize Abu Hafs, a former official said, but by then it was too late. The target had disappeared.
Officials said the White House pushed the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop plans for a commando raid to capture or kill Mr. bin Laden. But the chairman, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, and other senior Pentagon officers told Mr. Clinton's top national security aides that they would need to know Mr. bin Laden's whereabouts 12 to 24 hours in advance.
Pentagon planners also considered a White House request to send a hunter team of commandos, small enough to avoid detection, the officer said. General Shelton discounted this option as naive, the officer said. 
White House officials were frustrated that the Pentagon could not produce plans that involved a modest number of troops. Military planners insisted that an attack on Al Qaeda required thousands of troops invading Afghanistan. "When you said this is what it would take, no one was interested," a senior officer said. 
A former administration official recently defended the decision not to employ a commando strike. "It would have been an assault without the kind of war we've seen over the last three months to support it," the official said. "And it would have been very unlikely to succeed."
Clinton administration officials also began trying to choke off Al Qaeda's financial network. Shortly after the embassy bombings, the United States began threatening states and financial institutions with sanctions if they failed to cut off assistance to those who did business with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. 
In 1999 and early 2000, some $255 million of Taliban-controlled assets was blocked in United States accounts, according to William F. Wechsler, a former White House official.
Mr. Wechsler said the search for Al Qaeda's assets was often stymied by poor cooperation from Middle Eastern and South Asian states. 
The United States, too, he added, had problems. "Few intelligence officials who understand the nuances of the global banking system" were fluent in Arabic. While the C.I.A. had done a "reasonably good job" analyzing Al Qaeda, he wrote, it was "poor" at developing sources within Mr. bin Laden's financial network. The F.B.I., he argued, had similar shortcomings.
Senior officials were frustrated by the C.I.A.'s inability to find hard facts about Al Qaeda's financial operations.
Intelligence officials said the C.I.A. had amassed considerable detail about the group's finances, and that information was used in the broad efforts to freeze its accounts after Sept. 11.
At the State Department, officials reacted sharply to the assault on the embassies. Michael Sheehan, the department's former counterterrorism coordinator, said that after the bombings, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met with her embassy security director every morning and became increasingly focused on efforts to protect her employees and installations.
But to Mr. Sheehan, the response was inadequate. He believed that terrorism could be contained only if Washington devised a "comprehensive political strategy to pressure Pakistan and other neighbors and allies into isolating not only Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda, but the Taliban and others who provide them sanctuary," he said, and that did not happen. There were competing priorities. "Our reaction was responsive, almost never proactive," he said.

'We Were Flying Blind'
An Arrest, a Review And New Obstacles
The arrest of Ahmed Ressam was the clearest sign that Osama bin Laden was trying to bring the jihad to the United States.
Mr. Ressam was arrested when he tried to enter the United States in Port Angeles, Wash., on Dec. 14, 1999. Inside his rental car, agents found 130 pounds of bomb-making chemicals and detonator components.
His arrest helped reveal what intelligence officials later concluded was a Qaeda plot to unleash attacks during the millennium celebrations, aimed at an American ship in Yemen, tourist sites and a hotel in Jordan, and unknown targets in the United States.
"That was a wake-up call," a senior law enforcement officer said, "not for law enforcement and intelligence, but for policy makers." Just as the embassy bombings had exposed the threat of Al Qaeda overseas, the millennium plot revealed gaping vulnerabilities at home.
"If you understood Al Qaeda, you knew something was going to happen," said Robert M. Bryant, who was the deputy director of the F.B.I. when he retired in 1999. "You knew they were going to hit us, but you didn't know where. It just made me sick on Sept. 11. I cried when those towers came down."
A White House review of American defenses in March 2000 found significant shortcomings in nearly a decade of government efforts to improve defenses against terrorists at home. The F.B.I. and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, it said, should begin "high tempo, ongoing operations to arrest, detain and deport potential sleeper cells in the United States."
The review called for the government to greatly expand its antiterrorism efforts inside the United States, creating an additional dozen joint federal-local task forces like the one that had been set up in New York.
The review identified particular weaknesses in the nation's immigration controls, officials said. The government remained unable to track foreigners in the United States on student visas, despite a 1996 law passed after the first World Trade Center bombing that required it to do so.
In June 2000, after the millennium plot was revealed, the National Commission on Terrorism recommended that the immigration service set up a system to keep tabs on foreign students. Academic institutions opposed the recommendation, fearing that a strict reporting requirement might alienate prospective foreign students, according to government officials. Nothing changed.
As the commission was completing its work, the Sept. 11 hijackers began entering the United States. One of the 19 hijackers, Hani Hanjour, who had traveled on a student visa, failed to show up for school and remained in the country illegally.
The F.B.I. had some problems of its own. It had no intelligence warning of an attack on Los Angeles International Airport, which investigators eventually learned was Mr. Ressam's intended target.
Beginning in 1997, senior officials at the bureau had begun to rethink their approach to terrorism, viewing it now as a crime to be prevented rather than solved. But it was the millennium plot that revealed how ill equipped the bureau was to radically shift its culture, former officials say.
It lacked informers within terrorist groups. It did not have the computer and analytical capacity for integrating disparate pieces of information.
"We did not have any actionable intelligence," one senior official said. "We were flying blind."
In March 2000, Dale L. Watson, the F.B.I.'s assistant director for counterterrorism, started a series of seminars with agents who headed the bureau's 56 field offices. Each field office was required to establish a joint terrorism task force with local police departments, modeled after the arrangement begun in New York in the mid-1980's. Field office chiefs were also told to hire more Arabic translators and develop better sources of information.
Mr. Watson said that the meetings were a centerpiece of efforts to shore up the bureau's counterterrorism work that had begun several years earlier. The meetings, he said, were "designed to bring every office, no matter how small, to the same top terrorism capacities resident in our larger offices like New York."
The F.B.I. renewed its push on Capitol Hill for money to create a computer system that would allow various field offices to share and analyze information collected by agents. Until late last year, Congress had refused to pay for the project.
Without the analytical aid of a computer system, Mr. Bryant said, the bureau's counterterrorism program would be hobbled, particularly if the goal was to avert a crime. "We didn't know what we had," he said. "We didn't know what we knew."
Overseas, the Clinton administration searched for new ways to obtain the intelligence needed to attack Mr. bin Laden. In September 2000, an unarmed, unmanned spy plane called the Predator flew test flights over Afghanistan, providing what several administration officials called incomparably detailed real-time video and photographs of the movements of what appeared to be Mr. bin Laden and his aides.
The White House pressed ahead with a program to arm the Predator with a missile, but the effort was slowed by bureaucratic infighting between the Pentagon and the C.I.A. over who would pay for the craft and who would have ultimate authority over its use. The dispute, officials said, was not resolved until after Sept. 11.
On Oct. 12, an explosive-laden dinghy piloted by two suicide bombers exploded next to the American destroyer Cole in Yemen, killing 17 sailors. Intelligence analysts linked the bombing to Al Qaeda, but at a series of Cabinet-level meetings, Mr. Tenet of the C.I.A. and senior F.B.I. officials said the case was not conclusive.
Mr. Clarke, the White House counterterrorism director, had no doubts about whom to punish. In late October, officials said, he put on the table an idea he had been pushing for some time: bombing Mr. bin Laden's largest training camps in Afghanistan. 
With the administration locked in a fevered effort to broker a peace settlement in Israel, an election imminent and the two-term Clinton administration coming to a close, the recommendation went nowhere. Terrorism was not raised as an issue by either Vice President Al Gore or George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential campaign.
In October 2000, the administration took another shot at killing Mr. bin Laden. When Mr. Berger called the president to tell him the effort had failed, he recalled, Mr. Clinton cursed. "Just keep trying," he said.

The New Team
Seeing the Threat But Moving Slowly
As he prepared to leave office last January, Mr. Berger met with his successor, Condoleezza Rice, and gave her a warning. 
According to both of them, he said that terrorism -- and particularly Mr. bin Laden's brand of it -- would consume far more of her time than she had ever imagined.
A month later, with the administration still getting organized, Mr. Tenet, whom President Bush had asked to stay on at the C.I.A., warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda remained "the most immediate and serious threat" to security. But until Sept. 11, the people at the top levels of the Bush administration may, if anything, have been less preoccupied by terrorism than the Clinton aides. 
At the C.I.A., according to former Clinton administration officials, Mr. Tenet's actions did not match his words. For example, one intelligence official said, the C.I.A. station in Pakistan remained understaffed and underfinanced, though the C.I.A. denied that.
In March, the White House's Counterterrorism Security Group began drafting its own strategy for combating Al Qaeda. Mr. Clarke was still nominally in charge, but Bush aides were on the way to approving Mr. Clarke's recommendation that his group be divided into several new offices.
Mr. Bush's principals did not formally meet to discuss terrorism in late spring when intercepts from Afghanistan warned that Al Qaeda was planning to attack an American target in late June or perhaps over the July 4 holiday.
They did not meet even after intelligence analysts overheard conversations from a Qaeda cell in Milan suggesting that Mr. bin Laden's agents might be plotting to kill Mr. Bush at the European summit meeting in Genoa, Italy, in late July. 
Administration officials say the president was concerned about the growing threat and frustrated by the halfhearted efforts to thwart Al Qaeda. In July, Ms. Rice said, Mr. Bush likened the response to the Qaeda threat to "swatting at flies." He said he wanted a plan to "bring this guy down."
The administration's draft plan for fighting Al Qaeda included a $200 million C.I.A. program that, among other things, would arm the Taliban's enemies. Clinton administration officials had refused to provide significant money and arms to the Northern Alliance, which was composed mostly of ethnic minorities. Officials feared that large-scale support for the rebels would involve the United States too deeply in a civil war and anger Pakistan. 
President Bush's national security advisers approved the plan on Sept. 4, a senior administration official said, and it was to be presented to the president on Sept. 10. (However, the leader of the Northern Alliance was assassinated by Qaeda agents on Sept. 9.) Mr. Bush was traveling on Sept. 10 and did not receive it.
The next day his senior national security aides gathered shortly before 9 a.m. for a staff meeting. At roughly the same moment, a hijacked Boeing 767 was plowing into the north tower of the World Trade Center.

When Kenny Anthony was re-elected prime minister of St. Lucia this month, one of the first faxed congratulations he received was from a high-ranking executive at Britain's Cable and Wireless.
 It came from the chief executive of the telephone company's regional operations, which include more than a dozen Caribbean countries and far-flung locales like Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands and Macao. Rarely had a powerful Cable and Wireless executive been so swift and cordial in his congratulations. 
 "Cable and Wireless has learned that they have to play marbles with us," said Earl Bousquet, Mr. Anthony's spokesman. "They are recognizing the need for a relationship free of colonial baggage." 
Some of the fawning is a response to St. Lucia's decision in April to end Cable and Wireless's century-old monopoly, permitting competition in its telephone market. St. Lucia, the most populous of the island countries that make up the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, followed the example of neighbors like Jamaica that have sought to weaken Cable and Wireless's grip on their markets.
The opening of the telecommunications markets where Cable and Wireless operates is just one of the challenges facing the 129-year-old company, which long provided telegraph and telephone service in the colonies of the British Empire.
The company's strategy of cobbling together a money-losing World Wide Web host empire while defending its profitable colonial legacies from competition is coming under fire. Its foray into the United States with a proposed $850 million acquisition of the assets of Exodus Communications, an Internet-services company based in Santa Clara, Calif., that is under bankruptcy protection, is facing skepticism. If the deal is completed next month, the company would become the world's largest Web-host business.
"I'm convinced we need to reinvent ourselves in order to focus on an internationalized Internet-based strategy," Graham Wallace, chief executive of Cable and Wireless, said in an interview. 
Investors are not so sanguine about Mr. Wallace's approach, which extends an acquisition effort. In May, long after the dot-com bubble burst, Cable and Wireless agreed to pay $340 million for the Web site manager Digital Island of San Francisco. 
Cable and Wireless stock fell to its lowest level in a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks, though it has recovered some ground. The stock is down 68 percent from its 52-week high set last Jan. 10, closing last week at 326 pence ($4.73) in London; the American depository receipts, each representing three ordinary shares, closed at $14.65 last week, off a similar level from their 52-week high set on Jan. 11.
Still, Cable and Wireless is pursuing its acquisition strategy at full speed. Earlier this month, it offered to buy the Japanese operations of PSINet, a bankrupt Internet services company, for about $10 million in cash and $25 million in assumed liabilities. But the Exodus deal would far outstrip previous efforts.
It would be one of the biggest bets on the potential of high-end communications services like Web site management and high-speed Internet voice and services for businesses with offices around the world. The acquisition will be expensive, at about $300,000 a customer, said Cyrus Mewawalla, an analyst in London with Nomura International.
The hefty price has left some investors wondering why Cable and Wireless thinks it can make money providing Internet services to businesses where Exodus and its competitors could not.
Mr. Wallace, the chief executive, said he was persuaded of the opportunity to form a profitable global communications network by serving a growing market efficiently. Cable and Wireless expects the Exodus assets to turn a profit by 2005.
Together with capital spending and a plan to buy back up to 15 percent of Cable and Wireless's stock, the Exodus acquisition would deplete Cable and Wireless's cash from about $6.8 billion, to about $2.9 billion. Alarmed by the risks associated with the attempt to buy Exodus, the rating agency Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on Cable and Wireless this month to negative from stable.
The performance of Global, the unit that provides voice, data and Internet services to businesses, explains the concern over efforts to expand the operation through costly acquisitions. For the six months ended Sept. 30, the unit accounted for 71 percent of overall revenue but just 16 percent of earnings, before charges.
In addition, Cable and Wireless has been hurt by the same fierce competition in long-distance service that has hurt companies like AT&T and WorldCom. Margins for the Global unit fell to 2.7 percent in the second and third quarters of this year, down from 13 percent in the comparable period the previous year, according to Standard & Poor's.
The troubling performance of the Global unit reveals the importance of Regional, the subsidiary that provides telephone service in 26 locations in the Caribbean, Panama, the Middle East and islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. 
Regional accounts for just 28 percent of sales but for a whopping 95 percent of profit, before charges. Because many of its operations are monopolies, they are quite profitable, lifting the unit's margins to 43 percent. The elimination of 7,000 jobs this year, which brought the company's work force to about 24,000, should help lift overall margins the next six months, a Cable and Wireless spokesman said.
The trouble is, like St. Lucia, other island authorities are taking steps to end Cable and Wireless's monopoly. Cable and Wireless threatened earlier this year to withdraw completely from St. Lucia, a former British possession of 160,000 people, if its monopoly was broken.
But Cable and Wireless backed off after Mr. Anthony, the prime minister, banded with four of his counterparts in the eastern Caribbean, who threatened it with expulsion from their lands if it abandoned St. Lucia. A deal was reached that opened the way for competition in St. Lucia and eventually in neighboring countries. Keith Mitchell, Grenada's prime minister, led the negotiations that brought Cable and Wireless' agreement to operate in competitive markets to fruition.
Deregulation started in Jamaica last year after mobile licenses were granted to two competing companies. In Bermuda, which, like St. Lucia, is a former British possession, the government opened its telecommunications market in 1996, permitting TeleBermuda, a unit of 360networks of Canada, to provide international services.
Peter Eustace, a spokesman for Cable and Wireless, said it welcomed the opening of markets where it operated as long as clear rules wereestablished so everyone could compete equally.
"We think competition is healthy in the long run because that will help these markets to become more sophisticated, with more revenue-generating possibilities for everyone," Mr. Eustace said.
Still, it may be too early to tell how deeply these efforts will erode profits at Cable and Wireless's most profitable arm, although analysts are already voicing concern. Mr. Eustace said recent reports in Britain that said a sale of the Regional properties was planned were unsubstantiated.
"Ongoing deregulation could pressure earnings," said Peter Kernan, an analyst in London with Standard & Poor's. The unit "will also continue to face a relatively high degree of political and economic risk, although this is mitigated by a well-diversified business portfolio."
Some of Cable and Wireless's smaller holdings are well protected from competition. For example, on Ascension Island, almost equidistant in the Atlantic Ocean between South America and Africa, it provides all international communications and operates the Ariane Earth Station, which is used to monitor European Space Agency launchings.
Similarly, Cable and Wireless is the exclusive provider of telephone services in Diego Garcia, the island in the Indian Ocean that serves as an important base for the United States military installations used to carry out bombing raids in Afghanistan.
For the time being, there is no question that the complex task of reconciling such faraway operations with the cutting-edge but unprofitable assets resulting from Cable and Wireless's acquisition strategy is weighing on the company.
"When a company spreads itself too thin, something has to eventually give," said Mr. Mewawalla, the Nomura analyst, who has a sell recommendation on Cable and Wireless stock. "Using its profitable operations to finance such a risky expansion strategy is not something that can be sustained in the long term."

HEADLINE: Reluctance in Greece to Let Go of the Coin of History 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: ATHENS 

 BODY:
At midnight on Dec. 31, Europe's oldest currency, the drachma, will vanish, ending a tradition that originated nearly 2,600 years ago and, some Greeks fear, an integral part of their national identity.
 "Shame!" said Anastasios Tzamanis, a coin expert and the president of Greece's Numismatic Society. "You'd think thousands of years of history would be sold off at a better price." 
 In fact, though, the switch comes only after decades of belt-tightening fiscal reforms in pursuit of the dream of European integration. Five years ago, Prime Minister Costas Simitis promised that Greece would become part of the monetary union by 2000. 
The drachma was depreciated by 14 percent, and Greece, the poorest member of the European Union, had to struggle an extra year to meet the convergence criteria.
So today, politicians are euphoric, even if the public is mostly bewildered.
Nota Phillipides, a 27-year-old elementary school teacher, said: "I still don't get it. Why must we give up the drachma within Greece? She means more to us than just money. She is a mirror of who we are. She's in our math books, our history books, our folk tales, our daily parlance. She's everywhere."
The drachma was the standard silver coin of antiquity, and its name is said to have originated on the island of Aegina, a major commercial center from 570 to 540 B.C.
Its use soon spread to emerging city-states like Athens and Corinth. Commerce and conquest, particularly by Alexander the Great, took the coin as far east as Afghanistan, where tribes in the region used it as a model for another coin -- the dirham -- a measure of currency still applied in the Islamic world, Mr. Tzamanis said.
After the Romans and their conquests, though, the drachma disappeared until 1832, when Greece gained independence after 400 years of Ottoman rule. The modern drachma was intended to revive the spirit of classical Greece.
Instead, said Athanassios Tarasouleas, the country's leading authority on the currency, the drachma "weathered a sequence of crises."
"It's no wonder we feel so sentimental about the drachma," he said. "It embodies 170 years of contemporary Greek hardship and survival."
The currency was for decades printed in the United States and initially depicted scenes inspired by Latin America.
In 1922, the bankrupt government ordered all bills to be cut in half.
One half was given to the Central Bank as part of a "forced loan" it has yet to pay back.
Four years later, Greeks were ordered to scissor their bills again. In 1942, inflationary pressures forced Greece to issue the largest note denomination in European history -- a bill for 100 billion drachma, which at the time was the price of a loaf of bread.
In 1953, the state again intervened and ordered Greeks to strike three zeros off every bill they owned.
Still, the vulnerable drachma was regarded with great affection, and Greeks call it "drachmoula," likening it to a feisty woman. Not surprisingly, some Greeks were put off by the appearance of the euro.
"Look at this stuff," said Spyros Kalamanas, a 43-year-old shopkeeper, as he surveyed his euro starter kit. "It just feels as alien as moon dust. It's uninviting. And it sure doesn't make me feel more European."
Maria Zafiraki, 18, a student of agriculture, went a step further. "If anything," she lamented, "I now feel less of a Greek. It's a terrible feeling. A loss of identity. And the fact that they added a couple of Greek depictions on one side of the coin -- well, that's all crumbs!"
Panayiotis Manthoudakis, 62, nodded in agreement. "What next?" he wondered. "Will they take away our language too?"
Part of the popular opposition is the accumulated resentment after a string of adjustments that Greeks have been forced to make in recent years, at the demand of a government determined to modernize Greece.
Among the most contentious measures was the state's decision to remove religious affiliation from national identity cards, a move that stoked nationalist passions, led to mass protests and a political crisis from which the government has yet to fully recover.
Still, not all Greeks believe that the switch to the euro amounts to a loss of national heritage.
"If a country has a strong enough national conscience," said Anna Karapanayiotou, a 34-year-old archaeologist, "then the introduction of a new currency with a new face should herald no emotional dilemmas. It should be a cinch of a change."
Others, like Yiannis Sifonakis, 82, a retired painter, are blunter: "Money is money," he said. "And we Greeks tend to forget quickly."
In fact, in the final days of the drachma, some Greeks are visiting coin shops trying to make a profit off their soon-to-expire currency.
At one shop in Athens, owned by Mr. Tarasouleas, one woman recently tried to exchange 100 drachmas for the equivalent of a million. "She said it was the price she wanted for consigning the drachma to the trash bin of history," Mr. Tarasouleas said.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the replacement of Greece's currency, the drachma, by the euro carried an erroneous byline. It was by Anthee Carassava.

GRAPHIC: Photo Chart: "FORGED IN ANTIQUITY, IMMORTALIZED IN LEGEND" First Introduced -- 1832. Trivia -- The modern drachma was introduced after Greece gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire. But the currency's history dates back to the sixth century B.C. when Greeks in Athens and the island of Aegina produced silver coins they called drachma, Greek for handful. Alexander the Great carried the coins as far east as Afghanistan, and the drachma is mentioned in the Bible. Drachma to euro value -- 340.75000.
