HEADLINE: Ex-Chief of Park Avenue Bank Charged With Bailout Fraud

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER and ERIC DASH; Ann Farmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A former president of the Park Avenue Bank in Manhattan was charged on Monday with fraud, embezzlement and bribery in what the authorities called the first criminal case of trying to defraud the federal government's bank bailout program.
 The former banker, Charles J. Antonucci Sr., misled state and federal regulators into believing that he had come to the rescue of his troubled institution by investing $6.5 million of his own money to improve its financial position, the authorities said. 
 Instead, they say, Mr. Antonucci actually made the investment with the bank's money. He secretly routed it through a group of entities he controlled, and then used it to buy a majority control of the bank, as if the money were from outside investors, according to a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
 This allowed him to make the bank appear stronger than it really was, essentially double-counting the money, in an application for more than $11 million from TARP, or the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The government established the program during the height of the financial crisis to pour capital into the nation's banks at a time when private investors were too nervous to invest their own money. 
 Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the money would have been enough to solve the Park Avenue Bank's financial problems. But Mr. Antonucci's supposed investment of personal capital, he said, ''was the functional equivalent of Monopoly money.''
 In another scheme, prosecutors said, Mr. Antonucci approved millions of dollars in bank overdrafts to firms controlled by an associate, who then gave him use of a private plane for trips to destinations like the Super Bowl and the Masters golf tournament.
 They also charged that he defrauded officials of a Florida church of more than $100,000.
 Mr. Antonucci, 59, of Fishkill, N.Y., was released on a $2 million personal recognizance bond by a federal magistrate judge. His lawyer, Charles A. Stillman, said after the hearing that he expected his client to plead not guilty. 
 The fraud charges were the first to emerge from federal inquiries into the suspected misuse of bailout funds. The office of the TARP's special inspector general said in its most recent report that officials were conducting 77 criminal and civil investigations into companies that accepted bailout money, including inquiries into insider trading and accounting and securities fraud. Other federal and state investigators are also regularly involved. 
 Neil Barofsky, the bailout program's special inspector general, said the charges against Mr. Antonucci represented ''an important chapter in the history of the TARP bailout.'' He said it was the first time an individual was ''being criminally charged for attempting to steal money from the taxpayer through the TARP.'' 
 On Friday evening, New York State banking regulators shuttered the Park Avenue Bank because of ineffective management and inadequate capital, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation immediately seized and sold it. Valley National Bank, a New Jersey lender, took control of the operations. 
 ''No customer of the bank will lose a dime and I expect that this transition will be seamless,'' said Richard H. Neiman, New York State's superintendent of banks.
 The bank, which had its headquarters at 460 Park Avenue, had several retail branches in Manhattan and Brooklyn, the authorities said.
 As the crisis worsened in fall 2008, Treasury Department officials rolled out the TARP program to aid healthy lenders. Banks needed a satisfactory regulatory rating, and ample capital, to qualify. 
 Although regulators questioned Park Avenue's deteriorating condition, Mr. Antonucci pointed to the $6.5 million investment in fall 2008 as evidence the bank was viable, the authorities said. 
 ''The bank was broken,'' Mr. Bharara said, adding that Mr. Antonucci ''methodically went about pretending to fix it.''
 Federal officials began reviewing Park Avenue's application in November 2008. By late February 2009, the officials determined that the bank was not strong enough to receive bailout money. In response, Park Avenue withdrew its application. 
 In the scheme involving the church, prosecutors charged that Mr. Antonucci defrauded officials of the Calvary Springs Chapel in Coral Springs, Fla. Church officials wanted to construct a new building for the congregation and were told that if they invested $103,940 with an associate of Mr. Antonucci's, they would be paid back $604,848 within two or three weeks, prosecutors said.
 ''The church members still have not seen a penny of the promised gains or of their original moneys,'' said James T. Hayes Jr., special agent in charge of the New York office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
 On Monday, at a branch at 45th Street and 13th Avenue in Borough Park, two blue-and-yellow Valley National banners covered the bank's old name on a red awning. Some customers expressed surprise at the developments. 
 ''It was a great shocker,'' Barry Reichman, 59, said. ''We thought, a bank is a bank. We don't expect one to change.'' 
 He said he had been unaware of the criminal charges but said he had no plans to close his account. ''We like the friendliness of this bank,'' he said.
 Moses Menczer, 24, a student, came out pushing a baby carriage. ''They didn't explain to me anything,'' he said. ''As long as they give me my money, it's not my business. They can call it whatever they want.''

HEADLINE: Goal at Deutsche Telekom: More Women as Managers

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecommunications company, said Monday that it would more than double the number of women who are managers within five years, becoming the first member of the DAX 30 index of blue-chip German companies to introduce gender quotas. 
 Political pressure has grown on companies across Europe to increase women's representation among their leadership ranks and to address persistent gender gaps in areas like pay and professional opportunity. 
 Deutsche Telekom said it planned to raise the number of women in senior and middle management to 30 percent by the end of 2015, from 12 percent today. The company said it had roughly 15,000 management positions worldwide. 
 ''Taking on more women in management positions is not about the enforcement of misconstrued egalitarianism,'' the company's chief executive, Rene Obermann, said in a statement. ''Having a greater number of women at the top will quite simply enable us to operate better.'' 
 To meet its target, the company -- the third-largest in Germany, after the engineering group Siemens and E.On, a utility company -- plans to step up its recruiting of female university graduates and require that at least 30 percent of the places in executive development programs be held by women, Anne Wenders, a Deutsche Telekom spokeswoman, said. 
 It also plans to expand parental-leave programs and introduce more flexible working hours for managers. Fewer than 1 percent of the company's managers work part time. The number of available places in company child-care programs in Germany will double to around 700 from 350, Ms. Wenders said. 
 Of Deutsche Telekom's global work force of 258,000, 52 percent are in Germany, where women -- especially working mothers -- continue to lag behind many of their European peers and earn significantly less than their male counterparts. 
 A survey of 600 companies in 20 countries published this month by the World Economic Forum ranked German companies 15th in terms of female employees, with just 33 percent. 
 According to Germany's Federal Statistical Office, average hourly wages for women in Germany are 23.2 percent lower than for men, a significantly wider gap than the European Union average of 18 percent. 
 Women occupy 13 percent of top management positions in the German economy, the largest in Europe, slightly above the European Union average of 11 percent. In 2008, 7.8 percent of German board directors were women, below the 9.7 percent average for the 15 core members of the European Union. In the United States, 15.2 percent of board members in 2009 were women. 
 No women are among the chief executives of the 30 largest German companies. Only one company, Siemens, has a woman on its executive committee. Barbara Kux, 56, serves on the eight-member panel. At the 200 largest German companies, women represent 2.5 percent of senior managers. 
 Deutsche Telekom has no women on its eight-member executive committee. Of the 20 directors on its supervisory board, three are women. 
 Deutsche Telekom's initiative follows a wave of efforts across Europe to increase the number of women in corporate leadership posts. Since 2008, Norway has mandated that women hold at least 40 percent of board seats at publicly listed companies, while Spain, the Netherlands and France have passed similar laws. 
 The German government's minister of family affairs, Kristina Schroder, praised Deutsche Telekom's plan but said that mandated quotas ''must be the very last resort'' for achieving gender balance in the executive ranks.

HEADLINE: Fending Off Digital Decay, Bit by Bit

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Among the archival material from Salman Rushdie currently on display at Emory University in Atlanta are inked book covers, handwritten journals and four Apple computers (one ruined by a spilled Coke). The 18 gigabytes of data they contain seemed to promise future biographers and literary scholars a digital wonderland: comprehensive, organized and searchable files, quickly accessible with a few clicks. 
 But like most Rushdian paradises, this digital idyll has its own set of problems. As research libraries and archives are discovering, ''born-digital'' materials -- those initially created in electronic form -- are much more complicated and costly to preserve than anticipated.
 Electronically produced drafts, correspondence and editorial comments, sweated over by contemporary poets, novelists and nonfiction authors, are ultimately just a series of digits -- 0's and 1's -- written on floppy disks, CDs and hard drives, all of which degrade much faster than old-fashioned acid-free paper. Even if those storage media do survive, the relentless march of technology can mean that the older equipment and software that can make sense of all those 0's and 1's simply don't exist anymore. 
 Imagine having a record but no record player. 
 All of which means that archivists are finding themselves trying to fend off digital extinction at the same time that they are puzzling through questions about what to save, how to save it and how to make that material accessible. 
 ''It's certainly one of those issues that keeps a lot of people awake at night,'' said Anne Van Camp, the director of the Smithsonian Institution Archives and a member of a task force on the economics of digital preservation formed by the National Science Foundation, among others.
 Though computers have been commonly used for more than two decades, archives from writers who used them are just beginning to make their way into collections. Last week, for instance, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin, announced that it had bought the archive of David Foster Wallace, who committed suicide in 2008. Emory opened an exhibition of its Rushdie collection in February, and last year, not long before his death, John Updike sent 50 5 1/4-inch floppy disks to the Houghton Library at Harvard. 
 Leslie Morris, a curator at the Houghton Library, said, ''We don't really have any methodology as of yet'' to process born-digital material. ''We just store the disks in our climate-controlled stacks, and we're hoping for some kind of universal Harvard guidelines,'' she added.
 Among the challenges facing libraries: hiring computer-savvy archivists to catalog material; acquiring the equipment and expertise to decipher, transfer and gain access to data stored on obsolete technologies like floppy disks; guarding against accidental alterations or deletions of digital files; and figuring out how to organize access in a way that's useful. 
 At Emory, Mr. Rushdie's outdated computers presented archivists with a choice: simply save the contents of files or try to also salvage the look and organization of those early files. Because of Emory's particular interest in the impact of technology on the creative process, Naomi Nelson, the university's interim director of Manuscript Archives and Rare Book Collection, said that the archivists decided to try to recreate Mr. Rushdie's writing experience and the original computer environment.
 Mr. Rushdie started using a computer only when the Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 fatwa drove him underground. ''My writing has got tighter and more concise because I no longer have to perform the mechanical act of re-typing endlessly,'' he explained during an interview while in hiding. ''And all the time that was taken up by that mechanical act is freed to think.'' 
 He added: ''I had this kind of fetish about presenting clean copy. I don't like presenting my publisher with pages with lots of crossings-out and scribbling. So I would be manic at the end of typing a page where actually I didn't want to change anything, not at all.''
 Some of the early files chronicle Mr. Rushdie's self-conscious analysis of how computers affected his work. In an imaginary dialogue with himself that he composed in 1992 when he was writing ''The Moor's Last Sigh,'' he wrote about choosing formatting, fonts and spacing: ''I am doing this so that I can see how a whole page looks when it's typed at this size and spacing.
 ''Oh, my God, suppose it looks terrible?''
 ''Oh, my God, yeah. And doesn't this look wrong?''
 ''Where's the paragraph indent thing?''
 ''I don't know. I will look.''
 ''How about this? Is this good for you?''
 ''A lot better. How about fixing the part above?'' 
 At the Emory exhibition, visitors can log onto a computer and see the screen that Mr. Rushdie saw, search his file folders as he did, and find out what applications he used. (Mac Stickies were a favorite.) They can call up an early draft of Mr. Rushdie's 1999 novel, ''The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' and edit a sentence or post an editorial comment. 
 ''I know of no other place in the world that is providing access through emulation to a born-digital archive,'' said Erika Farr, the director of born-digital initiatives at the Robert W. Woodruff Library at Emory. (The original draft is preserved.)
 To the Emory team, simulating the author's electronic universe is equivalent to making a reproduction of the desk, chair, fountain pen and paper that, say, Charles Dickens used, and then allowing visitors to sit and scribble notes on a copy of an early version of ''Bleak House.''
 ''If you're interested in primary materials, you're interested in the context as well as the content, the authentic artifact,'' Ms. Farr said. ''Fifty years from now, people may be researching how the impact of word processing affected literary output,'' she added, which would require seeing the original computer images. 
 It may even be possible in the future to examine literary influences by matching which Web sites a writer visited on a particular day with the manuscript he or she was working on at the time.
 Michael Olson, the digital collections project manager at Stanford University, said that the only people who really had experience with excavating digital information were in law enforcement. ''There aren't a lot of archives out there capturing born-digital material,'' he said, referring to the process of extracting all data accurately from a device. 
 Located in Silicon Valley, Stanford has received a lot of born-digital collections, which has pushed it to become a pioneer in the field. This past summer the library opened a digital forensics laboratory -- the first in the nation. 
 The heart of the lab is the Forensic Recovery of Evidence Device, nicknamed FRED, which enables archivists to dig out data, bit by bit, from current and antiquated floppies, CDs, DVDs, hard drives, computer tapes and flash memories, while protecting the files from corruption. (Emory is giving the Woodruff library $500,000 to create a computer forensics lab like the one at Stanford, Ms. Farr said.)
 With the new archive from David Foster Wallace, the Ransom Center now has 40 collections with born-digital material, including Norman Mailer's. Gabriela Redwine, an archivist at Ransom, is impressed by Emory's digital emulation, but said the center was not pursuing that kind of reproduction at the moment. 
 ''Our focus is preservation and storage now,'' she said. ''Over the last couple of years, we've been learning about computer forensics.''
 The center is trying to raise endowment money to hire a digital collections coordinator while Ms. Redwine works on preservation and processing. In the meantime, most of the digital material is off limits to researchers.

HEADLINE: Production Increases Again, Pointing to Improved Demand

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Industrial production picked up slightly in February, though a bout of winter weather hampered growth in manufacturing.
 Production rose 0.1 percent over all in February, the Federal Reserve said Monday, with mining gaining 2 percent and utilities increasing 0.5 percent over the previous month. 
 Manufacturing posted a decline of 0.2 percent for the month, but economists said that was largely because of a series of snowstorms that temporarily closed factories along the East Coast and reduced the length of the workweek. 
 In addition, car manufacturing fell 4.4 percent, which economists attributed to worries about the safety of Toyota vehicles. Toyota halted production at several factories for a week in February as it developed a fix for sticky accelerator pedals in several models.
 Economists said Monday's report indicated that a recovery for the manufacturing sector was intact, even though output slowed in February. Over all, demand appears to be gaining strength, led by a 1 percent increase in electronics and computer production last month. When car production was excluded, manufacturing output rose 0.1 percent. 
 ''There's a pretty solid uptrend in place,'' said Dana Johnson, chief economist for Comerica in Dallas. ''Manufacturing is doing noticeably better than other parts of the economy.''
 With the prospects for a recovery looking better, businesses are beginning to tentatively rebuild inventories. That has helped drive factory orders and made manufacturing one of the few bright spots of the economy. The sector continues to outpace the growth of the overall economy.
 Factories are also benefiting from a resurgence in orders from overseas. Many businesses have seen exports grow significantly over the last six months, helped in part by a weak dollar and a surge in demand as foreign economies begin to stir.
 Industrial production was up 1.7 percent in February compared with a year earlier, and it rose 0.9 percent in January. February's gains marked the eighth month of upward momentum.
 A separate report by the Fed on Monday provided more evidence that the recovery for manufacturing was robust. New York-area manufacturers recorded a surge in orders and shipments in March, according to the Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. Employment in the sector reached the highest level since 2007, and inventories grew to the largest levels since before the start of the financial crisis. The overall index of manufacturing activity fell, but not as much as expected.
 Production is expected to continue to make gains this year. Economists forecast a large gain in industrial output in March as businesses make up for lost time caused by February's weather.
 John Ryding, chief economist for RDQ Economics, predicted that industrial production would grow 7 percent this year as the labor market improved and businesses in the United States and abroad began spending more on capital goods.
 ''The financial system has stabilized, and trade flows are reconnecting,'' Mr. Ryding said. ''The recovery continues to be led by a recovery in manufacturing.''
 But economists note that a return to normal production levels is still a way off. Capacity utilization, which measures how much of the nation's production capability is in use, increased slightly to 72.7 percent in February, far below the historical average of 80.6.

HEADLINE: Amid Democratic Impatience, Senators Move on a Jobs Bill

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate cleared the way on Monday for final Congressional approval of a Democratic plan to spur job creation as Democrats grew impatient with delays in enacting what they hope is the first in a series of economic measures.
 By a bipartisan vote of 61 to 30, the Senate eliminated the final procedural obstacle to approval later this week of a bill that would exempt employers from payroll taxes through the end of the year on newly hired employees who have been out of work for at least 60 days. 
 Six Republicans joined 53 Democrats and two independents in cutting off debate; 29 Republicans and one Democrat, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, opposed the move. The jobs measure is one of the few major pieces of legislation in months to draw significant support from both parties in the Senate.
 Frustrated over the pace of consideration of the measure, which has already passed the Senate once, Democrats sought to move up a final vote on the bill that contains $15 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for capital improvement bonds along with an extra $20 billion for highway and transit construction. 
 ''Let's get this done,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader. ''This bill should go to the president tomorrow so people can start being hired the day after tomorrow.''
 But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, objected to an expedited vote and Democrats instead accepted Mr. McConnell's proposal to finish the measure Wednesday morning and to consider a long-delayed renewal of Federal Aviation Administration programs in the interim.
 Democrats had wanted the jobs-related measure on President Obama's desk weeks ago and they significantly scaled back its scope in an effort to speed its approval. But the measure was still snarled by Democratic reservations in the House, where lawmakers considered it too narrow and insisted on changes, as well as by procedural delays in the Senate despite some Republican backing.
 Democratic supporters of the bill said the measure would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs while providing tax benefits to small businesses that make investments in their operations.
 ''We need to help people get jobs,'' Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said. ''We need to do more to help businesses to hire more workers.'' 
 Under the proposal, businesses that hired the unemployed would also get a $1,000 tax credit if the workers are kept on the payroll at least a year. Besides adding money for public works construction, the measure would also extend the federal highway program through the end of the year, sparing it from interruptions that led to temporary unpaid furloughs for Department of Transportation workers earlier this month.
 The Senate last week approved a separate $150 billion package of business tax breaks and safety net programs that Democrats hope to make the next stage in their push to encourage hiring while providing some relief to those who are struggling to find employment. But that measure still needs review in the House and appears to be weeks away from passage.
 Democrats intend to follow that bill with legislation focusing on more aid to small businesses. On Monday, leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee proposed another package of tax breaks for small businesses and incentives for state and local government bonds to finance public works projects.
 Under the bill, individuals who invest in eligible small businesses could exclude all capital gains for stock acquired for the remainder of the year and held for at least five years. That is up from a 75 percent tax exclusion in the original stimulus law. The bill would also increase through 2011 deductions for some costs of starting a business. The tax-writing panel could approve the proposal as early as Wednesday and send it to the House floor soon after.
 Democrats had hoped to make the economy and job creation their main priority in 2010, but they continue to get sidetracked by the health care debate, a clash they hope to conclude in the coming days.

HEADLINE: For Obese People, Prejudice in Plain Sight

BYLINE: By HARRIET BROWN. 
Harriet Brown teaches magazine journalism at the Newhouse School in Syracuse.

 BODY:
As a woman whose height and weight put me in the obese category on the body-mass-index chart, I cringed when Michelle Obama recently spoke of putting her daughters on a diet. While I'm sure the first lady's intentions are good, I'm also sure that her comments about childhood obesity will add yet another layer to the stigma of being overweight in America.
 Last August, Dr. Delos M. Cosgrove, a cardiac surgeon and chief executive of the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, told a columnist for The New York Times that if he could get away with it legally, he would refuse to hire anyone who is obese. He probably could get away with it, actually, because no federal legislation protects the civil rights of fat workers, and only one state, Michigan, bans discrimination on the basis of weight.
 Dr. Cosgrove may be unusually blunt, but he is far from alone. Public attitudes about fat have never been more judgmental; stigmatizing fat people has become not just acceptable but, in some circles, de rigueur. I've sat in meetings with colleagues who wouldn't dream of disparaging anyone's color, sex, economic status or general attractiveness, yet feel free to comment witheringly on a person's weight. 
 Over the last few years, fat people have become scapegoats for all manner of cultural ills. ''There's an atmosphere now where it's O.K. to blame everything on weight,'' said Dr. Linda Bacon, a nutrition researcher and the author of ''Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight'' (Benbella, 2008). ''If we're worried about climate change, someone comes out with an article about how heavier people weigh more, so they require more fuel, and they blame the climate change crisis on fatter people. We have this strong belief system that it's their fault, that it's all about gluttony or lack of exercise.''
 It's no secret that being fat is rarely good for your career. Heather Brown (no relation) has experienced this firsthand. A few years ago, she applied for a grant-writing job with a small nonprofit in the Boston area. After a successful phone interview, she was invited to the office. 
 ''As soon as I shook the interviewer's hand, I knew she would not hire me,'' Ms. Brown said. ''She gave me a look of utter disdain, and made a big deal about whether we should take the stairs or ride the elevator to the room where we were going to talk. During the actual interview, she would not even look at me and kept looking to the side.'' Ms. Brown, 36, who now works as an assistant dean at a college near Chicago, said she never even got a ''No thank you'' letter after the interview. 
 That story is all too familiar to people like Bill Fabrey, an advocate who in 1969 founded the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance. The organization's archives, he says, are full of stories from people who say they lost jobs or promotions because of their weight, or were not hired in the first place.
 Some of the most blatant fat discrimination comes from medical professionals. Rebecca Puhl, a clinical psychologist and director of research at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale, has been studying the stigma of obesity for more than a decade. More than half of the 620 primary care doctors questioned for one study described obese patients as ''awkward, unattractive, ugly, and unlikely to comply with treatment.'' (This last is significant, because doctors who think patients won't follow their instructions treat and prescribe for them differently.) 
 Dr. Puhl said she was especially disturbed at how openly the doctors expressed their biases. ''If I was trying to study gender or racial bias, I couldn't use the assessment tools I'm using, because people wouldn't be truthful,'' she said. ''They'd want to be more politically correct.''
 Despite the abundance of research showing that most people are unable to make significant long-term changes in their weight, it's clear that doctors tend to view obesity as a matter of personal responsibility. Perhaps they see shame and stigma as a health care strategy. 
 If so, is it working? Not very well. Many fat people sidestep such judgments by simply avoiding doctor visits, whether for routine checkups, preventive screenings or urgent health problems. 
 Indeed, Dr. Peter A. Muennig, an assistant professor of health policy at Columbia, says stigma can do more than keep fat people from the doctor: it can actually make them sick. ''Stigma and prejudice are intensely stressful,'' he explained. ''Stress puts the body on full alert, which gets the blood pressure up, the sugar up, everything you need to fight or flee the predator.'' 
 Over time, such chronic stress can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes and other medical ills, many of them (surprise!) associated with obesity. In studies, Dr. Muennig has found that women who say they feel they are too heavy suffer more mental and physical illness than women who say they feel fine about their size -- no matter what they weigh.
 Even if doctors don't directly express weight-based judgments, their biases can hurt patients. One recent study shows that the higher a patient's body mass, the less respect doctors express for that patient. And the less respect a doctor has for a patient, says Dr. Mary Huizinga, the study's lead author and an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the less time the doctor spends with the patient and the less information he or she offers. 
 Fat stigma affects everyone's health -- fat, thin or in between. Last fall, Lincoln University in southern Pennsylvania announced that it would weigh and measure all freshmen, and require those with a B.M.I. over 30 to enroll in a special fitness class. Fat rights advocates protested it as discrimination: If the fitness class was that important to student health, shouldn't everyone take it?
 Lincoln's administrators backpedaled after a storm of bad press. But the controversy underscores the fact that fat stigma isn't about improving people's health, as doctors like Delos Cosgrove contend. If it were, the conversation would be about health rather than numbers on the scale and the B.M.I. chart. 
 Dr. Bacon tells the story of an overweight teenage girl whose high school was going through a ''wellness campaign.'' Hallways were plastered with posters saying ''Prevent teenage obesity.'' After the posters went up, the girl said, schoolmates began taunting her in the halls, pointing at the obese girl on the posters and saying, ''Look at the fat chick.''
 She said heavier students were now made to feel guilty about their lunch choices, but the thin ones could eat anything they wanted without comment -- even if it was exactly what the fat kids were eating. 
 ''Stigmatization gives the thinner kids permission to think there's something wrong with the larger kids,'' Dr. Bacon, the nutrition researcher, said. ''And it doesn't help them look at their own health habits. There's got to be a way to do this more respectfully and more effectively.''

HEADLINE: Immigration Offer Draws Few Haitians

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
Within days of the devastating earthquake in Haiti on Jan. 12, the United States government declared that Haitians living illegally in the United States were eligible for temporary protected status, a special immigration designation that temporarily allows them to work here legally. 
 While advocates and government officials alike said that this was one of the most effective ways to get help to needy quake victims, the number of applicants has fallen short of expectations. 
 Two months after the earthquake, and a third of the way to the July deadline to file for the special status, just 34,427 of the estimated 100,000 to 200,000 undocumented Haitians who were in the United States before Jan. 12 have applied, said the Department of Homeland Security. The protected status allows 18 months of legally working. 
 Charitable groups blame the lag on the application fees, which total about $500. The average monthly amount that Haitians abroad send to relatives in Haiti -- a pillar of the country's economy -- is just $150, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. On Monday, a broad coalition of charities called on the government to make it easier for applicants to have the fee waived. 
 Haitians who are granted the special immigration designation could add as much as $1 billion to the Haitian economy over the next three years, Hunton & Williams, a law firm for Catholic Charities Immigration Legal Services, wrote in a letter backed by the Episcopal bishop of Haiti and 49 American charity groups. The letter was sent to Congress and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the program.
 Applicants for the special status are usually working class and, because they are working illegally, may not be receiving fair wages, said Debi Sanders, a government liaison for Catholic Charities Immigration Legal Services. And the cost is not the only obstacle: To get the fee waived, applicants must supply extensive financial information, a challenge for workers who have ''gone out of their way not to have anything on paper,'' she said. 
 Ms. Sanders said the charities were optimistic that the government would adopt their suggestion to make the fee waiver process simpler, because department officials have told advocates privately that they want to see more applications. Just 1,657 people have applied for waivers so far, said Luz Figuereo Irazabal, a spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Services. Only 696 were granted, partly because applicants offered little proof beyond saying, ''I don't have the money.'' She said about 10 percent of the 34, 427 applications had been rejected because of simple mistakes like forgetting to sign a form. Her agency's Web site, uscis.gov, lists common filing mistakes.

HEADLINE: The Rental Car Squeeze

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Tried renting a car lately? In some cases, travelers say, the final bill is double or even triple the amount they thought they had agreed to.
 The charges include roadside assistance or collision insurance packages that some travelers say they do not want or need but are urged to accept at the car rental counter. 
 Some travelers also say rental companies are more aggressive about charging for damage to a rented vehicle, and more lax about making sure there is no damage before the renter drives it off the lot. And consumer advocates argue that some renters are being charged refueling prices that bear no relation to the prices at nearby gas pumps, high drop fees to return the car to a different location and administrative fees for processing toll payments. 
 Auto rental companies maintain that these are individual issues and that customers need to resolve their disputes at the local rental counter. 
 ''We have made a concentrated effort to empower our locations to solve issues themselves,'' said Chris Payne, a spokesman for Thrifty Car Rental, a subsidiary of the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group of Tulsa, Okla.
 The companies also said rental bills could climb because of the excise fees on car rentals imposed by state and local governments. There is no political cost to levying fees on people who are in transit and, said Andrew C. Taylor, the chief executive of Enterprise Holdings, which owns Alamo Rent A Car and National Car Rental as well as Enterprise Rent-A-Car, ''have nothing to do with travel or renting a car.''
 At the same time, the auto rental industry has been buffeted by other forces beyond its control. The weak economy has cut into demand, by as much as 15 percent. High gas prices, the credit squeeze and reduced automaker incentives for car purchases have added to the industry's woes. And rentals of navigation devices, toll passes and satellite radio, which all once helped to bolster the bottom line, have slipped as travelers increasingly carry their own devices.
 ''Everybody in the car rental business is hungry for revenues,'' said James R. Hood, who founded consumeraffairs.com in 1998. 
 Still, the percentage of dissatisfied travelers in 2009 rose to 21 percent in the annual survey of customer car rental experiences by J. D. Power and Associates. That was up slightly from 2007 and 2008, but significantly higher than six years ago when it was 12 percent, said Michael Drago, the firm's research director. Of the customers who said they were dissatisfied last year, 11 percent said they had encountered a significant problem in the rental process, up from 6 percent in 2004. 
 Bob Sullivan, who wrote the book ''Stop Getting Ripped Off,'' said one reason customers might feel dissatisfied was that ''for car rentals, your bargaining power is basically nil.'' Mr. Sullivan, who also fields consumer complaints at redtape.msnbc.com, added, ''It's the only transaction where you don't know what the amount will be when you hand over your credit card.'' 
 Dean Moeller, a phone equipment installer from Oakdale, Minn., said he had unintentionally added daily insurance coverage when he traveled on business to Phoenix in mid-December. Mr. Moeller said he knew he had added $40 to his bill when he upgraded from an economy car. But he was startled, he said, to find an additional charge of $22.99 a day for a collision damage waiver, shifting the liability from the renter to the car rental company if the car is damaged or stolen.
 ''I said I didn't need any because I have car insurance,'' Mr. Moeller said. ''Then, like 90 percent of people, I signed on the dotted line.'' 
 Michael Worley of Westminster, Colo., complained about what he described as the hard sell when he went to rent a car recently, and the counter agent at Thrifty told him that buying insurance was mandatory. When he tried to argue his personal auto insurance covered the rental, ''she demanded that I select an option,'' he said. Then, he said, when he asked her to explain other charges, the agent replied, ''I can explain them after your card is charged.''
 Mr. Worley appealed to thrifty.com and received an apology and Thrifty's promise to reimburse him. 
 Travelers have also complained about another charge, for roadside assistance, sometimes called ''trip saver.'' Hernan Ferro, a senior manager for a technology company in California, travels weekly for business, he said. But when he and his wife, Carrie, went to Park City, Utah, last November, they found $100 added to the four-day auto rental for ''trip saver.'' Mr. Ferro said he already had coverage through his personal car insurance.
 ''As we were heading for our flight home, my wife noticed the extra charge,'' Mr. Ferro said. The company eventually credited them as ''a one-time exception,'' he said.
 Refueling charges also bring complaints, said Mr. Drago of J. D. Power. ''What the companies charge is always higher than what you can find at the pump.''
 Maryland tackled the issue directly when it found that rental agencies were charging as much $13 a gallon when vehicles were returned with less than full tanks. Maryland's attorney general two years ago struck a deal to limit the refueling price to 140 percent of the local prevailing price for full-service fuel.

HEADLINE: Obama's C.D.C. Director, Wielding a Big Broom

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- No federal health agency changed more during the Bush administration than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It got new buildings, new managers and an entirely new operating structure.
 A year into the Obama administration, only the new buildings remain. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the agency's director since June, has quietly scrapped nearly all the administrative changes that the previous director, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, spent much of her six-year tenure conceiving and carrying out. 
 Gone are the nonscientific managers whom Dr. Gerberding sprinkled throughout the agency's top ranks. Gone is a layer of bureaucracy, agency officials said.Gone, too, are the captain's chairs with cup holders from a conference room so fancy that agency managers dubbed it the Crown Room.
 In their place, Dr. Frieden has restored not only much of the agency's previous organizational structure and scientific managers, but also its drab furniture. And he has brought something new: a frenetic sense of urgency. 
 The C.D.C. is considered one of the world's premier public health agencies, responsible for tracking the spread of infectious disease, distributing vaccines and monitoring the causes of sickness and deaths. About three-quarters of its $10 billion annual budget is given out in grants to places like state and local health departments, which collectively lost 16,000 positions last year, according to a recent public health survey, making those grants that much more important. 
 Dr. Frieden, 49, a former New York City health commissioner, marches around the agency's Atlanta campus so rapidly that staffers have to trot to keep up. He uses his BlackBerry constantly, sending a stream of brief e-mail messages that are so cryptic that recipients sometimes ask for translations. ''Kmi,'' for instance, means ''keep me informed.''
 By the end of her tenure, Dr. Gerberding had become so removed from day-to-day management that some top agency officials went weeks without seeing or hearing from her, they said. Dr. Frieden, by contrast, sometimes wanders the agency's hallways and drops in on scientists unannounced to ask about their work, both delighting and terrifying them.
 In an interview last month, in his 12th-floor office, Dr. Frieden said that when he arrived in June, there was near-universal agreement that change was needed, but nobody wanted a repeat of the disruption Dr. Gerberding's years-long reorganization had wrought. 
 ''Faced with that, you pull off the Band-Aid quickly,'' Dr. Frieden said. 
 Within two months, Dr. Frieden eliminated the ''coordinating centers,'' a layer of management Dr. Gerberding had added between the agency's scientists and top leadership. The Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases, with 600 employees, became the Office of Infectious Diseases, with 12. No one was fired; the agency's leadership was simply pared. 
 Now president of Merck Vaccines, Dr. Gerberding said in an e-mailed statement: ''The 9/11 and anthrax attacks, SARS, and other global health threats altered the landscape of public health forever and made it necessary for C.D.C. to work faster and more synergistically to protect health than it had before. That was the intent of the reorganization. I'm sure the new ideas that Dr. Frieden is introducing are motivated by the same intent.''
 Agency employees and former leaders said in interviews that they were thrilled with Dr. Frieden's changes.
 ''I think he's doing a great job,'' said Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan, one of five former C.D.C. directors who had publicly criticized Dr. Gerberding's leadership. ''He is setting priorities and sticking to them.''
 Part of the agency's embrace of Dr. Frieden probably has to do with politics. Despite being in a Republican state, the disease centers' staff, like much of the public health world, is overwhelmingly Democratic, so employees tend to prefer directors appointed by Democratic presidents. Also, Dr. Frieden began his career in 1990 as an officer in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the C.D.C. at New York City's health department, doing the base-level tracking of diseases that is fundamental to the agency. 
 Dr. Frieden said that among his priorities for the agency, the most important are improving its disease tracking and supporting state and local government health offices. 
 ''All of public health starts with more information,'' he said. ''We have to analyze what we have better and disseminate it better.''
 And with the poor economy and mounting deficits straining budgets, Dr. Frieden has been scrutinizing the C.D.C for savings to pay for his priorities. 
 Some agency officials panicked when Dr. Frieden asked each to plan for a 3 percent budget cut. The exercise found few easy cuts and fewer still that could be used to finance other programs.
 ''We have very little flexibility to move money around,'' Dr. Frieden said. 
 Although he now lives in the South, Dr. Frieden is still very much a New Yorker.He returns from visits to New York with bags of bagels. He speaks longingly of New York's neighborhoods, and, in a series of meetings on Feb. 24, repeatedly referred to his experiences as the city's health commissioner.
 One of the lessons from New York, he said, is that many of the programs that have the greatest impact on public health get the least attention. During his eight-year tenure there, for instance, smoking rates among teenagers declined while colon cancer screening efforts climbed, he said. Neither got much publicity, he said, sounding somewhat wounded.
 He promised to continue focusing on basic tasks like getting those people at risk of heart attacks to take aspirin; those with high blood pressure to get treatment; and those who smoke to stop. 
 In New York, Dr. Frieden came under fire for, according to some critics, acting like a nanny and a scold with campaigns to ban trans fats, post calorie counts in chain restaurants, reduce salt in processed food and tax high-calorie sodas. He had a supportive boss in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and a receptive populace in New York, but if he were to try anything similar at the C.D.C., tough Congressional hearings could be in his future because conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill often oppose such measures.
 Dr. Frieden rarely discusses his family publicly, and he dismissed questions about how his wife and two children were coping with the move to Atlanta by saying, ''Moves are always transitions, and they can be difficult.'' Agency officials said that the stream of e-mail messages from him tapers off between 6 and 9 p.m., when he is with family.
 His days are filled with short meetings in which he quickly makes his points and leaves at the appointed times. When the 25 minutes allotted for an interview ended, he got up, shook hands and left.
 ''There's a time to make things happen,'' Dr. Frieden said, ''and if you miss the wave, you're not going get stuff done.''

HEADLINE: Yellen May Prove Less Than Dovish

BYLINE: By MARTIN HUTCHINSON, ROB COX and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
Janet Yellen has a reputation as a monetary dove. After all, she thought deflation a risk when she became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and has suggested inflation may be too low now. But Ms. Yellen displays hints of talons beneath her feathers that could change the way the central bank does business.
 Of the three new possible Fed governors to be proposed by the Obama administration, Ms. Yellen would be most influential in setting monetary policy. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee she consistently voted with the majority, but has hinted recently that she thinks inflation, running below 2 percent, is undesirably low. 
 For those concerned about incipient inflation stemming from the extraordinary influx of money into the economy, all this could be worrying.
 When Ms. Yellen joined the San Francisco Fed in 2004, reported consumer price inflation was 3.3 percent. A third of that, however, was ''owners' equivalent rent,'' an artificial construct imported into the Consumer Price Index in 1980.
 Now, replace the 2.5 percent rise in owners' equivalent rent with 2004's 16.2 percent rise in house prices nationwide, and the actual living cost inflation experienced by Americans comes to a theoretical 7.4 percent, suggesting that deflation was the last thing the Fed should have been worrying about. Of course, the Fed's mandate has been to target consumer price stability, rather than asset price stability.
 But in a November speech, Ms. Yellen said that while using interest rates to fight asset price inflation was ''costly,'' the recent financial crisis had ''prompted many of us to re-examine the widely held view that monetary policy should respond to asset prices only to the extent that they influence the anticipated trajectories of inflation and unemployment.''
 She has said the Fed needs other policy tools for combating bubbles. Ms. Yellen has also said repeatedly that the high inflation of the 1970s was partly the result of monetary policy blunders that should not be repeated.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's views were formed by his work on the Great Depression, when the Fed failed to respond adequately to a collapse in money supply caused by widespread bank failures. He has made it a priority to avoid the mistakes of the 1930s.
 If avoiding 1970s-style inflation -- and this decade's asset bubbles and their associated hidden price rises -- is indeed a priority for Ms. Yellen, her contribution to Fed policy might be less dovelike than the public record would suggest.
 Coal for Gas
 Consol Energy is joining the shale gas party. And its $3.5 billion deal to buy assets from Dominion Resources looks like a bargain. But the investors who knocked Consol's share price are rightly skeptical. By hedging its energy bets, the coal company risks confusing investors and sealing in a conglomerate discount.
 Consol should at least feel happy with its negotiating prowess. True, it has paid slightly more than is typical for proven gas reserves. When Exxon Mobil bought XTO last year, it paid just $2.96 a thousand cubic feet. Consol is paying about 15 percent more. But Dominion's territory on the Marcellus shale is largely virgin land. Consol should be able to triple production over the next five years.
 On a per-acre basis, Consol's deal looks even better. It is paying roughly half the price that Mitsui did for assets from Anadarko Petroleum in February.
 While the price is right, the strategy may not be. Sure, shifting partly from coal to gas makes good sense. Coal stands to be the big loser from actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Gas-powered electricity generators have plenty of spare capacity and spew out much less carbon dioxide than coal stations.
 But investors are better placed to achieve this diversification for themselves. Consol is virtually alone among large coal producers to pursue gas. The result is a punishing discount to peers. Its gas assets are valued on the market at $2.41 a thousand cubic feet, compared with $3 or more for rivals, according to Raymond James. Consol's coal, meanwhile, is trading at 4.4 times 2010 operating cash flow versus 6.5 times for the competition.
 Investors in most industries find it hard to love companies that are neither fish nor fowl. After this deal, 35 percent of Consol's output will be in gas. As the blend grows more evenly weighted, the company risks losing out on even more shareholder value.

HEADLINE: Tight Credit Seen as Corporate Debts Come Due

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
When the Mayans envisioned the world coming to an end in 2012 -- at least in the Hollywood telling -- they didn't count junk bonds among the perils that would lead to worldwide disaster.
 Maybe they should have, because 2012 also is the beginning of a three-year period in which more than $700 billion in risky, high-yield corporate debt begins to come due, an extraordinary surge that some analysts fear could overload the debt markets. 
 With huge bills about to hit corporations and the federal government around the same time, the worry is that some companies will have trouble getting new loans, spurring defaults and a wave of bankruptcies. 
 The United States government alone will need to borrow nearly $2 trillion in 2012, to bridge the projected budget deficit for that year and to refinance existing debt. 
 Indeed, worries about the growth of national, or sovereign, debt prompted Moody's Investors Service to warn on Monday that the United States and other Western nations were moving ''substantially'' closer to losing their top-notch Aaa credit ratings. 
 Sovereign debt aside, the approaching scramble for corporate financing could strain the broader economy as jobs are cut, consumer spending is scaled back and credit is tightened for both consumers and businesses.
 The apocalyptic talk is not limited to perpetual bears and the rest of the doom-and-gloom crowd. 
 Even Moody's, which is known for its sober public statements, is sounding the alarm. 
 ''An avalanche is brewing in 2012 and beyond if companies don't get out in front of this,'' said Kevin Cassidy, a senior credit officer at Moody's.
 Private equity firms and many nonfinancial companies were able to borrow on easy terms until the credit crisis hit in 2007, but not until 2012 does the long-delayed reckoning begin for a series of leveraged buyouts and other deals that preceded the crisis. 
 That is because the record number of bonds and loans that were issued to finance those transactions typically come due in five to seven years, said Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at Standard & Poor's. 
 In addition, she said, many companies whose debt matured in 2009 and 2010 have been able to extend their loans, but the extra breathing room is only adding to the bill for 2012 and after.
 The result is a potential financial doomsday, or what bond analysts call a maturity wall. From $21 billion due this year, junk bonds are set to mature at a rate of $155 billion in 2012, $212 billion in 2013 and $338 billion in 2014. 
 The credit markets have gradually returned to normal since the financial crisis, particularly in recent months, making more loans available to companies and signaling confidence in the pace of economic recovery. But the issue is whether they can absorb the coming surge in demand for credit.
 As was the case with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market three years ago, derivatives played a big role in the explosion of risky corporate debt. In this case the culprit was a financial instrument called a collateralized loan obligation, which helped issuers repackage corporate loans much as subprime mortgages were sliced, diced and then resold to other investors. That made many more risky loans available. 
 ''The question is, 'Should these deals have ever been financed in the first place?' '' asked Anders J. Maxwell, a corporate restructuring specialist at Peter J. Solomon Company in New York. 
 The period from 2012 to 2014 represents payback time for a Who's Who of private equity firms and the now highly leveraged companies they helped buy in the precrisis boom years. 
 The biggest include the hospital owner HCA, which was taken private in 2006 by a group led by Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts for $33 billion, and has $13.3 billion in debt payments coming due between 2012 and 2014. Another buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis, for the giant Texas utility TXU, has $20.9 billion that needs to be refinanced in the same period.
 Realogy, which owns real estate franchises like Century 21 and Coldwell Banker, was taken private by Apollo in the spring of 2007 just as the housing market was beginning to unravel and as the first tremors of the subprime crisis were being felt.
 Realogy was saddled with $8 to $9 of debt for every $1 in earnings, well above the ''$5 to $6 level that is manageable for a company in a highly cyclical industry,'' according to Emile Courtney, a credit analyst with Standard & Poor's. 
 Realogy has survived -- barely. ''The company's cash flow is still below what's needed to cover the interest on its debt,'' Mr. Courtney said. 
 Realogy said it ended 2009 with a substantial cushion on its financial covenants and over $200 million of available cash on its balance sheet. ''The company generated over $340 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 after paying interest on its debt,'' the company said. 
 Not everyone is convinced that 2012 will spell catastrophe for the junk bond market, however.
 Optimists like Martin Fridson, a veteran high-yield strategist, note that investors seeking high yields snapped up speculative-grade bonds last year and early this year, and he suggests that continued demand will allow companies to refinance before their loans come due. 
 ''The companies have nearly two years to push out the 2012 maturity wall,'' he said. ''Of course, the ability to refinance will depend upon the state of the economy.''
 That is still a wild card, but even if the economy improves, companies with a lot of debt will be competing with a raft of better-rated borrowers that are expected to seek buyers of their debt at around the same time.
 Chief among those is the best-rated borrower of all: the United States government. The Treasury Department estimates that the federal budget deficit in 2012 will total $974 billion, down from this year's $1.8 trillion, but still huge by historical standards. 
 Most critics of deficit spending have focused on the budget gap alone, but Washington will actually have to borrow $1.8 trillion in 2012, because $859 billion in old bonds will come due and have to be refinanced in addition to the deficit. By 2013 and 2014, $1.4 trillion will have to be raised annually. 
 In the late 1990s, the federal government ran a surplus and actually paid down a small portion of the national debt. But with the huge deficits of the last few years, the national debt has grown to more than $12 trillion.
 Next in line are companies with investment-grade credit ratings. They must refinance $1.2 trillion in loans between 2012 and 2014, including $526 billion in 2012. Finally, there is the looming rollover of commercial mortgage-backed securities, which will double in the next three years, hitting $59.7 billion in 2012.
 Even if most of the debt does get refinanced, companies may have to pay more, if heavy government borrowing causes rates for all borrowers to rise. 
 ''These are huge numbers,'' said Tom Atteberry, who manages $5.6 billion in bonds for First Pacific Advisors, and is particularly alarmed by Washington's borrowing. ''Other players will get crowded out or have to pay significantly more, because the government is borrowing so much.''
 Payback Time: Articles in this series are examining the consequences of, and efforts to deal with, growing public and private debts.

HEADLINE: Moody's Says U.S. Debt Could Test Triple-A Rating

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The gold-plated credit rating of the United States -- an article of faith across America and, indeed, around the world -- may be at risk in coming years as the nation copes with its growing debts. 
 That sobering assessment, issued Monday by Moody's Investors Service, provided a reminder that even Aaa-rated United States Treasury bonds, supposedly the safest of safe investments, could be downgraded one day if Washington failed to manage the federal debt. 
 Moody's said the United States and other major Western nations, particularly Britain, have moved ''substantially'' closer to losing their gilt-edged ratings. The ratings are ''stable,'' but ''their 'distance-to-downgrade' has in all cases substantially diminished,'' the credit ratings agency said. 
 A downgrade would affect more than American pride. The bigger risk would be to the country's ability to keep borrowing money on extremely favorable terms, and therefore to keep spending more money than it takes in from tax revenue.
 A credit rating lets lenders and investors know how likely it is that a borrower can pay back a loan. A sterling rating means there is little for lenders to worry about. A lower one typically results in bond investors demanding higher interest rates on debt. 
 Those higher rates, in turn, add to the country's overall debt burden and can force the government to reduce spending, increase taxes or both. That difficulty has been well-illustrated recently in Greece and Portugal, with strikes and protests as citizens march in the streets to oppose tough austerity measures that directly reduce entitlements and state benefits. 
 ''Growth alone will not resolve an increasingly complicated debt equation,'' Moody's said. ''Preserving debt affordability'' -- the ratio of interest payments to government revenue -- ''at levels consistent with Aaa ratings will invariably require fiscal adjustments of a magnitude that, in some cases, will test social cohesion.'' The United States, Britain, France and Germany have always been rated triple-A by Moody's, with the United States first rated in 1949. 
 Pierre Cailleteau, managing director of sovereign risk at Moody's, stressed that none of their ratings were ''threatened so far.'' 
 But he did differentiate among the top countries, saying that Britain and the United States are in the toughest position. 
 ''The U.K. and the U.S. are more tested than, say, Germany or France,'' Mr. Cailleteau said in an e-mailed response to a question. 
 ''Their rating relies, more than in other countries, on their ability to repair the damage caused by the crisis on public finances,'' he added.
 Without a stronger recovery, governments could encounter serious trouble in phasing out government support for the economy, Arnaud Mares, the main author of the report, said in a statement. That ''could yet make their credit more vulnerable,'' he said. 
 Last May, Moody's cut Japan's Aaa rating to Aa2, as the market grew increasingly uneasy with Japan's debt burden. 
 For now, the United States debt remains affordable, Moody's said, as the ratio of interest payments to revenue fell to 8.7 percent in the current year, after peaking at 10 percent two years ago. If that trend were to reverse, the Moody's analysts said, ''there would at some point be downward pressure on the Aaa rating of the federal government.'' 
 The administration of President Obama estimates that the United States deficit will rise to 10.6 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, the highest since 1946, and federal debt will reach 64 percent of gross domestic product. Government expenditures are expected to rise to a postwar high of 25.4 percent of G.D.P. 
 In Britain, Moody's said, the risk is that the growth outlook proves too optimistic and tax receipts do not match forecasts, as the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown has little room left to maneuver. 
 In that situation, the debt -- which the government already predicts will stabilize at around 90 percent of G.D.P. -- could balloon, undermining the credit rating. 
 In comparison to both Britain and the United States, the report said, households in France and Germany entered the crisis with relatively low indebtedness, and hence the governments have a little more room to maneuver. Yet both countries will find themselves under pressure to maintain financial discipline in the event that growth does not pick up. 
 Mr. Cailleteau at Moody's said that ''discretionary fiscal adjustment'' -- cutting programs or raising taxes -- had become ''the principal means of repairing the damage that the global crisis has inflicted on government balance sheets,'' and it remained to be seen whether governments were capable of carrying out the painful measures necessary. 
 ''Growth will support some governments' adjustment plans more than those of others,'' Mr. Cailleteau said in the report, ''but no government can rely on it.'' 
 There is also a danger that, with governments unwilling or unable to begin withdrawing stimulus, central banks could take the initiative to raise interest rates before the economy is ready, the report found. Such a situation might ''quickly compound an already complicated debt equation, with more abrupt rating consequences a possibility.'' 
 Moody's praised Spain's recent efforts to address its finances, although ''its adjustment process will undoubtedly be drawn out and painful.'' 
 As for the Nordic countries, the agency said the region entered the crisis in relatively good shape, and their credit ratings appeared to be well protected.

HEADLINE: Workers Crushed By Toyota

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
California has been very, very good to Toyota. It is one of the largest markets in the world for the popular Prius hybrid. Nearly 18 percent of all Toyotas sold in the U.S. are sold in California. The state has showered the company with benefits, including large-scale infrastructure improvements for its operations and millions of dollars for worker training. California is one of the key reasons that Toyota is the wealthiest carmaker on the planet. 
 Toyota is paying the state back with the foulest form of ingratitude. 
 The company is planning to shut down the assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., that makes Corollas and the Tacoma compact pickup. The plant closure will throw 4,700 experienced, highly skilled and dedicated employees onto the street during the worst job market since the Depression, and it will jeopardize nearly 20,000 other jobs around the state.
 It is a cold and irresponsible act on Toyota's part, a decision that was not necessary from a business standpoint and that completely disregards the wave of human misery it is setting in motion. 
 The New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. plant (generally referred to as NUMMI) began as a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors in 1984. G.M. abandoned the venture when it collapsed into bankruptcy proceedings last year. Toyota declared that the plant was no longer viable because of the absence of G.M. and announced that it would close at the end of this month. 
 What has not been made clear to the public is that for many years the plant has been used primarily to produce vehicles for Toyota, not General Motors. A report prepared for a state commission that has been seeking to avert the plant closure noted that ''G.M. accounted for only 10 percent of the plant's production last year and an average of 15.4 percent between 2001 and 2009.''
 In fact, from Jan. 1 to Feb. 27 this year, with G.M. gone, Toyota produced 61,000 sparkling new vehicles at the plant. That was more than double the 27,000 that were produced in the same period in 2009, when G.M. was part of the operation.
 The report, written by Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that ''Toyota could easily fill its production lines at NUMMI by building a higher percentage of the Corollas it sells in the U.S.,'' or by adding a new model to the plant -- a hybrid, for example.
 What we're dealing with here is the kind of corporate treachery toward workers and their local communities that has ruined countless lives over the past several decades and completely undermined the long-term prospects of the economy. 
 The NUMMI plant is a heck of a lot more viable than the nonstop dissembling of top Toyota executives. The company could keep the plant open and profitable if it wanted to. But, instead, it has decided to shift the production of these vehicles to Japan, Canada, Mexico and Texas.
 The scale of the ingratitude is breathtaking. The U.S. is the largest market for Toyota vehicles in the world, larger even than Japan. The Corolla, one of the vehicles produced at NUMMI, is the best-selling car of all time.
 Beyond sales, Toyota has reaped endless benefits not just from California, but from the U.S. government and other states as well. 
 The federal cash-for-clunkers program, for example, was a bonanza for Toyota. As Professor Shaiken's report put it: ''The automaker ranked first in 'Cash for Clunkers' sales in summer 2009, a stimulus effort that allocated $3 billion in incentives to trade in older models for newer, more fuel-efficient ones. The Corolla proved the most popular model.''
 Among the infrastructure investments made by California on behalf of the NUMMI plant was the dredging of the Port of Oakland 12 years ago at a cost of $410 million. That was done to accommodate the types of cargo ships required by the plant.
 It will be a crushing economic blow if Toyota, as planned, high-tails it out of Fremont. Like the rest of the nation, California is struggling with the worst employment crisis since the 1930s. The NUMMI plant closure would be the single biggest layoff in the state since the start of the Great Recession in December 2007. 
 Those who are trumpeting the alleged fact that the recession is over should consider that the unemployment rate in California in January (the last month for which complete statistics are available) was a mind-numbing 12.5 percent. That was the fifth worst in the nation. In eight California counties, the jobless rate -- not the underemployment rate, mind you, but the official jobless rate -- was higher than 20 percent. Those counties are suffering through a depression.
 The human toll behind such data is of no apparent interest to the fabulously wealthy Toyota operation.

HEADLINE: The Health Care Letdown

BYLINE: By WILLIAM F. PEWEN. 
William F. Pewen is a former senior health policy adviser for Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 WHILE Democrats may yet enact health care reform via a convoluted process that involves passing three separate bills, many people may wonder, ''What happened to the postpartisan era?'' Both President Obama's 11th-hour meeting with Republicans and the Republican leaders' demands to ''start over'' are recognized by Americans for what they are -- political talk substituting for bipartisan legislation. 
 As health policy adviser for Senator Olympia Snowe, the Maine Republican, while Congress considered this most critical and complicated issue, I saw firsthand how a failure to recognize the magnitude of the task, and a toxic political environment, undermined the effort to achieve reform. 
 Republicans rightly note that their role was minimized in four of the five Congressional committees charged with drafting the legislation. Yet many Republicans had decided even before Inauguration Day to block reform, including policies that their party had previously supported. In 2003, for example, Republicans enacted legislation that financed end-of-life counseling -- yet in town halls last August they claimed a similar measure would create ''death panels.'' 
 Republican cries for fiscal responsibility also ring hollow when you consider the party's record of establishing higher-cost private Medicare plans and enacting a drug benefit that wasn't paid for. The fact is that under the Republicans' watch, critical problems of escalating health costs and access to affordable coverage were largely ignored. 
 Yet Democratic leadership worsened the erosion of bipartisanship. With dissonant voices excluded, too many Democrats failed to recognize that most Americans, who already have health insurance, wanted the assurance of continued, affordable coverage. Health security, especially in a severe recession, should have been the central concern. 
 The Senate Finance Committee sought to address that concern by drafting legislation to reform health insurance, provide subsidies to those who cannot afford coverage and achieve better value for America's health care dollar. Some faulted this committee's so-called Gang of Six -- the chairman, Max Baucus of Montana; two other Democrats; and three Republicans (including Senator Snowe) -- for drafting its bill in a prolonged series of closed-door meetings. Yet I witnessed that group make steady progress, and maintain a level of collegiality. The senators were free to discuss options outside the spotlight of the news media. Each party could counter the excesses of the other -- a balance that disappeared when Democrats later merged legislation from the two Senate committees into a single bill. 
 In that merging, the focus shifted to a one-sided political calculus, and away from critical questions like just how much it would cost Americans to carry the minimum amount of insurance coverage required under the emerging bill. Rather than address such concerns, the Democratic leadership, in the interest of political expediency, expanded the scope of the legislation, adding more regulation, spending and taxes. Soon health care reform, which had been achievable, became endangered. 
 At the same time, Democrats trying to lead health care legislation through Congress made a multitude of missteps. One of these was to fixate for months on the ''public option,'' only to wholly discard it. Yet Senator Snowe had long offered the option of a ''fallback'' public plan. This would have allowed insurance market reforms to work, but would have applied the threat of intervention by a public plan to ensure that private health plans actually performed. The Congressional Budget Office confirmed that such a strategy would have pressured private insurance plans to reduce costs. 
 No less embarrassing was the way the majority leadership killed a bipartisan amendment to establish an F.D.A.-regulated system for importing prescription drugs. Safe importation would have produced nearly $100 billion in savings, $19.4 billion of which would have been realized by the federal government. But the amendment conflicted with the deal Democrats had made with the pharmaceutical industry. 
 Ultimately, Democrats decided to pass their bill with no Republican support, sacrificing bipartisanship and empowering every Democratic senator to seek inappropriate concessions. I was frustrated because I knew that last-minute deals couldn't result in a bill that would be correctly drafted, with all its costs clearly delineated, and properly considered by the Senate. The Democratic leadership insisted that a vote must be taken, that debate simply couldn't continue into January. So midnight votes commenced on legislation that few senators had read and fewer understood. Just pass it, Democrats said, and we'll fix it later. 
 Should they succeed in blocking reform, Republicans should take no consolation. When Congress next attempts reform, in a decade or more, health costs and the number of uninsured and underinsured will have escalated -- and the likely outcome will be the single-payer system that Republicans most abhor. 
 Three in four Americans say the health care system needs to be overhauled, and many provisions in the pending legislation have strong support. What's more, the core of the Senate's legislation closely resembles the very bill the Republicans offered in 1993 as an alternative to the Clinton plan. This makes clear that bipartisan reform was achievable, and indicts Congress for its failure to realize that goal with broad public support.

HEADLINE: Reform Bill Adds Layers Of Oversight

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Cyrus Sanati contributed reporting from New York, and Edward Wyatt from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The 1,336-page bill to overhaul financial regulation that Senate Democrats put forward on Monday with the backing of the Obama administration calls for Washington to play a more active role in policing Wall Street. 
 The plan would create a nine-member council, led by the Treasury secretary, to watch for systemic risks, and direct the Federal Reserve to supervise the nation's largest and most interconnected financial institutions, not just banks. 
 But the bill, which would amount to the most sweeping change in financial rules since the Depression, would preserve much of the existing regulatory architecture, which has been criticized for being too fragmented. And it would rely on a new mechanism for seizing and liquidating a huge financial company on the verge of failure, one that would diminish, but not eliminate, the likelihood of future bailouts.
 The proposal, which was put forward by Christopher J. Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, included significant concessions to Republicans, compared with an initial draft Mr. Dodd released in November. It also contained provisions urged by President Obama to restrict banks' ability to engage in certain forms of speculative trading.
 ''This proposal provides a strong foundation to build a safer financial system,'' Mr. Obama said, adding, ''As the bill moves forward, I will take every opportunity to work with Chairman Dodd and his colleagues to strengthen the bill, and will fight against efforts to weaken it.''
 Senate Republicans were muted in their response, saying they would introduce amendments to press their case on areas of disagreement, including the powers of a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that would set up inside the Fed. 
 But whether the legislation could pass in an election year, with a rancorous debate on health care looming over the Capitol, remained uncertain. Assuming all Democrats and independents in the Senate voted for it, at least one Republican would have to back it as well to avoid a filibuster. 
 ''The stakes are far too high, and the American people have suffered far too greatly, for us to fail in this effort,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''This legislation will not stop the next crisis from coming. No legislation can, of course. But by creating a 21st-century regulatory structure for our 21st-century economy, we can equip coming generations with the tools to deal with that crisis and to avoid the kind of suffering we have seen in this country.''
 Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the Banking Committee, warned against trying to rush the bill through committee next week, as Mr. Dodd has said he intends to do. ''Given the magnitude, complexity and importance of this task, it is critical that we have sufficient time for a thorough review,'' he said. 
 Any Senate bill would have to be reconciled with the House's version. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said, ''There are some differences between the House-passed bill and Senator Dodd's version, but they are more alike than they are different.''
 A nine-member Financial Stability Oversight Council would subject to Fed oversight any nonbank financial companies that ''pose risks to the financial stability of the United States in the event of their material financial distress or failure.'' 
 The council would also direct regulators to raise capital requirements. It would rely on the work of a new Office of Financial Research, within the Treasury, to serve as an early warning system for systemic risk.
 Just as the central bank's creation in 1913 was partly a response to the Panic of 1907, the bill specifies that the Fed ''shall identify, measure, monitor and mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States.''
 The Fed would have two vice chairmen, one of them dedicated to supervision. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who is now chosen by the bank's board and serves as the central bank's eyes and ears on Wall Street, would be appointed by the president of the United States for a five-year term. Banks regulated by the Fed could no longer have their executives sit on the boards of the Fed's 12 district banks or help select the district banks' presidents. 
 The Fed would continue to supervise bank holding companies with assets of at least $50 billion; there are about 35, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. 
 Smaller bank holding companies would be supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees national banks. The Fed's state-chartered member banks would be supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 Mr. Dodd had initially proposed stripping the Fed of all bank supervision duties. Though he has backed away from that stance, Richard Spillenkothen, former director of banking supervision and regulation at the Fed, said the removal of more than 5,800 smaller and midsize banks from the Fed's purview would be a mistake.
 ''A central bank benefits from knowing what sort of credit issues and pressures are building up in banks of all sizes,'' he said.
 The new consumer bureau would write rules banning abusive and unfair terms for mortgages and other financial products. Its director, appointed by the president for a five-year term, would set its budget, and the Fed would pay for it. 
 In a concession to Republicans, a consumer rule could be set aside if the council decided, by a two-thirds vote, that it put the banking system's safety and stability at risk. 
 The bill would also create a $50 billion fund, paid for by the largest financial companies, for the orderly liquidation of a company that is collapsing and whose failure would have ''serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States.'' 
 The provision for orderly liquidation would be invoked only as a last resort, if a company's financial ties were too complex to be resolved through normal bankruptcy proceedings. 
 Such a liquidation would require approval of the Treasury secretary and a two-thirds vote of the boards of both the Fed and the F.D.I.C.

HEADLINE: As Medicaid Payments Shrink, Patients and Doctors Drop Out

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
FLINT, Mich. -- Carol Y. Vliet's cancer returned with a fury last summer, the tumors metastasizing to her brain, liver, kidneys and throat.
 As she began a punishing regimen of chemotherapy and radiation, Mrs. Vliet found a measure of comfort in her monthly appointments with her primary care physician, Dr. Saed J. Sahouri, who had been monitoring her health for nearly two years.
 She was devastated, therefore, when Dr. Sahouri informed her a few months later that he could no longer see her because, like a growing number of doctors, he had stopped taking patients with Medicaid.
 Dr. Sahouri said that his reimbursements from Medicaid were so low -- often no more than $25 per office visit -- that he was losing money every time a patient walked in his exam room. 
 The final insult, he said, came when Michigan cut those payments by 8 percent last year to help close a gaping budget shortfall. 
 ''My office manager was telling me to do this for a long time, and I resisted,'' Dr. Sahouri said. ''But after a while you realize that we're really losing money on seeing those patients, not even breaking even. We were starting to lose more and more money, month after month.'' 
 It has not taken long for communities like Flint to feel the downstream effects of a nationwide torrent of state cuts to Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor and disabled. With states squeezing payments to providers even as the economy fuels explosive growth in enrollment, patients are finding it increasingly difficult to locate doctors and dentists who will accept their coverage. Inevitably, many defer care or wind up in hospital emergency rooms, which are required to take anyone in an urgent condition.
 Mrs. Vliet, 53, who lives just outside Flint, has yet to find a replacement for Dr. Sahouri. ''When you build a relationship, you want to stay with that doctor,'' she said recently, her face gaunt from disease, and her head wrapped in a floral bandanna. ''You don't want to go from doctor to doctor to doctor and have strangers looking at you that don't have a clue who you are.'' 
 The inadequacy of Medicaid payments is severe enough that it has become a rare point of agreement in the health care debate between President Obama and Congressional Republicans. In a letter to Congress after their February health care meeting, Mr. Obama wrote that rates might need to rise if Democrats achieved their goal of extending Medicaid eligibility to 15 million uninsured Americans.
 In 2008, Medicaid reimbursements averaged only 72 percent of the rates paid by Medicare, which are themselves typically well below those of commercial insurers, according to the Urban Institute, a research group. At 63 percent, Michigan had the sixth-lowest rate in the country, even before the recent cuts. 
 In Flint, Dr. Nita M. Kulkarni, an obstetrician, receives $29.42 from Medicaid for a visit that would bill $69.63 from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. She receives $842.16 from Medicaid for a Caesarean delivery, compared with $1,393.31 from Blue Cross.
 If she takes too many Medicaid patients, she said, she cannot afford overhead expenses like staff salaries, the office mortgage and malpractice insurance that will run $42,800 this year. She also said she feared being sued by Medicaid patients because they might be at higher risk for problem pregnancies, because of underlying health problems.
 As a result, she takes new Medicaid patients only if they are relatives or friends of existing patients. But her guilt is assuaged somewhat, she said, because her husband, who is also her office mate, Dr. Bobby B. Mukkamala, an ear, nose and throat specialist, is able to take Medicaid. She said he is able to do so because only a modest share of his patients have it.
 The states and the federal government share the cost of Medicaid, which saw a record enrollment increase of 3.3 million people last year. The program now benefits 47 million people, primarily children, pregnant women, disabled adults and nursing home residents. It falls to the states to control spending by setting limits on eligibility, benefits and provider payments within broad federal guidelines. 
 Michigan, like many other states, did just that last year, packaging the 8 percent reimbursement cut with the elimination of dental, vision, podiatry, hearing and chiropractic services for adults. 
 When Randy C. Smith showed up recently at a Hamilton Community Health Network clinic near Flint, complaining of a throbbing molar, Dr. Miriam L. Parker had to inform him that Medicaid no longer covered the root canal and crown he needed.
 A landscaper who has been without work for 15 months, Mr. Smith, 46, said he could not afford the $2,000 cost. ''I guess I'll just take Tylenol or Motrin,'' he said before leaving. 
 This year, Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, has revived a proposal to impose a 3 percent tax on physician revenues. Without the tax, she has warned, the state may have to reduce payments to health care providers by 11 percent. 
 In Flint, the birthplace of General Motors, the collapse of automobile manufacturing has melded with the recession to drive unemployment to a staggering 27 percent. About one in four non-elderly residents of Genesee County are uninsured, and one in five depends on Medicaid. The county's Medicaid rolls have grown by 37 percent since 2001, and the program now pays for half of all childbirths.
 But surveys show the share of doctors accepting new Medicaid patients is declining. Waits for an appointment at the city's federally subsidized health clinic, where most patients have Medicaid, have lengthened to four months from six weeks in 2008. Parents like Rebecca and Jeoffrey Curtis, who had brought their 2-year-old son, Brian, to the clinic, say they have struggled to find a pediatrician.
 ''I called four or five doctors and asked if they accepted our Medicaid plan,'' said Ms. Curtis, a 21-year-old waitress. ''It would always be, 'No, I'm sorry.' It kind of makes us feel like second-class citizens.''
 As physicians limit their Medicaid practices, emergency rooms are seeing more patients who do not need acute care.
 At Genesys Regional Medical Center, one of three area hospitals, Medicaid volume is up 14 percent over last year. At Hurley Medical Center, the city's safety net hospital, Dr. Michael Jaggi detects the difference when advising emergency room patients to seek follow-up treatment. 
 ''We get met with the blank stare of 'Where do I go from here?' '' said Dr. Jaggi, the chief of emergency medicine.
 New doctors, with their mountains of medical school debt, are fleeing the state because of payment cuts and proposed taxes. Dr. Kiet A. Doan, a surgeon in Flint, said that of 72 residents he had trained at local hospitals only two had stayed in the area, and both are natives. 
 Access to care can be even more challenging in remote parts of the state. The MidMichigan Medical Center in Clare, about 90 miles northwest of Flint, closed its obstetrics unit last year because Medicaid reimbursements covered only 65 percent of actual costs. Two other hospitals in the region might follow suit, potentially leaving 16 contiguous counties without obstetrics. 
 Medicaid enrollees in Michigan's midsection have grown accustomed to long journeys for care. This month, Shannon M. Brown of Winn skipped work to drive her 8-year-old son more than two hours for a five-minute consultation with Dr. Mukkamala. Her pediatrician could not find a specialist any closer who would take Medicaid, she said. 
 Later this month, she will take the predawn drive again so Dr. Mukkamala can remove her son's tonsils and adenoids. ''He's going to have to sit in the car for three hours after his surgery,'' Mrs. Brown said. ''I'm not looking forward to that one.''

 CORRECTION:
A headline on Tuesday about state cuts in funding for Medicaid referred imprecisely in some editions to the response of patients whose doctors have dropped out of the program and no longer treat them. While some patients have chosen to forgo health care, they have not themselves dropped out of the Medicaid program.

HEADLINE: The Envelope, Please: Six Applicants for the Class of 2014 Tell Their Own Stories

BYLINE: JACQUES STEINBERG


HIGHLIGHT: In words and in video, six high school seniors from across the country will blog about the end game of this year&#8217;s college admissions process. 

 BODY:
Much of the anxiety of waiting by the mailbox to retrieve decision letters from the nation's most selective colleges has - like so much of the admissions process - gone digital in recent years. Whether an envelope is considered fat or thin is more likely measured in bytes. And yet, the day that decisions are formally released by many of the most competitive institutions, whether by e-mail or United States mail, remains as it always has: April 1. 
In the run-up to that deadline, The Choice, is introducing a new season of "The Envelope, Please," an occasional online series. Over the next two months, six high school seniors from across the country will share - in print and in video - as they receive word on whether they have been accepted, rejected or placed on the waiting list at their first-choice colleges.
The students will also provide details on the financial aid offers they are weighing, in a year of economic turbulence for families as well as for colleges. (For example, Dartmouth and Williams are among the institutions that have responded to diminished endowments by recently rescinding policies that had promised eligible students aid packages with no loans.)
One of the two students being introduced today is Anne Paik, a senior at Immaculate Heart High Schoolin Los Angeles who has applied to a dozen colleges, including the University of California, Los Angeles; Columbia; Amherst; and Pitzer. She writes: "Simply put, if I can't afford the price tag of my dream school, I can't go."
The other student blogger featured today is Brett Ferdinand, who attends Cedar Park High School, a public school outside Austin, Tex. Brett writes of missing a critical application deadline - at the University of Texas at Austin, which he had considered his "safety school" - raising the stakes for the decision letters he will soon receive from Rice, the University of Virginia and Duke, among other universities.
In the coming days, readers will also meet three other seniors at public high schools: Erik Bates of Forest Hills Eastern High in Ada, Mich.; Omosefe Aiyevbomwan of Stuyvesant High School in New York City; and Brian C. Bose of Chatsworth High School in Los Angeles. A sixth, Michael Greshko, attends Providence Day, a private school in Charlotte, N.C.
In many instances, their decisions, and how they respond to them, will unfold for readers in real time. And later in the spring, the "Today" show on NBC expects to feature some of them in a segment. We'll provide more details on The Choice as that date draws near.

HEADLINE: Statements By an Artist, For the Palms Of Strangers

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
For more than 30 years now, sharp-eyed New Yorkers have been finding them on ledges, windowsills and store counters -- poker-chip-size coins that reveal themselves to be something far more mysterious than loose change.
 The inch-wide ceramic discs, painted in iridescent colors, have the rough, weathered feel of ancient treasure. Each is embossed with a short, cryptic message, a year and two humble letters: ''bw.'' 
 Those, it turns out, are the initials of Beriah Wall, a Brooklyn artist who estimates he has knocked out hundreds of thousands of these handmade tokens since the late 1970s, quietly dropping them in public places or the hands of bewildered strangers. His latest batch, minted over the last few months, carry the message ''Stuck in Brkln.''
 They are anything but. Mr. Wall, 63, said his homemade currency had shown up all over the world. He has passed many of the pieces to friends and relatives, who have scattered them from California to Africa and from the Caribbean to Tibet. 
 In the realm of the coin, Mr. Wall is a sovereign, producing anonymous art that is encountered in random, intimate moments. The phrases he stamps on the front and back include wordplay like Flee/Flea and Real/Good and political statements like Bush/Gush and Palestine/Israel. 
 ''My work has been in millions of hands,'' he said. ''It's a little free object that sort of floats around. It's about small endeavors, the edge of meaning or significance. If you'd like some to take wherever, I got a carload for you.''
 Mr. Wall was a potter in Vermont when he conceived the idea of giving away small chunks of ceramics. He was manning the parking lot at a crafts fair, charging $2 per car. The fee did not go over well with customers, who wondered why they had to pay anything to park in a field.
 ''I sliced out little pieces of clay squares and gave them to people,'' he said. ''And they all liked it. They smiled. It was immediate. So, bada-bing, I ran with it.''
 The coins started coming soon after he married his wife, Janice, in 1977. (The ceramic hearts that announced their wedding lasted longer than the union.) They moved to New York and settled into a loft on Franklin Street -- and no, he did not name the place the Franklin Mint. As he pursued his dream of becoming an artist, painting oils and creating large sculptures, he found that the coins set him apart.
 ''Back then people were doing big stuff on a grand scale,'' he said. ''The only way to compete was to go the other way. Think of the intimacy. You can go to a gallery to look at a piece of art. Here, you have a little gallery in your palm.''
 He tosses away most of the coins, simply dropping them along the way wherever his day takes him. His gifts to strangers almost always elicit a smile. 
 Peter Frank, a critic for The Huffington Post who first came across Mr. Wall's handiwork in TriBeCa in the 1970s, said the coins were more than lighthearted knickknacks.
 ''They upend your expectations, with an aspect of positive subversion,'' said Mr. Frank, who is also the senior curator at the Riverside Art Museum in California. ''That's my favorite kind of art. They do not redefine art. They redefine life. They don't make you think about ceramics in a new way. They make you think about coins in new ways.''
 They have not, however, put any real money into Mr. Wall's bank account. To finance his art, he has worked as a plasterer, doing high-end work in Manhattan and on Long Island. His walls have washes of color -- some bold, others faded. The inspiration for the look came to him by accident, when some pigment fell into a bucket of plaster.
 ''You have a wall, you have color, so why not do color on the wall?'' he said. ''It was a good way to get fired.''
 But slowly the style caught on, as clients looking for something different were referred to him. Some of the apartments Mr. Wall plastered are now featured in shelter magazines, where the walls look like minimalist paintings.
 ''Is it art?'' he asked. ''What else would it be? Art is to make, and I like to make. To step back from a glistening, fresh wall is satisfaction. Why argue?''
 Now semiretired from plastering, Mr. Wall continues to strike his coins -- he can make 2,000 in a week -- in the basement studio of his Red Hook home. Little clay blanks rest in a bucket on the table, where a plank is splattered with green and yellow streaks of paint. A kiln that looks like a coffee maker on steroids is off to the side. When he has something new to say, he carves his message into a cup-shaped plaster mold, then stamps each clay disc by hand. 
 Upstairs, coins are piled into buckets and bowls, all the easier to grab on the way out the door. Words peek out from the pile: Bling, Made, Good, Real, Pro, To Have, To Hold. Somehow, he said, they add up to one big statement.
 ''In the long run, there is a kind of unity,'' he said. ''It's like the blind man touching the elephant. I've touched the elephant in a lot of places. I'm just not sure what it looks like yet.''
 The big phrase last year was a nod to the economy: Income/Outcome. This year he has been playing with Stuck in/Brkln.
 ''I had an uncle who said there were two things he never wanted -- to be a banker and to live in Brooklyn,'' Mr. Wall explained. ''He ended up doing both. I came to New York with stars in my eyes thinking I'd hit it big, and here I am, stuck in Brooklyn.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: The ceramic tokens Beriah Wall makes in the basement studio of his Brooklyn home are stamped with his initials, a year (usually the one in which the token was made) and a phrase of his choosing. Mr. Wall began making them after announcing his 1977 marriage with similarly fashioned hearts. The paired photos show both sides of his works. (PHOTOGRAPH BY LIBRADO ROMERO/THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: Phoenix Meets the Wrong End of the Boom Cycle

BYLINE: By JOHN COLLINS RUDOLF

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Perhaps it was just a matter of time, but three years after this city's housing market collapsed in spectacular fashion, commercial real estate has followed it off the cliff. 
 The average price paid for office space in the Phoenix metro area tumbled more than 50 percent last year, from $205 a square foot in 2008 to $102 a square foot in 2009, according to data compiled by Kammrath & Associates, a local real estate analysis firm. Retail and industrial space underwent similar declines. 
 ''Prices are falling like a stone,'' said Bob Kammrath, who has studied the commercial market in Phoenix since 1981. ''I see them going lower.''
 The recession has been the main instigator of the crash, but overbuilding and speculation set the stage. In a mirror image of the housing bubble, relaxed lending standards and a boom mentality prompted the construction of hundreds of offices, shopping centers, industrial buildings, hotels and apartments from 2005 to 2009 -- about 86.5 million square feet of new commercial space in all, according to research by CB Richard Ellis. 
 In 2006, when growth peaked, about 30 percent of the Phoenix area's economic output was tied to real estate and construction. So it was not long after the once white-hot housing market fell apart, in 2007, that the rest of the city's economy stumbled, and hard. As jobs in construction and real estate dried up, and stock market losses curbed the relocation of retirees from the north, in-migration to the city radically slowed.
 Commercial brokers blame a confluence of factors for the worst downturn in memory: rampant overbuilding, a national economic crisis, spiking unemployment and a near halt in population growth. The result is visible all over the city in the form of empty storefronts and ''for lease'' signs affixed to office buildings.
 The worst-off of these projects were built in marginal locations on the outskirts of the metropolitan area, and stand completely empty months and even years after completion. 
 ''We've got some see-through shopping centers,'' said David Wetta, senior vice president and managing director in the Phoenix office of the real estate brokerage Marcus & Millichap. 
 A handful of major developments throughout the metro area simply collapsed midconstruction and linger, half-built, as gloomy reminders of the sudden end of good times. 
 One such failure, the Hotel Monroe, sits in the heart of downtown Phoenix, just a few blocks from City Hall. Started in 2006, its plans were extravagant even by the bloated standards of the bubble era. The 144-room boutique hotel was to be housed in a rehabilitated 12-story Art Deco office building from the 1930s and would include opulent ''Rock Star'' suites, a five-star restaurant, a rooftop nightclub and 24-hour room service.
 Construction began in 2007 but ground to a halt a year later when the project's banker, Mortgages Ltd. -- for a short time, Arizona's largest private lender -- cut off financing, en route to its own bankruptcy. The hotel remains unfinished, with dark windows and a desolate mien; Grace Communities, its developer, was recently cited by the City of Phoenix for code violations including graffiti on exterior walls and trash and debris around the premises. 
 When or how the hotel will be finished is uncertain, as the building is in foreclosure and headed to a trustee's sale in April. There, 13 investors will try to recoup $76.5 million in loans, though experts say the building is unlikely to fetch anywhere near that amount.
 Yet it is not just new commercial developments that are foundering. Older properties -- in particular, those that sold at big premiums during the market run-up -- are also struggling with rising vacancy rates, shrinking rent rolls and high debt loads. 
 A prime example is the Viad Corporate Center, a 24-story, 478,000-square-foot high-rise in midtown Phoenix, which was built in 1991 and bought for an estimated $105 million in 2006. Earlier this month, Bank of America filed a motion in court to appoint a receiver for the property, citing the failure of the building's owner to stay current on a $65 million loan.
 Bank of America's move to foreclose on the tower is one prominent sign that lenders are losing patience with large commercial borrowers and are stepping up efforts to resolve problem loans behind big properties. Commercial mortgages in Phoenix are souring at their highest rate in years: according to Foresight Analytics, a banking analysis firm, 5.3 percent of commercial mortgages in the metro area were delinquent in the fourth quarter of 2009, up from 2.3 percent at the same period in 2008. 
 Yet even as delinquencies climb, some analysts say lenders have not been aggressive enough in writing down loans and repossessing and disposing of properties -- often a painful process for both banks and borrowers.
 ''There's more to go, just to get caught up with the current volume of defaulted loans,'' said Matt Anderson, an analyst with Foresight Analytics.
 High unemployment (over 9 percent here in February), combined with continued weakness in housing and sluggish consumer spending, will most likely prolong the pain in Phoenix's commercial market. Since the recession began nearly two years ago, many business owners here have dipped into savings and lines of credit in an effort to stay afloat. As these resources run out, more tenants are closing up shop.
 Already, vacancies are at troubling levels: according to CB Richard Ellis, 25.4 percent of office space in the Phoenix metro area is unoccupied. Retail has also deteriorated: vacancy rates for that sector have risen the last 11 quarters, to 11.4 percent at the end of 2009. These rates may not reflect the full extent of the industry's weakness, however, as some landlords appear disinclined to evict even seriously delinquent tenants because of the difficulty of attracting businesses to replace them. 
 Yet despite the avalanche of negative indicators, some in the public and private sector are keen to point out bright spots for commercial real estate in the Phoenix area. Desirable pockets in affluent cities like Scottsdale have little vacant space available at any price, while areas close to the downtown core and along established urban corridors are weathering the storm fairly well. CityScape, a $900 million commercial development in the heart of downtown Phoenix that includes shops, restaurants and a 27-story office tower, is at least 75 percent leased months ahead of its scheduled opening this summer.
 Billions of dollars in public investment in a light-rail system, and improvements to the Arizona State University campus and the Phoenix Convention Center, should also help commerce. The improvements are already helping downtown Phoenix shake its reputation as a ghost town after dark. 
 There is, too, no shortage of bargain properties to be leased or bought, particularly on the city's outskirts. Some assets are from portfolios of failed banks now held by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and are selling for rock-bottom prices. 
 The mood of commercial real estate professionals is improving, said Kevin Calihan, senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis in Phoenix. ''People are starting to feel the end is in sight,'' he said.
 But others are less optimistic. ''We're in the first or second inning,'' said Mr. Wetta of Marcus & Millichap. ''We haven't seen the worst of it yet.''

HEADLINE: Prompted by Economy, Lawmakers Press China to Address Value of Its Currency

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Members of Congress from both parties sought on Tuesday to put more pressure on China to allow an increase in the value of its currency, saying Beijing's policy of holding the value down to give China an edge in export markets was holding back job creation in the United States. 
 In response to longstanding frustration over the Treasury Department's refusal under successive administrations to cite China formally for manipulating its currency, five senators introduced a bill that would all but compel the administration to act. A manipulation finding could prompt retaliatory efforts by the United States. 
 In addition, 130 House members sent a letter on Monday calling on the Treasury to issue a finding of manipulation and on the Commerce Department to impose countervailing duties to protect American manufacturers.
 The Senate bill would require the Treasury to identify ''fundamentally misaligned currencies'' based on specific criteria. The bill would seek to address one reason that the United States has not cited China for manipulation since 1994, which is that a finding of manipulation requires intent. 
 If the Treasury designated such a misaligned currency ''for priority action,'' that would set off other steps, including an investigation by the Commerce Department that could result in import duties to counter the effects of foreign export subsidies. 
 ''I believe the Chinese don't believe in free trade,'' one of the five senators, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said. ''I believe they're mercantilist, that they simply want to increase their economic power and will do whatever it takes to do that.'' 
 Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who helped organize the House letter, said the Chinese currency distortion was undoing some of the effects of the stimulus in the United States
 ''To have one country pegging their currency at a certain level instead of letting it float is dishonest,'' he said. ''We need to rectify that. It's putting a lot of Americans out of work.''
 China has built up $2.4 trillion in foreign reserves in part by propping up the value of its currency, the renminbi, which has the effect of subsidizing its exports and making imports more costly. 
 On Sunday, the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, rebuffed calls for China to end its currency policy, saying he did not believe the renminbi was undervalued. 
 In a statement, the Treasury said it was reviewing Mr. Schumer's proposal, and added: ''That said, we too have serious concerns about China's exchange rate policy. The rebound of China's economic growth and exports and their continued large-scale reserve accumulation indicate clearly that China should resume appreciation of the renminbi.'' 
 The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said at a news briefing: ''The president mentioned just a few days ago that he wished and hoped that China approached their currency using a more market-based interpretation.''
 In 2005, Mr. Schumer and a Republican senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, introduced legislation to impose a hefty tariff on Chinese imports. The tariff received broad support in the Senate, but the senators backed down after China took steps to appreciate the renminbi. That gradual appreciation ended in 2008. 
 In Tuesday's effort, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Graham were joined by Senators Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican; Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat; and Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.
 C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said administrations had failed to take action against China for various reasons. The Bush administration was concerned about maintaining a free trade policy, he said, and the Obama administration has been fearful of provoking retaliation from the Chinese, or a trade war. 
 The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, caused a stir last year when he declared that the Chinese manipulated the renminbi. He quickly backed down and, like his predecessor, Henry M. Paulson Jr., has argued that negotiating with China would be more effective than saber-rattling.

HEADLINE: In a Victory for London, Europe Delays Hedge Fund Rules

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- European Union finance ministers delayed a decision on new rules for hedge funds Tuesday in a reprieve for Britain, which fears that onerous regulations could drive the industry from London. 
 The ministers, meeting in Brussels, could take until the summer to reach agreement on the issues, officials said.
 ''We were not the only country with reservations,'' said Alistair Darling, the British finance minister, referring to the ministers' meeting. ''It's sensible to spend a while trying to see if we can get consensus.''
 Earlier this month, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, warned that the proposed rules could discriminate against funds in the United States, raising the specter of trade friction.
 The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive would have required funds based outside the 27-member European Union to ask permission from individual European countries to market themselves to investors rather than being able to treat the bloc as a single market.
 The rules also would require hedge funds, private equity groups and others to register and disclose trading information to supervisors.
 Regulators and lawmakers worldwide are tightening their scrutiny of hedge funds and private equity firms on the grounds that they may have been partly to blame for the worst financial crisis in a generation. Many in Europe also see the industry as too opaque and secretive.
 Michel Barnier, the European Union commissioner for financial affairs, who is leading the overhaul, sought to keep pressure on European leaders to pass regulations, saying he would not bow to pressure from the United States to back away from the issue. ''I am not amenable at all to pressure from wherever it comes,'' Mr. Barnier said.
 Regulators in Brussels did not take instructions from any European capital and ''certainly not from Washington,'' he added.
 Britain, however, has led a fight against elements of the proposed directive, fearing that the rules threaten the position of the City of London as a global financial hub while doing little to protect the financial system.
 About 70 percent of hedge funds operating in Europe are based in Britain, and London is a base for the managers of many non-European Union funds.

HEADLINE: Time for Change in the Postal Service?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Saving the Post Office'' (editorial, March 10):
 No business ever bounced back to health by rushing to offer slower service and turning customers away. Yet that's the advice you give to Congress for saving the United States Postal Service.
 Eliminating Saturday delivery would send the wrong message to both citizens and businesses, that this public service is about to get a lot worse. That alone could push away many mailers, including movie and video game distributors, prescription drug companies and magazines. 
 We agree that the Postal Service needs more flexibility to provide new services and win new revenues. But the single most important step Congress could take immediately is to reform the mandate to prefund future retiree health care obligations. An inspector general's report in January showed that the Postal Service could fully fund those obligations for the long term if it could tap its $65 billion surplus in the Civil Service retirement fund.
 The Postal Service has adapted remarkably well during this economic crisis. If not for the advance payments for retiree health insurance, mandated by Congress just before the recession hit, the Postal Service would have made money over the last three years.
 The worst thing Congress could do is allow it to drop Saturday delivery instead of fixing the prefunding problem. That course would damage the long-term prospects for the Postal Service and destroy another 50,000 good jobs, just when officials are scrambling to create more.
 Fredric V. Rolando President, National Association of Letter Carriers Washington, March 11, 2010
 To the Editor:
 So the Postal Service is losing money in the Internet age. No surprise there; nowadays most important or time-sensitive documents are transmitted electronically. Paper copies are sent via snail mail to confirm and record what we've already learned online.
 Rather than eliminate Saturday delivery, why not bite the bullet and reduce mail delivery to three days a week? Half of the postal routes would receive mail on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the other half on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Each letter carrier would be responsible for two routes instead of one, coinciding with the expected 50 percent rate of attrition forecast for postal workers over the next 10 years.
 Mail carriers would complain that this arrangement would saddle them with twice as much junk mail, and they would be right. The answer is to end the bulk-rate subsidy currently provided to deliver supermarket circulars, clothing catalogs and credit card offers. This would save trees and fuel, and reduce the burden on our landfills.
 Jonathan Gyory Winchester, Mass., March 11, 2010
 To the Editor:
 There are new services that will receive your mail for you, provide an Internet-readable list of items received and let you decide which mail pieces should be scanned (so that you can read them online), forwarded to you via the mail or overnight delivery, picked up or simply discarded.
 Understandably, the service is relatively expensive. With its current infrastructure and staff, however, the Postal Service is well suited to develop this 21st-century technology -- to replace the antiquated technology currently in use.
 Just as I now have little reason to go inside a bank, I would seldom have a reason to go inside a post office. My frustration at standing in line watching the inefficiencies of an outmoded system would be minimized.
 Dan Rouse Frisco, Tex., March 10, 2010
 To the Editor:
 While swiftly completing my appointed rounds, I was thinking about your editorial. As a carrier for 24 years, I was pleased that you avoided the knee-jerk call for privatization.
 Private companies like FedEx are also struggling in this economic downturn, even with the ability to raise rates and impose surcharges at will. And as we have seen with Blackwater and others, the privatization of government services does not mean better service or more accountability.
 A committed, professional Postal Service is vital to the business and security of the nation. Save and improve the Postal Service. Benjamin Franklin, our first postmaster general, would be proud.
 Peter Turek Oak Park, Ill., March 11, 2010

HEADLINE: Judge, Star, but Still a Chef

BYLINE: By SAM SIFTON

 BODY:
TOM COLICCHIO came out of the kitchen at Colicchio & Sons the other night wearing a short-sleeved dishwasher's shirt and a white apron. His black clogs were scuffed beneath his jeans, and there were burn marks on his forearms. He appeared tired, his angry eyes more sunken than usual. 
 He had been in Los Angeles earlier in the week, running a big dinner for the Oscars. He had been down in Dallas before that, for a charity dinner for, among others, Jay-Z and LeBron James. Mr. Colicchio has Craft restaurants in both cities, as well as others in Atlanta, San Francisco, Las Vegas and at Foxwoods in Connecticut. He had been in Washington, too, where he will film the next season of ''Top Chef,'' the cooking competition on Bravo for which he is chief judge. It draws something on the order of three million viewers a week.
 Mr. Colicchio is a celebrity. He is also a businessman with varied and complicated interests in cities across the United States. 
 But he is by temperament and deportment a cook. And at Colicchio & Sons he is running his kitchen at a level that New Yorkers have not been able to experience since his days at the helm of Gramercy Tavern, the restaurant he opened with Danny Meyer in 1994. For the moment, anyway, Mr. Colicchio's is the must-try New York menu. His restaurant isn't perfect. But it is exciting. And the food is terrifically good.
 Order the tasting menu: $125. (Expensive, yes, but still cheaper than orchestra seats for ''The Nose,'' or a facial at Bliss.) Currently it begins with a single roasted scallop placed beside an equal measure of silken foie-gras terrine. Pale turnips turned in honey, and peppery, chicory-like puntarelle separate the species. They elevate what might be a menu cliche into something fantastic. 
 Much more follows, an intricate dance to flavor. A cone of squid arrives stuffed with cavalo nero, a kind of black cabbage, over an ebony-ink risotto that itself emerges from a fiery chunked tomato sauce. A stroke of dark sauce -- roasted cacao nibs blended into verjus -- runs a bass line under the salt and sweet, heightening both.
 Then lobster, a slash of red and white claw meat in a lobster bordelaise so deeply flavored as to recall both veal stock and opium smoke, with cabbage to bind them together. And sturgeon, a rectangle of meat the color of ivory, with a sauce of reduced grape must and a grape-pumpkin marmalade. It's a mad hatter's dish, cooking out of Lewis Carroll. 
 Red squab is next, the tiny bird lacquered and crisp, scented with vadouvan, the French-ish curry powder that made its big-market debut on ''Top Chef'' a few years ago. It tastes of funky sophistication, illicit rides in late-night cabs. And last, before a dessert round of orange-scented cannoli and a phenomenal mango tatin from Stephen Collucci, the restaurant's fearsomely talented pastry chef, comes a perfectly roasted piece of lamb loin. It's served with nettles, green and puckered chickpeas and a caramelized yogurt with luxurious tang. This is low-whistle-and-chuckles food.
 At Craft, Mr. Colicchio's flagship restaurant on 19th Street, there is no caramelized yogurt, no grape-pumpkin marmalade. Even at Tom: Tuesday Dinner, the supper club he ran there for a time, the composed plates did not exhibit the sophistication currently on offer at Colicchio & Sons.
 ''As much as I love what I do at Craft,'' Mr. Colicchio told New York magazine in December, ''I don't want to be known for putting a piece of fish on the plate with olive oil and salt and pepper.'' 
 And so he has gone in an opposite direction. There are elements of French technique to the cooking here, as well as an appreciable Italian devotion to ingredients. There are Indian flavors, and central European ones; there are nods also at Spain, at the Greenmarket, at North Africa. The result is a menu with an aesthetic that is entirely American. It appropriates all that has come to it, without apology. 
 There is an astonishing array of beer available to match this food, most of it well suited to it; a varied and excellent wine list has prices that, unlike Craft's, do not provoke winces. 
 Whatever you're drinking, it's hard to go wrong with an appetizer of butter-poached oysters, off the regular menu. These are served in a wide bowl with celery root cooked and cut into a perfect rendition of tagliatelle pasta, with a large dab of American caviar for seasoning. 
 The dish is spooky perfection, crazy-making in its clean simplicity, its slinky richness. Butter traces run into oyster liquor, and the amalgamation swirls forward over the sweetness of a vegetable that acts as a starch, and carries the salty pop of the fish eggs carefully toward the tongue. 
 Also nice: an addictive sea urchin and crab fondue; a hugely fat roasted sweetbread with honey-napped onions and a bacon-sherry vinaigrette; and agnolotti stuffed with a mash of white beans, with chorizo, pork belly and octopus, a buddy-and-sidekick film that should do well at the box office.
 For entrees, there is a wide wrist of monkfish, wrapped in pancetta and cooked crisp, atop braised red cabbage that's been dressed in black-truffle vinaigrette. The combination of flavors -- sweet again, and salty, with a bite of acid -- cross-references the varied textures like a math problem, or an Escher print. 
 Chicken pot-au-feu is hardly stewish beneath its crisp sheet of skin and fat cuts of black truffle, but it maintains the Escoffier standard while stepping into the modern age; a veal breast with tripe, trumpet royal mushrooms and a sweet cousin of baby broccoli, spigarello, explodes it for the same purpose. There is excellent striped bass with chopped razor clams and pea shoots, the sort of meal where you want a fork, a spoon and a few napkins, and a precisely Frenched little rack of rabbit, with braised fennel and olives. This last is dollhouse cuisine, not bad, if a little creepy.
 About the only misses are a perfectly cooked and defiantly under-seasoned fist of sirloin that is no match for the salsify, bacon and black garlic that come with it, and, for the same reason, a braised loup de mer with pork trotter and shallots cooked sweet and sour. 
 Colicchio & Sons occupies the space that used to be Craftsteak, which Mr. Colicchio opened in 2006. Versions of that restaurant have done well in casino towns. But in Manhattan, the conceit started and stalled, then gained traction only to drive into the teeth of a new, diminished economy. Mr. Colicchio closed it right before Christmas last year.
 Colicchio & Sons came less than a month later. Some of the staff has remained (''Craftsteak, good afternoon!''). But a lot of testosterone has been drained off, and a combination of flowers and a Grateful Deadish soundtrack do much to counter the boom-era feel of the restaurant's towering ceilings and soft leather seats. It's not precisely comfortable, but it's close.
 This is true especially at lunch, up in the Tap Room, where there's a big rug in front of the bar and a menu that runs to pizzas and sandwiches and low-caliber versions of some of the dinner meals. An open-face Dagwood taken there at noon -- grilled toast and pulled pork piled high with sauerkraut with a run of Fontina -- is a perfect introduction to a long walk on the High Line and an argument for blowing off the afternoon's work besides. 
 Mr. Colicchio stands by the pizza oven up front, his arms crossed, his bald head gleaming in the heat. He's talking low to a cook, forceful already, a couple of hours into a doubleheader day, customers who recognize him from billboards streaming past, whispering as if he were Derek Jeter at batting practice. 
 You think celebrity is easy? Colicchio & Sons says: not if you're ambitious.

HEADLINE: Taking the Bake Out of Bake Sale

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
IN one corner: Reduced Fat Cool Ranch Doritos, Linden's Chocolate Chip Minis and Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips. In the other: homemade pumpkin bread, pink cupcakes and spinach tofu empanadas. 
 Bureaucratically speaking, the Doritos take it, under the recent restrictions on student bake sales in New York City public schools. That is, unless the parents who plan to stage a ''bake-in'' at City Hall on Thursday can persuade officials to overturn the regulation. The City Council is planning a public hearing on the matter for later this month. 
 The rule, which school officials say is aimed at tackling obesity, allows PTAs to hold bake sales once a month or weekdays after 6 p.m. Otherwise only fresh fruits and vegetables and any of 27 packaged items that meet city Health Department guidelines on calories, fat and sodium can be sold at schools. 
 Some parents have accused school officials of promoting processed food. 
 The battle over bake sales, a tenacious civic tradition, has struck a deep chord with home cooks and food historians. Whether in the chaos of New York City or in the quiet of a rural village, bake sales evoke a sense of comfort and trust through the intimacy of cooking, in slices of layer cake, lemon bars, tollhouse cookies, hermits, muffins, pies. (Or, in the case of some of the more ambitious New York City parent-cooks protesting this week, the empanadas, mini-spanakopitas, vegetable calzones and vegan chocolate cake.) 
 Helen Martineau-Kraus has two daughters at the Neighborhood School in the East Village and likes to bake carrot cupcakes and pumpkin muffins with them for bake sales. (She once made mini-spanakopitas, but said they were too much work and went too fast.) Bake sales connect parents and children at the school, she said. 
 ''Everybody contributes, everybody feels more like they are part of the school community,'' she said. ''They try things that other people have baked. In such a big city it's really nice to have that small community feeling.''
 Other parents, at a time when the schools have been devastated by budget cuts and the recession has squeezed so many wallets, said it is hard to match bake sales for fund-raising. 
 Geraldine Neary, who has three children at the Renaissance Charter School in Jackson Heights, Queens, said the weekly bake sales at her school, netting between $200 and $300, raised enough money to send 11 students to see the Mayan ruins in Mexico last year. 
 She is famous for her Rice Krispie Buns, which she makes with semisweet dark chocolate instead of marshmallows. The bake-sale money has also gone to send students to the Adirondacks for a four-day ''nature's classroom'' in the summers, quite a benefit for a school where she said 60 percent of the students meet the federal poverty standard. 
 ''A lot of families in our school don't have money, but if they're baking something they feel they are contributing,'' said Ms. Neary, a past president of the PTA. ''If they can't give me money and they can't give me time, they give me some brownies, they give me some cupcakes.''
 School officials say parents have misinterpreted the ban as an endorsement of junk food.
 ''We're not saying you should eat Doritos,'' said Eric Goldstein, chief executive of School Food and Transportation for the Department of Education. ''We're not telling you what you can feed your child or not feed your child. If you want to send in with your child 15 cupcakes you can do so. That probably wouldn't be advisable. But what we're talking about is the selling of food. We've taken a good long look at this.''
 He said that 40 percent of the 1.1 million city schoolchildren are overweight or obese and that restricting the sale of baked goods was just ''one piece in a holistic wellness puzzle,'' coming after the school system had replaced much of the food in its vending machines with items lower in calories, fat and sodium. Listing the ingredients of food for sale in school is essential to monitoring what students eat, Mr. Goldstein said. 
 But Laura Shapiro, a food historian and author, said the city's argument was ''exactly the kind of thinking that sent us down the road of packaged, industrial junk food in the first place.''
 Big food companies, she said, came ''roaring out of World War II, producing every kind of food and getting people to eat this stuff,'' and ''that was the start of a kind of war between the food industry and American home cooks, which this bake-sale flap shows is not over.''
 She added: ''Americans came to accept a kind of distance between themselves and food. You wouldn't trust it if it wasn't wrapped up and labeled. Now, farmers' markets are in vogue -- we love to exalt in that -- but for many decades you only bought a bag of potatoes, cut up and wrapped and predone.''
 Now, she said, ''we're supposed to believe that a packaged chocolate-chip cookie is preferable to a homemade one, not on the basis of taste, texture or the quality of the ingredients, but because it came from a factory and has a nutrition label.'' 
 In any case, there is also the matter of what to call these erstwhile bake sales. Among the more cynical suggestions from a few boiling-mad parents were names like ''prepackaged, corporate junk-food sale.''
 The education department is trying to persuade parents and students to hold food-free fund-raising events, perhaps selling T-shirts, pencils, notebooks, shoelaces or handmade beaded jewelry instead. One option it suggests is selling exercise: the buyer pays for the student to run a certain number of laps around a park or track.
 Call it a ''running-laps sale?'' Inspired idea, no doubt, but it doesn't quite roll off the tongue.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 24, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article last Wednesday about efforts to overturn a restriction on the sale of homemade food at bake sales in New York City schools referred incorrectly to an action planned by the City Council. Gale A. Brewer, a Democratic council member from Manhattan, said she will introduce a resolution asking the Department of Education to overturn the regulation; the council has not scheduled a hearing about the regulation.

HEADLINE: The Red Bulls Are Finally Ready to Open the Arena of Their Dreams

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
HARRISON, N.J. -- The first thing you notice about Red Bull Arena is how big it appears from the outside. As you approach the stadium, the new home of the Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, it rises on the horizon like a giant floating silver souffle. The stadium looks as if it could easily hold 50,000 fans, maybe more.
 Its size is magnified by the enormous adjacent lots that have been cleared to make way for a series of shops and condominiums that are part of a plan to revitalize this town. The roof, which billows over the stadium, also masks what turns out to be a cozy stadium, something you recognize once you enter. 
 Red Bull Arena will open Saturday when the Red Bulls play the Brazilian team Santos F.C., Pele's old team. In many ways, the stadium, which cost about $200 million, is the antithesis of the team's old home, Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. The new building has seats for just 25,000 fans, one-third as many as Giants Stadium, which was better suited for football. The team will play on grass, not artificial turf, and the soccer field will not become lost in a maze of faded football yard markers.
 With far fewer seats, the Red Bulls will not draw the large crowds that turned out to see World Cup matches and superstars like Pele and David Beckham. But fans will be closer to the action. There are only 17 rows of seats in the lower bowl, and the first rows are just seven yards from the sidelines. The pitch of the upper bowl is somewhat steep, but the entire field is visible from the top rows. The handful of seats that have obscured views will not be sold.
 The original design for the stadium, which goes back 10 years, included 66 suites, 2,000 premium seats and a stage. When Red Bull, the Austrian maker of energy drinks, took over the stadium project in 2007, it scrapped the stage and cut the number of suites to 30 and the club seats to 750. This increased the seating capacity of the stadium by about 40 percent and helped the team keep the average ticket price at about $25.
 ''We've reversed the trend,'' said Erik Stover, the team's managing director. ''We've taken a lot of the premium out of the stadium. We have a different philosophy.''
 The stadium's most unusual feature is its roof. Originally, it was designed to cover one side of the stands. Now, it wraps around the entire stadium and covers all the seats, while leaving the field exposed to the elements.
 The 60 feet of roof that covers the lower bowl is translucent to allow in sunlight. The rest of the roof is metal, so the seats in the upper bowl feel darker and cooler. Of course, fans may welcome the shade on hot days.
 The lack of direct sunlight may also prevent the aluminum used in the upper bowl from heating up in the sun. While the lower bowl is made of precast concrete, the team chose metal for the upper bowl so fans could create more noise when they stamped their feet.
 The stadium's smaller dimensions and the roof should make Red Bull Arena a place that soccer fans can finally call their own.
 But unlike, say, the new Yankee Stadium, the average fan is not smothered in luxuries. The club suites are fancy enough, but fans in most of the stadium will have access to concession stands on one concourse. From there, fans can see the field but will be encouraged to return to their seats. The team has hired Seabra, which runs Portuguese supermarkets and restaurants in Newark, to help select the food.
 Soccer does not seem to generate as many statistics as other sports, so fans may not mind that the scoreboards hanging above the end zones are relatively small. The four-foot-high screen that wraps around the middle of the stadium is more visible, though undoubtedly it will include a lot of advertising.
 The stadium does not appear to have a lot of garish signage. That may be a sign of the weak economy or perhaps the team's focus on the game. The team's owners, though, are not shy about pumping their brand: vending machines that sell Red Bull will be placed throughout the stadium.
 The real drawbacks are outside the stadium. The Harrison PATH station is less than a 10-minute walk, and the station is being renovated. Access to highways will take some navigation and patience.
 The nearest restaurant is another 10 minutes away. Better to work or ride one stop on the PATH to Newark, where the Ironbound neighborhood has a large Portuguese and Brazilian population and many restaurants that televise soccer games.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Questioned on Its Far-Reaching Plan to Expand Broadband Access

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL and BRIAN STELTER; Jenna Wortham contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Federal regulators on Tuesday made public the details of their ambitious policy to encourage the spread of high-speed Internet access. But their 376-page proposal, the National Broadband Plan, was met with a chorus of questions, even from the staunchest advocates of its goals.
 Telecommunications companies praised the intent but worried that new regulations might impede rather than encourage their progress in expanding Internet access. Industry analysts said the plan was both too ambitious and not detailed enough, and consumer advocates doubted it alone would lead to more affordable broadband service at adequate speeds. 
 The criticisms were largely tempered by a strong embrace of what is by far the most aggressive effort to date by regulators to encourage widespread adoption of broadband at much higher speeds than most Americans have today. 
 The plan, put forth by the Federal Communications Commission, also proposes to allot more wireless spectrum for mobile devices, redirect some subsidies toward broadband access, develop a nationwide network for emergency first responders and create a ''digital literacy corps'' to train new users.
 ''They should be commended for the document's remarkable breadth,'' said Craig Moffett, a telecommunications industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, but he added that such scope could also be a liability. The plan ''sets up a hundred different battles over funding and spectrum and even set-top box design, and each on its own would represent an ambitious agenda.''
 He added, ''The risk is that the plan's very scope will limit its real-world impact.''
 For its part, the F.C.C. on Tuesday characterized its Congressionally mandated plan as a much-needed step for keeping the nation competitive. The policies echo a generations-old effort to provide every home with a telephone, itself once seen as a communications tool central to economic and social development.
 The broadband proposal, which the agency sent to Congress on Tuesday, ''is necessary to meet the challenges of global competitiveness, and harness the power of broadband to help address so many vital national issues,'' the agency chairman, Julius Genachowski, said in a statement.
 President Obama said the plan recalled the way ''past generations of Americans met the great infrastructure challenges of the day, such as building the transcontinental railroad and the Interstate highways.'' 
 For most Americans who already have broadband access the most important part of the 10-year plan may involve speed. The F.C.C. hopes that by 2020 at least 100 million households will have access to broadband capable of running 100 megabits a second, and for community institutions like schools and hospitals to have access at 10 times that speed. 
 The average at-home connection is three to four megabits a second now, speeds seen as ultimately unable to deliver increasingly rich multimedia content. But industry analysts say that the government's ability to influence access speeds is limited. 
 Some aspects will take years to put into place and require Congressional action. Notably, legislators would have to allow some proceeds from the spectrum auctions to be diverted to broadcasters. The F.C.C. hopes to use that spectrum to lead to the creation of wireless Internet access, to enhance competition and keep consumer costs in check. 
 But some television station owners are wary of the auction plans. That is one of the little battles that seems likely to emerge involving deep-pocketed advocates, industry analysts said.
 One F.C.C. commissioner, Mignon Clyburn, said in a statement that she was ''very concerned'' about the tradeoff. ''It is unclear at this point whether the Internet can currently replace these trusted sources,'' she said.
 And some analysts said that even if the spectrum ultimately became available, it might create wireless access but fail to create competition for the much higher-speed Net access. Wireless access is roughly one-twentieth of the speed of the envisioned 100-megabit lines, said Dave Burstein, editor of DSL Prime, an industry newsletter.
 ''They talk, talk, talk about affordability, but when you look at the plan, most peoples' prices are going to go up,'' Mr. Burstein said. It typically costs $100 a month for Net access at speeds of 50 megabits to 100 megabits.
 Mr. Burstein said those prices were double the cost in places like France and England and yet the plan, he added, does little to bring those down.
 He also asserted that the goal of getting high-speed access to 100 million homes was already within reach. About 50 million homes have access to broadband service of 50 to 100 megabits, and the cable industry says 100 million homes will have such access within five years. 
 Chief among its goals, the F.C.C. wants future broadband investment to be focused on the areas where gaps in service remain. It will direct this investment in part through the Universal Service Fund, a program for telephone and Internet access, costing $8 billion annually, paid through a phone bill surcharge. Over time, the subsidies for Internet will increase and those for phone will dissipate, with the knowledge that people can make online calls. 
 ''Some of the details are lacking, particularly on Universal Service Fund reform,'' said Dan Mitchell, a vice president for the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association, a group that represents rural providers and worries that the proposals to change phone carrier costs will curtail the providers' abilities to expand infrastructure.
 ''Broadly, they're stating the right things,'' he added. ''But the devil is always in the details.''

HEADLINE: Sharp Rise in Uninsured

BYLINE: By SINDYA N. BHANOO

 BODY:
The number of uninsured adults and children in California swelled by 28 percent from 2007 to 2009, according to a report on Tuesday by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 One quarter of the state's population is now uninsured, according to the analysis, and less than half of those with insurance receive it through employers.
 The increase in the uninsured, to 8.2 million from 6.4 million, is largely due to job loss during the recession, said Shana Alex Lavarreda, co-author of the study and director of health insurance studies at the Center for Health Policy Research at U.C.L.A.. The figures include all workers in the state regardless of immigration status.
 In 2007, even before the economy's collapse, the number of uninsured adults and children in California had reached more than six million, Dr. Lavarreda added.
 For advocacy groups, the new numbers are a clear indication that change is in order. ''This is what our country looks like without reform,'' said Anthony Wright, the executive director of Health Access, a statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition. ''California is like the Ghost of Christmas Future for the rest of the country.''
 The study's estimates are based on data from health insurance companies and public health insurance programs offered in California.
 The increases in uninsured occurred in all age groups, though working adults were hit hardest. The unemployment rate in California increased to 12.3 percent from 5.4 percent from 2007 to 2009.
 Public health coverage in California increased to 16 percent from 15 percent during this period, but it was not enough to counter the steep drop in coverage because of unemployment.
 Many Californians who lost their jobs stayed on health care plans through Cobra, supported in part by a government subsidy. Without that cushion, the tallies would have been higher, Dr. Lavarreda said.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Are Slowed By Blizzards, as Expected

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Home building slowed in February as snowstorms stopped construction in some of the country's largest markets, a Commerce Department report indicated Tuesday.
 But the data suggested that builders might also be curtailing construction in response to disappointing demand, despite the government's efforts to lure buyers with a tax credit of up to $8,000.
 Construction fell 5.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 575,000 homes, with much of the weakness in the Northeast and South, where the severe weather was concentrated. Building of single-family homes fell 0.6 percent. 
 ''The outlook remains bleak,'' Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. ''Home building activity remains very low by historical standards and is set to remain that way for some time.''
 The drop in February followed an increase in January that was much better than initially reported. The government said Tuesday that construction increased 6.6 percent in January, nearly triple the original estimate, with much of the momentum coming from single-family homes.
 Analysts had expected home construction to decrease by less in February, but those forecasts did not account for the surge in building in January.
 The slowdown revived a debate about the potency of the tax credit for home buyers. While economists said most of the decline in February could be tied to weather, builders might also be responding to tepid demand.
 Sales of new homes fell to a record low in January, resurrecting worries that consumers would delay home buying until the jobs market turned around. The government's tax credit helped lift sales in the fall. But analysts have yet to see the second wave of buying they predicted as the April 30 deadline for the credit approaches.
 Indeed, building permits, which indicate future activity and were not affected by weather, fell 1.6 percent in February after robust gains in recent months.
 A large supply of excess homes on the market is keeping builders on the sidelines. Economists estimate there are 3.8 million homes for sale in the United States, and the market may be flooded with an additional five million to six million in foreclosed properties over the next several years. 
 ''It's still a real struggle for builders,'' said Nigel Gault, an economist for IHS Global Insight. ''They're competing with a lot of distressed properties on the market at bargain prices.''
 The influx of foreclosed homes is also making it harder for Americans to sell their homes, contributing to the weak demand for new homes. Over the last year, the housing market has moved mostly sideways: the rate of construction was 0.2 percent higher in February compared with a year earlier.
 Adding to the troubles is the foundering commercial real estate market, where vacancy rates are high and financiers are scarce. That has curbed apartment construction. In February, construction of apartments with five units or more fell 43.1 percent to an annual rate of 58,000 units, though economists cautioned that the trends could be exaggerated at such low levels.
 The housing market's recovery may depend largely on how quickly unemployment eases. It may take several years before the jobless rate, now 9.7 percent, retreats to normal levels. 
 In part because of the weak jobs market, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that it would keep interest rates near zero for an extended period. 
 Despite the low rates, economists say inflation appears to be in check in the United States. A Labor Department report released Tuesday reinforced that view, with import prices, a gauge of inflation, falling 0.3 percent in February, mostly because of a decline in fuel prices.

HEADLINE: Hiding Money With Global Rules

 BODY:
Lehman Brothers' now notorious Repo 105 scheme depended on forum shopping. The investment bank wasn't able to persuade its lawyers in the United States that the relevant repurchase agreements constituted real sales. So it routed them through its British subsidiary. That meant they came under the British legal system, and the law firm Linklaters was able to opine that the transactions counted as sales.
 United States accounting standards apparently did the rest, allowing Lehman to shuffle $50 billion of assets off its balance sheet. Regulators in different jurisdictions need to cooperate to close all such gaps that they can. 
 Forum shopping, also known as regulatory arbitrage, is undesirable, but smart bankers are always going to do it. The Lehman case shows, for one thing, how bankers exploited weaknesses in United States accounting standards -- seemingly without objection from the firm's auditor, Ernst & Young. Although the transactions concerned came under British law, they were reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Those standards have lots of detailed rules, but they don't catch every eventuality. Things can slip through the cracks.
 International accounting standards, by contrast, rely more heavily on broad principles. These can be better at ensuring compliance with the spirit of true and fair accounting. For example, one principle of the standards is that if companies keep substantially all the risks and rewards of an asset, they can't keep it off their balance sheets. This would seem to mean that Lehman's sleight of hand with Repo 105 would not have been possible under international accounting standards.
 Lehman's other regulatory arbitrage was to park the Repo 105 transactions in Britain. If Lehman had stayed entirely at home, using both United States laws and accounting standards, it wouldn't have been able to hide assets. If the firm had hopped over the Atlantic and applied international accounting standards as well as British law, the scheme would also have failed.
 The crafty Lehman bankers found a fault in the system -- the intersection of British law and American accounting standards. But that's to be expected from highly paid bankers, helped by expensive lawyers and accountants. It's a concrete reminder that those heading individual nations' reform of financial regulation need to keep thinking globally.
 A Tempting Thought
 Wall Street's closest link to the lyrics of ''Hotel California''had been the indulgent pink Champagne. But Senators Christopher Dodd and Bob Corker are bringing a more modern slant. A provision Mr. Corker added to Mr. Dodd's plan to overhaul financial regulation stipulates that even if Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, or other banks that received funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, check out as bank holding companies, they can never leave the Federal Reserve's embrace.
 The two firms signed the Fed registry at the height of the financial crisis in September 2008. The last surviving independent investment banks were granted bank holding company charters to gain access to emergency credit from the central bank. Two months later, the status enabled them to sell government guaranteed debt through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Goldman announced it would be the first to use the process the day its shares hit a low of $47.41.
 All these carrots came with a theoretical stick: oversight by the tougher Fed instead of the more lax Securities and Exchange Commission. But with survival no longer in question, whispers started circulating that one or both banks might want to slip out the back door without paying the price -- by dropping their charters in a game of regulatory arbitrage.
 The temptation must be inviting. Deposits are a complete afterthought for Goldman, and still remain a minor component of Morgan Stanley's business despite plans to add Smith Barney deposits to its brokerage and closer ties to a Japanese commercial bank. Such funds can't be used to finance investment banking activities, which remain a hallmark of both Wall Street denizens. What's more, Goldman is losing money by parking its small pool of deposits at the Fed.
 It's true neither firm has said or suggested it wants out from under the Fed's thumb. But as the bankruptcy examiner for Lehman Brothers starkly reminded, Wall Street has a way of shrewdly finding regulatory loopholes. The senators are smart to stab this beast with their steely knives.

HEADLINE: Senate Republican Leader Finds Weapon in Party Unity

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Before the health care fight, before the economic stimulus package, before President Obama even took office, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, had a strategy for his party: use his extensive knowledge of Senate procedure to slow things down, take advantage of the difficulties Democrats would have in governing and deny Democrats any Republican support on big legislation.
 Republicans embraced it. Democrats denounced it as rank obstructionism. Either way, it has led the two parties, as much as any other factor, to where they are right now. Republicans are monolithically against the health care legislation, leaving the president and his party executing parliamentary back flips to get it passed, conservatives revived, liberals wondering what happened.
 In the process, Mr. McConnell, 68, a Kentuckian more at home plotting tactics in the cloakroom than writing legislation in a committee room or exhorting crowds on the campaign trail, has come to embody a kind of oppositional politics that critics say has left voters cynical about Washington, the Senate all but dysfunctional and the Republican Party without a positive agenda or message. 
 But in the short run at least, his approach has worked. For more than a year, he pleaded and cajoled to keep his caucus in line. He deployed poll data. He warned against the lure of the short-term attention to be gained by going bipartisan, and linked Republican gains in November to showing voters they could hold the line against big government. 
 On the major issues -- not just health care, but financial regulation and the economic stimulus package, among others -- Mr. McConnell has held Republican defections to somewhere between minimal and nonexistent, allowing him to slow the Democratic agenda if not defeat aspects of it. He has helped energize the Republican base, expose divisions among Democrats and turn the health care fight into a test of the Democrats' ability to govern. 
 ''It was absolutely critical that everybody be together because if the proponents of the bill were able to say it was bipartisan, it tended to convey to the public that this is O.K., they must have figured it out,'' Mr. McConnell said about the health legislation in an interview, suggesting that even minimal Republican support could sway the public. ''It's either bipartisan or it isn't.''
 Mr. McConnell said the unity was essential in dealing with Democrats on ''things like the budget, national security and then ultimately, obviously, health care.'' 
 Still, he said, his party had offered Democrats a chance for a deal on health care but blamed them as being inflexible. Democrats and the White House heavily courted Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, who voted for an early version of the bill but later broke with Democrats. Democratic leaders, including the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said they did not think Republicans were ever serious about trying to strike a deal.
 Even Mr. McConnell's fellow Republicans say somewhat admiringly that he can be a secretive and coldly calculating tactician with an eye for political openings, someone more consumed by political strategy than ideology or philosophy. 
 He is in many ways the mirror image of his Democratic counterpart, Mr. Reid. Both are experts at the inside game who struggle with the burden of trying to control a political caucus at a time when legislative leaders no longer have the brute power they once had and senators are hailed for acting like mavericks.
 ''Mitch tends to play things close to the vest,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas.
 The extent of Republican unity to date is attributable to some degree to Democratic missteps, as well as to the rise of the Tea Party movement, which has exerted tremendous pressure on Republicans not to do anything that might give comfort to the president and his party. 
 But it is also testimony to how Mr. McConnell has been able to draw on 25 years of Congressional savvy to display a mastery of legislative maneuvering. Mr. McConnell rejected the criticism that his approach is all about scoring political points by denying Mr. Obama any victories. His opposition, he said, is rooted in a principled belief that Mr. Obama is pushing the nation in the wrong direction.
 Building a Strategy
 ''To the extent that they want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be helpful,'' Mr. McConnell said of the Democrats. ''To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful.''
 He consistently told fellow Republicans they needed to win back independent voters and lapsed Republicans who, he said, have shifted only temporarily to the Democratic camp. To win them over, he suggested, Republicans should emphasize issues that resonated with them at a time of insecurity, including government spending, debt, government bailouts and terrorism.
 The question now is how much of an enduring gain Republicans might get from Mr. McConnell's blocking strategy. For all his efforts, Democrats could very well pass a health care overhaul in the next week. While he has drawn sharp ideological contrasts that have rallied conservatives after their Congressional defeats in 2006 and 2008, Mr. McConnell is a long way from capturing control of the Senate in November.
 More fundamentally, Mr. McConnell's strategy has left Republicans at risk of being tagged as pure obstructionists and a party without a positive agenda.
 ''Their goal,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, ''is to slow down activity to stop legislation from passing in the belief that this will embolden conservatives in the next election and will deny the president a record of accomplishment.'' 
 ''Senator McConnell is their inspiration, their enforcer and their enabler,'' Mr. Durbin said.
 Yet such critiques do not disturb Mr. McConnell, who has for years been raked over the editorial coals around the country for his signature opposition to campaign finance law changes. On the wall of his private Senate office, where most lawmakers hang photographs of themselves with presidents and dignitaries, Mr. McConnell instead has framed originals of venomous editorial cartoons that portray him in most unflattering terms. 
 The strategy that has brought Senate Republicans where they are today began when they gathered, beaten and dispirited, at the Library of Congress two weeks before Mr. Obama's inauguration. They had lost seven seats in November, another was teetering, and they were about to go up against an extraordinarily popular new president and an emboldened Democratic Congress. 
 ''We came in shellshocked,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. ''There was sort of a feeling of 'every man for himself.' Mitch early on in this session came up with a game plan to make us relevant with 40 people. He said if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant.''
 A First Test
 As the year went on, Mr. McConnell spent hours listening to the worries and ideas of Republicans, urging them not to be seduced by the attention-grabbing possibilities of cutting a bipartisan deal. ''I think the reason my members are feeling really good,'' he said, ''is they believe that the reward for playing team ball this year was the reversal of the political environment and the possibility that we will have a bigger team next year.'' 
 On the first big test of his strategy, Senate passage of the economic stimulus bill, Mr. McConnell lost three Republicans; one of them, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, would soon leave the party. Yet before long, Republicans in both houses had become a monolith of opposition. 
 The president's first budget proposal presented a juicy target in early 2009. At a spring meeting with Republican leaders in his office, Mr. McConnell invoked, as is his custom, a collection of poll data to argue that the budget could be undone with a simple phrase that would crystallize public concerns: ''spends too much, taxes too much and borrows too much.'' 
 That phrase, Mr. McConnell said, should be invoked by Republican lawmakers every time they saw a television camera or an open notebook. 
 ''Good politics is repetition,'' Mr. McConnell said. When there were signs of Republicans breaking from the ranks -- like when Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa led a delegation of Republicans in negotiations with Democrats about a deal on health care -- Mr. McConnell would keep close watch.
 Mr. Grassley said Mr. McConnell worked patiently with him, asking only that he not agree to a public option or ''rationing of health care'' -- two positions Mr. Grassley was never going to accept. But Mr. McConnell also said Mr. Grassley and Republicans should not make the mistake that Democrats had and present a single, big-idea bill that could draw all kinds of criticism. In the end, no deal was struck.
 Some Ups and Downs
 As the months went on, Mr. McConnell would show up at weekly meetings of his conference with a chart tracking poll numbers that, by summertime, showed that support for a health care overhaul had flipped. With their approach producing tangible benefits, Republicans were driven even more strongly to remain united. 
 Just before the summer recess, on July 21, Mr. McConnell used the weekly luncheon of Senate Republicans in the L.B.J. Room off the Senate floor to list the fruits of their labor. His PowerPoint presentation showed that the president's approval rating was down and that Republicans were gaining on Democrats on the question of which party voters would prefer to see controlling Congress. ''We came up with a plan, stuck to it, and now we're starting to see results,'' the presentation noted.
 Still, there have been moments of doubt. Just before Christmas, Republican senators began badgering Mr. McConnell to halt maneuvers blocking a final vote on the Senate health bill. They wanted to get home, and they were worried that they looked overly obstructionist. In meeting after meeting in the Capitol, Mr. McConnell, a devoted fan of University of Louisville basketball, urged his colleagues to keep playing ''team ball.'' He reiterated the message he had employed for a year -- the party's resurgence depended on unity, and Republicans needed to be patient.
 They listened. By the time the health bill was approved by the Senate on Christmas Eve with zero Republican votes, Democrats had been forced to cut questionable intraparty deals and jump through legislative hoops in an ugly process that helped sour the public on the party and its legislation. 
 Mr. McConnell, who was first elected to the Senate in 1984 with the help of a Roger Ailes-produced advertisement that showed bloodhounds searching for his opponent, has had his ups and downs as a leader. Senate Republicans lost 14 seats in the last two elections when he was the No. 2 Republican and then the party chief, and Mr. Specter jumped ship on his watch.
 But Mr. McConnell is credited with a very effective run over the last 15 months -- though being minority leader has distinct advantages over being in charge of making the Senate function.
 ''Throwing grenades is easier than catching them,'' acknowledged Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a fellow member of the Republican leadership.

HEADLINE: A Big Insurance Rate Increase for Pennsylvania Poor

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
Facing a sharp rise in costs, Pennsylvania has almost doubled the monthly bill for a state health insurance program for poor people who do not qualify for Medicaid and are on a waiting list for a less costly option.
 On March 1, the cost of the plan rose to about $600 a month, up from $313 a month, for the roughly 2,400 state residents on the waiting list. 
 The increase comes as Congress is poised to act on a health care overhaul and as the Obama administration has been highly critical of insurance companies for rate increases of 30 percent to 40 percent. 
 State officials said that the program had become a magnet for the sickest people in the state, even as rising unemployment had driven more people to sign up.
 Joel Ario, the state insurance commissioner, said that while unavoidable, the price increase would probably make matters worse. ''This is very likely going to send us into a death spiral,'' he said.
 The increase may cause even more people to drop out of the program, he said, leaving mainly the people most in need of costly health care and making the program even more expensive.
 Mr. Ario, who has been an ally of the Obama administration in its effort to overhaul health care, said his state's predicament was one of the reasons that it was important for the federal law to require virtually everyone to have health insurance, so the costs can be spread around more widely. Without such a requirement, he said, there will be little way to prevent the sickest people from burdening state-financed ''safety net'' programs. 
 The former president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Sandy Praeger, echoed Mr. Ario's point. 
 ''Unless you require everyone to carry insurance,'' Ms. Praeger said, ''you will have people able to sign up just when they are sick, but you will lack any of the financial support from people when they are healthy. That's the situation you are seeing in Pennsylvania.''
 In Pennsylvania, Katherine Chavis, 63, received a letter in February informing her of the price change. ''I broke down and cried,'' she said, adding that she lives on Social Security income of $1,383 a month and cannot afford $600 for health insurance. She has since decided to cancel her enrollment in the program, she said.
 Established in 2002, Pennsylvania's state insurance program, called AdultBasic, covers adults ages 19 to 65 with incomes lower than twice the federal poverty level, or about $21,672 for a single person, at a cost to participants of about $36 per month. About 39,000 people are enrolled in AdultBasic.
 About 390,000 other people are on a waiting list to join the AdultBasic program. While they wait, the state gives them the option to pay for the same insurance at a higher rate. It is the cost for members of the waiting list that rose on March 1 to about $600 a month. 
 The AdultBasic program began after it was revealed that several health insurance plans that provide care for many state residents had billions of dollars in ''surplus'' funds, even though they were supposed to be nonprofit. 
 In response, Gov. Edward G. Rendell negotiated an agreement with the plans under which they would make a charitable commitment of $900 million over six years, with 60 percent of the money financing AdultBasic. The agreement expires on Dec. 31, near the end of Mr. Rendell's term.
 ''Our fear is that the state is being pressured by insurers to raise rates as a way to limit the number of people enrolled in the program,'' said Kristen Dama, a staff lawyer with Community Legal Services of Philadelphia. ''Then if insurers decide not to continue underwriting the program after Dec. 31 of this year, there will be fewer people enrolled in it that suddenly will lose coverage.'' 
 Ms. Dama said that her organization had asked the state to provide documentation that justifies such a drastic price increase but that it had yet to receive any information.
 The insurance program for people on the waiting list allows them to get coverage on a month-to-month basis, which means that most of the 2,400 or so enrollees sign up only when they are sick, Mr. Ario said.
 For every person in the AdultBasic program, the state provides a subsidy of about $350 a month. But for those in the waiting list program, the subsidy is roughly $1,000 monthly.
 ''We had to make a difficult decision,'' Mr. Ario said. ''Do we raise the rates on the people in the main program that enrolls about 40,000 people for $36 per month, or do we raise the rates on the 2,400 people on the waiting list program?''
 He said, ''In the end, we thought it was smarter to salvage the main program, which covers more people.''

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Official Promises Do Little to Ease a Stricken City's Pain

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN and GINGER THOMPSON; Elisabeth Malkin reported from Ciudad Juarez, and Ginger Thompson from Washington.

 BODY:
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico -- In the six weeks since gunmen killed 15 people in a working-class neighborhood here, the police, the governor, psychologists and even the president's wife have descended.
 The first lady, Margarita Zavala, promised to build a field for playing American football in a giant trash-strewn lot nearby. The psychologists played games with the neighborhood's terrified children to help them cope. 
 And then everybody left. The lot is still barren, and children still have trouble sleeping at night. 
 ''I want to go back to before,'' said a mother of three who lost her husband that night when he went out to rescue their 16-year-old son, whose legs were so badly injured that he may not walk again. She would not provide her name for fear that whoever was behind the killings would come back to finish off the witnesses. 
 ''I wish it were all a dream, that everybody is back,'' she said. Then she shrugged weakly. 
 The killings that night in Villas del Salvarcar, a neighborhood of modest concrete homes in the southeast reaches of this border city, set in motion a blur of political movement that continued Tuesday when President Felipe Calderon visited here for the third time since the shootings. 
 Eager to show that the federal government is committed to ending the drug-related violence that has killed 500 people in Juarez since Jan. 1 -- including three people connected with the United States Consulate who were shot dead on Saturday -- Mr. Calderon turned up with a laundry list of social programs that he hoped would placate the city's increasingly angry citizens.
 In the weeks since the killings in Villas del Salvarcar, the president has changed tack, acknowledging that his emphasis on a military solution to end the violence of the drug gangs will not work by itself. There are 10,000 soldiers and police officers patrolling the city's streets, but every week, the violence seems to grow more brazen. 
 A front-page editorial in El Diario de Juarez asked, ''How can citizens sit down with their authorities to define where to construct a new park or reclaim a public space without the minimum guarantee that their children can go out without being exposed to crime?''
 Lucinda Vargas, the general director of Plan Estrategico de Juarez, a civic group, said that Mr. Calderon was at last beginning to take the right approach, combining a police solution with an emphasis on judicial reform and social programs. 
 ''Initially they thought this could be a quick fix,'' Ms. Vargas said. ''They were surprised that we weren't grateful enough.
 ''I'm not naive to think this is going to end overnight,'' she added. ''If things are moving in the right direction, then that's a threat to organized crime. When you see measures that work, you see a spike in violence. It's that inflection point that I wonder where it's going to be.'' 
 Accompanied to Juarez by his wife, much of his cabinet and the United States ambassador to Mexico, Carlos Pascual, Mr. Calderon announced an expanded antipoverty program, along with scholarships to keep teenagers in high school, at an event in a school gymnasium.
 He spent much of the afternoon in a hotel conference center listening to a recitation of the government's programs from his cabinet, but got irritated responses from civic leaders.
 Guadalupe Diaz Rodriguez, president of the local psychologists' association, said the government's statistics presented a ''fabulous world that we don't perceive.''
 Mr. Calderon acknowledged that the violence was claiming innocent victims but defended what he said was incipient evidence of improvement.
 Mr. Pascual's presence underscored Washington's growing involvement in the modified approach to Mr. Calderon's war against drug traffickers. The Bush and Obama administrations have supported Mr. Calderon's three-year campaign, supplying about $1.3 billion in military and law enforcement aid.
 To continue its support, the Obama administration is expected to announce a $311 million plan for the expansion of joint intelligence units that concentrate on money laundering, as well as additional training for judges, prosecutors and the police. 
 And in a departure, American aid will also go toward strengthening community programs in poor neighborhoods. The Mexican director of the United States Agency for International Development visited Juarez last week to meet with civic groups. 
 The killings of the three people connected with the consulate -- an American Consulate employee and her husband, along with the Mexican husband of another employee -- bring a new urgency to the United States' involvement in Mexico's drug war.
 The bodies of the slain American couple, Lesley A. Enriquez and Arthur H. Redelfs, were returned to El Paso on Tuesday. The investigation is following several lines, including the possibility of mistaken identity, said Special Agent Andrea Simmons, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. field office in El Paso, which is helping Mexican investigators. 
 In Washington, there is increasing disenchantment with the results of the American aid, under what is known as the Merida Initiative. 
 And in Villas del Salvarcar, where those who can have left, there is little hope that all the fuss will make any difference. 
 ''What's he coming here for?'' Gerardo Dominguez, an unemployed deliveryman, said of the president. ''He's not coming to do anything.''

HEADLINE: Teams on Mets' Spring Training Schedule Are Sadly Familiar

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- Spring training is all about fresh starts, getting in shape and taking a look at your competitors before the regular season. For the Mets, that last goal is getting harder to meet.
 In recent years, several major league teams have moved away from the Mets to the other side of Florida or and bolted to Arizona. The result has been fewer teams that play near the Mets' training camp here, about one hour north of West Palm Beach.
 In turn, that has forced the Mets into a schedule in which the lion's share of their games are against just five other teams -- the ones who remain with the Mets in Florida's eastern half. 
 Of the 34 games on the Mets' spring training schedule, 27 are against St. Louis, Florida, Washington, Atlanta and Houston. Even among those five teams, only two -- the Cardinals and Marlins -- are less than an hour's drive away from Port St. Lucie. 
 The Mets find themselves in this quandary because the Los Angeles Dodgers vacated their longtime spring home in Vero Beach for Arizona after the 2008 season and Baltimore followed suit by moving its training camp to Sarasota this season after 14 years in Fort Lauderdale. As a result, the Mets play the Orioles only once this year, rather than four or five times, as in years past.
 Instead, the Mets play the Cardinals and Marlins, who share a stadium in nearby Jupiter, seven times apiece. They also play six times against the Nationals, who play in Viera, 90 minutes north of Port St. Lucie.
 The Yankees, by contrast, play no team more than five times. Their farthest bus trip of spring training is a bit more than two hours, to Viera and Fort Myers. The Mets go to Fort Myers on Wednesday to play Boston, but for them, the trip is closer to three hours.
 And they took that same bus ride last week only to learn that their game against Minnesota was canceled because of rain. 
 Complicating the situation for the Mets is that they are playing half their spring training games against three teams -- the Braves, Marlins and Nationals -- who then play them over and over again in the regular season as members of the National League East. And familiarity can breed contempt, with too many games in spring training having the potential to stoke nasty rivalries, and beanballs, in the summer. 
 ''You hate to see our own division all the time and the potential for bad blood,'' said Dan Warthen, the Mets' pitching coach, in reference to the team's spring schedule.
 The limited variety of the Mets' schedule does not do much for attendance at Port St. Lucie. The loss of the Dodgers was a particular blow because of their popularity, especially with older Mets fans. The Mets drew an average of 5,136 fans to their home games during spring training last year, a decline of 16 percent from 2008, In eight home games this year, they are averaging 4,990 fans, an additional drop of 3 percent.
 The weak economy and the Mets' second straight September collapse in 2008 helped contribute to the sharp drop in attendance last spring, according to Charlotte Lombard, St. Lucie County's manager of tourism development.
 And 2009 was not any better. St. Lucie County has the second-highest foreclosure rate in the state, according to the research firm RealtyTrac. In February, foreclosures rose 39 percent compared with the same month last year.
 The real-estate problems have echoed through the local economy. Core Communities, a major developer in Port St. Lucie and nearby Tradition, failed to pay its annual fee to the county to maintain the naming rights on Tradition Field, the Mets' spring training stadium.
 The company signed separate 10-year naming-rights deals with the county and Mets in 2004. The county, which owns the stadium, uses the proceeds to help pay the $2.6 million worth of bonds that it issued to refurbish the stadium for the Mets. The county said it was owed $95,769.17.
 ''They're in pretty bad shape financially,'' Dan McIntyre, the attorney for St. Lucie County, said of Core Communities. ''The fact that they haven't paid suggests that they're not going to.''
 McIntyre said the county was considering legal action to recoup its money. The Mets confirmed that Core Communities also owed them an annual payment and that they were pursuing the matter.
 Representatives from Core Communities declined comment.

HEADLINE: Fed Affirms Plan to End Mortgage Intervention

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve on Tuesday affirmed its plan to stop buying mortgage-backed securities, expressing a degree of confidence that it could eliminate that pillar of support without undermining the nation's economic recovery.
 The move came as the Fed voted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, at nearly zero percent, citing evidence of economic weakness and little sign of inflation.
 The Fed's purchases of mortgage-backed securities, which will total $1.25 trillion and end March 31, have helped hold mortgage rates to near-record lows, and the Fed left open the possibility that the purchases might have to be resumed, particularly if the housing recovery stalls. 
 The Fed said it would ''continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.''
 Marvin Goodfriend, a former research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said the Fed was essentially conducting an experiment by trying to end its purchases of mortgage securities. ''It would like private money to come back into the mortgage market, but if the interest-rate spread on mortgages over government securities that is needed to bring private money back is too high, it could impede the recovery of the housing market,'' he said.
 Ideally, the Fed would like to see only a slight rise in mortgage rates, he said.
 In announcing that it would hold its benchmark fed funds rate near zero, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's chief policy-setting arm, said that ''the labor market is stabilizing.'' 
 That was a slight improvement over the assessment given after the Fed committee's last meeting, in January, when it said ''the deterioration in the labor market is abating.''
 The committee added: ''Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly. 
 ''However, investment in nonresidential structures is declining, housing starts have been flat at a depressed level, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.''
 The committee maintained its position that ''inflation is likely to be subdued for some time,'' and left the target range for the fed funds rate, the rate that banks make overnight loans to each other, at zero to 0.25 percent, where it has been since December 2008. 
 And as it has said since last March, the committee projected that the rate would probably remain ''exceptionally low'' for ''an extended period.'' Many economists have taken that language to mean that the Fed would not begin tightening monetary policy until the second half of this year.
 As of last week, the Fed has bought just over $1 trillion in mortgage-related assets, through a program that started in November 2008. It also had bought, as of Wednesday, $169 billion out of a target of $175 billion in debt guaranteed by federal mortgage-financing agencies, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 Stephen H. Axilrod, a retired Fed official and the author of ''Inside the Fed,'' a book about monetary policy, said of the committee members: ''They're gathering the nerve to end this response to the crisis and revert to normal, which is not to buy large amounts of long-term securities to lower interest rates.''
 Traditionally, the Fed's balance sheet has mostly comprised safe Treasury-securities. 
 But Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting company, said the end of the asset purchases would ''expose M2,'' a measure of the money supply, ''to the full force of the credit contraction, and it won't be pretty.''
 He wrote in a research note: ''The Fed reserves the right to buy assets again if needed; we think it will have to.''
 Mr. Goodfriend, now a professor of economics at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University, said: ''The Fed can't fund the mortgage market forever. There has to be an exit where the Fed pulls out, lets the spread move around a little, and assures investors that they can get a return commensurate with the current risk in housing.''
 So far, the gradual tapering off of the purchases has not had a major effect on mortgage interest rates, which many Fed officials view as an encouraging sign. 
 The committee approved its public statement by a vote of 9 to 1. Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who is known for his wariness about inflation, dissented, as he did in January. 
 Mr. Hoenig ''believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted because it could lead to the buildup of financial imbalances and increase risks to longer-run macroeconomic and financial stability,'' the Fed said in its statement.
 With interest rates unable to go any lower, the Fed has had to use other instruments of monetary policy to help stimulate growth. Chief among those tools has been the asset purchases.
 ''The Fed, if it wanted to, and it may yet need to, could continue buying assets and expanding its balance sheet,'' Mr. Goodfriend said. 
 ''That's an option the Fed has, even though interest rate policy is immobilized at zero. The reason we have a central bank is that it retains flexibility to move in either direction, depending on what the economy requires. It needs to make the most of that flexibility, because it's very hard to see the future.''
 The Fed also injected liquidity into the markets by making huge amounts of loans at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008.
 Less than a month ago, the Fed took steps to normalize lending by raising the interest rate it charges on short-term loans to banks to 0.75 percent, from 0.50 percent. 
 While the Fed emphasized that the change in the discount rate did not represent a shift in monetary policy, it was interpreted by some as a clear sign that an extraordinary era of easy money was going to end gradually.

HEADLINE: After Three Suspected Suicides, A Shaken Cornell Reaches Out

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
ITHACA, N.Y. -- All weekend, Cornell University's residential advisers knocked on dorm rooms to inquire how students were coping.
 On Monday and Tuesday, the start of a stressful exam week before spring break, professors interrupted classes to tell students they cared for them not just academically, but personally. Both days, the university president, Dr. David J. Skorton, took out a full-page ad in the campus paper, The Cornell Daily Sun, saying: ''Your well-being is the foundation on which your success is built. If you learn anything at Cornell, please learn to ask for help.''
 The university is on high alert about the mental health of its students after the apparent suicides of three of them in less than a month in the deep gorges rending the campus. The deaths, two on successive days last week, have cast a pall over the university and revived talk of Cornell's reputation -- unsupported, say officials -- as a high-stress ''suicide school.''
 ''I think everybody's kind of shaken. I know I am,'' said Nicole Wagner, a 19-year-old freshman from Newport Beach, Calif. ''I wanted to go home.'' 
 She was crossing the Thurston Avenue Bridge, which was strewn with red carnations and affixed with fresh stickers for a suicide prevention telephone line. 
 On Thursday, the body of a sophomore engineering student, William Sinclair, of Chevy Chase, Md., was recovered from the rugged gorge more than 70 feet below the bridge, where the fierce waters of Fall Creek sluice through a narrow corridor. The body of Bradley Ginsburg, a freshman from Boca Raton, Fla., was found in the same vicinity on Feb. 17.
 Then on Friday, Matthew Zika, a junior engineering student from Lafayette, Ind., died when he dropped from a suspension foot bridge a short distance downstream, according to the university. Rescue workers have yet to recover his body in the rain-swollen creek.
 The Ithaca Police Department is investigating both of last week's deaths, but the university is responding as if they were suicides. Besides aggressive mental health outreach, Cornell has stationed guards on the bridges through the end of the week.
 ''While we know that our gorges are beautiful features of our campus, they can be scary places at times like this,'' Susan Murphy, the vice president for student and academic services, said in a video message posted on a new Web site,caringcommunity.cornell.edu. 
 As disturbing as the recent deaths are, they are just the latest of 10 by enrolled students this academic year, including deaths from illness, accident and no fewer than six ruled as suicides by the county medical examiner or still under investigation, according to campus officials.
 Last Thursday, e-mail blasts went out to 35,000 students and faculty and staff members acknowledging Mr. Sinclair's death, followed by a message to parents and one from the college president.
 ''Unbelievably, shockingly, we had to do the same thing the next day,'' said Thomas Bruce, the vice president for communications.
 Despite the half-dozen known or suspected suicides this year, Timothy Marchell, a clinical psychologist in Cornell's campus health services whose specialties include suicide, said that, historically, Cornell suicides have not been higher than what national statistics predict for a university population of 20,000 students: about two per year.
 Between 2000 and 2005, there were 10 confirmed suicides, Dr. Marchell said, and from the beginning of 2006 through the beginning of this academic year, there were none. 
 Dr. Marchell said he was ''well acquainted with the perception of Cornell as a suicide school,'' having grown up in Ithaca and graduated from Cornell. But it is an urban legend, he said, largely fueled by the fact that suicides there are often shockingly public.
 ''When someone dies by suicide in a gorge, it's a very visible public act,'' he said.
 Cornell's mental health outreach in recent years, which has attracted national attention, is intended to bring students who are at risk, and who might not seek help, into counseling. Custodians are trained to look for signs of emotional trouble when cleaning out dorms; therapists hold open-door hours at 10 campus locations; and a faculty handbook advises professors about how to spot students' distress in its many contemporary forms, from disturbing artwork to clothes that disguise self-mutilation.
 Despite these efforts, Dr. Skorton said in an interview, ''We are not getting the job done,'' adding that suicide among young people is a national health crisis and is not specific to one campus. Administrators at Cornell have been ''very intensively reassessing'' existing programs in recent weeks, he said. 
 Around campus, students and staff wondered whether some combination of familiar stresses -- the long upstate New York winter, classroom demands of an Ivy League university -- and new factors, like the evaporation of internships and jobs for graduates during a bleak recession, had provoked the recent deaths.
 Dr. Marchell cautioned that it is almost impossible to link broad causes to suicide rates, that ''the psychology of suicide can be very individual.'' 
 He and others, however, are concerned that students' deaths may lower barriers for others who are contemplating it. ''We have to be thinking about the potential influence on the collective psychology,'' he said.
 Mr. Zika, the most recent to die, was remembered by friends not as lonely and stressed-out, but as quick to laugh and a caring friend -- he drove for hours during the recent winter break from New York to Indiana visiting friends, recalled Deirdre Mulligan, one of those he dropped in on. 
 Mr. Zika, who had been a star baseball player in high school, played Ultimate Frisbee with Cornell friends, wrote poetry on his Facebook page and had a tattoo with a lyric from the rock band Incubus: ''If the wind blew me in the right direction, would I even care? I would.''
 Nicole Huynh, a junior who began dating Mr. Zika last semester, said in an e-mail message: ''During this current semester, some who knew him more than others could see he was having a rough time. He'd talk, but it wasn't as much. He slept more than usual. Didn't feel motivated about some things. Tried distancing himself, little by little.''
 She does not think the stress of studies pushed him to the edge, but rather troubles he carried from early in life. She suspected he was having suicidal thoughts, and both she and Ms. Mulligan said close friends had urged him to seek counseling, but they did not know if he did. The university declined to comment, citing privacy laws.
 Ms. Huynh said she and Mr. Zika agreed to suspend their relationship a few weeks ago as he pushed her away.
 ''Many people listened and cared a lot about him,'' Ms. Huynh said. ''But no matter how great his support system was, his mind was set, and he was going to do whatever he wanted to do.''

HEADLINE: Good for Europe's Exports, Not So Good for Europe

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- It used to be easy to sum up the way European business executives viewed exchange rates: a strong dollar was good; a strong euro was bad.
 Most still think that, but as the euro glides down from the peak of more than $1.50 it reached in November, trading on Tuesday at $1.37, some problems are emerging that complicate the picture.
 Yes, the weaker euro is good for European exporters. It makes it easier for their cars, machinery and beer to compete on price abroad and makes every sale to the United States -- and to countries like China whose currencies are closely tied to the dollar -- more valuable in euros.
 The weakening euro also is good news for Greece, Spain and Portugal, which are suffering from excessive trade deficits and struggling to become more competitive in world markets. 
 ''I haven't heard of anybody who is sad about it,'' said Ralph Wiechers, the chief economist of the German Engineering Federation, an industry group in Frankfurt that represents makers of machine tools and other capital goods.
 But there is also a range of negative effects. The cost of oil and other raw materials priced in dollars is rising. Consumer prices could come under pressure because goods imported from outside Europe become more expensive in euro terms.
 More important, there is a queasy feeling that the decline of the euro makes an uncomfortable statement about Europe's chronic tendency to underperform the United States in economic growth.
 The euro's decline reflects the harsh verdict of investors on the Greek debt crisis and the monetary union's inability to insure that its members adhere to basic principles of fiscal prudence.
 ''It's more of a euro weakness than a dollar strength,'' said Ulf Schneider, chief executive of Fresenius, a German health care company. ''The whole world is watching, and there is some doubt about the euro.''
 The euro has bounced back from its recent low of about $1.35 in February, reflecting more optimism that Greece is taking decisive steps to reduce its 12.7 percent budget deficit. A short spike back to $1.40 or so is possible over the next few weeks as investors who bet against the euro unwind their positions, currency analysts at Commerzbank in Frankfurt said.
 On Monday, the euro slipped against the dollar to $1.3672 in late trading in New York amid uncertainty about whether European economic ministers meeting in Brussels would figure out a way to help Greece while maintaining pressure on Greek leaders to reduce their deficit. Those concerns subsided somewhat on Tuesday after Standard & Poor's announced that it was taking Greece off its negative credit watch, lowering the threat of a downgrade. The euro rebounded to $1.3756. 
 Over the next year or so, analysts say, the euro is likely to continue declining as United States growth accelerates more quickly than Europe's. And the dollar may get an extra push from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise official interest rates faster than the European Central Bank will. Along with brisker United States growth, higher interest rates will make it more attractive for investors to own dollar assets. 
 ''The Fed is expected to raise late this year, and then move more quickly,'' said Antje Praefcke, a senior foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, who predicts the euro will fall to $1.20 by the end of the year. ''The E.C.B. isn't expected to raise rates until next year and then move slowly.''
 These days, though, what may matter most to businesses is not the absolute value of the euro but its stability. Above all, European business leaders hope the euro will avoid any sudden moves.
 ''Companies plan a year to 18 months ahead,'' Ms. Praefcke said. ''If there are very strong currency movements, companies don't have time to react and hedge.''
 The last two years have been a roller-coaster ride. After climbing fairly steadily for more than two years, the euro peaked near $1.60 in July 2008. But amid the financial crisis, the euro -- and most other major currencies -- suffered a series of violent swings. The euro plunged to $1.2453 in November 2008, then gyrated wildly several more times before reaching the recent peak of more than $1.50 in December.
 ''More important than the absolute level is the amount of volatility you see and how fast these swings are happening,'' Mr. Schneider of Fresenius said. Last year, he said, the swings were ''a little too fast for what a normal company is set up to adjust to.''
 Big moves by the dollar, euro and yen also sent shock waves through less widely circulated currencies in eastern Europe or Asia. The volatility was expensive for exporters like Volkswagen, which suffered 1.2 billion euros (about $1.65 billion) in costs associated with exchange-rate fluctuations by the Russian ruble and other currencies in 2009, analysts at UniCredit said in a note.
 ''As these currencies are stabilizing, a significantly lower amount can be expected in 2010,'' wrote Christian Aust, an analyst at UniCredit in Munich.
 Heineken, the Dutch brewer, also suffered from the steep devaluations in emerging market currencies. A 23 percent plunge in the Polish zloty took 37 million euros from 2009 revenue, Heineken said in February. By contrast, a weaker dollar in comparison to 2008 cut revenue by a relatively small 17 million euros, according to the company, which is based in Amsterdam.
 Companies have made strenuous efforts in the last decade to insulate themselves from currency shocks. It is routine even for smaller companies to hedge on financial markets, insuring themselves against future exchange rate movements. In addition, firms like Daimler, BMW or the software maker SAP have expanded operations in the United States to match production costs with sales.
 For many companies, currency swings are fairly far down on the list of things that keep their managers up at night. 
 ''We don't see the currency situation as anything very dramatic,'' said Stefan Ingildsen, vice president for finance and investor relations at the William Demant Holding Group, a Danish company whose products include Oticon hearing aids. Denmark is not a member of the euro zone, but the Danish krone closely tracks the euro.
 Mr. Ingildsen's relaxed attitude might seem surprising considering that the company gets 35 percent of its sales from the United States and makes most of its products in Europe. But the company buffers itself against dollar fluctuations by purchasing most of its components in China from suppliers that take payment in dollars, a form of so-called natural hedging.
 As a result, the stronger dollar -- which has also risen against the Danish krone -- will add only 1 to 2 percent to operating profit in 2010, Mr. Ingildsen said.
 Even rising energy prices are not unambiguously bad for European companies. Costly oil plays to Europe's strengths in energy-saving technology, spurring demand for wind energy produced by Iberdrola Renovables of Spain or wind turbines made by Siemens or Vestas in Denmark.
 Mr. Wiechers, the machinery industry economist, said, ''It's a chance to succeed on the market with innovative products.''

HEADLINE: Drug Giants Lag Where Sales Boom, Study Says

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
The leading drug makers need to move quickly to adapt to a new world order in which some emerging markets are set to overtake some established national markets in pharmaceutical sales, according to a report issued Tuesday. 
 Next year, the report predicted, drug sales in China will outpace those of France and of Germany, while Brazil will be buying more medications than Britain. The report was issued by IMS Health, a research company based in Norwalk, Conn., that tracks prescriptions and other data on drug sales.
Unless the world's current leaders in brand-name drugs move more nimbly to expand into those emerging markets, they will miss the big growth opportunities and cede those markets to local players, the report said. 
 Annual growth of pharmaceutical sales in mature markets like the United States and Western Europe has slowed to the low single digits in the last eight years. The slowdown is a result of the worldwide economic crisis, but also of patent expirations on a variety of name-brand drugs, growing use of generic drugs, reduced investments in biotechnology and tighter government restrictions on the pharmaceutical market, the report said.
 The United States drug market had sales last year of about $300 billion, with an annual growth rate of 5 percent, IMS said. And even if Congress passes health care legislation, which, according to a recent Credit Suisse report, could increase drug sales by $10.7 billion, the impact on the growth rate would be minimal. 
 By contrast, IMS said, 17 emerging markets are poised for significant growth. The report grouped the countries, which IMS has called the ''pharmerging markets,'' into three tiers in descending order of market value growth. China alone occupies the top tier. The second tier comprises Brazil, Russia and India, while the third tier includes Venezuela, Poland, Argentina, Turkey and Mexico. 
 Last year, those countries accounted for $123 billion -- about 16 percent -- of more than $770 billion in global drug sales, IMS said. The emerging market sales represented 37 percent of industry growth.
 By 2013, those same countries are estimated to bring in an additional $90 billion in sales accounting for 48 percent of industry growth, the report said. Over all, emerging markets will represent about 21 percent of total drug sales in 2013, IMS executives said in an interview. 
 It estimated that China, the leader of the pack in emerging markets, would account for $40 billion in additional sales by 2013. ''These traditionally peripheral economies are gearing up to turn the tables on the established pharmaceutical world order,'' the report said. 
 Certainly, developed markets like the United States and Japan still represent a vast majority of pharmaceutical sales. Even so, the report urged leading drug makers to move faster to capitalize on high-growth emerging markets, where they already face competition from entrenched domestic producers with well-established brands.
 A few European drug makers, including Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline, have been forging ahead by acquiring local companies or increasing their local partnerships in those countries -- or by making major investments in research and development in developing markets.
 But, over all, the leading drug makers are underperforming in emerging markets. The top 15 pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Merck and Eli Lilly, together derive less than 10 percent of their sales from emerging markets, IMS said.
 To build profitable businesses in these countries, drug makers must tailor their approaches to the specific dynamics and challenges of each market, Murray Aitken, a senior vice president at IMS, said in an interview Tuesday. Some emerging markets for pharmaceuticals have been particularly hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis, he said.
 ''In Romania, the situation is rather dire,'' Mr. Aitken said. ''Turkey is in bad shape.''
 He added, ''Welcome to the realities of doing business in these sorts of environments.''

HEADLINE: Why Consumers Can't Trust the Fed

BYLINE: By DANIEL CARPENTER. 
Daniel Carpenter is a professor of government and director of the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 ON Monday, Senator Christopher Dodd unveiled his proposal to reform the nation's financial regulatory system, including a new agency to protect consumers from predatory practices like teaser mortgages and misleading credit card contracts. 
 It's a great idea, save for a fatal flaw. As a sop to Republicans, Senator Dodd's plan lodges the agency in the very organization that dropped the ball in America's consumer finance crisis: the Federal Reserve. 
 The Fed has a long and largely undistinguished history of consumer protection. During the 1970s, officials at the Fed opposed the Community Reinvestment Act, which attacked home lending discrimination, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which compelled banks to reveal their lending patterns. 
 When these became law, the Fed limply enforced them; it gave the same treatment to the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, passed in 1994. 
 The Fed also sat on the sidelines during the housing bubble. Many Fed officials supported the explosion in subprime lending, and they seemed to look the other way as foreclosures soared in the latter half of 2006. 
 Even at the height of the crisis, Fed governors rarely mentioned consumer protection. Indeed, it wasn't until two Democratic representatives, William Delahunt of Delaware and Brad Miller of North Carolina, proposed an independent consumer agency on March 10, 2009, that the Fed began to talk the talk of consumer protection; it's probably no coincidence that the first public mention of consumer protection regulation by Fed officials in the entire aftermath of the financial crisis came on March 19, 2009, when a Fed governor, Daniel Tarullo, spoke about it at a hearing. 
 At this point, the Fed, and in particular its chairman, Ben Bernanke, seemed to find religion. Last July, it proposed rule revisions that would simplify the fine print on mortgages and highlight risky features of a loan. Two months later, it said that credit cards should be subject to similar regulatory reform, and Mr. Bernanke followed in October with a proposal for a council of risk regulators that would also oversee consumer issues.
 It wasn't all talk: according to its own data, the Fed's enforcement actions against banks and lenders also began increasing over the past year, particularly after Congress took up the idea of an independent regulator. From a post-crisis average of eight announced enforcement actions per month, the Fed doubled its announcements to 16 actions per month once an independent agency was proposed. 
 But this new seriousness doesn't mean the Fed is the right place for a consumer protection agency. For one, the Fed is above all concerned with inflation and other systemic risks to the economy; given a conflict between avoiding threats to the economy and consumer protection, is it reasonable or fair to expect it to choose the latter? 
 And, conflicts of interest aside, the Fed has yet to show it can truly protect consumers. Regulation is often a cat-and-mouse game in which officials must constantly anticipate how banks and lenders will respond to the government's rules and activities and adapt regulation in turn. Reactive ''regulation for show,'' as we've seen from the Fed since March 2009, is not enough.
 Senator Dodd's proposal attempts to seal off the agency within the Fed, giving it rulemaking authority subject to the veto of a council of regulators. But independence will be impossible to enforce in practice, since nothing in the bill would prevent the Fed from lobbying the council or other regulators reviewing the bureau's rules -- and Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues would surely carry a lot of weight.
 Embedding consumer protection in the Fed could be worse than imperfect. By giving the imprimatur of a consumer protection office to an agency that has long resisted consumer protection, Congress risks creating a false sense of security among policymakers and the public. The Fed's politically reactive posture is the exact opposite of the sustained care that consumer financial protection demands.

HEADLINE: The Perils Of Pay Less, Get More

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As a society gets richer, its tax rates tend to rise.
 This idea is known as Wagner's Law, named for the 19th-century economist who came up with it. Citizens of richer societies generally prefer more government services, Adolf Wagner explained. With their basic needs met, they want a military to protect them, good schools for their children, comfortable retirement for the elderly, medical care even when it isn't profitable and a strong social safety net. 
 Sure enough, the United States followed this path for most of the last century. In 1900, federal taxes amounted to just 2 percent of gross domestic product. By 2000, the share had risen to 21 percent.
 Over the last couple of decades, though, we have repealed Wagner's Law -- or, more to the point, only partly repealed it. Taxes are no longer rising. They fell to 18 percent of G.D.P. in 2008 and, because of the recession, to a 60-year low of 15.1 percent last year. 
 Yet our desire for government services just keeps growing. We added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Farm subsidies are sacrosanct. Social Security is the third rail of politics.
 This disconnect is, far and away, the main reason for our huge budget problems. Yes, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the recession and the stimulus have all added to the deficit. But they are minor issues in the long run. By 2020, government spending is projected to equal 26 percent (and rising) of G.D.P., mostly because of Medicare and Social Security. Taxes are on pace to equal just 19 percent.
 On Friday, Congressional Republicans named six members of a deficit commission that President Obama created last month. In all, the commission will have 10 Democratic members and eight Republicans. It is scheduled to issue its recommendations late this year.
 ''By any reasonable projection, we're on an utterly unsustainable path,'' Peter Orszag, the White House budget director, told me last week. ''And the fiscal commission, while not guaranteed to succeed, offers the best hope of getting ahead of this problem before it becomes a true crisis.'' 
 The commission can succeed, of course, only if it comes up with solutions that Congress and the White House accept. For now, political leaders in both parties are still in denial about what the solution will entail. To be fair, so is much of the public.
 What needs to happen? Spending will need to be cut, and taxes will need to rise. They won't need to rise just on households making more than $250,000, as Mr. Obama has suggested. They will probably need to rise on your household, however much you make.
 A solution that relied only on spending cuts would dismantle some bedrock parts of modern American society. Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, recently released such a plan, and it got rid of Medicare for everyone now under 55. 
 A solution that relied only on taxes would muzzle economic growth. To cover the costs of future spending -- the retirement of the baby boomers and everything else -- federal taxes would have to rise by almost 50 percent, immediately and permanently, according to a recent analysis by the economists Alan Auerbach and William Gale.
 A solution that combined spending cuts and tax increases would not need to be ruinous -- or start in the next couple of years, when unemployment is likely to remain high. But the federal government does have a decent amount of fat in it. And, just as Wagner pointed out, tax increases are not inherently bad. Done right, they do not even have to reduce economic growth by much. 
 In recent years, economic research has suggested that moderate changes in the tax law don't actually have a huge impact on growth. You don't need econometrics to grasp this, either. Just look at the last 20 years. Economic growth after Bill Clinton's tax increases was far more rapid than economic growth after George W. Bush's tax cuts. Despite the Bush tax cuts, average annual growth over the last decade -- even before the Great Recession began -- was slower than in any decade since World War II.
 The biggest hurdle to solving the deficit problem will be politics, not economics. Even if the tax increases and spending cuts don't need to be ruinous, they will not be popular. None of us like the idea of losing benefits or paying more taxes. That's why Mr. Obama and Congress have outsourced the first stage of the process to a commission.
 On the spending side, health care is easily the biggest item. Not only will many people in their 50s and 60s live into their 80s, but technological advances will make medical care for any individual person much more expensive in the future. 
 A crucial aspect of the final health reform bills is that they take early steps toward trying to distinguish between care that makes people healthier and care that does not. These steps, along with some Medicare cuts, are the reason that many economists think the bills will reduce the deficit. The bills will also make it easier for Medicare to make further changes in the future. 
 Beyond heath care, Social Security benefits could be reduced for high-income households, and the annual inflation adjustment could be trimmed (making it more accurate, some economists believe). Many corporate subsidies -- for agribusinesses and banks, among others -- serve no useful economic function. Some military contractors could also stand to be squeezed. 
 Don't expect that any one program can close the deficit, though. Military spending, for example, already takes up a much smaller share of the budget than a few decades ago, as Douglas Elmendorf, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, said last week. Without the end of the cold war, the deficit might have already soared.
 On taxes, the affluent can certainly stand to pay higher rates than they have. Over the last three decades, they have received both the biggest pretax pay increases and the biggest tax cuts. But there is not enough money at the top to eliminate the long-term fiscal gap. Households making more than $250,000 pay federal taxes equal to only about 5 percent of G.D.P. 
 The ideal way to raise taxes for everyone else is not through the income tax code -- which can affect people's incentive to work -- but through another means. As Victoria Perry of the International Monetary Fund points out, every industrialized country in the world except Saudi Arabia and the United States has some kind of consumption tax. A modest consumption tax would give households more incentive to save and could raise significant revenue. Another option is to reduce some big deductions, like the one for mortgage interest.
 I'll confess that I have a hard time seeing how any of this will happen in the next few years, no matter what the deficit commission recommends. Congressional Republicans have shown little willingness to consider any tax increases, and Mr. Obama has shown no indication of breaking his $250,000-and-under pledge. We voters, meanwhile, tend to oppose government spending in general while supporting the government programs that the spending pays for.
 But a lot can happen in a few years. For one thing, interest rates on government bonds are likely to rise, making the need to reduce the deficit more pressing. ''It doesn't seem like policy makers are currently afraid of the bond market,'' Mr. Orszag says, ''and I wish that weren't the case.'' Someday soon, they may have to be.

HEADLINE: Christie Calls For Sharp Cuts In State Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
TRENTON -- Christopher J. Christie, the first Republican elected governor of New Jersey in 12 years, unveiled a $29.3 billion budget on Tuesday that relies almost exclusively on spending cuts to reverse the sagging fortunes of a state he sees as battered by the recession and choking on its tax burden.
 To close a deficit that he asserted was approaching $11 billion, Governor Christie called for the layoffs of 1,300 state workers, closings of state psychiatric institutions, an $820 million cut in aid to public schools, and nearly a half-billion dollars less in aid to towns and cities. He also suspended until May 2011 a popular property-tax rebate program, breaking one of his own campaign promises.
 Democrats were quick to characterize Mr. Christie's proposal as falling disproportionately on the backs of the middle class, the poor, the elderly, schoolchildren, college students and inner-city residents, while leaving largely unscathed the wealthy and most businesses. 
 But Mr. Christie was ready for that line of attack. 
 ''Today, we are fulfilling the promise of a smaller government that lives within its means,'' he said at a joint legislative session here. ''The defenders of the status quo have already begun to yell and scream. They will try to demonize me. They will seek to divide us rather than unite us. But even they know in their hearts, if not yet in their minds -- it is time for a change.'' 
 Mr. Christie's budget stands as a stark example of how a fiscal conservative determined not to raise taxes grapples with the budget of a once-expansive, now-humbled state government in challenging economic times. 
 Over all, his budget would spend $29.3 billion, including $1 billion in remaining federal stimulus money. Setting that aside, it represents a 5 percent reduction in state spending. 
 New Jersey's budget crunch is hardly unique; dozens of states face similar predicaments. But a budget relying almost exclusively on spending cuts puts the state in a much smaller peer group, along with Florida, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia -- all led by Republicans, a number of them with national aspirations. 
 ''Time has run out, and the bill has come due,'' Mr. Christie said in a speech frequently interrupted for applause, mostly from Republicans.
 The budget would probably mean higher property taxes for most homeowners, at least in the short term, as local governments try to make up for the diminished state financing. But the governor is also proposing constitutional amendments and legislation to cap property taxes and spending at the local, county and school-district level.
 Mr. Christie campaigned last year attacking the teachers' and public workers' unions and their costly contracts, and his budget lived up to his words: The $820 million cut in school aid is 7 percent of the total funding, and the 1,300 state workers being laid off come from a work force of about 65,000.
 The governor said ''the watchwords of this budget are shared sacrifice and fairness,'' yet his spending plan calls for only modest tax increases on insurers and hospitals, eliminates the film-production tax credit, and halves a tax credit for high-tech businesses.
 The battle to ensue is likely to shape up around the so-called millionaire's tax, a one-year income-tax surcharge on people making more than $400,000 that Mr. Christie vowed not to renew. (Democrats allowed it to lapse in December.) If that surcharge were renewed, it would bring in close to $1 billion.
 In his speech, Mr. Christie affirmed his stance on the issue, saying New Jersey's tax burden was already the nation's costliest. ''Mark my words today: If a tax increase is sent to my desk, I will veto it,'' he said.
 He said that to accede to any tax increases would be to ''kill a job market already on life support.''
 Democrats greeted this with dismay, while vowing to work closely with the governor on the budget. 
 ''The fact that the governor took that higher income tax off the table, I think is a major mistake on his part,'' said the Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, a Gloucester County Democrat who has been an ally of Mr. Christie's in cutting public-sector pensions. ''This is a very cold budget. There has to be a little more compassion for the middle class and poor, because all the burden is being put on them.''
 Indeed, Mr. Christie's budget would squeeze those with lower incomes by eliminating cash welfare for the able-bodied, imposing new $310 deductibles and doubling some drug co-payments for Medicaid patients, cutting state-financed school breakfasts and rental assistance and trimming the state's earned-income tax credit to 20 percent of the federal benefit, from 25 percent.
 Jon Shure, an expert on state finances at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning group in Washington, said he believed this would be the first time a state had reduced its earned-income tax credit.
 ''That's the kind of decision that could be avoided by going for more on the revenue side,'' he said. ''You're spreading the pain to the lowest-income working people in the state.''
 Mr. Christie also wants to make steep cuts in aid to towns and counties, impound the $88 million in sales taxes collected in urban enterprise zones, and eliminate efforts by his predecessor, Jon S. Corzine, to prod local governments to consolidate or share expenses.
 Mr. Corzine cut property-tax rebates for homeowners last year, though he preserved them for the elderly, the disabled and people making less than $75,000. Mr. Christie, positioning himself as a champion of the middle class, attacked the cuts fiercely and vowed to restore a portion of the rebates.
 But in his budget, he is now canceling rebates entirely until next year, when they will begin showing up as credits on quarterly property-tax bills instead of arriving in the mail as yearly refund checks.
 He also wants to reduce by attrition the so-called senior freeze that caps property taxes for the elderly, by not admitting new homeowners into the program.
 Mr. Christie pointed to a few areas that were spared: state parks, food banks, prescription-drug coverage for the elderly and health insurance coverage for children. He called for sizable increases in food-stamp eligibility and in charity care, which pays hospital bills for the indigent. But taxes on hospitals would rise by $45 million.
 The governor took pains to mitigate some of his cuts. The sharp reduction in school aid will be apportioned to limit the blow to any one district to 5 percent of its current-year budget. Districts relying on the state for less than that will see their state aid eliminated. Administration officials could not immediately say how many fell into that category.
 Similarly, a broad reduction in state aid to municipalities was structured to raise the tax bill of the average taxpayer in each town by $250. 
 Mr. Christie's idea for a 2.5 percent cap on increases in property taxes, modeled on Proposition 2 1/2 in Massachusetts, would allow no exceptions except by local referendum and would apply to towns, school boards and counties. He also is calling for new handcuffs on towns and school districts as they bargain with unions, to prohibit towns from awarding contracts with pay increases, including benefits, of more than 2.5 percent.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 18, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the deep spending cuts planned by Gov. Christopher J. Christie of New Jersey referred incorrectly to his call for new $310 deductibles and a doubling of some drug co-payments. Those measures would apply to participants in a state prescription-drug plan for the elderly and disabled, not to Medicaid patients.

HEADLINE: Will China Listen?

 BODY:
The drumbeat of complaints in Washington about China's manipulation of its currency -- and the deafening silence pretty much everywhere else -- might lead one to think that this is just an American problem. It isn't. 
 China's decision to base its economic growth on exporting deliberately undervalued goods is threatening economies around the world. It is fueling huge trade deficits in the United States and Europe. Even worse, it is crowding out exports from other developing countries, threatening their hopes of recovery. 
 After treading lightly on the subject of China, President Obama vowed last month to ''get much tougher'' about China's cheap currency. On Monday, 130 members of Congress sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, demanding that the Obama administration designate China as a currency manipulator in a report due to Congress next month. On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill aimed to force the administration's hand. This would ease the way to imposing retaliatory trade barriers against Chinese goods.
 So far, China has been defiant. On Sunday, after the close of the annual National People's Congress, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao rejected American complaints as ''a kind of trade protectionism'' and made clear that he had no plan to do anything differently. 
 Since 2003, China's central bank has been purchasing huge amounts of dollars to keep the value of its currency, the renminbi, artificially low against the dollar. China backed away somewhat in 2005, allowing its currency to appreciate slowly from 8.25 renminbi to the dollar to about 6.83 renminbi by 2008. As the global recession hit, China slammed on the brakes in order to protect its exports. The renminbi has remained at about 6.83 since then, and the pain has been felt in countries as far apart as Mexico and India. 
 Beijing's intervention is a textbook example of the beggar-thy-neighbor competitive devaluation forbidden by the International Monetary Fund's charter. 
 The challenge now is how to persuade China to at least moderate its strategy without unleashing something even more destructive. As the decibel level has risen in Washington, Chinese officials have implicitly warned that they could retaliate by dumping Treasury bills from their central bank's $2.4 trillion cache. 
 This would be risky for both countries. The move would weaken the dollar and lessen the value of China's holdings. The United States might weather a sell-off or even benefit from the drop in the dollar's value, but any precipitous move could further disrupt the skittish financial markets. And Beijing has other potential weapons, like tariffs and quotas. There is no guarantee of rationality in these showdowns. The fallout from a trade war would be felt around the world. 
 It makes a lot more sense to address the problem in a multilateral setting, where China couldn't portray itself as a weak, righteous fighter holding out against arbitrary American power. Retaliation, or even the threat, would carry more legitimacy if it were part of a multilateral agreement and done on a world stage. 
 One way would be to press the I.M.F. to officially pronounce on whether China is breaking the rules and manipulating its exchange rate. That is part of the fund's job, though it has preferred not to pick the fight. China would find it far harder to reject an I.M.F. determination than any American criticism. It could open the door for other aggrieved trading nations to eventually seek legal redress at the World Trade Organization.
 Even before that, it would help if some other countries -- certainly those in the European Union, but perhaps aspiring players including India and South Korea -- started publicly making the case that the cheap renminbi is hurting them, too.
 The world's battered economy is certainly in no shape to keep absorbing China's exports, subsidized through a cheap currency policy. The more countries that say this, the more likely Beijing will consider changing course -- and the less likely this disagreement will escalate into a fight that no one can win.

HEADLINE: A Good Deal for the Everglades

 BODY:
The effort to restore Florida's Everglades has been revived thanks to the efforts of President Obama and Florida's Republican governor, Charlie Crist. The Obama administration has committed more than $300 million in new money, and construction on important projects -- including lifting a section of the Tamiami Trail to bring freshwater to the Everglades -- is under way. 
 Last week, the state agency that oversees the restoration voted unanimously to press forward with Mr. Crist's controversial -- but potentially game-changing -- $536 million deal to buy 73,000 acres of land from the United States Sugar Corporation. The land would eventually be taken out of agricultural production, removing a major source of pollution, and converted into reservoirs and artificial marshes to store and clean water for later release into the Everglades during the dry season. 
 The agency -- the South Florida Water Management District -- had been under mounting pressure to kill the deal. Florida Crystals, another big and politically connected sugar company, lobbied ferociously against the deal with its rival. Some environmentalists complained that Mr. Crist paid too much and that the cost of the deal would crowd out other restoration projects. 
 But some of those projects -- a string of underground storage wells, for instance -- made little sense to begin with and none are as important as the land deal. The payout to United States Sugar and some other aspects of the deal seem excessive. But the agency can negotiate the price downward or cancel the arrangement if United States Sugar refuses to bargain or if the economy keeps tanking and the deal becomes unaffordable. 
 What the taxpayers need to remember is that this is a very good deal for the environment. Without an ample supply of clean, fresh water, the Everglades will never be restored to anything approaching their former vitality. 
 There is no shortage of rainfall in Florida. What's in short supply is places to store it during the rainy season when Lake Okeechobee overflows, places from which the water can be released when it is needed during the dry season to nourish wildlife, prevent catastrophic fire and provide clean water to Florida Bay. 
 Far more will have to happen to restore the water flows that once sustained the Everglades. But the United States Sugar lands are a critically important first step.

HEADLINE: Testing Obama, at Home and Abroad

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the last days of the 2008 presidential campaign, Joseph Biden warned that ''It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy.'' The young new president, his running mate declared, would face ''crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy.''
 But Mr. Obama's first test was a global financial crisis -- not quite what Mr. Biden seemed to have in mind that day. The mettle-testing by foreign adversaries has so far played out in slow motion. 
 And at the moment, he is being tested mainly by friends and allies, ranging from the Democrats in Congress to the Israelis. That, too, presents political dangers.
 ''Any president can stand having his enemies confront him,'' said David Rothkopf, a noted expert in the exercise of presidential power. ''But when your own allies are disrespecting you, that's when presidents have to decide where to draw the line. And the in the past 14 months the impression that's been drawn, fairly or not, is that Obama is unwilling to draw lines in the sand.'' 
 By the end of the week we may have learned a lot about Mr. Obama's handling of those he leads.
 In the health care debate, he has moved from the cool-rationalist phase to the Lyndon Johnson strong-arming phase, from professorial argument on the merits to mobilization, even muscling, of the 216 votes he is seeking in the House of Representatives. 
 And on the world stage, after a remarkable week of open conflict with the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhahu, which in the words of one White House official ''undermined Biden's entire trip'' to the Middle East last week by announcing a plan to build 1,600 new housing units in East Jerusalem while the vice president was in Israel, Mr. Obama is facing the kind of moment Kennedy did when world leaders wanted to see whether he could be pushed. 
 As one of the president's foreign policy advisers said on Monday evening, after Mr. Netanyahu gave another defiant speech, ''our Israeli friends are not asking themselves the question, if Obama can't set some parameters for our allies, how is he going to set some for the mullahs?'' 
 Pushing through signature legislation in Congress and managing alliances may require very different skills. But early in a presidency, they factor together into the elusive equations of Presidential power that can describe the whole term.
 At home, the next week is about whether Mr. Obama can muster what Johnson's biographer, Robert Caro, called that ''genius for manipulation and domination'' that enabled L.B.J. to force politicians to do what comes unnaturally -- cast votes that may end their political careers. 
 Mr. Obama's argument has come down to this: Details aside, the only thing more damaging than voting ''yes'' would be to come home empty-handed. It is an appeal to raw political calculation now -- not the argument over the merits, the territory where Mr. Obama feels most comfortable and performs the best.
 Abroad, Israel poses a very different kind of challenge. But because the whole world is watching, Mr. Obama's team seems to understand that if they lose this contest of wills, the rest of their foreign policy agenda is also threatened.
 In his first year, Mr. Obama focused on engagement and outreach abandoning the Bush-era notion that ''you are with us or against us.'' In many places around the world, notably Europe, that tonal change was so welcome that it reversed the view of America. But in other corners, it created the impression that the new president could be pushed around.
 China is pushing with its refusal to adjust its currency or join sanctions on Iran, and its constant refrain that America is a receding power. Russia is pushing with more subtlety. But it was Israel, suspicious of Mr. Obama's commitment to its security from the start, that has pushed hardest.
 Mr. Netanyahu was scratching at a raw wound. Already, Israel had forced Mr. Obama to backtrack last year on his early insistence on a temporary settlement freeze to get peace talks going -- lest the settlements become a way of taking territory off the negotiating table. 
 Then his government --without his knowledge, he protested -- announced new construction in East Jerusalem barely 24 hours into Mr. Biden's visit last week. That provoked a ferocious American reaction, orchestrated by Mr. Obama himself. (It was Mr. Obama who approved on having Mr. Biden ''condemn'' the announcement, using a word held in diplomatic reserve for the most egregious transgressions, as when North Korea conducts a nuclear test.)
 What now? ''The key way that you project strength is to show that you mean what you say,'' Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama and his foreign-policy speechwriter, said on Monday. 
 Mr. Obama is already under tremendous pressure, including from groups like the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, the lobbying group that Mr. Netanyahu is coming to Washington to address next week, to back down and defuse the crisis. His aides worry about looking weak when he wants the United States to reinvigorate the moribund peace talks.
 But the bigger issue, though White House officials are loath to acknowledged it, is the one Mr. Biden raised in 2008. The tests that only simmered in 2009 seem likely to boil in 2010. Just look at Mr. Obama's promise of ''crippling sanctions'' against Iran, a quest that, like the one for health care, has dribbled past every deadline.
 ''He's in the position of appearing fierce with the Israelis over an insult, but timid with the Iranians over nuclear weapons,'' said Mr. Rothkopf. 
 Mr. Obama has an instinct for compromise -- it is one of the characteristics that distinguished him, in voters' minds, from his predecessor. It may also be the part of his persona that, this week, he is trying to suppress.

HEADLINE: Afghanistan Says It Enacted Law to Pardon War Crimes

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan (Reuters) -- Afghanistan confirmed for the first time publicly on Tuesday that it had enacted into law a blanket pardon for war crimes and human rights abuses that took place before 2001. 
 Human rights groups have expressed dismay that the law appeared to have been enacted quietly, granting blanket immunity to members of all armed factions for acts committed during decades of war before the fall of the Taliban.
 President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan had promised not to sign the measure, known as the National Stability and Reconciliation Law, when it was passed by Parliament in 2007.
 Human rights groups said they had learned only this year that the bill had been published in the country's official gazette, making it law.
 A spokesman for Mr. Karzai, Waheed Omer, said Tuesday that the bill had become law because it was approved by two-thirds of the members of Parliament and therefore did not require the president's signature.
 Parliament is made up largely of lawmakers who once belonged to armed groups, some of which have been accused of war crimes by human rights groups and individual Afghans.
 It was the first time the palace had confirmed that the measure had become law.
 Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said there was still a good deal of mystery surrounding the process. Among the questions is why it took more than two years for news of the law's enactment to be made public.
 ''This law is absolute disgrace,'' Mr. Adams said. ''It's a slap in the face to all the Afghans who suffered for years and years of war crimes and warlordism.'' 
 He called on the United States and other nations to press Afghanistan to repeal the law.
 ''The U.S. needs to decide whether they're with the victims or the perpetrators, and make their views known publicly,'' Mr. Adams said.
 During Mr. Karzai's eight years in power, he has included former commanders of armed factions in his government and inner circle, including a number of former warlords who have been accused by the West of war crimes and other abuses.
 Mr. Karzai's two vice presidents are former leaders of armed groups whose factions squabbled for control of the capital, Kabul, in the 1990s, when thousands of civilians were killed and hundreds of thousands fled their homes.
 Supporters of the amnesty law said that prosecuting old accusations would risk restarting years of civil war. But critics said that providing a blanket pardon for former warlords would allow them to retain their grip over Afghanistan's economy and public life.

HEADLINE: Team Owners Hoping to Sell Face a New Opponent: Recession

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
As a basketball player, Michael Jordan ruthlessly exploited his opponents' weaknesses. As a businessman, he is now trying to exploit the financially troubled sports world by buying the money-losing Charlotte Bobcats of the National Basketball Association for about $25 million less than they sold for in 2002. 
 Jordan is not alone in seeing opportunity in financially weakened franchises. In the past year, five of the nine major professional sports teams in the United States that were sold or are being sold were saddled with substantial debt or operating losses. Another dozen in the four biggest leagues, which have a total of 122 teams, may soon change hands.
 In the wake of the financial crisis, new owners like Jordan are facing a future without the near-certainty of making up for any short-term losses by selling their teams for hefty profits later. 
 ''It used to be you got bailed out when you sold your team even if you lost money year after year,'' said Marc Ganis, president of SportsCorp Ltd., a consulting firm. ''Now, you're no longer assured of cashing out to cover your capital costs and losses.''
 Ganis and other sports-industry experts point to skittish banks that are tightening lending standards, ticket and sponsorship sales that have slowed and labor agreements now being negotiated that could force owners to pay players more or even lead to work stoppages. 
 At the same time, lawmakers in Washington are discussing whether to raise the capital gains tax by as much as 50 percent, which would slice into the profits of owners selling their teams.
 George Postolos, a former Houston Rockets executive who bid against Jordan for the Bobcats, said rising franchise values earlier this decade masked years of losses, debt, bad management and the problems of running teams in smaller markets. ''Warren Buffett says the tide has gone out and we can see who's been swimming naked,'' Postolos said.
 This new dynamic could fundamentally change the business of sports. As lenders reassess what teams can earn, they are challenging some buyers unwilling to agree to stiffer rules for borrowing, like having the lead investor in a group sign a contract to personally guarantee annual losses.
 ''Does it practically change behavior? No,'' said a person involved in buying a franchise who did not want to be named because the deal is not complete. ''But does it cross a line? Yes.'' 
 For decades, sports teams weathered recessions remarkably well. Ticket and advertising sales sometimes dipped, but teams continued to sell at a profit despite the headwinds buffeting the broader economy, according to research by Moag & Company, which brokers sales of teams.
 But John Moag, the company's chairman, said this recession had been drastically different. ''The impact of the stock and real estate devaluation on franchise ownership is indirectly, but very certainly, impacting the stability of a number of professional sports franchises,'' he said.
 The effect of the financial crisis has been seen even in sales of marquee teams like the Chicago Cubs ($845 million) and the Montreal Canadiens ($550 million), which almost certainly would have received more in a thriving market. 
 But the sums paid for financially weakened teams like the Bobcats suggest a growing gap between the value of stronger and weaker franchises.
 The Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorovagreed to pay $200 million for 80 percent of the Nets, the worst team in the N.B.A., and 45 percent of their new Brooklyn arena. He will also finance $60 million in team losses and be responsible for most of its $207 million debt.
 Last month, the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League was sold to Jeffrey N. Vinik, who once ran the giant Fidelity Magellan Fund, for a sum described as from $100 million to $150 million -- well below the $200 million paid in 2008.
 The debt-laden Phoenix Coyotes were sold last fall in bankruptcy court for $140 million to the N.H.L., which fended off a much higher bid from a suitor who wanted to move the team to Canada. The league plans to resell the Coyotes for an estimated $150 million.
 In a three-step process, the buyers of baseball's San Diego Padres are taking on more than $200 million in stadium debt from an owner who needed cash to pay for his divorce. 
 The pending sale of the Texas Rangers came after Tom Hicks, the Major League Baseball team's owner, defaulted on $525 million in loans on the Rangers and the Dallas Stars of the N.H.L.
 Now that the economy seems to be on the mend, owners who held off selling during the downturn are seeking to unload their teams. According to sports bankers, the teams thought to be for sale include the Atlanta Hawks, the Memphis Grizzlies, the Golden State Warriors and the Detroit Pistons in the N.B.A; the Stars, the Atlanta Thrashers and potentially the Columbus Blue Jackets in the N.H.L.; and baseball's Houston Astros.
 The Los Angeles Dodgers could be sold because of the pending divorce of their owners.
 In any economy, owners cash out after long tenures, as H. Wayne Huizenga did early last year when he completed the sale of the Miami Dolphins for $1.1 billion nearly 15 years after buying them for $138 million.
 And owners die. The St. Louis Rams agreed to the sale of the N.F.L team last month, two years after their owner's death. The Washington Wizards are in play as their minority owner is seeking to buy out the interests of Abe Pollin, who died in November.
 The sale of the Bobcats, for $300 million, is symptomatic of how the economy exposes poorly run, money-losing teams.
 David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, said Robert Johnson, the Bobcats' primary owner, was hurt early on by a bad cable television deal, the absence of a naming rights partner for the arena and slow ticket and sponsorship sales. Though the team has largely fixed those flaws, Stern said, ''The legacy of financial underperformance is still with the team.'' He said the league and city of Charlotte were fortunate that Jordan, a Bobcats part-owner and executive since 2006, is buying the team, which has ''lost money every year and has incurred substantial debt.'' 
 While the economy is slowly improving, the pool of wealthy investors willing to buy teams has shrunk, as has the number of financial institutions willing to finance team acquisitions. Dave Checketts, who led a group to bid for the Rams, said buyers needed ''a big equity check'' to avoid using too much debt.
 Checketts, the principal owner of the N.H.L.'s St. Louis Blues, said his goal was to find an undervalued team in any economy. He said, ''We look for situations, like the Blues and Rams, that have seen better days.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 19, 2010

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the effect of the financial crisis on sales of professional sports franchises misstated the amount Michael Jordan is paying to buy the Charlotte Bobcats of the National Basketball Association. It is $275 million -- not $300 million, which is the sum Robert L. Johnson paid for the expansion team in 2002.

HEADLINE: An Apparel Underdog Outfits A No.15 Seed

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH -- Amid the Nike swooshes and Adidasthree stripes that dominate the N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments, it may be hard to spot the logo of a little-known company that is squeezing its foot in the door of the $4 billion sports-apparel industry.
 Crons, which created its name as an acronym from the phrase ''Come ready or never start,'' is based in Pittsburgh and describes what it sells as ''motivational apparel.'' It is supplying the uniforms and practice gear for Robert Morris University, which is one of only six teams not wearing Nike or Adidas uniforms. 
 Robert Morris, a small, private university of 5,000 students located just outside Pittsburgh, is seeded 15th in the South Region and plays No. 2 Villanova on Thursday. 
 The Colonials are making their second straight appearance in the N.C.A.A. tournament after again winning the Northeast Conference tournament and the automatic bid that went with it.
 Crons's founder and owner is Pat Cavanaugh, 42, who played in the N.C.A.A. tournament three times as a walk-on starter at Pittsburgh in the late 1980s. He points out that Robert Morris's run of success under Coach Mike Rice coincides with their relationship. 
 ''All I know is they've been making the tournament wearing our uniforms for the past two years,'' Cavanaugh said.
 Cavanaugh may have a hard time proving a direct correlation between new uniforms and a team's on-court success.
 But the surprising thing is that Crons -- whose name Cavanaugh came up with 15 years ago -- is supplying the uniforms and practice gear at all.
 Two years ago, the university went looking to buy new uniforms. It found that the bigger companies were not willing to do much more than give it different-colored models of uniforms they were already providing to larger programs -- and wanted to charge Robert Morris about 30 percent more than Crons.
 ''We get the booklets these other companies produce, and when you look for a new uniform, it's usually a Syracuse or Kentucky style, and if you choose it, you're basically wearing their uniform,'' Rice said.
 It also did not hurt that in the intertwined world of college basketball, Rice had a tie to Cavanaugh. Rice was an assistant coach at Pittsburgh before going to Robert Morris three years ago, and had met Cavanaugh there and seen the line of clothing his company made for local Amateur Athletic Union teams.
 So when Rice asked him what he could do for Robert Morris, Cavanaugh offered a custom look that completely revamped the team's red, white and blue tops and bottoms, and added red, white and blue horizontal stripes down the sides -- a look the team's players instantly liked.
 ''The guys liked it and people have talked about it, so, yeah, it's gotten some buzz,'' said Rice, who points out that the team still wears Nike sneakers. All but 12 of the other 64 teams in the N.C.A.A. tournament are wearing sneakers from Nike or its Jordan division.
 And while it may be only anecdotal, other smaller programs also describe similar situations that demonstrate why companies like Crons -- beyond its founder's kinetic personality -- are making inroads with teams that previously would have never considered going with anyone but Nike, Adidas, Russell Athletic or even Under Armour.
 ''The landscape of uniforms and shoes is changing,'' said Ryan Marks, the coach of Texas-Pan American, which last year became Crons's second Division I basketball client. ''Major schools are bound by the shoe contract of whether the coach is a Nike guy or an Adidas guy, and we never were. But schools like ours also don't get the shoe allotments or discounts we used to on uniforms.''
 Rice said, ''It's kind of the haves and have-nots these days, and Crons is taking advantage of that, making quality apparel that's affordable.''
 Both Nike and the universities peg that to the economy. In recent years, as the economy has constricted and budgets have become tighter at smaller places in particular, programs have started to look to save wherever they can. At the same time, companies like Nike are putting more emphasis on larger, more visible programs, while giving fewer free goods and smaller discounts to the smaller guys.
 ''With the economy, we're not immune to it like everyone else,'' said Kejuan Wilkins, a Nike spokesman. 
 That is red meat to career salesmen and entrepreneurs like Cavanaugh, who started his first company when he was 21 while he was at Pitt, and has built the Cavanaugh Marketing Network into a $10-million-a-year company.
 He created Crons in 1996, and thought initially he would go straight into retail, so he offered his line to Dick's Sporting Goods, which is based in a Pittsburgh suburb.
 ''They said: 'Pat, great product. But come back when you have a track record,' '' Cavanaugh said. 
 So, over the last four years, Cavanaugh has ignored retail sales and focused on selling to high schools, athletic organizations, then small colleges, smaller professional teams and now bigger colleges and conferences. Last fall, he secured a contract to provide league gear -- though not individual team uniforms -- for all of the teams in the Big South conference.
 In all, the company has gone from about 20 clients in 2006 to more than 400. It had revenue of more than $2 million last year, which Cavanaugh believes will grow to nearly $8 million this year.
 Should Nike ($19 billion in revenue last year) and Adidas ($15 billion) be worried?
 ''Oh, no,'' said Jim Hartford, chief executive of SportSourceOne, which publishes the trade journal SGB Update. ''But then, Nike wasn't worried about Under Armour until it was too late.''

HEADLINE: Small Donations In Large Numbers, With Online Help

BYLINE: By MATT VILLANO

 BODY:
LAST fall, when the Neversink Valley Area Museum in Cuddebackville, N.Y., set out to raise $11,000 for architectural renderings of a new building, museum officials turned to strangers for fund-raising using the Internet.
 Through a Web site called Kickstarter.com, the museum met its fund-raising goal in fewer than 90 days with help from 69 donors. Some of these supporters had been friends of the museum for years; others did not even know where Cuddebackville was. (It is pronounced Cuh-da-BACK-ville and is about 90 miles northwest of New York City.)
 The fund-raising process, known as crowd funding, has enabled the museum to move forward with long-term plans for a state-of-the-art center to replace the historic buildings where it currently resides. 
 It has also made life a lot easier for the executive director, Seth Goldman.
 ''If we had gone the traditional route of sending mailings and cold-calling people, we'd probably still be scrounging to raise the money we need,'' said Mr. Goldman. ''This made the entire process more efficient.''
 Neversink Valley is not the only museum to turn to crowd funding in recent months; at a time when the sagging economy is leading potential donors all over the country to tighten their purse strings, a handful of other museums have taken this Internet-enhanced approach to pay for exhibits, too.
 While museums have raised money with ChipIn.com, CreateaFund.com, FirstGiving.com and other sites, the majority of museum fund-raising has been hosted by Kickstarter.
 This site, which bills itself as a fund-raising platform for a variety of creative endeavors, was started in April 2009. It enables visitors to support projects with any amount of money they wish. Projects are financed on an all-or-nothing basis; if a project does not meet its fund-raising goal within a maximum of 90 days, it receives nothing. Perry Chen, the company's chief executive, said that while many of the site's 75 new projects every week represented individual efforts, a ''small but growing'' number were spearheaded by organizations.
 Kickstarter's success is linked intimately with the success of its projects. The company takes 5 percent of the full amount raised on each project, if and only if project organizers meet their goals.
 ''For entities like small museums, money is always a problem, and any new funding channel should be explored or at least considered,'' Mr. Chen said. ''Not only are we helping these organizations raise funds for exhibits but we also are helping them galvanize their communities and use the projects as marketing tools.''
 The ToonSeum, for instance, a cartoon museum in Pittsburgh, recently introduced separate Kickstarter campaigns to raise money for two exhibits. One exhibit will display art from the anime classic Akira; the other will chronicle comic and cartoon dogs.
 The museum is seeking $13,500 for both exhibits; as of early March, 22, a total of $465 had been pledged.
 Joe Wos, executive director of the ToonSeum, said he was confident the museum would find enough backers before the deadlines in early April. He added that, in many ways, the Internet fund-raising was a backward approach because of its emphasis on smaller donations rather than larger ones.
 ''Before Kickstarter, we did what every museum did, and relied on local foundations, sponsorships and the general operating budget for sizable contributions to fund new exhibits,'' he said. ''Under this new approach, we're aiming for smaller donations first, and we'll rely on those larger sources only if we need to do so down the road.''
 The fund-raising model is not perfect. Mr. Wos said that a museum's fund-raising efforts were only as good as the organization's ability to spread the word and get people to contribute online. He added that his organization used Facebook and other social networking sites to publicize its fund-raising.
 Mr. Chen, of Kickstarter, said small museums were used to keeping every dollar they raised, so Kickstarter's all-or-nothing approach ''takes some getting used to,'' and could force management to come up with alternative plans.
 Still, museum executives appear undaunted.
 At Rhizome, a new-media art organization affiliated with the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City, officials are planning to incorporate the Internet-enhanced fund-raising into its planning for an exhibit this spring.
 Lauren Cornell, the executive director of Rhizome, was not certain how she would build fund-raising with Kickstarter, but she said she appreciated the process because of the way it helped young people understand how philanthropy worked.
 ''It's huge to help people understand how a little bit of money can change people's lives and get people's projects into the public domain,'' she said. ''For that reason alone, this approach is one I think all museums should take seriously.''

HEADLINE: Ukraine: Venue Offered For Arms Talks

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
Ukraine's new president, Viktor F. Yanukovich, has offered Kiev as a location for the United States and Russia to sign a revamped nuclear arms reduction treaty, once it has been agreed to. Though the peace agreement is unrelated to Ukraine, having the treaty formally signed in Kiev, the capital, would be rich in symbolism for a country whose recent internal politics became a tug of war between Russia and the West for economic and political influence. Mr. Yanukovich, though he is generally viewed as leaning heavily toward Russia, has promoted the idea of Ukraine as bridge between East and West, rather than a country that falls readily within either sphere of influence. Russian officials welcomed the offer; the United States would prefer Prague, where President Obama gave a speech on disarmament last year, Ukraine's new foreign minister, Kostyantyn Gryschenko, said Wednesday.

HEADLINE: On HGTV, Fixing Homes And Hearts

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
''The Grants are getting a divorce,'' Ian Kleier says after studying the gossip pages at the kitchen table of his Park Avenue apartment. His wife, Michele, is not surprised. ''I had my suspicions,'' she says, and starts to list the warning signs while scrambling eggs for ''the girls,'' the couple's trio of white Maltese. Ian cuts her off. ''It's not a pretty divorce, and I think you should jump right on top of it.''
 It's like a scene from ''The Real Housewives of New York,'' only the Kleiers are the Real Realtors of New York, owners of a family-run real estate firm and, beginning on Thursday, stars of a new reality series on HGTV, ''Selling New York,'' which focuses on just that. The Kleiers, who are grandparents, sell multimillion-dollar apartments to an older Upper East Side clientele. They and their two daughters are matched up against younger, hipper brokers from another firm, Core, catering to young professionals willing to pay more than $2 million for downtown views, double sinks and rooftop pool parties that are, as one events planner puts it, ''a little Puff Daddyish.'' 
 ''Selling New York'' is a bit of a jolt because, at first glance, it looks like a flashback to pre-recession values. But it's less a harbinger of economic recovery than a midcourse correction for HGTV, a cable network that fed -- and feasted on -- the fantasies and delusions of the housing bubble and then, when that collapsed, went into austerity and atonement mode with series like the 2009 ''Real Estate Intervention.'' 
 HGTV is getting its building buzz back, but gingerly. Most of the new series, and there are six of them in prime time alone, focus on modest middle-class home sales and improvement projects. 
 And like ''Selling New York,'' these new series have learned a lesson not from housing starts but from the ''Real Housewives'' franchise on Bravo: There is no dip in the market of people making spectacles of themselves. 
 Reality shows like ''Real Housewives'' -- be they of Orange County, Atlanta, New York or New Jersey -- ''The Bachelor,'' ''Jersey Shore'' (and a hair salon knockoff, ''Jerseylicious,'' on Style beginning this weekend) keep growing more stagily preposterous and rococo. Paradoxically, a few of them are tiptoeing around the housing market collapse too: Lynne, one of the housewives in Season 5 of ''Orange County,'' was forced to downsize, then was served an eviction notice on her Laguna Beach rental. 
 HGTV, however, is seeking shelter in Manhattan penthouses, beauty makeovers and home improvement for the heart.
 When it began, ''Real Estate Intervention'' taught distraught homeowners how to deal with the collapse of the housing market. Now ''Home Rules,'' which had its premiere on Monday, teaches distraught homeowners how to deal with the collapse of their marriages -- while renovating their houses. 
 In the first episode the host, Fran Harris, a former WNBA player who is now a life coach, helps an estranged couple, Matt and Heather, rekindle their ardor; a new master bedroom and a remodeled kitchen are dangled as rewards for completing communication assignments, like listening. ''You work on your inner house,'' Ms. Harris says, ''we'll work on your outer house.'' 
 While workers tear out pink countertops and replace rotting planks, Matt and Heather renew their vows on a gauzy, candlelit set that rivals the most poignant rose ceremony on ''The Bachelor.''
 HGTV calls ''Tough as Nails,'' which begins on Thursday, a docudrama, but it looks more like a docu-telenovela, a weekly series about a tough, comely Boston developer, Cindy Stumpo, who barks orders at all-male construction crews but cannot still the yearnings of her own heart. Like Bathsheba Everdene, the Thomas Hardy heroine who is torn between a loyal farmhand and her rakish runaway husband, Cindy mistily tells the camera that she trusts and relies on Michael, her foreman, but still has ''feelings'' for her ex-husband, Joe. 
 ''Marriage Under Construction,'' which began on Tuesday, follows a pair of newlyweds in Toronto, Natalie and Rod. Their marriage and tangential real estate problems are served up as a kind of romantic sitcom, an HGTV version of ''Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood.'' Rod, who has a burly ''King of Queens'' physique, is good-humored and somewhat slothful; Natalie is attractive, determined and a little bossy. While brushing her teeth, Natalie asks Rod, seated in front of a laptop, what he is doing. ''Looking at houses,'' he replies though he is playing backgammon on an online gaming site. 
 ''My First Sale,'' starting Thursday, focuses on a different family each week but milks each housing decision for melodrama and whatever naughtiness it can glean. Shelly and Brian have a new baby and no privacy in the loftlike, one-bedroom that they're selling. They have to lower their price and just barely wrangle the mortgage for a bigger house.
 They are last seen in their new kitchen, doors closed and blender whirring. ''So, is it bad that we sold our house and bought a new one so we could drink after the baby goes to bed?'' Brian asks. 
 ''No,'' Shelly coos. ''No. I've been waiting to have margaritas for months.''
 Even ''The Antonio Treatment,'' a design show that began on Sunday and stars Antonio Ballatore, the heavily tattooed winner of Season 4 of ''HGTV Design Star,'' tries to give some reality show hype along with moldings and ceiling frescos by focusing on his wacky construction crew, which includes heavy-metal musicians and an English bulldog named Chewy. Mr. Ballatore puts it this way, ''We all got these crazy personalities going on.''
 And on HGTV it's the personalities that have room for improvement.

Time Seems Right
 For PayPal to Fly
 Should eBay change its name to PayPal? The company's auction business is mature, but PayPal, its online payments business, is growing fast. Plans announced on Wednesday to double PayPal's Asian staff by the end of the year accentuate the point. A better idea than changing the stationery, however, is spinning off PayPal. 
 Most analysts who follow eBay also cover online retailers like Amazon rather than financial firms like Visa. This can lead to misunderstandings. Before the financial crisis, analysts covering General Electric, for example, focused on the conglomerate's industrial side and missed big risks in its financial arm. 
 EBay has the opposite problem: an overlooked opportunity. The company estimates PayPal will generate up to $1 billion in operating profit next year. Put this conservatively on the same multiple as the slower-growing Visa, and its value is over $12 billion, or approaching half eBay's current enterprise value.
 PayPal's online payments platform is becoming the standard in an industry where winners often gain most of the spoils, yet the company so far has less than a tenth of the $600 billion market for online transactions. 
 A spin-off would have other benefits. Its link with eBay certainly gave the company rich soil for growth. PayPal's penetration in eBay sales has increased both at home and overseas, and now reaches around 80 percent in the United States.
 That success, though, means PayPal now increasingly has to look outside this protected garden for growth. That would be easier if it were independent, rather than attached to a business that many potential customers regard as a competitor. 
 EBay might be reluctant to give up its growth engine. But its other businesses should generate around $2 billion in operating profit this year. Put this on a hefty 25 percent discount to the 13 times multiple on which peers trade, and it's worth $23 billion according to research from FBR Capital Markets. 
 Throw in its minority Skype stake -- worth nearly $2 billion -- and eBay's parts are worth $37 billion, or a premium of more than 20 percent to the company's current enterprise value. It's time for PayPal to prepare to leave the nest.
 A Sensible Plan
 The financial industry isn't the only one that needs reform. The Federal Reserve needs a transformation of its own. After all, the Fed, the most senior government watchdog over financial firms, missed one of the biggest credit bubbles since its founding. 
 But while action is called for, it's not obvious what sort. After all, mindset not the rulebook, was the Fed's main weakness in the credit bubble. It had enough legal authority and political independence to fight against financial excess, but chose not to. 
 The politicians who are trying to redesign the national financial landscape can't legislate a new intellectual paradigm, but they can try to avoid three pitfalls. 
 First, beware of the monolithic mindset. The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, each with its own traditions and expertise, provide a healthy check on groupthink in Washington and New York. 
 Second, don't let politicians micromeddle. The Fed needs political guidance on how to balance its objectives, but it's healthy to have tension between a strong central bank favoring financial stability and elected office-holders primarily looking to keep voters happy. 
 Finally, beware of regulators falling under the sway of industries they oversee. As it stands, the two best-informed members of the board of the New York Fed are chief executives of giant financial companies: Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan and Jeffrey Immelt of G.E. That creates unacceptable potential for conflicts of interest. 
 The plan by Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced on Monday, gets it mostly right. The regional Feds stay, which is a plus. Bankers will be kicked off their boards. That's good, but the plan goes too far by also banning all former bankers, whose expertise could be useful.
 The plan goes wrong by making the New York Fed president a political appointee, like the members of the Fed's central board. Politicians aren't ideal judges of who has the technical expertise needed to sit at the center of the financial markets. 
 Still, one more political appointment may not be too high a price to pay for a generally sensible reworking.

HEADLINE: The Beat Goes Online, Minus the Glitz

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
IN the magazine world, there has traditionally been no more glamorous place to work than Conde Nast. Brandon Holley can attest to that.
 When she was the editor in chief of Jane, Conde Nast's monthly for young single women, she had a big office in the company's Times Square headquarters, a driver and a lavish expense account. She sat in the front row at the Paris and Milan fashion shows. She was invited to fabulous parties by Hollywood publicists. Sometimes, a stylist did her hair in her office while she was on the phone.
 ''I can't even imagine that at this point in my life,'' she says with a laugh. ''It was a different time.''
 It certainly was. And it abruptly ended in July 2007 when Jane was shuttered. 
 There is no longer someone waiting to chauffeur her to work in the morning. Instead, she pads downstairs in her slippers to her living room in Brooklyn's Red Hook section, switches on her MacBook Pro and begins her workday.
 Ms. Holley, 43, is the editor in chief of Shine, Yahoo's rapidly growing Web site for women, which will celebrate its second anniversary next month. She serves up the same sort of fare there -- at shine.yahoo.com -- that she did at Jane: advice about cheap fashion, sex and health and, when all else fails, a pointed item about Sarah Palin, who never ceases to inspire debate on Shine.
 The timing was flawless. The recession hasn't been kind to women's magazines. Last year, Conde Nast also euthanized Gourmet, Cookie, Modern Bride and Elegant Bride. The Audit Bureau of Circulation has reported that newsstand sales for Good Housekeeping and Redbook, Hearst magazines, fell by nearly a third in the last six months of 2009.
 Meanwhile, Shine seems to be prospering. In January, it attracted 17 million visitors, making it the third-largest women's destination on the Web, behind the Glam Media network of sites and iVillage, according to comScore, the online measurement company.
 Ms. Holley says she loves her current job. But she concedes a bit wistfully that her new life as a digital women's-service journalist is much less glamorous than her old one at Conde Nast's glossy dream factory.
 She used to relish going to work with her sharply dressed employees in Midtown Manhattan. Now, says Ms. Holley, who lives with her musician husband and toddler son, she spends much of her day in her nightgown, communicating with her staff almost entirely via instant messages.
 She once dispatched what she calls ''crazy photographers and insane stylists'' to Aruba and commissioned lengthy articles from investigative journalists. Now, she spends much of her time trying to figure out ways to get Shine's visitors to contribute their own unvarnished thoughts on the site by blogging and posting reader comments.
 Ms. Holley is courted by deep-pocketed advertisers like Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart. Indeed, the latter recently made its largest digital ad purchase ever on the site. ''Shine is a great place for us to be,'' said Wal-Mart's chief marketing officer, Stephen F. Quinn.
 Yet the Hollywood press agents who wined and dined her when she was at Jane seem to have lost her telephone number. ''It's almost like I'm in hiding,'' she said. ''Nobody calls me anymore.''
 ON a recent morning, Ms. Holley sat at her laptop in her sunny living room, showing a visitor one of that day's most popular postings on Shine. It was an item by a blogger who identified herself J Montana, titled, ''How Many Times a Day Do Men Think About Sex?'' Ms. Montana's answer: 13, according to a recent survey, compared with 5 for women. 
 This disparity has often been examined in women's magazines. But Shine's visitors didn't just read the blog post. They posted more than 1,500 comments, many questioning the survey's validity. ''I'm fantasizing all the time,'' wrote a woman who called herself Glenda.
 Ms. Holley was delighted to see that the item had generated such dialogue. ''You don't get that sharing in print,'' she said. ''You miss the whole second part of the conversation.''
 It was at Jane that Ms. Holley, who had started Elle Girl for Hachette Filipacchi Media in 2001, had her first glimpse of the Internet's power. In 2007, two years after she had arrived at Jane, she ran a photo spread of real women's breasts because she thought women were inundated by images of perfect ones, courtesy of Hollywood.
 ''We wanted to show women what real breasts look like: big, small, lopsided, not so perky,'' she said. ''Mostly, women responded by saying: 'Thank you, I always felt weird about my breasts. Now I know I'm not so strange.' ''
 Ms. Holley encouraged readers to post pictures of their own on Jane's Web site. No faces, just breasts. Jane was deluged with responses. 
 Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to save Jane. In July of that year, Ms. Holley went in to talk with S. I. Newhouse, the Conde Nast chairman, and Thomas J. Wallace, its editorial director, about the print run for the next issue. She said she was told at that meeting that Jane had ''ceased to exist that morning.''
 IT wasn't long before Yahoo called. The company wanted a former magazine editor to start Shine. Ms. Holley wanted a career change, but she was often baffled by the digital jargon that Yahoo executives used when they interviewed her for the job. Luckily, most of those talks took place over the phone. ''I was on Wikipedia half the time,'' looking things up, she said.
 Yahoo wanted her to work in its office in Santa Monica, Calif. Ms. Holley didn't want to uproot her family. She and her new employer reached a compromise; she would run Shine from her home.
 But the transition wasn't easy. Ms. Holley oversaw a staff of eight editors, almost all of whom worked at home in places like Brooklyn, Chicago and San Francisco.
 Something that she and her New York editors, all print veterans, missed in the new gig was the publishing industry ritual of regularly going out to lunch. Ms. Holley thought she had a solution: she insisted that they meet every Thursday at the Chelsea office of Yahoo and dine at a nearby restaurant.
 Even so, two of her editors quit the site early on. ''Working at home can be a lonely experience,'' Ms. Holley said. 
 Ultimately, she delivered what she describes as a ''tough love'' message to her remaining ones. ''I told everyone: 'Look, we work from home. We get health benefits. We get to set our own hours. We are all moms. Come on. This is a great job.' ''
 Even so, Ms. Holley said, she and her staff weren't entirely sure this was true until visitors started to react to their efforts on the site. When the economy collapsed in late 2008, Ms. Holley discovered that her audience was interested in more than just saving money; women said that they were also fighting with their husbands about finances. So Shine began posting pieces about recessionary marital discord.
 Ms. Holley also found that Shine's visitors loved it when the site challenged conventional wisdom about celebrities. Early on, she and her editors posted an item headlined, ''Things we don't get: Zach Braff.'' Readers responded with more than 70 comments about why they, too, found the appeal of Mr. Braff, the ''Scrubs'' star, elusive.
 Shine gave the rock star John Mayer the same skeptical treatment. This time, Shine's visitors posted more than 700 comments.
 Ms. Holley's job is about to become harder. In the next few months, Microsoft is introducing a women's site that will compete directly with Shine.
 ''We think Shine is ready for a little competition,'' said Scott Moore, a former Yahoo executive who oversaw Shine's creation and is now the executive producer of MSN, the Microsoft portal. ''We will be more than happy to provide it.''
 At the same time, Shine is being challenged by Glam Media, which controls an extensive network of much smaller sites. Samir Arora, the chief executive of Glam Media, argues that the old model of a large Web site for women, curated by an old-school journalist like Ms. Holley, is out of style now that Web surfers are using Google to seek out only the stories they truly want to read. ''You can't replicate being an editor in chief of a magazine online,'' he said.
 Ms. Holley said she isn't rattled by such talk. She and her editors no longer see themselves as magazine people. Perhaps the most telling sign is that that they no longer get together in Manhattan for lunch every Thursday. 
 They are all so busy now with their jobs, and they have grown accustomed to communing online. ''We don't need it now,'' Ms. Holley said of the Manhattan lunches. ''But sometimes it's nice to get together and see what everybody else is wearing. It's a reason to get out of our pajamas.''

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices Decline As Gasoline Leads the Way

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wholesale prices fell 0.6 percent in February, the government said Wednesday, signaling that inflation remained tame even in a time of extraordinarily low interest rates.
 A day after the Federal Reservereiterated its pledge to keep rates down to spur growth, data from the Labor Department reinforced the view that price pressures remain subdued. 
 That will most likely give the Fed leeway to keep interest rates low for an extended period, though the central bank is expected to begin taking more substantial steps to normalize monetary policy toward the end of the year.
 ''There's nothing here that would shake the view that inspired the Fed's decision,'' said Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase.
 Wholesales prices have been increasing since October and climbed 1.4 percent in January. February broke that trend, largely because of a 7.4 percent drop in the price of gasoline.
 Prices at the pump have increased in the last month because of rising demand and limited supply. Over all, energy prices fell 2.9 percent last month, which was offset somewhat by a 0.4 percent increase in food prices, including eggs, meat and fresh vegetables.
 A more closely watched measure that excludes volatile food and energy costs showed wholesale prices increased 0.1 percent. 
 Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices are up 4.4 percent, which economists consider elevated but not sufficient to sound an alarm about widespread inflation. 
 Changes in producer prices often trickle down to the consumer level, though businesses have been reluctant to raise prices in the current economic environment as they compete for customers. 
 ''In subdued economic conditions, there just isn't the demand to support higher prices,'' said Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics in Toronto. ''Companies have to cut prices to survive.''
 The Labor Department will release its barometer of consumer prices on Thursday. On Tuesday, the Fed held its regular meeting to set interest rates. In a statement, the central bank's policy-setting committee suggested it was not concerned about inflation, though one member, Thomas M. Hoenig, dissented. He has expressed concern that the Fed was moving too slowly to restore higher interest rates and may set the stage for inflation.
 In its statement, the committee said, ''With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.'' 
 Economists expect the Fed to keep rates low until the labor market and the broader economy show clear signs of improvement. 
 Some argue that an extended period of low interest rates could usher in deflation, which occurs when weak demand causes prices to fall. Japan, for instance, is grappling with deflation concerns as it tries to emerge from a recession.
 But in the United States, concerns about deflation have subsided as the recovery has gained strength and demand has shown signs of rebounding. Still, Mr. Feroli warned, ''I think we may be jumping the gun -- we collectively, meaning economists and policy makers -- in declaring deflation risks over.''
 Other economists believe that a healthy recovery will come only when inflation is more pronounced in the United States, and that central banks have set their target inflation rates too low.

HEADLINE: A Master Showman's Old Masters

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
JOHN RINGLING, one of five brothers who created the Ringling Brothers Circus (which later acquired the Barnum & Bailey Circus), was an avid art collector. With a fortune that placed him among the country's richest men, Mr. Ringling and his wife, Mable, bought thousands of art objects from 1920 to 1930 and created the John and Mable Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Fla., to display them. 
 ''It is one of the most significant museums in America,'' said George Wachter, co-chairman of Old Master Paintings Worldwide at Sotheby's. ''Ringling was a showman, and he was attracted to big, showy pictures.'' 
 Best known for its Baroque Italian and Flemish works, the museum owns one enormous tapestry and five cartoons -- preparatory works for tapestries -- by Rubens, as well as paintings by van Dyck and by Italian Renaissance masters like Titian and Tintoretto. It also has antiquities, including 2,200 that Mr. Ringling bought from the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Cesnola collection in 1928. 
 In 1936, Mr. Ringling willed the property, including his home, Ca d'Zan, to the state and left $1.2 million to support the museum. The museum went through good times and bad, and by 1996, Ca d'Zan had deteriorated so badly -- with so many leaks that visitors found buckets on the floor to catch the water -- that the museum board closed it for a six-year renovation financed by the state and local fund-raising. 
 In 2000, the state handed governance of the museum to Florida State University, an arrangement orchestrated by John McKay, then president of the state Senate and a member of the Ringling board, who is expected to be elected its chairman this summer. 
 ''It had been treated like a redheaded stepchild and had not received enough money to meet its potential,'' Mr. McKay said. ''There are benefits to placing it under the guardianship of a university.'' For example, once the museum was governed by the university, the university essentially had to match any gift the museum received. 
 For nearly a decade, money flowed in from gifts and grants: for a circus museum, new exhibition space and other benefits, and the art museum itself, presided over by the museum director, John Wetenhall.
 In 2002, ''we got a huge grant of $49 million for expansion through Florida State University,'' recalled T. Marshall Rousseau, the museum's interim director, who is also a Ringling board member. In turn, the museum expanded its endowment, which now holds $24 million, with more pledged. 
 The Ringling also mounted exhibitions with other museums, like the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, which helped put it on the national map. 
 But with the financial crisis and the recession came cutbacks and casualties. Because the museum is governed by the university and financed by the state legislature, it appears to have been caught between the two when they struggled over the budget. Last spring, Florida State, which supplies roughly half the museum's $13.5 million budget, said it might have to stop providing financing. 
 ''The university itself was facing a 25 percent budget cut, bigger even than California,'' said Sally McRorie, dean of the College of Visual Arts, Theater and Dance at Florida State. ''It was not as if we were a state that had always invested heavily in higher education, so there was not a lot of cushion, and we had to look at budget items very carefully.'' 
 Since the spring, the university and the museum have been seeking strategies for cutting costs and increasing revenue.
 Mr. Wetenhall resigned in August. He declined to comment, but several people with knowledge of the situation said he was weary of the political wrangling.
 ''Closing was never an issue, but the museum needed to find additional sources of revenue,'' Mr. McKay said. 
 The Ringling has cut its budget 20 percent, according to Mr. Rousseau, and has avoided layoffs. Equally important, the museum, its trustees and the university trustees have avoided any devastating battles over the future of the collection, like the one at Brandeis University, where the museum collection was almost sold until an uproar from donors and the public stopped the process. 
 Much of the collection is protected by the provisions that Mr. Ringling made before his death in 1936.
 ''He was a populist and stipulated that the art could not be sold, nor could any portion of the facility,'' Mr. McKay said. ''Otherwise, everything would revert to his heirs.'' Art bought since his death is not subject to those provisions. 
 In recent months, the Ringling has found other means to stabilize its situation. It focuses more heavily on exhibitions drawn from its own collection, rather than relying on art borrowed from other institutions. The current ''Gothic Art in the Gilded Age,'' for example, is drawn from its own collection. 
 ''I am committed to doing exhibitions focused on our permanent collection,'' said Virginia Brilliant, one of the museum's two curators.
 The museum is also strengthening ties to the university. Students can take courses at the museum as part of a graduate program in museum studies. Ms. Brilliant is teaching at Florida State, traveling more than 300 miles to its campus in Tallahassee and sometimes having students come to the museum. The other curator, Matthew McLendon, will join the program in the fall. 
 In another effort to increase the museum's profile, this winter the Ringling, with the Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York, mounted an arts festival and sold 93 percent of the tickets. 
 Despite the weak economy, the museum is visited by more than 300,000 people a year and has 10,000 members, far more than the average membership of university museums, which is 1,000, according to Ford Bell, president of the American Association of Museums. 
 For now, the speculation about closing appears to be over. But the financial pressures remain. Hearings on the state budget resumed this month, and Florida still faces a deficit.

HEADLINE: Economical and Effective, Chamberlain Stakes Claim

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Joba Chamberlain could probably have pitched his way out of the rotation with a poor outing Wednesday against the Philadelphia Phillies. Instead, Chamberlain breezed through four innings, tightening the most important position battle in the Yankees' spring training. 
 Chamberlain allowed a run and two hits through three innings at Bright House Field, and when the game ended in a 6-2 Yankees loss, the Phillies agreed to play the bottom of the ninth inning. That gave Chamberlain another chance to pitch, and he retired the side with two strikeouts. 
 Notorious for high pitch counts, Chamberlain was so economical that he threw only 48 pitches and needed more work in the bullpen to reach his target of 65. He faced several hitters who will likely start the season with the Class AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs -- Brian Bocock, Cody Ransom, Wilson Valdez, Dewayne Wise -- but he pleased his manager. 
 ''Outstanding,'' Joe Girardi said. ''Worked quickly and attacked the zone. That's what you want to see -- quality.'' 
 Girardi has said he would like to decide on a fifth starter by next Thursday or Friday, and he had warned Chamberlain and the others that they needed to show results. Phil Hughes did that Tuesday, blanking the Houston Astros for the final four innings and using his weakest pitch -- the changeup -- with confidence. 
 Chamberlain followed with a similar effort, getting at least two outs on changeups. He struck out five and pitched aggressively, throwing 32 pitches for strikes.
 Chamberlain said Girardi was right to challenge him after two poor outings in which he gave up 11 runs in three and two-thirds innings. 
 ''Joe does a great job of motivating his players, pushing them and getting what he needs out of them,'' Chamberlain said. ''I give him a little bit of the credit, because sometimes you need a kick in the rear. He did a great job of that.'' 
 Alfredo Aceves, an effective middle reliever last season, has permitted one run in 10 innings this spring. The veterans Chad Gaudin and Sergio Mitre are nominally under consideration, but they are also auditioning for other teams because the Yankees are short on bullpen spots. 
 Chamberlain would have a right to see the starting job as his to lose. He made 31 starts last season, with one relief appearance, and went 9-6 with a 4.75 earned run average. If he starts now, he will finally be free of the innings restrictions he faced his first three seasons. 
 ''There's a sense of pride of going out and winning, and competing with all these other guys,'' Chamberlain said. ''Pushing each other in the competition that we have is going to make our team better. I'm going to fight with all my heart, with everything I've got, to try to win that job and help this team win. That's what I want to do, get that opportunity.'' 
 The Yankees have four veterans at the front of the rotation in C. C. Sabathia, A. J. Burnett, Andy Pettitte (who worked four solid innings Wednesday) and Javier Vazquez. They have seen Chamberlain and Hughes excel in relief and have seen mixed results from both as starters. 
 What they have not seen is a full year from Hughes in the rotation. If he wins the job, he would be held to the same threshold as Chamberlain was last season -- roughly 160 innings. Managing that workload can be tedious, but for Hughes to grow as a pitcher and fulfill his promise, he needs that experience. 
 ''Development-wise, it would do a great deal, because I'm able to go and throw those four pitches every five days and get, obviously, a tremendous more amount of innings if I am starting,'' Hughes said Tuesday, adding later: ''But it basically comes down to what the team wants. It's not my place to go around that at all.'' 
 At least two of the pitchers who do not win the fifth starter's spot will have a place in the bullpen. Other spots will go to Mariano Rivera, Dave Robertson, Chan Ho Park and Damaso Marte. That leaves one final bullpen spot to be decided. 
 Marte, the only left-hander assured of a bullpen job, faced four batters in an eventful spring training debut. He gave up singles to Jimmy Rollins and Shane Victorino before Jayson Werth lashed a three-run homer to left. 
 Ryan Howard came up next, after going 0 for 4 with two strikeouts against Marte in the World Series. He connected this time with a line drive off Marte's lower back, knocking him out of the game. Girardi said Marte would be sore, but he is scheduled to pitch again Friday.

HEADLINE: Long-Separated Portraits, on a Wall Together at Last

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
 STUNNING oil portraits of Adam and Eve, both painted in 1613, should logically have been hanging together as a treasured pair. But the vagaries of the art world, where paintings are bought and sold at auction, stored in family attics and basements or cherished on a collector's living room wall for decades, often dictate otherwise.
 Now, reunited for the next few months on the dove gray walls of the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, the two are finally, briefly, side by side. Adam gazes left, Eve gazes right, their eyes meeting again after centuries apart, separated by the Atlantic Ocean. 
 An unusual and intimate show, ''Reunited Masterpieces,'' with 10 carefully chosen pairs of artworks, opened here Feb. 14 and continues until May 30.
 The painter of Adam and Eve is Hendrick Goltzius, a Dutchman who lived from 1558 to 1617. The Wadsworth Atheneum acquired Adam in 2004; Eve belongs to the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Strasbourg, France. 
 Eric Zafran, the curator, who conceived, arranged and designed the show, said the loan was made easier because both institutions were members of Frame, the French Regional and American Museum Exchange, a consortium of museums in cities outside government and economic capitals that work together to share their collections.
 Some of the paintings in the pairs appear extremely different, partly because of different conservation methods, Dr. Zafran explained. The portrait of Adam remains fresh, pink and luminous, while Eve appears older and more weathered, with a light coating of grime and crackling on the surface. 
 A similar stunning contrast marks two large pieces, 61 inches by 68 3/4 inches and 61 1/4 inches by 65 1/2 inches, painted in 1490 by Piero di Cosimo of Italy. The Wadsworth's version, ''The Finding of Vulcan,'' is classically Renaissance, a breath of fresh, clean air, its six clothed women (Vulcan, in the center, is nude) wearing typically flowing garments. 
 Its mate, ''Vulcan and the Beginnings of Civilization,'' borrowed from the National Gallery of Canada, contains 11 figures, including a giraffe in Florence during the period. The colors are muddier, the brushwork much less fine, the birds and beasts oddly out of scale. 
 The show includes a spectacular pair of portraits by the Dutch Master Frans Hals, from 1644, of Joseph Coymans and his wife, Dorothea Berck; he was 52, she, 51. He belongs to the Wadsworth, while she traveled north from the Baltimore Museum of Art to join him. The two have been reunited only once before, in a show in Hals's hometown, Haarlem, in 1962.
 Each of them wears a single white leather glove. ''It's a very characteristic Dutch symbol,'' Dr. Zafran said. ''It's a sign of married love.''
 Another pair of Dutch portraits offers a pointed contrast to the sober black velvets and silks of the adjacent images by Hals. This pair, painted in 1674, includes the original ornate gold plasterwork frames. One shows Johan de la Faille, unapologetically resplendent in a gold embroidered vest and sleeves, his manservant kneeling beside him. 
 The painter, Johannes Verkolje the Elder, was the second-most important painter in Delft, after Vermeer, Dr. Zafran said. Even the choice of medium -- the images are painted on copper -- reflected the sitter's intense interest in signaling his wealth and social status, he said. The wife, Margaretha, in the matching portrait (both owned by the Wadsworth), wears equally opulent attire, a low-cut thick white satin dress and pearl bracelets and earrings. 
 The largest pair in the show is by George Romney of Britain, painted in 1786. The paintings depict Sir John William de la Pole and his second wife, Anne. The painting of Anne de la Pole was sold at auction in London by Christie's in 1913 for $206,850, at the time the highest price ever paid for any object in any country, according to the catalog for the show. 
 The Wadsworth Atheneum acquired Sir John's portrait in 1961, the same year the Museum of Fine Arts was given the companion painting. Though the two museums are only 100 miles apart, this is the first time husband and wife have hung side by side since 1913.
 Moving Lady de la Pole from Boston for the exhibition proved most challenging, Dr. Zafran said. ''Getting her here was an enormous effort. She's at least 10 feet high, and we had to truck her down I-95 in a week filled with snowstorms.''
 Dr. Zafran joined the Atheneum in 1997 from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and soon hoped to reunite such masterpieces. 
 ''This really is a wish fulfillment for a curator to pull together these pieces. You can do it in a book or pictures. But many of these paintings haven't been together in America for a century or more.''
 The show ends with a small, modest pair of pastels of George and Martha Washington, both of which belong to the Wadsworth. They were painted by James Sharples of Britain in 1798 and bequeathed to the museum in 1848 by Daniel Wadsworth, whose father's home became the museum.

HEADLINE: City Opera's Former Director Tracks the Tumult and Breaks Down the Buzz

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
The New York City Opera is never far from the thoughts of Julius Rudel, who was its general director and principal conductor for 22 years, until he stepped aside in 1979, making way for Beverly Sills. I recently met Mr. Rudel, still lively and avuncular at 89, for an interview in his apartment on Central Park West. And the first thing he showed off was his collection of framed sketches of memorable sets from City Opera productions he had conducted. The pictures adorn an entire wall next to his piano. 
 City Opera, which begins its spring season on Thursday with a revival of Mark Lamos's production of Chabrier's ''Etoile,'' has been especially on Mr. Rudel's mind of late. Along with the loyal fans of the company, long called ''the people's opera,'' he was distressed by its recent period of administrative chaos and financial crisis. 
 ''It affects me,'' he said, ''and I hope now it's turned around.'' Under George Steel, City Opera's new and energetic, if somewhat green, general manager, things seem to have stabilized, Mr. Rudel said. He was impressed by the two comeback productions in the fall, the inventively updated ''Don Giovanni'' and the striking revival of Hugo Weisgall's formidable ''Esther,'' he said. He was also gratified to have been invited to conduct part of the gala opening-night program in November.
 Still, he wants to set the record straight. Mr. Rudel is rather amused by all of the promotional buzz in recent years coming from City Opera and other companies, including the Metropolitan Opera under Peter Gelb: all that talk about the need to infuse new works into the repertory, to bring in directors from theater and film, and to boost the dramatic components of opera productions.
 Mr. Rudel's reaction is, basically, been there, done that. His record speaks for itself. 
 During his 22 years he presented 19 world premieres (including Kurka's ''Good Soldier Schweik'' and Weisgall's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author''), 7 American premieres (including Prokofiev's ''Fiery Angel'') and 12 New York premieres (Shostakovich's ''Katerina Ismailova'' and Britten's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' among them), and commissioned 12 operas (notably, Jack Beeson's ''Lizzie Borden'' and Ned Rorem's ''Miss Julie''). 
 Recruiting directors from outside opera? Mr. Rudel brought in Harold Prince, Jerome Robbins, Margaret Webster and Jose Quintero. He cultivated the company's identity as one that emphasizes the total musical and theatrical impact of a production over the star system, although he nurtured his share of stars. Most of them, after achieving success, moved on, including Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras, Sherrill Milnes, Shirley Verrett and Catherine Malfitano. ''We had to laugh a bit,'' Mr. Rudel said. ''It was quite a big list of people we sent along.'' 
 Naturally, he also laughs a bit when he hears house managers today talking up the supposed innovations they are bringing to the field. 
 ''Every one of us has said these things,'' he explained. ''Even Mahler.'' Like all performing arts, opera has gone though cyclical ups and downs. New leaders come along and think they are reinventing the art form. 
 Yet Mr. Rudel may underestimate the daring of the vision he brought to City Opera, especially considering his background. Born in Vienna in 1921, he left in 1938, two months after the Anschluss, with a visa that took him to Paris, where he left for New York. In 1943 he became a rehearsal pianist and vocal coach at City Opera, which then performed at City Center. His conducting debut there came in 1944, with Strauss's ''Gypsy Baron.''
 When he was named general director in 1957, he took it as a given that an American opera company should have an American profile. So he began his tenure with an entire season of American works.
 ''I looked at more than 200 scores, some of them handwritten,'' he said. ''I thought in America we had an inferiority complex, and I wanted to show that we can do this too.''
 That first six-week season City Opera presented 42 performances of 12 works, including Douglas Moore's ''Ballad of Baby Doe,'' Blitzstein's ''Regina'' and Bernstein's ''Trouble in Tahiti.'' Over the next two years Mr. Rudel presented two more all-American seasons. Then came an entire season of international contemporary works. 
 In 1966, for the first production at the company's new home, the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, Mr. Rudel presented the North American premiere of Ginastera's arresting, musically thorny 1964 opera, ''Don Rodrigo,'' with Mr. Domingo in the title role. Later that year the company staged its milestone production of Handel's ''Giulio Cesare'' with Beverly Sills as Cleopatra, a breakthrough performance that finally made her a major star. She remained intensely loyal to City Opera and ran the company for 11 years after retiring from singing. Mr. Domingo, on the other hand, was a short-term City Opera headliner. He made his Met debut in 1968 and before long was being pursued by companies around the world.
 In an effort to keep him on the roster in the early 1970s, Mr. Rudel tried ''a little bit -- how shall I say? -- of subterfuge,'' he said. ''I knew that Placido wanted to conduct,'' he explained. ''I knew he was very musical and had studied conducting.'' 
 So Mr. Rudel invited Mr. Domingo to conduct Verdi's ''Traviata'' in 1973. ''It was O.K.,'' Mr. Rudel said of the performance. ''He was nervous as hell. But it was fine. And for that chance he also gave us some singing performances. You play the cards the way they lie.''
 During City Opera's recent crisis, when the leaderless company courted the opera impresario and provocateur Gerard Mortier as its manager, Mr. Rudel was guarded in his public comments. After a year of planning Mr. Mortier and City Opera parted ways in November 2008. Mr. Mortier said repeatedly in interviews at the time that he was utterly committed to City Opera. That was not the way Mr. Rudel saw things. 
 ''I told people that Mortier was not serious,'' he said. ''This was for self-aggrandizement, a bargaining position.'' Mr. Mortier wound up with the directorship of the Teatro Real in Madrid. 
 Although Mr. Rudel's 35-year association with City Opera has been at the center of his life, he has worked extensively in opera houses and with orchestras around the world and has a legacy of notable recordings. Asked if there if there was a special highlight of his career, without pausing he cited a performance of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' at the theater in Prague where Mozart conducted the work's 1787 premiere. ''Standing where Mozart stood, I had shivers,'' he said. ''I still do, thinking about it.''

HEADLINE: OPEC, Satisfied With Oil Prices, Stands Pat on Production Quotas

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
With oil prices rising tentatively above $80 a barrel as demand picks up in Asia, members of the world's oil cartel see few reasons to complain. Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, OPEC's de facto leader, said this week that oil prices were in a ''happy situation.'' 
 Despite high levels of inventories, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who met in Vienna on Wednesday, decided to keep production levels unchanged for the time being. 
 The ministers anticipated that a rebound in the world economy would increase demand in the coming months. However, Mr. Naimi said producers would remain vigilant and prevent the market from tightening too quickly and putting more pressure on prices.
 ''Good demand, reliable supply, beautiful prices -- we are very happy,'' Mr. Naimi said, according to Reuters.
 After declining for two years because of the recession, global oil demand is expected to rise this year, mostly because of surging economic activity in Asia and a particularly fast rebound in China. The International Energy Agency predicted this month that global oil consumption would rise to 86.6 million barrels a day this year, a 1.8 percent increase from last year.
 Over the last six months, oil prices have been relatively stable, averaging about $75 a barrel while trading in a range of $65 to $85 a barrel. Crude oil futures in New York rose Wednesday after OPEC's decision, settled at $82.93 a barrel, up 1.5 percent. The rise also came as the Energy Department reported a drop in gasoline inventories last week.
 The rebound in demand, and prices, has pushed up gasoline costs at the pump. Gasoline prices typically pick up in the spring, when refiners reduce output to perform regular maintenance in anticipation of an increase in summer demand.
 Gasoline prices now average $2.80 a gallon, up about 17 cents in the last month, according to AAA, the automobile group. That is their highest level in 16 months.
 ''We see prices are very comfortable for producers and consumers -- so why change?,'' Abdulla al-Badri, OPEC's secretary general, said. ''We hope we are out of the woods now. The recession is over, and we have growth. We hope growth will continue in the future and that prices will remain where they are through 2010.''
 However, some ministers expressed concern about prices rising much above their current level. Angola's oil minister, Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos, said that while $70 to $80 a barrel was a fair price for consumers, $90 a barrel could ''jeopardize the market'' by derailing the global rebound. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, has said it favors prices at about $80 a barrel.
 OPEC has the means to limit prices from rising further. The group has plenty of spare capacity after a two-year drop in oil demand forced producers to cut back. Saudi Arabia alone has the ability to raise its production by more than four million barrels a day. Others, like Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, also have some unused capacity that could be ramped up if needed.
 OPEC ministers signaled that they were also uneasy with the high levels of inventories, averaging about 60 days of consumption, a historically high level. But at today's prices, Saudi Arabia and other moderates within OPEC are unlikely to take any steps that would push up prices further. Inventories held by refiners typically cover about 52 days of demand.
 In its statement, OPEC said its members should comply better with their quota commitments. OPEC's discipline has frayed significantly in the last year, with a majority of the group's members producing above their assigned targets. But with high prices, there are few incentives for most countries to abide by their commitments. 
 The last time OPEC cut its production was December 2008, when the cartel's members engineered a series of reductions totaling 4.2 million barrels a day aimed at pushing back oil prices that had slumped to $30 a barrel. Since then, compliance levels have fallen to about 55 percent, from a high of over 80 percent last year. 
 ''We have been sailing very well and we will continue to sail very well,'' Mr. Naimi told reporters in Vienna.

HEADLINE: The Funny Side Of What Can Go Wrong At the Big Meeting

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
WITH the country in a grim mood about corporate America, Hyatt is adding some humor to its marketing in an effort to get companies to hold meetings again.
 In a series of Web videos from the comedy site Funny or Die that begin running Thursday, Hyatt will emphasize what can go wrong when people choose the wrong hotel or meeting planner. (Hint: watch out for rogue mimes.)
 During the economic crisis, holding corporate meetings came to be seen as something high-flying and wasteful, like, say, taking private planes or buying naming rights to a stadium. 
 ''Two thousand nine was a tough year economically, and a large part of our business comes from meetings,'' said Amy Curtis-McIntyre, senior vice president for marketing at Hyatt. 
 With the public and the media criticizing banks that had taken taxpayer money for planning retreats, John G. Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, took out full-page ads in The New York Times and The Washington Post last February to defend corporate events. The impression that ''every employee recognition event is a junket, a boondoggle, a waste, or that it's for highly paid executives,'' he said, was ''nonsense.''
 Still, Wells Fargo called off all its employee-recognition events for 2009, and a rash of other companies made similar cancellations.
 And in 2010, according to a December study from the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, a majority of travel managers say they will use more video or Web conferencing, rather than in-person meetings, to cut travel budgets.
 That leaves Hyatt in a bit of a pickle.
 ''We consider meeting expertise to be something that separates us from our competitors, and something we have a real intuition for,'' Ms. Curtis-McIntyre said. For example, she said, Hyatt meeting planners schedule frequent breaks, stock buffets with high-energy foods and use chairs that are comfortable enough to sit in for seven hours.
 ''The meetings business was slow in 2009, and slow as we come into 2010, so we thought the timing was right to put out an aggressive, confident invitation to get together again,'' Ms. Curtis-McIntyre said.
 In the past, Hyatt's campaigns for meetings have centered on ads in publications like ''Successful Meetings,'' and e-mail to meetings planners. It realized, through internal research, that more than half of small meetings -- 100 people or fewer -- are not organized by an event planner. ''They don't routinely read those trades,'' she said.
 ''The average meeting holder could be a C.E.O., someone holding a reunion, an H.R. professional, an administrative assistant,'' she said. ''They all say the same thing: that a meeting has to have great food, the audio-visual has to work, and the planner doesn't want to get yelled at. So we thought there was something interesting in that.''
 The Funny or Die videos show a meeting organizer getting the blame when things go awry. In one, the organizer notes that the hotel is the hippest in all downtown, and that the meeting adviser helped him book a table at the club next door. When the presentation begins, though, it is interrupted by thumping bass from the club, then by a pair of clubgoers embracing. As the meeting organizer is fired, Hyatt ends with the tagline ''Bad meetings happen. Just not here.'' 
 In another one, a Benihana-style chef distracts attendees. An executive finally gets the group under control, and starts discuss his plan for increasing profits -- but is interrupted by a mime. 
 Funny or Die, which was co-founded by Will Ferrell and others as a comedy Web site, has been moving into brand-sponsored videos. Recent branded projects include a video featuring Tori Spelling for the toilet-paper brand Cottonelle, and one with Tony Romo for the apparel line Starter.
 Hyatt paid less than $300,000 for the project, including production and advertising. ''It's a lot cheaper for the client, yet they're getting the quality,'' said Dick Glover, chief executive of Funny or Die. ''You look in the big media companies, you look at agencies, traditional places, they've built up over the years this system and overhead and people that have been with them 23 years and have gotten 5 percent pay raises every year. You end up adding it all together, and things become very expensive.''
 Also, he said, Funny or Die had an established following among its audience (which is largely young, male and upscale, Mr. Glover said). ''We can market that into the social media space, to an audience where we have credibility and where perhaps a consumer products company doesn't.'' (Funny or Die has almost 1.5 million followers on Twitter and almost 50,000 Facebook fans.)
 Mr. Glover said he was not worried that Funny or Die would lose credibility if it was perceived to be pushing products. 
 ''The key, the absolute key, is to be funny,'' he said. ''It's not that this audience doesn't want advertising -- they dislike bad advertising.''
 PHD, Hyatt's media agency, struck the partnership, part of a project in which PHD will aim to spend $2 million to $3 million in 2010 with Funny or Die for other clients, a list that includes HBO and Starbucks. 
 ''It's more cost-efficient,'' said Andrew Chomer, director of strategic partnerships at PHD, part of the Omnicom Media Group division of the Omnicom Group. ''If I chase down a guy like Zach Galifianakis, and I go to CAA, it's going to cost me $1 million to get him in a video. If I go to Funny or Die, they have these relationships,'' and someone like Mr. Galifianakis could be lined up ''for somewhere in the ballpark, of, like $75,000 to $100,000,'' Mr. Chomer said.
 ''It's about fitting the brand into a relevant audience,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Groundbreaking Partnership Unites Decades of Research

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
MOST people associate museums with art and artifacts, not research libraries. But many of New York's most prestigious museums have extensive collections of books and papers. Four of them -- the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the Frick Collection -- have combined forces to share resources, save money and make their holdings more accessible to the public.
 Together these institutions make up the New York Art Resources Consortium, an integrated library system formed in 2007 that is supported by grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Its Web site, nyarc.org, just went on line in February. Last year, three of the museums united their collections in one catalog, called Arcade (the Met has kept its catalog separate). 
 ''This allows us to do some things collaboratively that we weren't able to do individually,'' said Milan R. Hughston, the chief of library and museum archives at MoMA. ''Together we aggregate close to a million books, articles, periodicals and special collections that document art history.''
 The database, at arcade.nyarc.org, is a trove of more than 800,000 records from ancient Egypt to contemporary art that includes exhibition and auction sale catalogs, monographs, periodicals, rare books, photographs and archival materials.
 The Arcade program allows users to search all three libraries' combined holdings and also conduct searches of specific collections. In addition, the Web site has links to recent acquisitions, bibliographies, new digital collections and library blogs. 
 ''The culture of each museum is so unique, they haven't had a tradition of doing this,'' said Deborah Kempe, chief of collections management and access at the Frick Art Reference Library. ''It's groundbreaking in the world of art information.''
 ''It's all about making sure that we stay vibrant, alive places,'' Ms. Kempe added. ''The whole is larger than its parts. We can maximize our strengths. We can showcase collections at each site, but together pack more of a punch. The possibilities are endless.'' 
 The research collections had previously primarily served scholars, museum and art market professionals, collectors and graduate students. But by coordinating their efforts, the museums hope to reach a wider audience. ''We all have a mission to the public that isn't generally known and we want to highlight that,'' Ms. Kempe said. ''There are many other people that could use this material. We would like the word to be out even more.''
 All of these libraries have been affected by the economic downturn, and the consortium hopes to save money by, for example, sharing a subscription to a journal. ''Part of the objective is to bring certain economies and efficiencies to our operations, to look at centralizing core activities -- cataloging, processing, acquisitions, conservation, storage of print collections, digital collections,'' said Kenneth Soehner, the chief librarian at the Met's Watson Library. ''We realized that sustainability -- if not survivability -- lies in good, strong, effective, collaborative relationships. The goal is to reduce some of the redundancy in the system.''
 ''The potential for this collaboration and the need for this collaboration is greater every day as we face economic challenges,'' Mr. Soehner continued. ''I'm still confident that a consolidation of our activities could bring significant cost reductions.''
 With a staff of 42 and nearly 700,000 volumes, the Met has one of the largest art museum libraries in the world, Mr. Soehner said. It attracts 28,000 visitors a year and adds 1,000 books to the collection every month. ''There is a much greater chance of continuing that distinction through collaboration with other libraries,'' he said.
 But the consortium has also made the participating museums realize the specific strengths of their individual holdings. ''It allows us to see what we have that's unique and rare,'' said Deirdre Lawrence, the principal librarian at the Brooklyn Museum. ''The libraries reflect what's in the museum collections. There is not a lot of duplication.''
 ''What we've been able to do is broaden knowledge of what we have,'' she added. ''We've opened up the doors and let the world in.'' 
 The Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives, for example, includes the Wilbour Library of Egyptology, founded in 1934 with the personal library of Charles Edwin Wilbour, one of America's first Egyptologists, who provided the foundation for the museum's Egyptian antiquities collection. The Frick has sketchbooks of artists who went to Egypt. ''These things all complement each other,'' Ms. Kempe said.
 The Frick Art Reference Library, established in 1920 by Helen Clay Frick -- the daughter of Henry Clay Frick, who founded the adjacent museum -- has collections relating to fine and decorative arts from the fourth century to the mid-20th century by artists from Europe and the Americas. Its photo archive includes more than one million photographs documenting the work of 36,000 artists. 
 ''The Frick was collecting in areas the Met wasn't,'' Mr. Hughston said. 
 If someone wants to research Latin America, they can draw on the Brooklyn Museum library's Spanish Colonial holdings or the Modern's contemporary material. ''If you're looking for anything related to Picasso, you're going to go to MoMA,'' said Lily Pregill, Arcade's project coordinator and systems manager. ''But you'll also find things at the Frick that you may not have known were there.''
 The libraries, in turn, can work together to curate online exhibitions, oral histories and other projects. ''What we're looking at is collaborative projects that will fill gaps in terms of research,'' Ms. Lawrence said.
 ''We spend thousands of dollars on books and periodicals,'' she continued. ''We want them to be used. We don't want them to just sit on the shelves.''

HEADLINE: On Safari, Off the Beaten Path in Kansas

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: CHANUTE, Kan. 

 BODY:
 THE story of Martin and Osa Johnson, an American couple whose documented journeys to places like Africa transformed them into national celebrities in the first part of the last century, has faded with time. Even in some parts of Kansas, where the couple grew up before setting off on their adventures, mention of the Johnsons can now draw looks of puzzlement.
 But here in the rolling hills of southeastern Kansas, in the town where Osa Johnson grew up, their memory is alive and well. Inside an old train depot, the halls of the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum are filled with photographs from their trips, copies of their books and the possessions they carried -- film splicers, licenses to fly airplanes, a waffle iron, even Mrs. Johnson's zebra skin shoes.
 Occupying these halls, too, is the double challenge of a small museum off the beaten track: How to explain the significance of a once-famed couple to an audience now accustomed to glancing at African scenes with the click of a mouse; and how to do that from a town that sits about two hours from the nearest major city (Wichita, Kansas City and Tulsa, Okla., are each about the same distance away.) 
 The museum in Chanute, home to fewer than 10,000 residents, draws 5,000 or 6,000 visitors a year, said Conrad Froehlich, the director, who notes that small facilities, though often overlooked, actually make up the vast majority of the nation's museums. ''That's peanuts compared to the Field Museum,'' Mr. Froehlich said of attendance here, referring to the natural history museum in Chicago. ''But for where we are, that's not bad.''
 The museum draws its share of Osa and Martin Johnson devotees from far and wide. But other visitors, Mr. Froehlich acknowledges, have never heard of them. 
 ''Some people just see the sign and stop in, and you can watch those visitors getting excited as they learn about the Johnsons for the first time,'' he said. ''That reminds me why we're here. What we're doing is keeping their legacy alive.''
 By the 1920s and 1930s, Martin and Osa Johnson were household names and faces -- as famous in their era, according to one Johnson historian, as Michael Jackson. Their comings and goings made headlines and, in perhaps the modern measure of celebrity, Mrs. Johnson had a stalker.
 They were ordinary Kansas kids, as museum officials put it, without wealthy backgrounds or lengthy educations. Martin Johnson, a lanky boy raised in Independence, Kan., not far from here, was expelled from school for a photography prank that made fun of the school principal, the museum notes, though the episode is not emphasized before the busloads of Kansas schoolchildren who travel here on field trips. 
 At a young age, Mr. Johnson yearned for adventure and managed to travel with Jack London on his 1907 voyage on the Snark. After marrying when Osa was 16 (another fact not emphasized for school groups), the pair set off on their exploits, spending years in Africa and the South Pacific and documenting the animals, people and scenes they saw in a series of films. Mr. Johnson captured the images. Mrs. Johnson, who was also a photographer and filmmaker, starred. 
 The films were successful. Tours and talks followed. So did books.
 ''They projected the ideal American couple, and they really debunked a great deal of the previous imagery of Africa at the time,'' said Dr. Pascal James Imperato, dean of the school of public health at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, who edited Mrs. Johnson's final book, published after her death; co-wrote a biography of the Johnsons; and is an honorary trustee of the museum. ''They made Africa a place of beauty and tranquillity that was accessible almost as if it were a backyard in Kansas.''
 But in 1937, Mr. Johnson died in a commercial plane crash in the United States. Mrs. Johnson, whose 1940 autobiography, ''I Married Adventure,'' became a best seller, died in New York in 1953. 
 In the years that followed, some forgot about the Johnsons, whose films now seem dated. Some in new generations never heard of them. And travel -- and travelogues -- shifted, both in technology, style and reason for being. 
 The museum opened in 1961, thanks to contributions and efforts from Osa Johnson's mother, Belle Leighty, who still lived in Chanute at the time. It has expanded to include objects of African art and an ethnographic collection of masks, tools and musical instruments. It also developed traveling exhibitions and moved to its current, more polished setting. 
 The museum's 10,000 square feet (including a storage facility and space shared with a library) house a cozy theater and a gallery with statues of the Johnsons -- Martin before his camera -- at the center. The gallery guides the uninitiated through the Johnsons' story, featuring childhood clothing and personal memorabilia and photographs from their trips.
 Survival for any small nonprofit museum is hard, not least of all during a recession. With two full-time employees and one part-time worker, Mr. Froehlich said, the museum ''stretches things as far as we can'' to manage its $150,000-to-$200,000 annual budget. Since the 1970s, the museum has entered into licensing deals for the images of the Johnsons, a way to make ends meet.
 But those efforts have picked up sharply in recent years, and a larger campaign is under way, according to a lawyer who has been hired to lead the museum's licensing efforts. American Eagle Outfitters had a licensing agreement with the museum in connection with the retailer's Martin + Osa stores. The stores, which American Eagle recently decided to close, used the museum archives for ''design and lifestyle inspiration,'' according to the clothing line. A Hollywood producer is developing a movie. 
 If that all sounds contrary to the academic work of a museum, Mr. Froehlich says that it is quite in keeping with the way the Johnsons themselves got by. Some view them as pioneers in the notion of product placement in film. They used items like Hershey candy bars and Bisquick in their movies and elsewhere in order to pay for the next adventure, he said. 
 In any case, Mr. Froehlich said, none of it clashes with the museum's goal: ''Introducing the Johnsons' story and lives to a younger and more diverse group.''
 Jacquelyn Borgeson, the museum's curator, says she sees signs that their story is re-emerging. In different decades, different fields of study have focused in on the Johnsons, finding relevance in their work. 
 In the 1960s, she says, the Johnsons were rediscovered by conservationists. Then in the 1970s, anthropologists found them, followed by scholars of women's studies in the 1980s and aviation specialists in the '90s. During the last decade, those in the fashion world found Mrs. Johnson (who had her own clothing line and was once voted one of America's best-dressed women). 
 ''They're slowly coming back, niche by niche,'' she said. ''It's a slow process.''
 Others, too, are finding them, perhaps accidentally along the quiet road through this town. On an afternoon this year, the halls were mostly empty, but for a few of the curious. 
 In a museum this size, there is time and space for visitors' journals. A recent entry gushed, ''Osa Johnson is a woman who knew how to live.''

HEADLINE: Detroit Plan Would Close 45 Schools

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
In a continuing overhaul of one of the most troubled school systems in the nation, officials in Detroit on Wednesday announced a plan to close 45 of 172 public schools at the end of the academic year. The move is the latest in a string of efforts aimed at rescuing an academically failing district in the midst of a financial crisis. 
 Detroit has closed more than 100 schools since 2004, yet still has more than 50,000 excess seats throughout the system.
 Robert C. Bobb, the emergency manager appointed last year by Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm to take control of the schools, proposed the closings, which would eliminate as many as 2,100 jobs, in the face of a deficit expected to peak at $316.6 million and a dwindling student population.
 Only 3 percent of Detroit fourth graders were proficient in math on the last National Assessment of Educational Progress, an annual test of basic skills. The district is the largest in Michigan, with 87,000 students, most of whom are poor and black.
 ''I think you can say Detroit has hit bottom,'' said Jack Jennings, president of the Center on Education Policy, a research group in Washington. ''I don't see how things could get much worse, so you'd hope there would be a chance to bring about improvement that they need so much.''
 This week, Mr. Bobb announced a sweeping academic plan that calls for smaller class sizes, a 98 percent graduation rate and significant improvement in students' yearly progress. ''We have no more time to waste,'' Mr. Bobb wrote in the plan.
 The closings are part of a $1 billion facilities plan to be phased in over five years, paid for in part by federal stimulus money. Many students attend classes in outdated buildings in neighborhoods that are marked by abandonment. 
 The teachers' union, the Detroit Federation of Teachers, said it opposed the closing of so many schools at once. 
 In the coming weeks, the district will hold public meetings for community comment before Mr. Bobb makes a decision in April.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With Philippe de Montebello

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
WHEN Philippe de Montebello retired at the end of 2008 after 31 years as director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he found himself back where he started: in the classrooms of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, the very school where he had earned a master's degree more than 30 years ago. 
 Now teaching the history and culture of museums, Mr. de Montebello reflects on how he ended up in the academic world, how things have changed since he was a student and on arts education in general. 
 Q.Why did you decide to teach? 
 A. I always figured I would. I've always been a bit of a didact; now the didact is let loose. I love working with ideas and putting them together; creating narratives and what I want to impart to students. And I have to say the students at a place like this -- which is one of the top schools in the country and in New York -- are very bright. They know a lot. I meet with them. We talk about their papers, assignments or about their careers, and I find that extremely stimulating. And you feel good. 
 You feel as if you are contributing something, and in some ways there is a greater specificity of reward because a lot of it is one on one or a small cluster of people at a still impressionable age where you can inflect the discourse, maybe have some influence on their lives, their careers. 
 Q.How many classes do you teach? 
 A. I taught a lecture in the spring/fall, which basically means 14 weeks, a two-hour lecture every week. It's a huge amount of work and preparation and it was entitled ''The Meaning of Museums,'' about the ideas behind the formation of museums starting all the way from antiquity through the Age of Enlightenment into the 19th century. I barely touched the 20th century. 
 It's a fascinating story, obviously the most simplistic way with the opening up of private collections or princely collections to a broader and broader public, until you reach the point where collections are formed from the start for the public. It all begins with sanctuaries in ancient Greece and treasuries in medieval Europe, and earlier even with libraries. 
 And this spring I'm actually teaching a colloquium, which is like a seminar with about a dozen students and another dozen auditors about issues to do with cultural property in which I figure I am an unwitting expert. And I've invited a number of people to teach with me so that the students get not only one point of view. 
 And I've told them from the start if you violently disagree with me and you do it in a very well-researched and well-written paper, you'll get an A. I'm not here to tell my collecting views versus archaeologists'. 
 So next Tuesday I have Brian Rose, the head of the Archaeological Institute of America, coming in. I have Sir John Boardman, who is the great classicist from Oxford, talking about the Parthenon. I've also asked Hugh Eakin because he's written a lot about the subject and knows the press. 
 I've always been puzzled at the rapidity and the eagerness of the press to embrace the anticollecting lobby. The press has been for the archaeologists and for the source countries and against museums. So I want Eakin to speak about this and tell us why. 
 Q. You were a student here. How has teaching changed?
 A. There's no question it has become more theoretical: more looking at the anthropology, the sociology, the economics surrounding art history. But the institute, like Columbia, is still one of the graduate schools that, while it does some of the theoretical teaching, is still a place where connoisseurship is not the ''C'' word; where it is taught; where there is a fair amount of object-based teaching; where professors cross the street and take their students to the Met. On the other hand, the whole field, if you start looking across the United States, has become very theoretical. 
 Q.Why do you think that is? 
 A. I think a lot of it may have to do with postmodernism and a kind of P.C. mentality of relativism; increasingly there are a lot of people in the academic world who have trouble with the masterpiece, with the concept of good, better, best. I don't know why. I think it's egalitarianism. But it's changing back. My very presence here now teaching the history and culture of museums is an indication of this. 
 Q.How have the students changed? 
 A. I've given a million public lectures in the last 35 years, but I have really not taught students. So, for me, I really have no basis of comparison. I would say they're highly focused, perhaps more than we were. And they're already quite specialized. In a way they don't have quite the breadth, the same frame of reference as their elders. At the same time they know certain defined subjects in depth. 
 Q.Are a lot of your students looking to become curators? 
 A. More than I might have thought. And they are also influenced by their own sense of where they are likely to get a job. If you are studying Byzantine or ancient subjects, older things, you are less likely to find something in museums. 
 Q.Do you find the role of the museum curator broader than it once was?
 A. Yes. I've watched it evolve and change in 30 years when I was at the Met. Curators are much more involved in their own budgeting for exhibitions and working more closely with editorial departments on books and catalogs, with development, helping with fund-raising, which I never did as a young curator. Well, it's a logical thing. Put yourself in the donor's shoes. You're more likely to give if the presentation is made by a curator who brings the knowledge and expresses it with passion. 
 Q.Do you find that graduate students are more sophisticated or hoping to get something different out of school? 
 A. They're more sophisticated in the sense that they are older than when I was a student. I am not a sociologist so I can't explain the phenomenon. It may have something to do with the economy; maybe they couldn't afford the school before. I don't know. They tend to have a more interesting curriculum vitae. I didn't have a curriculum vitae -- Harvard, N.Y.U., that was my curriculum vitae, and two years in the Army. Now they've been on fellowships in Cairo. They have worked at Christie's or Sotheby's or in a museum. They've traveled more. 
 Q. Are museums making more of an impact educationally? A. To me, one of the great challenges of the future is the absence of a general education or humanistic education, so little of which is provided by the schools and so much of which is necessary to create the audiences of the future because the audiences for art museums by definition are going to come from the better educated, more humanistically inclined people in our population. 
 And the difficulty is that museums can do just so much. They simply cannot function in lieu of the schools. You can provide the programs but the programs museums tend to provide are for people who come to the museum, programs for those already in the chorus. 
 While materials are created now for teachers, museums can establish a stronger presence maybe through the Internet or some other relationships with universities and with schools. I'm not talking specifically or exclusively about art education. I'm talking about the curriculum with more literature, more history and, of course, also art. The broad range of the humanities need to be taught along with obvious notions of art history, with the artists, the monuments, the architecture. 
 Q.Do you find that curators these days seem less specialized and more connected to other parts of the museum? 
 A. You simply can no longer balkanize the institution. Art and artists are not isolated. They travel, they experience multiple influences, across borders, across time. 
 There was an era when it was easier to get a loan from the British Museum than from your colleague down the hall. Let me tell you it happens, but a lot less. You've got to be able to show the continuity, the breadth, the interconnections from within the collections, but that's a relatively new thing. It used to be much harder to get different departments to work together on a project. 
 At the Met, we did it in a small way. For example, Chinese ceramics were shown with Iranian metalwork, showing that one influenced the other. Since both were in the collection the curators talked and put it together. If you're going to do thematic shows, where it's not the artist or the school, but the iconography or kind of art which is represented, then it can work. 
 If, for example, you're doing an exhibition on tea cups, you can't just have Meissen tea cups, unless you're doing a Meissen show. So you're going to show a tea cup from Japan, one from China, one from Germany, one from France. 
 Q.What has been your biggest surprise as a teacher?
 A. A double surprise: It's even more rewarding and pleasurable than I thought. But it's also even harder than I thought. If you're conscientious and you are dealing with young minds and people who really pay attention to what you say, not that they view it as the Bible, but you cannot be flippant. You have to realize that everything you say has to be properly documented, has to be well researched, because they will take it very seriously as you're the teacher and they're the student. Yet, that sense of accountability -- you have to deliver the best that you can -- is what is ultimately the most satisfying.

HEADLINE: It's the Stagnant Pay, Not the Stench, That Upsets Sewage Workers in the City

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
On a good day, the unpleasant byproducts of human existence simply flow tepidly beneath their noses. 
 On lesser days, unmentionable objects block the huge grates in the sewer channels. The workers descend knee deep into the muck and scrape at the dripping clogs. The gunk drips to their shoulders and splashes on their faces, working its way into pores and psyches.
 But many of the nearly 1,200 workers who process some 1.4 billion gallons of New York City sewage every day say they can handle those indignities. What disgusts them, what has tested sobriety, credit ratings and marriages more than any stubborn stench, is the fact that their salaries have not budged, in some cases for as long as 15 years. 
 ''It's disrespectful,'' said Michael Enright, an 18-year sewage-treatment veteran. ''I've got to change bearings and seals on million-dollar pumps with raw sewage flowing between my legs, and we make less than an auto mechanic.'' 
 In general, the city's municipal labor force has enjoyed nearly a dozen years of steady wage increases from the Bloomberg administration and the second term of the Giuliani administration. Most have seen salaries rise at a pace faster than inflation and better than the national average for both private and public employees, according to the Citizens Budget Commission.
 But a few municipal unions, for differing reasons, did not catch that rising tide. And none seem to have fared worse than the workers who keep the city's sewage system running.
 In the 1990s, two unions representing the sewage workers pulled out of negotiations for incremental increases and took a different route offered in state law: seeking a ruling that they were not being paid on par with similar jobs in the private sector. 
 Last year, the union representing about 800 sewage-treatment workers, Local 1320 of District Council 37, thought that it had finally won and would soon see a raise of about 50 percent, to match the pay of some Con Edison workers who the city comptroller and an administrative law judge had determined perform similar work. But the elation, after nine years without a contract, lasted only days before city lawyers filed an appeal, stretching out the process again.
 ''That was such a slap in the face,'' Mr. Enright said. ''We had guys who fell off the wagon because of this appeal.''
 Sewage-treatment workers earn an average of about $42,000 a year, a figure unchanged since 2001. Los Angeles pays a starting salary of $71,000 for similar work.
 The other union, Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, declined to discuss the status of its effort. It represents two categories of workers at the plants, including the plant managers, who have not seen a cost-of-living raise since 1995 and make an average of $59,600 a year -- less than many of the people they supervise.
 ''That's a travesty,'' said Frank Esposito, a plant manager who retired this month after 36 years with the Department of Environmental Protection. ''But in the last 10 years, we turned around the Hudson River and the East River. And you never heard about us causing a job action. That's what I'm proud of. We did our jobs.''
 The job today is a mix of old-world toil and a modern technician's skills. 
 Raw sewage flows into the 14 treatment plants scattered around the city's waterfront. Solid matter settles in holding tanks and is sold as fertilizer. The remaining water undergoes treatment before being released into the surrounding waterways.
 The workers take federally required water and solid-matter samples at specific intervals. They monitor levels of dangerous gases, including methane and hydrogen sulfide, and handle chemical and biological agents. 
 That predictable routine goes on every day. But the workers are also the jack-of-all-trades repairmen when something goes wrong. They perform emergency repairs on climate control systems, chlorination devices and huge pumps. Most come from construction backgrounds; they must have skills in plumbing, welding, masonry and carpentry. They take holding tanks off line and wade in to perform repairs. 
 ''I've been knee deep in raw sewage at 7:15 in the morning, and let me tell you, it don't smell like Folgers in your cup,'' said Anthony Mongiello, who has been in the job for nine years. ''That is one of those smells you just don't get used to.''
 They know their work is the opposite of glamorous. The first part of the e-mail address of James J. Tucciarelli, the president of Local 1320, is 1in2bus, short for No. 1 in the No. 2 business. Their unofficial slogan is a less delicate version of ''Your poop is our bread and butter.''
 From surges in flow, they know the mundane rhythms of our collective lives, like when we rise, shower, do the dishes and go to sleep. They know when halftime starts during the Super Bowl. 
 There are pieces of their lore that can sound as far-fetched as the fabled sewer alligator. Some say the smell of the plant takes root in a new worker's intestines during the first year, and that surviving that year makes a soul hardier than most. 
 ''I've had like two common colds since I started in 1992,'' Mr. Enright said. ''What we work with at the plant just hardens your immune system.''
 But there are risks. In January 2009, a sewage-treatment worker was killed when a temporary conveyor belt collapsed at the Owls Head Wastewater Treatment Plant, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called the worker, Gennaro Montello, 45, a married father of two, one of the city's ''unsung workers.''
 Mr. Bloomberg thanked sewage-treatment workers in December, when the city emerged from eight years under federal probation for ignoring federal environmental laws and, later, for failing to maintain backup generators at several treatment plants during the 2003 blackout, which caused the illegal discharge of 30 million gallons of sewage into the East River. 
 The treatment workers were not feeling gratitude when city lawyers appealed the decision of the administrative law judge that would have ended their years without a raise. The city asked for a hearing in September, potentially stretching out the standoff further. But in late-night sessions on Monday and Tuesday, the city and the leaders of both unions reached tentative settlements, which must be ratified by each union's members. 
 Mr. Enright, meanwhile, is moonlighting as a caretaker at the home of a wealthy suburbanite. Another treatment worker is moonlighting as a school custodian. Mr. Mongiello said that inflation, combined with flat wages, had made him fall behind on mortgage payments. 
 Several workers said they were angry that state law did not allow them to strike. Mr. Tucciarelli said he understood his members' frustration.
 ''I've got guys making $15.01 an hour doing skilled work that on the outside would be getting paid triple that,'' Mr. Tucciarelli said. ''I've got guys losing houses, going into bankruptcy.''
 Payroll records show how upside down salaries in the plants have become. Mr. Tucciarelli earns a base salary of $55,931 a year after 32 years on the job. His two sons work in the less-skilled title of construction laborer for the same department, and each has a base salary of about $73,000 a year. 
 Martin McGuire, whose grandfather and father were city police officers, had been working as an electrician when he started as a sewage-treatment worker in 1992. Mr. McGuire said the wage then was a little less than those for the skilled trades, but it came without threat of seasonal layoffs. He now figures his counterparts in the private sector are making double what he does, without wading through raw sewage. 
 ''When I started, you could hold your head up,'' Mr. McGuire said. ''It was a great group of guys. But let me tell you, the morale? It's over.''

HEADLINE: The New Guard Steps Up

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
 THE mouth of a giant monster, its razor-sharp teeth glaring overhead and its tongue forming a long red carpet, ushers visitors into the Tim Burtonretrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. Although the intentionally lighthearted chronicle of the filmmaker's work received only mixed reviews when it opened in November, Mr. Burton's fans don't seem to care. More than 450,000 people have already attended the show, and by the time it closes on April 26, attendance is expected to exceed that of recent blockbusters like the museum's ''Van Gogh: The Colors of the Night'' last year and ''Dali: Painting and Film,'' in 2008. 
 Visitors to the show are relatively young, somewhere in their 30s on average, which makes them a decade younger than usual for MoMA, recent surveys showed. And a surprising one-third of this audience had never stepped foot in the museum before. 
 ''We'd never done anything like this,'' said Rajendra Roy, the museum's chief curator of film, who was one of the show's organizers. ''There's always a learning curve. Would I have done things differently? I don't think so.'' 
 For a 37-year-old curator, Mr. Roy seems pretty cool about it all, considering that only a few years ago he started his professional life selling tickets at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Yet as museum directors have come to realize, younger minds attract younger audiences. And Mr. Roy is just one of a growing group of rising curatorial stars cutting quite a different figure from the age-old image of museum curator as a fusty academic.
 Sitting in his office, a small space whose walls are covered with movie posters, Mr. Roy is tall, elegant and articulate when talking about how he landed the coveted job of running MoMA's film department, the second-largest at the institution after painting and sculpture. 
 ''When I first heard they were looking for someone I was convinced I was NOT the person,'' he said. ''I was too young, too out there, not academic.'' 
 Yet as soon as he got the call to come in and talk about the position, he said, he had to ''at least accept a conversation.'' Fifteen interviews later, he was offered the job. ''It was fascinating, nerve-racking and a bit like ''American Idol,' '' he recalled.
 During good economic times, many young people like Mr. Roy would have snubbed the museum world, preferring instead to become a filmmaker or a big shot at an international film festival. Many young curators with backgrounds in art history would have jumped at the seemingly more glamorous life as an art dealer. But in these turbulent times, the stability of a museum job is attractive. 
 ''Museums are safe harbors in this difficult economic time,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the MoMA, who said that Mr. Roy was one of a growing number of curators at MoMA in their 30s and early 40s. ''Previously you were in your late 40s or 50s before becoming a senior curator, but all that's changed,'' he added. ''These curators look at things more broadly. This is a generation who grew up entirely in the digital world and they are untroubled by distinctions of media.'' 
 It is also a group plugged in to all areas of museum life. They don't simply organize exhibitions, they also have a hand in fund-raising and public relations, catalog production and installation. ''The old-fashioned notion of a curator was that of a connoisseur who made discoveries and attributions,'' said Scott Rothkopf, 33, who is the latest full-time curator to join the Whitney Museum of American Art's team. ''A lot of that work has already been done. The younger generation is trained to think differently, to think more about ideas.'' 
 Although Mr. Rothkopf came to the Whitney from Artforum, where he was the magazine's senior editor, like many of today's younger generation he landed where he is the traditional way, earning graduate degrees in art history from Harvard. Others, like Mr. Roy, came to it through less conventional channels. Right before joining MoMA, he had been the artistic director of the Hamptons International Film Festival. 
 There are also people like Hao Sheng, 37, the curator of Chinese art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, who started out wanting to become a professional potter, or his colleague Jen Mergel, 33, a sculptor who graduated from Harvard with a degree in visual and environmental studies. Ms. Mergel also earned a master's at the Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture at Bard College.
 ''I started teaching studio art courses at Harvard,'' she said. ''But I loved talking about other artists' work rather than doing my own.'' Now she is the senior curator for contemporary art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where she is responsible for the development, planning and organization of the museum's new wing for contemporary art, scheduled to open in June 2011. ''This is a big, big step for Boston,'' she said. ''We are giving one-quarter of the museum's campus over to contemporary art.''
 Going from being a teacher to curator isn't as great a leap as it seems. ''Teaching is about engaging students by telling a good story and that's what a good curator does, too,'' said Clara Drummond, 32, who was the co-curator of ''A Woman's Wit: Jane Austen's Life and Legacy,'' which ran through Sunday at the Morgan Library and Museum in Manhattan. 
 One of Ms. Drummond's biggest challenges when faced with presenting Austen, her world and her letters was figuring out how to best engage the audience. ''It could be deadly boring,'' Ms. Drummond admitted. But because she saw Austen's letters as ''little puzzles'' she put a lot of them in frames on the walls because, as she explained, ''in glass cases you feel distanced from them.'' She also paired the letters with satirical prints by artists like James Gillray and drawings by William Blake and was involved in the production of a 16-minute film with personalities like Fran Lebowitz, Cornell West and Colm Toibin talking about Austen. 
 ''We need to reach beyond the museum walls,'' she said. 
 David van der Leer, who turned 30 last month, is the assistant curator for architecture and design at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. He, too, is thinking beyond the physical museum.
 Teaming up with Nancy Spector, the museum's deputy director and chief curator, they organized ''Contemplating the Void: Interventions in the Guggenheim Museum,'' an exhibition of renderings by nearly 200 artists, architects and designers who were asked to imagine their dream interventions in the rotunda of the museum's Frank Lloyd Wright home. Besides being on view in the museum, each image is on the Guggenheim's Web site.
 Mr. van der Leer said he was also hoping to present a number of small architecture shows in cities where the Guggenheim did not already have an outpost. ''You can do something very ephemeral,'' he said. ''It can be any time and last just a few weeks, or a few months and then it's gone.'' 
 And although most of their exhibitions are temporary, these curators say they are in it for the long haul. Not one is embarrassed to acknowledge they work in a place as seemingly staid as a museum. ''In this economy, most of my friends in the film industry are out of work,'' Mr. Roy said. ''Suddenly, being a museum administrator, a job with stability, seems sexy.'' 
 NINE STANDING OUT
 Rajendra Roy, 37
 Since he was appointed chief curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art nearly three years ago, the California-born Mr. Roy says, he has been trying to make the museum's film programs more accessible to a broader audience. Although he has no graduate degree (he did get a bachelor's degree in political science and French literature from the University of California, San Diego), he is now in charge of a staff of 25. The job also requires overseeing MoMA's film archives. Presently, he is trying to create more regular film programs. 
 ''I am re-establishing daytime screenings and regularly scheduled events like talks with directors,'' Mr. Roy said. ''I also want MoMA to be a place where people know they can come and see avant-garde films.'' 
 He is also determined to introduce online ticketing. ''That's the way people go to the movies,'' he said. ''And if MoMA doesn't offer this, we're missing out.'' 
 Hao Sheng, 37
 Born in Shanghai, Mr. Hao was educated in the United States and studied physics at the College of Wooster, Ohio, but he soon switched to studio arts and art history. With a Watson Fellowship, he traveled to Japan for three years and apprenticed to the master potter Shimaoka Tatsuzo (who died in 2007) in the rural village of Mashiko. He came back to the United States in 2002 and received a master of Chinese art history from Harvard University, where he is a Ph.D. candidate. He is now the curator of Chinese art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
 ''Although I am a potter by training, I enjoyed working with objects,'' Mr. Hao said. He is organizing the show ''Fresh Ink: Ten Takes on Chinese Tradition,'' opening in November, in which 10 artists from China will present new works inspired by masterpieces from the museum's permanent collection. 
 ''For curators my age the boundaries are no longer so clearly drawn,'' he said. ''Things are more open.''
 Would he ever consider going back to being a potter? ''I think often about going back,'' he said. ''Maybe when I turn 50 I'll go back to the wheels.'' 
 Jen Mergel, 33
 Ms. Mergel joined the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston last month as its senior curator of contemporary art, responsible for managing the institution's contemporary collection, organizing exhibitions, identifying acquisitions and expanding programs at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. But perhaps her biggest challenge is presenting the debut exhibition for the seven new galleries for art from the 1950s to the present, scheduled to open in June 2011. 
 Ms. Mergel earned a degree in visual and environmental studies at Harvard and a master's at Bard College. ''I did my thesis in sculpture and was a sculptor,'' Ms. Mergel said. But when she became a curatorial fellow at the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., she said she ''became hooked'' on the idea of becoming a full-time curator. 
 Still, starting out as a sculptor has its advantages. ''When I do studio visits, I can really appreciate the work,'' she said, ''because I've had that experience.'' 
 Alison Gass, 34
 Before decamping to San Francisco, where she is the assistant curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Ms. Gass worked in New York at the Jewish Museum, where she was a curatorial assistant. She was also a research fellow for the Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. ''You make a choice when you leave New York that you are not going to be at the center of the action,'' she said. ''But being at S.F. MoMA you get the chance to present shows that might not have come here.'' She is a curator for the institution's New Work Series, small shows that showcase emerging or midcareer artists. She is working on a show devoted to the Argentine-born artist Mika Rottenberg, which opens this summer. 
 ''It's a difficult profession, because there are so few jobs,'' said Ms. Gass, who holds a bachelor's in art history from Columbia and a master's in the subject from New York University. ''Because museums are becoming less stuffy, you can focus on youth and hipness. I'm the same age as some of the artists I'm working with. Mika and I were born the same year, so we have the same cultural touchstones.'' 
 Diane Waggoner, 39
 As an assistant curator in the photography department at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Ms. Waggoner has been watching the photography department grow in importance and in its permanent collection. ''We've been amazed at the audience and the interest it has gathered,'' she said. 
 A Ph.D. in the history of art from Yale University, where she specialized in 19th-century photography, she said she chose the field because ''it has connections to real life -- it's so visceral.'' 
 A show she is in the process of organizing, ''The Pre-Raphaelite Lens: Photography and Painting, 1848-1875,'' opens in October and then travels to the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. One of the first surveys of British art photography from the 1850s and 1860s, the show will chronicle photography's relationship with Pre-Raphaelite art and its role of changing concepts of vision. ''It's about the effect of photography on painters at a time it was gaining a foothold in popular culture,'' she said.
 Scott Rothkopf, 33
 A rising star before he was named a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in November, Mr. Rothkopf was well known in art circles as the senior editor of Artforum. He also wrote catalog essays for artists as diverse as Eva Hesse, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein and Takashi Murakami and worked as a guest curator at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, where he organized shows like one devoted to Mel Bochner's photographs. Mr. Rothkopf received his undergraduate and master's degree in the history of art and architecture from Harvard University; he is also completing his Ph.D. there on Jeff Koons and art of the 1980s. 
 ''I'm working on a midcareer survey of Glenn Ligon that is scheduled to open in March 2011,'' Mr. Rothkopf said of the African-American painter. ''He's someone who's never had a big museum show in New York.'' 
 One of the reasons he came to the Whitney was for the new space it is planning to open at the entrance to the High Line in Manhattan's meatpacking district. ''Since the Whitney hasn't had dedicated collection galleries, this is the opportunity to invent a new narrative for telling the story of American art.'' 
 David van der Leer, 30
 David van der Leer joined the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum a year and a half ago to help with ''Frank Lloyd Wright: Architecture and Life,'' last year's exhibition to celebrate the Guggenheim's 50th anniversary. It was his first museum job; he came to the museum after having been the publications and exhibitions manager at Steven Holl Architects in Manhattan. 
 Growing up in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, he studied art and cultural sciences and received his master's degree in urban and architectural theory from Erasmus University there. ''Museums are a great way to think about everyday life in a different way,'' Mr. van der Leer said. 
 Clara Drummond, 32
 Although she has multiple degrees, including a master's in library science and a Ph.D. from Boston University's Editorial Institute, and has taught classes in scholarly subjects like letter writing, Ms. Drummond said she was attracted to museums because ''you can talk to audiences of all kinds.'' 
 In an effort to dispel the Morgan Library and Museum's reputation of ''perhaps being a bit sleepy,'' she is trying to invent exhibitions that will entice a younger audience. One idea would be to do a show about the history of animals and the human imagination, using the Morgan's vast and exceptional collections. ''We could take examples from medieval manuscripts and from children's books like Beatrix Potter or drawings by Blake,'' she said. ''Now that's a show I would want to go to.'' 
 Samantha Rippner, 39
 When ''Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of Art'' opens on April 27, two large galleries in the show will be dedicated to the Spanish master's prints. ''We have close to 400 of them,'' said Ms. Rippner, who has been an associate curator at the Met since 2006, responsible for its collection of modern and contemporary American and European prints. The show itself will highlight perhaps half of the Picasso prints, and deciding which ones is what Ms. Rippner is doing right now. 
 ''I've worked in this department for 12 years, while I was still in graduate school,'' she said. In 2003 she earned her master's from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. ''I was drawn to art at a young age because I loved the ability of a great work of art to tell a story.''

HEADLINE: The Markets Reach Highs Not Seen Since 2008

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street indexes reached their highest levels on Wednesday since the start of the financial crisis in 2008, pushed ahead by signs that inflation remained subdued and that interest rates would remain low.
 Investors were reassured by pledges from the central banks of the United States and Japan that they would keep in place policies aimed at speeding the global economic recovery. 
 The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that its benchmark federal funds rate would remain near zero for the immediate future. And in an attempt to add liquidity to the world's second-largest economy, the Bank of Japan on Wednesday doubled the size of a loan program for banks. 
 That helped send the major stock indexes to their highest levels in 17 months. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.45 percent, or 47.69 points, to 10,733.67, breaking above its recent January highs and extending a winning streak to seven days.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reached another 17-month high, climbing 0.58 percent, or 6.75 points, to 1,166.21. The Nasdaq rose 0.47 percent, or 11.08 points, to 2,389.09. 
 ''There really isn't a reason to sell here,'' said William J. Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates. ''You're not seeing robust outright buying, but you are seeing some nibbling. There is a growing sense that it's time to commit a little more to the market.''
 Building on the momentum, a report showed inflation in the United States remained tame in February despite an extended period of extremely low interest rates. Policy makers have kept rates at record lows in an effort to jump-start lending, but some economists remain concerned about upward pressure on prices. 
 Trading was lighter than usual, stirring doubts about the sustainability of the momentum. But several analysts said they were reassured by the advance in the absence of conclusive economic data.
 Health care stocks posted only a slight gain as Congress moved closer to some type of action on legislation to overhaul the country's health care system.
 A rise in commodities helped build the appetite for risk. The price of oil continued to increase, climbing 1.2 percent, to $82.93 a barrel, as producers decided to keep production levels unchanged for now. Copper gained nearly 2 percent.
 Ford's stock surged more than 4.5 percent after the company's debt was upgraded by Moody's. The company became the No. 1 automaker in the United States in February, with sales rising 43 percent.
 Analysts said the market might need conclusive signs that the recovery was under way to sustain a move upward. With the S.& P. 500 now more than 70 percent above its levels a year ago, and the Dow approaching 11,000 points, some investors say they believe that the market's exuberance may not reflect the reality of a halting recovery.
 ''The equity market is three parts perception and one part reality,'' said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff, an investment firm. ''It's extremely hard to believe that zero percent interest rates can engineer positive sentiment on an ongoing basis. It's really going to come down to how the economy and how earnings end up performing.'' 
 Investors will get a better sense of whether the tide has turned in the American labor market when the government releases its monthly employment snapshot. The jobless rate remains at 9.7 percent, and the economy continues to shed jobs each month.
 Interest rates were steady on Wednesday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note increased 4/32, to 99 29/32, and the yield fell to 3.64 percent, from 3.65 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Republican Deficit Hawk Returns, Much to His Party's Dismay

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Former Senator Alan K. Simpson, the co-chairman of President Obama's bipartisan commission for reducing the mounting federal debt, figures that with the country in danger of ''going to the bow-wows,'' he has bigger things to worry about than whether ''Rush Babe'' and other conservative critics are ''babbling into the vapors'' that he is not Republican enough for the job.
 That is Simpson-speak, recognizable to anyone familiar with Mr. Simpson's way of treating serious issues with folksy phrases and sometimes stinging humor during 18 years as a senator from Wyoming. But this is no joke: The Republican Party's insistence that no real Republican would even consider raising taxes is a big reason that many people believe the president's panel will never agree by December on a bipartisan multiyear plan to narrow the growing gap between spending and revenues. 
 ''Alan Simpson's a great guy, but he's not going to bring along Republican votes on Capitol Hill,'' said Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota who was part of a younger generation of Reagan-era tax-cutters. ''He's always been a Republican that would be willing to raise taxes, but that's not where today's Republican Party is.''
 That is likely all the more true of the Republican Party in an election year, especially when it is courting the zealously antitax, small-government Tea Party voters. Still, it is a measure of the building concern about the nation's fiscal future that some Republicans outside Congress are beginning to challenge the party's antitax orthodoxy. 
 Many in the Democratic Party are as adamant in opposing reductions in Medicare and Medicaid -- the programs that will do the most to drive the deficit ever higher in coming years -- as most Republicans are in ruling out tax increases. Yet led by the White House, Democrats appear open to some future cost-cutting -- if it is balanced with tax increases to minimize the pain of the spending reduction.
 And on the Republican side some conservative economists and corporate executives are pushing for just such a balanced package, concluding that an aging population and ever-rising health care costs guarantee deficits too big to control by spending cuts alone.
 Such arguments show signs of reigniting the battles within the Republican Party over fiscal policy that all but ended in the early 1990s. Back then the new generation of tax-cutters, inspired by President Ronald Reagan but more dogmatically antitax, had driven the once-dominant Republican ''deficit hawks'' -- who disliked deficits more than they liked cutting taxes -- nearly to extinction.
 Among those hawks was Mr. Simpson.
 The son of a Wyoming governor and United States senator, Mr. Simpson was the second-ranking Senate Republican for a decade, until he was ousted in late 1994 by one of the new guard, Trent Lott of Mississippi. Mr. Lott won by a single vote; Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, now the Senate Republican leader, had pledged to support Mr. Simpson but switched to Mr. Lott, according to several people with direct knowledge of the balloting.
 Mr. Simpson retired two years later. Since then, he has taught at Harvard and the University of Wyoming, and served on other bipartisan panels including the Iraq Study Group. Mr. Obama's call brought Mr. Simpson, 78, back into the budget fray.
 The welcome he received from the no-new-taxes forces was what he expected. Mr. Simpson was denounced as a stalking horse for new taxes by conservative bloggers, Rush Limbaugh (Rush Babe to Mr. Simpson, and not affectionately) and the antitax activist Grover Norquist, a longtime nemesis. 
 ''He's old and grumpy, and he doesn't like the Reagan Republican Party,'' Mr. Norquist said in an interview. 
 As if speaking to his adversaries, Mr. Simpson said in an interview: ''Go ahead, keep babbling into the vapors. I'm not out to raise taxes but, for God's sake, if these dizzy guys can't figure out that this country...'' 
 He trailed off, and then recalled the Reagan years, when the initial deep tax cuts were followed by years of tax increases to reduce deficits smaller than the current ones.
 ''Reagan didn't put anything off the table, if he felt it was for the good of the American people to tweak the tax system,'' he said.
 As for the present, ''I don't believe we ever had a war where we didn't have a tax to finance the war,'' Mr. Simpson added. 
 Slashing spending for earmarks, foreign aid and other unpopular appropriations would amount to ''a sparrow's belch in the midst of a typhoon,'' relative to the debt projections, he said. And ''when Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security suck up the entire revenue stream, we will be going to China and others to finance two wars, and that means borrowing it.''
 Others of the old-guard Republicans are also speaking out, both to support Mr. Simpson and to attest first hand that Mr. Reagan was not the antitax absolutist that the Republican right describes.
 ''He was not a doctrinaire conservative,'' said Howard H. Baker Jr., who was Senate majority leader and then White House chief of staff in the Reagan administration. 
 ''Reagan was more pragmatic than those who now quote him,'' said former Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, who was chairman of the Senate Budget Committee in the Reagan years. Both Mr. Domenici and Mr. Simpson began their Senate careers among its most conservative Republicans; each left office labeled as a relative moderate in a party that had shifted further right on economic and social issues. ''Those who claim they're better Republicans than we are -- put their solutions in front of us and let's see if they're doable,'' Mr. Domenici said. 
 Mr. Simpson's co-chairman is Erskine B. Bowles, a business-oriented Democrat who was President Bill Clinton's chief of staff. ''I think if you asked the hard left of my party if I was their favorite guy, they'd say no,'' Mr. Bowles said. While that is true, the right has been decidedly more hostile to Mr. Simpson.
 Mr. Bowles said Mr. Simpson is in ''the sensible center,'' where Mr. Bowles sees himself. ''When he says we're doing it for our grandkids, I know it sounds corny, but it's really true,'' Mr. Bowles added.

HEADLINE: World Bank Urges China to Bolster Rates and Let Currency Rise

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The World Bank recommended higher interest rates and a stronger currency for China on Wednesday, as it raised growth forecasts for the country. China's rapid economic growth has led to expectations of rising inflation and concerns that a bubble is building in the property industry. 
 In its quarterly assessment of China, which is poised to overtake Japan this year as the world's second-largest economy after the United States, the World Bank raised its forecast to 9.5 percent growth for 2010 from the 8.7 percent it projected in November. It also estimated that growth would slow somewhat next year, to 8.7 percent.
 Separately, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also said the renminbi's exchange rate was too low. ''Some currencies in Asia are undervalued, especially the renminbi,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn told a committee of the European Parliament in Brussels.
 A huge stimulus package and ample lending by China's government-controlled banks helped its economy avoid a recession last year. China grew 8.7 percent in 2009, less than in previous years but still a huge gain, especially when compared with the drop in gross domestic product that hit most other leading economies.
 Exports, a main driver of growth, also recovered briskly from their sharp fall in early 2009, allowing China to gain global market share last year.
 But several problems have emerged: the World Bank on Wednesday singled out the looming property bubble and strained local government finances as ''macroeconomic risks'' in China.
 ''Inflation expectations can be contained by a tighter monetary stance and a stronger exchange rate,'' the organization wrote in its report. ''The case for a larger role for interest rates in monetary policy is strong. If policy makers remain concerned about interest-rate-sensitive capital flows, more exchange rate flexibility would help.''
 The call for flexibility comes as China faces increasing pressure from the United States to let the renminbi appreciate against the dollar. Many American politicians argue that the current level, at 6.8 renminbi to the dollar, gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage by making their goods cheap for overseas buyers.
 In addition, the World Bank said that with output in China again ''close to potential,'' the country needs ''a different macro stance than most other countries.''
 This echoes assessments from many other economists, many of whom expect the Chinese authorities to step up measures to contain bank lending, including nudging up interest rates again later this year.
 ''The monetary policy stance needs to be tighter than last year, and the case for exchange rate flexibility and more monetary independence from the U.S. is strengthening,'' the organization said in its update.
 ''It would also be helpful to increase the tolerance for modest inflation, to ensure room for desirable relative price changes,'' the report said. ''Over time, more exchange rate flexibility can enable China to have a monetary policy independent from U.S. cyclical conditions.''

HEADLINE: G.M. Has 'Reasonable Chance' of Profit This Year, Its Chief Finance Officer Says

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors has a ''reasonable chance'' of earning a profit this year, the carmaker's chief financial officer, Christopher P. Liddell, said Wednesday.
 Mr. Liddell, in his first public comments since joining G.M. from Microsoft, said a stock offering for the carmaker, which is 60 percent owned by the federal government, is ''possible'' this year but that executives were in no hurry to hold one.
 Mr. Liddell said G.M. would first need to earn a profit and be able to show that it could remain profitable, so that the government could get the most value from its stake. The new-vehicle market and broader economy would also need to improve. 
 ''It's an important part of rejuvenation for the company, but it's important we do it at the right time,'' Mr. Liddell told reporters in an interview at G.M.'s headquarters.
 In January, G.M.'s chief executive, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., said he thought the company would earn a profit for 2010, but a spokesman later described Mr. Whitacre's comment more as a hope than a prediction. From 2004 until its bankruptcy filing last year, G.M. lost about $88 billion.
 Mr. Liddell said G.M. had made significant progress since emerging from bankruptcy protection last summer and that its ''preconditions for success are extremely good.''
 He also argued that the company's financial organization was never as poor as described by members of President Obama's automotive task force. Steven L. Rattner, the task force's former adviser, wrote in Fortune magazine that G.M. had ''the weakest finance operation any of us had ever seen in a major company.''
 ''It's not a situation where I'm having to rebuild the whole team from scratch,'' Mr. Liddell said. ''There's some rebuilding to be done, but it's not as bad as was characterized.''
 Mr. Liddell's decision to move to Detroit from Seattle and work for a carmaker just out of bankruptcy surprised many in both the automotive and technology industries. He had already announced his plans to retire from Microsoft, where he was the chief financial officer, before agreeing last December to take the job at G.M., and was widely expected to take a job as a chief executive at an information technology company.
 Mr. Liddell, 51, said Wednesday that he first spoke with G.M.'s chief executive at that time, Fritz Henderson, in September. Mr. Henderson was ousted in December and succeeded by Mr. Whitacre, G.M.'s chairman.
 Mr. Liddell, who also holds the title of vice chairman at G.M., would not address speculation that he could become the company's chief executive at some point. He said he was attracted to G.M. by the prospect of a ''once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something that's incredibly important and incredibly interesting.''
 A New Zealand native with an engineering degree and a master's in philosophy, Mr. Liddell said he had ''always loved cars'' and drove a Ferrari to Microsoft's offices each day. He said he read ''every car magazine I can think of'' and was working his way through driving every vehicle in G.M.'s lineup.
 ''If I can be part of the team that helps the turnaround G.M., I think that's something I can be incredibly proud of in 20 years,'' Mr. Liddell said. 
 ''Compared to what else I was looking at, this was far and above the most interesting, challenging and important. What we're doing here impacts the lives of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people.''

HEADLINE: With 11 Votes From G.O.P., Senate Passes Bill on Jobs

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Sewell Chan and Janie Lorber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a rare bipartisan vote, the Senate approved and sent to President Obama on Wednesday a bill intended to spur employment by providing businesses with incentives to hire new workers -- an approach that Congressional Democrats hope to repeat.
 The legislation, approved 68 to 29, would give employers an exemption from payroll taxes through the end of 2010 on workers they hire who have been unemployed for at least 60 days. It also extends the federal highway construction program, shifts $20 billion to road and bridge building and takes other steps to bolster public improvement projects. 
 Democrats hope to follow up with legislation by extending more than $30 billion in corporate tax breaks and aid to small business. 
 At a St. Patrick's Day luncheon on Capitol Hill after the vote, Mr. Obama thanked the 11 Republicans who backed the measure and said he would like to see that trend continue on emerging economic initiatives.
 ''I hope that on a series of future steps that we take to help small businesses get financing, to help improve our infrastructure around the country, to put people back to work, that we're going to see more progress on that front,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate and a co-author of the payroll tax break, said Congressional Democrats were trying to show the public that lawmakers understand how critical it is to provide more job opportunities.
 ''The American people sent us a message in Massachusetts and elsewhere,'' said Mr. Schumer, referring to the loss of a Democratic Senate seat there in January. ''It was focus on jobs, the economy, helping the middle class stretch its paycheck. Our answer today: We heard you.'' 
 In a sign of the significance Democrats place on the bill, the House leadership held a ceremony sending the legislation to the White House, where Mr. Obama is scheduled to sign it on Thursday. 
 While lawmakers have said the law will result in significant hiring, several economists said it will have only a modest impact on unemployment. 
 The law provides an exemption from the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax for every worker who has been unemployed at least 60 days and is hired after Feb. 3 through the end of this year. Employers will get an additional $1,000 income tax credit for new employees retained for at least a year. The Senate estimated the measure will cost $13 billion over 10 years, though most of the cost will be in the first two years. 
 While employers are expected to claim the credit for as many as five million workers, Timothy J. Bartik, senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, estimated that the new law would create no more than 200,000 jobs that would not otherwise have existed.
 ''The design of the Senate bill passed today is particularly beneficial to high-turnover companies, like restaurants, which in a typical year might replace fully half of their work forces,'' said John H. Bishop, an economist in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell. ''To get the hiring subsidy, it doesn't require that a company actually grow.''
 While the measure won support from some Republicans, others in the party were skeptical that it would help create jobs, or said they were distressed at its cost. ''This isn't so much a jobs bill as it is a debt bill,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican.
 The measure is partly paid for by tightening rules on offshore tax havens, but some costs would be added to the deficit.
 The bill was the first in some time to draw a sizable bloc of Republicans in the polarized Senate, an indication that some Republicans acknowledge they cannot stand in blanket opposition to Democrats on economic matters. Some Republican support was due to the push for more road and bridge building, which creates good-paying jobs for idle construction workers.
 ''The funding in this bill sends the message to struggling states like Ohio that they can move forward with shovel-ready transportation projects -- projects that will put people back to work quickly and contribute to economic growth,'' said Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio. 
 While they have wrapped up the initial jobs measure, Democrats were uncertain how quickly they could forge ahead on the larger effort to renew corporate tax breaks while extending added unemployment benefits and subsidies for health insurance for the unemployed through the end of the year.
 At the same time, the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday began advancing a third measure that would try to spur investment in small businesses by temporarily easing any capital gains taxes on income from such enterprises.
 Democrats said they would continue to press those initiatives. ''We have more to do on jobs,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the House majority leader.

HEADLINE: Nicked at Every Turn

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
France, promising to improve the environment, is planning to introduce a carbon tax. In Finland, where the government says it wants to improve diets, taxes are back on candy and soft drinks. Similarly, Denmark has added tobacco and some fatty foods to the list of taxed products.
 Britain is taking a different tack, considering a so-called horse tax. 
 All these taxes may be presented as serving virtuous ends, but they also have something else in common: they help plug budget holes deepened by the recession, bailouts and billions in stimulus spending.
 At a time when political leaders in Europe and the United States are committed to no additional income-tax burden on the middle class, they also share the advantage of raising revenue without drawing too much attention to the tightening fiscal noose. 
 As a result, analysts say, taxpayers from California to Copenhagen should brace themselves for more ''stealth taxes'' -- indirect levies like sales taxes, or microcharges on services once provided free, like registering a pet.
 Such charges can have many benefits for tax collectors. For one thing, they are less volatile and less dependent on the economic cycle than corporate or income taxes. For another, they are less prone to avoidance and cheaper to collect. Finally, analysts say, they are generally easier to enact.
 ''Politics comes into it,'' said Stephen Matthews, a tax expert at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 Raising income taxes is more of a ''last resort,'' he said.
 Not that income taxes are entirely off the table. President Obama has vowed to restore the higher tax rates of the Clinton era on those earning more than $250,000 a year. And the British government just returned its top rate on high incomes to 50 percent after years of declines. But those increases are focused on the wealthy.
 Given the public anger over the cost of bailing out the financial system, the idea behind such measures, Mr. Matthews added, is to be seen as tough on the rich.
 But countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Belgium already set their top rates around 50 percent, and sometimes higher. For most countries, there is no room to go much further.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, for example, was elected in 2007 promising to put more disposable income in people's pockets. In the areas of income, corporate and wealth taxes, he has kept his pledge, capping increases. But with the bills from the financial crisis now landing -- and the deficit rising -- he is becoming more creative.
 The taxpayers' pressure group Contribuables Associes claims that since Mr. Sarkozy was elected, at least 20 new taxes have been introduced, including one on crustaceans and mollusks to help pay for a rebate on diesel fuel for fishermen. Copayments for some medications have gone up, as well as television license fees.
 An official from the office of Eric Woerth, the French budget minister, disputed the group's figure, saying it was much lower. The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said that the overall fiscal burden for households and companies had fallen under the government of Mr. Sarkozy.
 Other countries have leaned toward increasing or extending the value-added, or sales, tax.
 The average V.A.T. rate in the European Union climbed to 19.8 percent in 2009 from 19.5 percent in 2008. It would have been higher except for a temporary cut in Britain that expired in January.
 A survey by the accounting firm KPMG in October said that the average V.A.T. rate in Europe would hit 20 percent this year or next.
 Beyond the taxes on unhealthy foods, Denmark recently removed tax exemptions on travel agencies, property management and the supply of buildings and land.
 Finland, besides resurrecting taxes on candy and carbonated drinks, raised the V.A.T. rate.
 ''There will also be a mixed bag of other indirect taxes and smaller stealth taxes, which combine revenue generation with other goals like improving the environment,'' Niall Campbell, global head of indirect tax at KPMG, said in an interview by telephone from Dublin.
 Britain raised the duty it adds to airplane tickets last year, and it will jump again on Nov. 1. While billed as an environmental tax, the revenue goes directly into the Treasury, critics say.
 The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a British research group, estimates that revenue from air duties will almost double to $:3.3 billion ($5 billion) by 2014. 
 France has announced plans for a carbon tax, intended to encourage conservation. It would be levied on fuels as a proportion of their emissions. It is supposed to be revenue-neutral, with a range of exemptions. Critics, including the opposition Socialist Party, argue that it will fall disproportionately on the poor.
 Other taxes are focused even more narrowly.
 Last year, Northern Ireland announced that it would raise the cost of a dog license tenfold to $:50, ostensibly to better tackle the problem of strays and violent attacks.
 London released a draft bill in January that would establish an animal health body, the cost to be met partly by livestock owners. Equestrians have called it the horse tax and are angry that a leisure industry will have to pay for a measure to aid farmers, who already receive payouts from the European Union.
 Di Grissell, a former jockey and the owner of Grissell Racing, a racehorse training facility in East Sussex, England, expects her personal income and business to be squeezed.
 ''The government's being very crafty by bringing in back-door tax increases,'' she said. ''The good guys -- people who work and are trying to build businesses -- are being taxed to the hilt.''
 A similar trend is playing out in the United States. In 2008, Winter Haven, Fla., started charging ''accident response fees'' to move the financial burden of tending to accidents directly to at-fault drivers.
 This month, Nevada officials drafted an emergency regulation to raise entrance fees and season passes for state parks to help plug a gap in state funds, according to The Associated Press.
 Data from the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, shows that the total state and local government revenue as a percentage of personal incomes has been steadily rising since the start of the last decade.
 By contrast, experts said, most Western governments will not tinker with corporate tax. Those receipts naturally fall during downturns as companies earn less. Corporate tax is also seen as a zero-sum game, as raising rates could lead companies to flee to lower-tax jurisdictions.
 In recent years, the overall tax burden has been volatile. Among counties belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris, tax rates were highest around 2000, then dropped in response to the dot-com recession, before rising again.
 ''Governments have tended to use the benefits of new growth over the past decade to cut taxes rather than improve public finances,'' Mr. Matthews of the O.E.C.D. said.
 ''They thought that growth was sustainable,'' he added. ''In hindsight, it clearly wasn't.''

HEADLINE: As Deflation Fears Persist, Japan Eases Monetary Policy

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- In a bid to shore up a deflation-plagued economy, Japan's central bank eased monetary policy further Wednesday by increasing a loan program for banks.
 The move sets the country, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, on a path divergent from those of other industrialized nations.
 Central banks around the world have in recent weeks contemplated rolling back stimulus steps put in place during the global economic crisis, gradually shrinking excess liquidity in their banking systems. The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it would let a mortgage-security purchase program expire at the end of March in the United States. 
 But in Japan, where prices have remained sluggish in a lackluster recovery from the country's worst recession since World War II, the government has urged the monetary authorities to stimulate the economy further by flooding the banking sector with cash.
 Japan is also leaning on monetary policy because its public debt load, the highest among industrialized countries, makes it reluctant to spend more money on public works projects and other government stimulus programs.
 At a policy meeting on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan's board decided in a 5-to-2 vote to double a loan program for banks aimed at increasing liquidity in the Japanese economy, to 20 trillion yen ($222 billion). The fixed-rate loans are available for three months.
 The board voted unanimously to keep the bank's benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.
 ''The latest step is additional monetary easing,'' the bank's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said at a news conference. ''We are employing the available tools to contribute to improving the economy and overcoming deflation.''
 Mr. Shirakawa struck a note of caution, saying the latest step alone ''would not clear up the cloud hanging over the Japanese economy.''
 One way central banks have encouraged economic activity has been to lower interest rates, making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow money and less attractive for them to save. With interest rates already close to zero, Japan must resort to other measures.
 The country pursued a zero interest-rate policy from 2001 to 2006, when it gradually started raising rates, which reached 0.5 percent in early 2007. In late 2008, the central bank again started to cut rates as Japan's economy was hit by the effects of the global economic crisis.
 With the action on Wednesday, Japan's financial institutions will be able to borrow a combined total of 20 trillion yen for three months at a fixed rate of 0.1 percent. Still, this most recent action could be offset by the end of a separate credit facility that provides unlimited loans, backed by collateral, to commercial banks.
 Japan's efforts may have little effect because banks are struggling to encourage credit growth in a weak economy despite ample liquidity -- a situation economists call a ''liquidity trap.''
 Japan is not expected to start tightening monetary policy soon. Even as Japan's economy shows signs of recovery -- its economy has grown for three consecutive quarters -- prices continue to fall. Consumer prices slipped for an 11th month in January, and bank lending fell for three consecutive months amid sluggish demand for credit.
 A major problem facing Japan is deflation, or a general decline in prices because of a lack of demand. Falling prices make consumers even more reluctant to spend, because any purchase is likely to be cheaper in the future.
 Deflation depresses investment by corporations because falling prices make it difficult to predict returns and make debts harder to pay off.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan has called on the central bank to do more to fight deflation. This week, he said he hoped Japan's economy would beat deflation this year.
 Mr. Kan applauded the central bank Wednesday, saying its action showed it was ''stepping up efforts to fight deflation.''
 Takehiro Sato, an economist for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report: ''It is not hard to imagine that the government's strong hope that Japan can beat deflation is behind the monetary loosening. If the government and Bank of Japan can present a unified front in fighting deflation, they might be able to send a positive message to markets.''
 Other analysts were skeptical.
 The central bank has ''made it clear that it does not believe that it has the tools to bring deflation to an early end,'' Richard Jerram, Japan economist for Macquarie Securities, said in a report.
 ''As a result,'' he said, ''it seems prudent to expect another extended period of price declines.''

HEADLINE: As China Surges, It Draws High-Tech Researchers From America

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
XIAN, China -- For years, many of China's best and brightest left for the United States, where high-tech industry was more cutting-edge. But Mark R. Pinto is moving in the opposite direction. 
 Mr. Pinto is the first chief technology officer of a major American tech company to move to China. The company, Applied Materials, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent firms. It supplied equipment used to perfect the first computer chips. Today, it is the world's biggest supplier of the equipment used to make semiconductors, solar panels and flat-panel displays. 
 In addition to moving Mr. Pinto and his family to Beijing in January, Applied Materials, whose headquarters are in Santa Clara, Calif., has just built its newest and largest research labs here. Last week, it even held its annual shareholders' meeting in Xian.
 It is hardly alone. Companies -- and their engineers -- are being drawn here more and more as China develops a high-tech economy that increasingly competes directly with the United States. 
 A few American companies are even making deals with Chinese companies to license Chinese technology.
 The Chinese market is surging for electricity, cars and much more, and companies are concluding that their researchers need to be close to factories and consumers alike. Applied Materials set up its latest solar research labs here after estimating that China would be producing two-thirds of the world's solar panels by the end of this year.
 ''We're obviously not giving up on the U.S.,'' Mr. Pinto said. ''China needs more electricity. It's as simple as that.''
 China has become the world's largest auto market, and General Motors has a large and growing auto research center in Shanghai. 
 The country is also the biggest market for desktop computers and has the most Internet users. Intel has opened research labs in Beijing for semiconductors and server networks.
 Not just drawn by China's markets, Western companies are also attracted to China's huge reservoirs of cheap, highly skilled engineers -- and the subsidies offered by many Chinese cities and regions, particularly for green energy companies. 
 Now, Mr. Pinto said, researchers from the United States and Europe have to be ready to move to China if they want to do cutting-edge work on solar manufacturing because the new Applied Materials complex here is the only research center that can fit an entire solar panel assembly line. 
 ''If you really want to have an impact on this field, this is just such a tremendous laboratory,'' he said. 
 Xian -- a city about 600 miles southwest of Beijing known for the discovery nearby of 2,200-year-old terra cotta warriors -- has 47 universities and other institutions of higher learning, churning out engineers with master's degrees who can be hired for $730 a month.
 On the other side of Xian from Applied Materials sits Thermal Power Research Institute, China's world-leading laboratory on cleaner coal. The company has just licensed its latest design to Future Fuels in the United States. 
 The American company plans to pay about $100 million to import from China a 130-foot-high maze of equipment that turns coal into a gas before burning it. This method reduces toxic pollution and makes it easier to capture and sequester gases like carbon dioxide under ground. 
 Future Fuels will ship the equipment to Pennsylvania and have Chinese engineers teach American workers how to assemble and operate it.
 Small clean-energy companies are headed to China, too.
 NatCore Technology of Red Bank, N.J., recently discovered a way to make solar panels much thinner, reducing the energy and toxic materials required to manufacture them. American companies did not even come look at the technology, so NatCore reached a deal with a consortium of Chinese companies to finish developing its invention and mass-produce it in Changsha, China.
 ''These other countries -- China, Taiwan, Brazil -- were all over us,'' said Chuck Provini, the company's chief executive.
 President Obama has often spoken about creating clean-energy jobs in the United States. But China has shown the political will to do so, said Mr. Pinto, 49, who is also Applied Materials' executive vice president for solar systems and flat-panel displays. 
 Locally, the Xian city government sold a 75-year land lease to Applied Materials at a deep discount and is reimbursing the company for roughly a quarter of the lab complex's operating costs for five years, said Gang Zou, the site's general manager.
 The two labs, the first of their kind anywhere in the world, are each bigger than two American football fields. Applied Materials continues to develop the electronic guts of its complex machines at laboratories in the United States and Europe. But putting all the machines together and figuring out processes to make them work in unison will be done in Xian. The two labs, one on top of the other, will become operational once they are fully outfitted late this year. 
 Applied Materials has built a 360-employee operation here in Xian after announcing an 18-month program last year to reduce employment by 10 to 12 percent, or 1,300 to 1,500 jobs, including layoffs in the United States and Europe. Mr. Pinto said that the company was readjusting its work force as manufacturing shifted to Asia, but that the Xian facility involved a new approach to researching the design of an entire assembly line and was not replacing laboratories elsewhere.
 Mr. Pinto is a well-known figure in Silicon Valley in his own right. While still a doctoral student at Stanford in the early 1980s, he wrote the first widely used two-dimensional computer simulation of how semiconductors work. This allowed engineers to test each one on a computer before building prototypes, shortening the semiconductor development process.
 Later, he became a celebrated researcher at Bell Labs.
 With China's economy gaining strength, Mr. Pinto and his wife, then living in Santa Clara, began insisting in 2005 that their sons study Chinese once a week.
 Now 10 and 11, the boys are improving their Chinese and mastering the art of eating with chopsticks.
 Applied Materials has greater challenges, including fighting technological theft, a chronic problem in China. 
 The company has taken measures, including sealing its computers' ports here, to prevent the easy use of flash drives to record data. Employees are not allowed to take computers from the building without special permission, and an elaborate system of computer passwords and electronic door keys limits access to certain technological secrets.
 But none of that changes the sense that tectonic shifts are under way. 
 When Xei Lina, a 26-year-old Applied Materials engineer here, was asked recently whether China would play a big role in clean energy in the future, she was surprised by the question.
 ''Most of the graduate students in China are chasing this area,'' she said. ''Of course, China will lead everything.''

HEADLINE: Connecting to a Culture Using 4 Wheels

BYLINE: By KAREN JONES

 BODY:
RYAN WASHINGTON, 21, said he can perform over 100 gravity-defying tricks on his skateboard, which has given him a place of honor at the local skate park. ''There is no limit to what you can do on a piece of wood with plastic wheels, he said. ''Whenever I master a trick, I feel like I am on top of the world.''
 Mr. Washington, a member of the Lakota Sioux tribe, started skateboarding at age 14 and quickly fell in love with a sport that requires tenacity. Elaborate tricks can include dizzying midair flips and twists, and mastering them takes the discipline to get back on the board after falling. 
 ''I have a lot of determination and will. I don't like to give up,'' said Mr. Washington, whose passion for skateboarding has also landed him a job. 
 Mr. Washington is the attendant and instructor at the indoor skate park on the Big Cypress Seminole reservation in Florida. He is ''living his dream,'' said Fred Mullins, prevention specialist in the family services department of the Seminole tribe. ''We needed a mature, sensitive Native American leader to groom our kids and that's Ryan.'' Mr. Mullins said the skate park, which opened in 2008, had become ''the most consistent activity offering positive interaction, contact-oriented, positive relationship-building environment for young people we have on the reservation.'' 
 Skateboarding has been a street sport for decades with a popularity that encompasses all demographics. ''Ramp It Up: Skateboard Culture in Native America,'' an exhibition at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian at One Bowling Green in Manhattan, celebrates the sport from a Native American perspective, said the project manager, Betsy Gordon. ''Native skateboarding is a thriving, extremely creative, strongly passionate movement and only getting bigger and better,'' she said. She added that tribal leaders were investing in skate parks to provide their youth with a place for healthy physical activity.
 The exhibition, which runs through June 27, features a chronology of the sport, photographs, videos of skaters doing their tricks and personally decorated boards from Native American skaters and skateboard companies like Wounded Knee Skateboards, Native Skates and 4wheelwarpony, owned by the filmmaker Dustinn Craig, a White Mountain Apache. A film, also called ''4wheelwarpony,'' by Mr. Craig about White Mountain Apache skateboarders helped inspire ''Ramp It Up,'' said Ms. Gordon. ''I was struck by the metaphor that the skateboard has replaced the pony on reservation life.''
 Once a skater, always a skater, said Jim Murphy, who became a widely known skateboarder in the 1980s. Part Lenni Lenape, he runs Wounded Knee Skateboards and is a co-founder of Nibwaakaawin, a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering Indian youths through skateboarding. Goals include helping build skate parks on reservations, particularly those that are economically depressed. 
 ''A lot of kids on these reservations need something to do and this is it,'' said Mr. Murphy. ''Skating keeps you motivated, keeps the weight down and keeps you healthy.'' 
 Todd Harder, who created the annual All Nations Skate Jam competition in Albuquerque and who runs Native Skates, which designs skateboards with ''culturally significant native symbols,'' said that diversity and traditions of Native American cultures can resonant with young people through skating.
 ''Some kids don't want to learn the old ways, but they might explore their heritage by painting a deck with their own native designs,'' said Mr. Harder, who is part Creek. 
 Kilma S. Lattin, a member of the tribal council of the Pala Band of Mission Indians in San Diego County and a former skateboarder, helped plan the installation of an expansive skate park on the Pala reservation, which the tribal youth campaigned for.
 ''We value our children and we value fitness, so the skate park was a good fit,'' Mr. Lattin said. He said that Native American children had the same struggles as other any other, except that the percentage of children with problems ''tends to be a bit higher. What I have witnessed is that skateboarding, like other forms of fitness and art, such as Pilates, yoga, surfing or music, is a healthy expression of character.''
 Meanwhile, Mr. Washington is eager to teach a new generation of Seminole skateboarders how to create aerial magic. ''I want to pass on all my knowledge,'' he said. ''You can turn anyone into a skater if they are willing to take the time. I don't have any anger or emotion when I skate. I go in and give 100 percent and usually come out on top.''
 He added. ''As long as my legs are working, I will be on a board.''

HEADLINE: As Deflation Fears Persist, Japan Eases Monetary Policy

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- In a bid to shore up a deflation-plagued economy, Japan's central bank eased monetary policy further Wednesday by increasing a loan program for banks.
 The move sets the country, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, on a path divergent from those of other industrialized nations.
 Central banks around the world have in recent weeks contemplated rolling back stimulus steps put in place during the global economic crisis, gradually shrinking excess liquidity in their banking systems. The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it would let a mortgage-security purchase program expire at the end of March in the United States. 
 But in Japan, where prices have remained sluggish in a lackluster recovery from the country's worst recession since World War II, the government has urged the monetary authorities to stimulate the economy further by flooding the banking sector with cash.
 Japan is also leaning on monetary policy because its public debt load, the highest among industrialized countries, makes it reluctant to spend more money on public works projects and other government stimulus programs.
 At a policy meeting on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan's board decided in a 5-to-2 vote to double a loan program for banks aimed at increasing liquidity in the Japanese economy, to 20 trillion yen ($222 billion). The fixed-rate loans are available for three months.
 The board voted unanimously to keep the bank's benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent.
 ''The latest step is additional monetary easing,'' the bank's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said at a news conference. ''We are employing the available tools to contribute to improving the economy and overcoming deflation.''
 Mr. Shirakawa struck a note of caution, saying the latest step alone ''would not clear up the cloud hanging over the Japanese economy.''
 One way central banks have encouraged economic activity has been to lower interest rates, making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow money and less attractive for them to save. With interest rates already close to zero, Japan must resort to other measures.
 The country pursued a zero interest-rate policy from 2001 to 2006, when it gradually started raising rates, which reached 0.5 percent in early 2007. In late 2008, the central bank again started to cut rates as Japan's economy was hit by the effects of the global economic crisis.
 With the action on Wednesday, Japan's financial institutions will be able to borrow a combined total of 20 trillion yen for three months at a fixed rate of 0.1 percent. Still, this most recent action could be offset by the end of a separate credit facility that provides unlimited loans, backed by collateral, to commercial banks.
 Japan's efforts may have little effect because banks are struggling to encourage credit growth in a weak economy despite ample liquidity -- a situation economists call a ''liquidity trap.''
 Japan is not expected to start tightening monetary policy soon. Even as Japan's economy shows signs of recovery -- its economy has grown for three consecutive quarters -- prices continue to fall. Consumer prices slipped for an 11th month in January, and bank lending fell for three consecutive months amid sluggish demand for credit.
 A major problem facing Japan is deflation, or a general decline in prices because of a lack of demand. Falling prices make consumers even more reluctant to spend, because any purchase is likely to be cheaper in the future.
 Deflation depresses investment by corporations because falling prices make it difficult to predict returns and make debts harder to pay off.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan has called on the central bank to do more to fight deflation. This week, he said he hoped Japan's economy would beat deflation this year.
 Mr. Kan applauded the central bank Wednesday, saying its action showed it was ''stepping up efforts to fight deflation.''
 Takehiro Sato, an economist for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report: ''It is not hard to imagine that the government's strong hope that Japan can beat deflation is behind the monetary loosening. If the government and Bank of Japan can present a unified front in fighting deflation, they might be able to send a positive message to markets.''
 Other analysts were skeptical.
 The central bank has ''made it clear that it does not believe that it has the tools to bring deflation to an early end,'' Richard Jerram, Japan economist for Macquarie Securities, said in a report.
 ''As a result,'' he said, ''it seems prudent to expect another extended period of price declines.''

HEADLINE: Fed Fights to Keep Oversight of Banks That Aren't Big

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Officials at the Federal Reserve are trying to alter a Senate proposal that would focus the Fed's regulatory attention on the nation's biggest banks and strip away its powers over small and medium-size banks.
 The proposal, which was introduced on Monday by the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, would make the Fed even more centered on New York and Washington and disrupt an institutional balance in place since the central bank opened its doors in 1914, officials said. 
 ''It's not the central bank of Wall Street,'' Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said in an interview. ''It's the central bank of the United States. Let's not forget that.''
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, made the same point in testimony to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. 
 ''We are quite concerned by proposals to make the Fed a regulator only of the biggest banks,'' he told Representative Melvin L. Watt, Democrat of North Carolina. ''It makes us essentially the 'too big to fail' regulator. We don't want that responsibility. We want to have a connection to Main Street as well as to Wall Street.''
 Mr. Bernanke, who noted that small institutions were involved in crises from the bank failures of the 1930s through the savings-and-loan collapse in the 1980s, added, ''We need to have insights into what's happening in the entire banking system to understand how regulation affects banks, to understand the status of the assets and the credit problems of banks at all levels, at all sizes.''
 As part of an overhaul of financial regulation, the chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, had proposed in November that the Fed be stripped of all bank supervision powers and focus almost exclusively on monetary policy. 
 In a revised bill released on Monday, he reversed course, proposing to grant the Fed oversight of all systemically important financial institutions, not just banks. 
 While the new proposal would leave the Fed with responsibility for about 35 bank holding companies, each with $50 billion or more in assets, about 4,900 smaller bank holding companies and 850 state-chartered banks that are members of the Fed system would become the responsibility of other regulators.
 Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman who has advised the Obama administration, said the $50 billion threshold -- Mr. Dodd had originally proposed $100 billion -- seemed to be ''rather arbitrary.'' 
 He said the Fed's 12 district banks ''provide a window into both banking developments and economic tendencies in all regions of the country.''
 The regional banks would have the most to lose under Mr. Dodd's proposal, which would enhance the New York Fed's traditional status as the first among equals.
 The New York Fed is the largest and most powerful of the 12 banks, and it also conducts the open-market operations by which the Fed expands or contracts the supply of credit in the economy. 
 As the vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, the New York Fed president always has a vote on setting the short-term interest rate. Voting powers rotate among the presidents of the 11 other district banks.
 Mr. Dodd's proposal would have the president of the United States appoint the New York Fed's president. 
 J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., a retired president of the Richmond Fed, said of the Dodd proposal, ''It will tend to sway the balance of power and influence within the Fed to some degree away from the non-New York banks toward the Fed power centers in Washington and New York.''
 Anne M. Khademian, a political scientist at Virginia Tech who has written about the Fed, said the Senate proposal was partly a response to a longstanding criticism that the Fed cared more about monetary policy than bank supervision.
 ''Despite the criticism of supervision by the Fed, there is some pretty sophisticated expertise in the regional banks that would be lost,'' she said of the proposal. ''To get a broad picture of systemic risk, you need to look at the smaller banks.'' 
 Mr. Hoenig, of the Kansas City Fed, is the longest-serving of the 12 current presidents. His district covers all or part of seven states, and he said it had served as an early-warning system for pressures in various sectors of the economy, from commercial real estate to agriculture. The link between monetary policy and bank regulation ''has served us well for nearly 100 years,'' he said. 
 The president of the Boston Fed, Eric S. Rosengren, has published research asserting that information collected by bank supervisors can improve the forecasts of inflation and unemployment that Fed policy makers consider when setting interest rates. 
 Jeffrey L. Gerhart, president of the Bank of Newman Grove in Nebraska, testified on Wednesday on behalf of the Independent Community Bankers of America. ''It is not logical to strip the Federal Reserve of its authority over community banks and their holding companies when the record shows it has been a very effective regulator of community banks,'' he said.
 Several lawmakers, however, seem unmoved by those arguments, suggesting that the bank presidents have been self-serving. 
 ''They like their marble buildings and they like their stature and they like their relevance,'' Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who has been a Republican negotiator with Mr. Dodd on the regulatory overhaul, said last week. 
 And at the Wednesday hearing, Representative Spencer T. Bachus of Alabama, the top Republican on the committee, said, ''It seems that when the Fed is responsible for monetary policy and bank supervision, its performance in both suffers.''

HEADLINE: Sex Scandals To Learn By

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Let's consider the story of Representative Eric Massa, a freshman Democrat from upstate New York who made headlines recently when he resigned from office amid talk about sexual harassment of male staffers.
 Massa's defense was that the questionable conduct was boisterous horseplay by an old ex-Navy officer and five of his single male aides, who roomed together in one small Washington townhouse. ''Not only did I grope him,'' he said of one of his roommates, ''I tickled him until he couldn't breathe and four guys jumped on top of me. It was my 50th birthday, and it was: 'Kill the old guy.' ''
 Already we have extracted our first important lesson from this scandal, which is that voters are going to have to pay more attention to where their elected officials bunk while they're in the nation's capital. Remember that last year we had the Prayer House, a much larger and nicer townhouse full of conservative Christian congressmen? They were supposed to be engaged in discussions of the Bible, but, in fact, seemed to spend most of their time trying to bail each other out of adultery crises. 
 The extremely overworked House ethics committee is looking into charges that the Democratic leadership should have done something about Massa sooner. It might have been a warning signal when he told a reporter that rather than pay substantial salaries to a handful of aides like most members do, he preferred to hire lots and lots of people who made so little that several of them were forced to economize by living with their boss. 
 Massa has offered a raft of explanations for his sudden resignation, ranging from a possible cancer recurrence to a plot by the Democrats to drive him out of office because he opposed the health care reform bill. This last one instantly excited Glenn Beck, who invited Massa on his program in hopes of hearing more about the claim that a naked Rahm Emanuel poked an angry finger at him in the Congressional gym.
 The Beck interview was mesmerizing. Whatever Massa did or didn't do with his aides, it was obvious that as a legislator, he is utterly loopy. His examples of political corruption consisted of Democratic leaders begging him to support the president and donors telling him that they wouldn't give him more money if he voted against the programs they care about.
 To clean up the mess in Washington, Massa told Beck, voters should call their representatives and urge them to forget about the party or the president or even said voters' own personal convictions and just ''do what you think is right.'' 
 Now, people, here is the problem exactly. There are quite a few members of Congress who are as out to lunch as Eric Massa, although we hope the rest of them are not career ticklers. Do we really want to see them all follow their own private drummers and go careening around from one position to another like a bunch of Frisbees? 
 Here we are, looking at the upcoming health care vote and mulling the virtues of bipartisan political independence. You think George Washington; I think Eric Massa. 
 Another star of this week's political sex scandal headlines was Rielle Hunter, the John Edwards mistress. This particular saga is less interesting than it would have been if Edwards was actually an elected official rather than a man who has spent the past six years being consistently rejected by the American voters, state by state, primary by primary. 
 Plus we have already learned the most important tip the story had to teach us, which is to avoid any candidate who makes his or her marriage the centerpiece of a campaign.
 Nevertheless, Hunter was eager to tell her version of the affair. As soon as Edwards told a national TV audience that the only woman he had ever loved was his wife, she reported, he called to assure her that he didn't mean it. 
 Which, she says, she believes, since she knows he will love her ''till death do us part.''
 If Hunter was a more credulous soul, I would have taken all this as a terrible failure on the part of the national news media. Really, the whole point of writing about one straying, lying political alpha dog after another is to alert the next generation that when a powerful pol invites you to come to his hotel room for a date, and suggests you arrive disguised as the turn-down maid, he is not going to stick with you through thick and thin. 
 But Hunter is 45 and has been around the block a time or three. So I think it's safe to say that she is not deluded so much as a woman intent on rearranging reality to suit her convenience. 
 ''Before I met Johnny, I had a lot of judgment about infidelity. Now I have a deeper and greater understanding and acceptance of people's processes,'' she told an interviewer for GQ.
 This was in happier times, before Hunter professed herself to be shocked by the magazine's pictures of her lying on a bed wearing pearls and no pants, since she was sure the photographer would be interested only in face shots.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN NEAR, HEALTH OVERHAUL GAINS TWO VOTES

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR; Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Democrats are inching toward the majority they need to pass health care legislation, giving them added confidence as they work out the last details of the bill and gird for a showdown as soon as this weekend.
 Behind the scenes, Democratic leaders were still working Wednesday to secure backing for the legislation from among roughly three dozen members of the party whose votes are considered to be in play, even as they awaited a final price tag on the bill from the Congressional Budget Office.
 But they sought to portray the measure as gaining momentum from the public declarations of support from two Democrats: Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who had previously opposed it, and Dale E. Kildee of Michigan, who had been among a group seeking tighter restrictions on the financing of insurance covering abortions.
 Democratic leaders say they have not nailed down the 216 votes they need for passage, but they are pressing ahead in the belief that they can get them. The House Democratic leader, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, said the House could take a final vote on the legislation by Sunday. 
 The endorsement from Mr. Kucinich suggested that Democrats who have been pushing for more ambitious legislation might put aside their reservations and unite behind the bill as their best opportunity to secure health insurance for millions of Americans who now lack it. The backing from Mr. Kildee -- and new support from nuns who lead major Roman Catholic religious orders -- indicated that Democrats were having some success in addressing an issue that has cost the votes of some Democrats who oppose abortion rights.
 But House Republicans said they still believed they could block the bill, a top priority for President Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
 Under a two-step plan devised by House Democratic leaders, the House would approve the health care bill passed by the Senate in December, then make changes in a separate bill using a procedure known as budget reconciliation to avoid the threat of a filibuster in the Senate. Republicans like Representative David Dreier of California have accused Democrats of ducking a straight-up vote on the Senate bill, which has provisions that many House Democrats do not like.
 In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Obama dismissed Republican criticisms of the parliamentary tactics, saying he does not ''spend a lot of time worrying about what the procedural rules are.''
 ''What I can tell you is that the vote that's taken in the House will be a vote for health care reform,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And if people vote yes, whatever form that takes, that is going to be a vote for health care reform.''
 Mr. Obama likened the measure to fixing the financial system or passing the economic recovery act. ''I knew these things might not be popular, but I was absolutely positive that it was the right thing to do,'' he said.
 Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, said Republicans were engaged in a variety of activities to stir opposition to the health care bill in the home districts of Democrats considered vulnerable in the November elections.
 ''We are going to do everything we can to put the pressure on these guys because they are going to have to choose,'' said Mr. Boehner. ''Are they going to vote with Nancy Pelosi and the president, or are they going to vote with their constituents?''
 ''It's going to be a wild ride,'' Mr. Boehner predicted.
 Besides securing commitments from Mr. Kucinich and Mr. Kildee, House Democratic leaders said they were pleased at the prospect of winning support from Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and an opponent of abortion.
 John A. Schadl, a spokesman for Mr. Oberstar, said the congressman was ''a strong likely yes'' on the health care bill. Mr. Schadl said Mr. Oberstar was generally satisfied that the bill before the House would not allow the spending of federal money on abortion.
 Democrats had hoped to unveil the text of the reconciliation bill on Wednesday afternoon, setting up the possibility of a decisive vote on Saturday. But they said that the Congressional Budget Office was still analyzing the cost of some provisions.
 House Democratic leaders have promised that lawmakers would be given 72 hours to review the legislation before voting on it.
 The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, said the Senate could pass the reconciliation bill as soon as next week if the House approves it over the weekend.
 In announcing his support, Mr. Kucinich said he would keep working for a government-financed single-payer health care system. But after coming under intense pressure, which included a visit to his district on Monday by Mr. Obama, Mr. Kucinich said he did not want his objections to stand in the way of the legislation.
 ''If my vote is to be counted, let it count now for passage of the bill, hopefully in the direction of comprehensive health care reform,'' Mr. Kucinich said.
 Explaining factors he had considered in making his decision, Mr. Kucinich said, ''We have to be very careful that the potential of President Obama's presidency not be destroyed by this debate.''
 ''Something is better than nothing -- that's what I keep hearing from my constituents,'' Mr. Kucinich said.
 A last-minute hitch developed Wednesday over a couple of provisions of the Senate bill of great interest to organized labor.
 One provision singles out the construction industry for special treatment, in a way that benefits union members and contractors who use union labor. It is unclear whether this provision will survive in the final package, and on Wednesday, Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., met with Mr. Obama at the White House to discuss the issue.
 Labor leaders are also concerned about a provision of the Senate bill that would impose an excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health plans. In January, Mr. Trumka and the White House reached an agreement that would delay the tax to 2018 and reduce the number of health plans affected.
 Republican senators said they believed they could successfully challenge the inclusion of that agreement in the final health care package, on the ground that it would violate the rules for budget reconciliation. If the compromise is dropped from the bill, labor groups and some of their allies on Capitol Hill would be much less supportive of the bill.
 At the same time, Democrats said they were making progress on the divisive issue of abortion.
 Mr. Kildee voted for the House health care bill in November, after Representative Bart Stupak, also a Michigan Democrat, won passage of an amendment imposing tight restrictions on insurance coverage for abortions.
 Mr. Stupak has said he will vote against the Senate bill because he sees the restrictions on abortion as inadequate. But Mr. Kildee said he was satisfied that the provisions in the Senate bill would prevent the use of federal money for coverage of abortions.
 ''I have always respected and cherished the sanctity of human life,'' Mr. Kildee said. ''I spent six years studying to be a priest and was willing to devote my life to God.''
 ''I have listened carefully to both sides, sought counsel from my priest, advice from family, friends and constituents, and I have read the Senate abortion language more than a dozen times,'' Mr. Kildee said. ''I am convinced that the Senate language maintains the Hyde Amendment, which states that no federal money can be used for abortion.''
 Mr. Stupak reiterated his opposition to the Senate bill, as did the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.
 But in a letter to House members on Wednesday, more than 50 nuns from various religious orders said, ''The time is now for health reform, and the Senate bill is a good way forward.''

HEADLINE: Dow Keeps Streak Alive On a Mixed Day

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Signs of strength in manufacturing helped lead the Dow Jones industrial average to an eighth day of gains on Thursday, despite worries about tighter monetary policy in the United States and lingering debt woes in Europe.
 After hopping between positive and negative territory for much of the day, Wall Street indexes ended mixed. Hopes were high amid signs that inflation remained tame and the jobs market was improving. 
 The Dow fell about 40 points at midday as rumors swirled that the Federal Reserve was poised to raise the rate it charges banks on short-term loans. In addition, the debt crisis facing Greece continued to weigh on the market. The German government indicated on Thursday that financial support for Greece should be provided by the International Monetary Fund, rather than European countries. That added more uncertainty to the prospects for a rescue plan for the struggling country as debt payments loom. 
 Those worries raised questions about the sturdiness of the global recovery. ''There is a high level of sensitivity,'' said Philip J. Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. ''You've got a lot of weak hands that are prepared to go the other way if it looks like this nascent recovery is stalling out.''
 By the end of the day, however, the Dow rose 0.41 percent, or 45.50 points, to 10,779.17, a 17-month high. The index was helped by a 2.15 percent increase in shares of Boeing. Industrial stocks gained after a Fed report on manufacturing in the Philadelphia region showed gains, particularly for hiring.
 Standard & Poor's 500-stock index struggled to break into positive territory, ending the day at 1,165.83, down 0.03 percent, or 0.38 points. It was held back by losses for the energy sector, which weakened as the price of oil fell nearly 1 percent, hovering at $82 a barrel. The Nasdaq gained 0.09 percent, or 2.19 points, to close at 2,391.28.
 Stocks in the financial sector also fell as traders tried to predict the effects of a bill to overhaul the nation's financial regulatory system. Some investors remain concerned about measures to focus the Federal Reserve's authority on Wall Street's largest financial institutions and strip it of its oversight over small- and midsize banks.
 Shares of Bank of America fell 1.1 percent, JPMorgan Chase declined 0.34 percent and Citigroup dropped 0.74 percent.
 But positive signs for the economy counteracted some of the uncertainty on Wall Street. A report from the Labor Department showed that inflation was largely in check, with consumer prices unchanged in February. 
 The results fueled hopes that central bankers would continue to hold down the Fed's benchmark interest rate, known as the federal funds rate, as they try to revive the economy. 
 The market had pulled back significantly at midday amid speculation that the Fed would move to raise the so-called discount rate. But as the day went on, investors grew skeptical of that possibility.
 The central bank, which declined to comment, raised the discount rate a quarter percentage point last month and has not signaled any additional increases.
 A separate report offered hope for the labor market, which remains one of weakest points of the economy. The number of people filing first-time unemployment claims declined by 5,000 last week to 457,000.
 The economy has yet to start creating jobs on a sustained basis, and the unemployment rate remains at 9.7 percent, far above historical averages.
 Some analysts say they believe stocks are poised for more growth before stimulus efforts begin to fade and political gridlock sets in ahead of the November election. 
 ''It doesn't necessarily mean that stocks are going down, but it does mean you get more headwinds,'' said Jeffrey D. Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, an investment firm. 
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 11/32, to 99 18/32. The yield rose to 3.68 percent, from 3.64 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Bill Proposes Increased Aid To the Needy For College

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The federal government would provide $36 billion in new financing for Pell grants to needy students over the next 10 years under legislation announced Thursday by Congressional Democrats.
 The maximum annual Pell grant would rise to $5,975 by 2017, from $5,350 this year. The new Pell initiative includes $13.5 billion to cover a shortfall caused by the sharp increase in the number of Americans enrolling in college during the recession. 
 Congress would pay for the larger grants by ending subsidies to private banks that make student loans and shifting to direct federal lending. 
 But the amount going to education spending and aid for college students is far less than the Obama administration had hoped, largely because the savings from the switch to direct federal lending is now estimated to be $61 billion, rather than $87 billion.
 In addition, $9 billion of the savings would be used to offset the costs of the health care overhaul proposed by the Democrats -- an amount that lets the health care proposal meet requirements for the package to go through the budget-reconciliation process. 
 On top of that, $10 billion of the savings would go to deficit reduction.
 ''This legislation offers the most sweeping changes to the federal student loan program in a generation,'' said Representative George Miller of California, chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. ''With one move, Congress can make college more affordable, keep jobs in America, prepare young people for our global economy, and reduce our deficit by billions.''
 The banking community, which has lobbied fiercely against the student-loan legislation, rallied against the use of education savings to pay for health care. 
 ''This is entirely unnecessary -- there's nothing in the reconciliation instructions that requires such a draconian cut in student aid, whatever the cause,'' said a statement Thursday from America's Student Loan Providers. At a news conference Thursday, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said he was confident that there would be enough votes to pass the legislation, which is likely to be put to a vote Sunday. 
 Congressional leaders, and Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, hailed the package as a historic opportunity to help working- and middle-class Americans afford a college education.
 But it is also true that the student-loan proposal has been cut back sharply from the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act that the House passed in October, based on a previous Congressional Budget Office estimate of $87 billion in savings. 
 The House bill provided billions for the construction, modernization and repair of school and community-college buildings, billions more to early childhood education, and further billions to help community colleges improve their graduation rates. All those have been eliminated, although community colleges would still get some new financing under the legislation.
 Then, too, the House bill called for increasing Pell grants each year by the consumer price index plus 1 percent starting in 2013, to $6,900 by 2019. But to save money, the extra 1 percent was eliminated.
 One of the few areas not cut was $2.55 billion for historically black and minority-service colleges, which remains the same as in the House legislation. 
 The Obama administration's effort to end the subsidies and federal guarantees for student loans, known as the Federal Family Education Loan program, and redirect billions of dollars to students, has been strongly opposed by bankers, Republicans and some Democrats from areas with strong student-loan businesses. 
 They say the conversion to required direct lending is an unwarranted government takeover that will lead to the widespread loss of banking jobs, and poor service for students.

HEADLINE: Public Hospitals In Miami Tackle Deficit With Pain

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Catharine Skipp contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MIAMI -- After warning two weeks ago that it would run out of money within weeks, Miami's public hospital group has cobbled together a stabilization plan that will keep most services intact through the end of September. 
 The plan, approved Thursday by county officials, would lead Jackson Health System, the third-largest public hospital system in the nation, to cut 655 positions, delay debt payments and, if possible, exact $30 million in concessions from unions. 
 Compared with an earlier proposal that would have closed two hospitals and laid off nearly 4,500 workers, the new plan is a reprieve. But health officials said it was also just a ''first step'' in a restructuring that could reshape how South Florida's poor and sick receive care. 
 Without a tax increase, private benefactor or rearrangement of who pays for the uninsured, experts expect the Jackson system to shrink significantly. Programs will be consolidated. Jobs will be lost. Wait times will probably increase. 
 ''The solution is not without pain, if we're realistic,'' said Merrett R. Stierheim, a former county manager who is acting as an unofficial adviser to the Jackson system. ''The current way of doing business is unsustainable.''
 The system's struggle, in many ways, mirrors the situation at public hospitals in New York, Atlanta and other cities. As safety-net providers with missions to serve the poor, public hospitals have been increasingly overwhelmed with patients who cannot pay. At the same time, government support -- through taxes and reimbursement for programs like Medicaid -- has continued to decline. 
 ''It's hitting from multiple angles,'' said Larry S. Gage, president of the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems. 
 In Miami-Dade County, where the immigrant population is especially large and the recession especially deep, officials now estimate that at least one in four residents is uninsured, compared with one in six nationwide. 
 Marcos Lapciuc, treasurer of Miami-Dade's Public Health Trust, which oversees the Jackson system, said the public hospital system would provide about $600 million in charity care this year while receiving about $400 million in public money. Despite clinical excellence in several areas, including transplants, and growing profit centers like its program for international patients, the system's deficit for the year stands at $230 million. 
 Federal health overhaul could buttress the system, said Linda Quick, president of the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association. ''Requiring people that make $50,000 to $60,000 a year to buy insurance and not walk out on their bill will help a lot,'' Ms. Quick said. 
 But it may not be enough to prevent cuts at Jackson's five hospitals or its handful of nursing homes. Ms. Quick said that roughly two-thirds of the uninsured in Miami-Dade County were illegal immigrants who would be ineligible for the insurance subsidies being considered by Congress. 
 Some other components of health care overhaul, like reduced payments for high rates of readmission, could hurt public hospitals because of the patients they serve. ''When you're sending a homeless person with a bad burn out to the street,'' Ms. Quick said, ''he's likely to come back.'' 
 Locally, the Jackson system also faces a high degree of distrust. At public meetings this week, county commissioners said they were alarmed by its condition; at $97 million paid to a consulting firm over six years; at its inability to collect more money from patients, health insurers and the government. On Thursday, as a condition to giving the system an $80 million advance on future county payments, the commission voted to put the Public Health Trust on ''management watch,'' inserting the county mayor's office into its deliberations.
 Ms. Quick said the Jackson system would have trouble getting more public support until its finances were in order. Compared with private hospitals in the area, she said, the system has a reputation for inefficiency, with a larger staff per patient and higher average costs. She described this as a product of the unions that represent 10,000 of Jackson's roughly 12,000 employees, though some hospital administrators have blamed county officials as lacking the will to impose layoffs. 
 Regardless, the cuts are coming. The plan approved on Thursday will still leave the Jackson system with a $130 million deficit this year. Next year is projected to be nearly as bleak. 
 At Jackson North, in North Miami Beach, one of the two hospitals initially slated to close, nurses and technicians described tear-filled break rooms on Thursday, as workers faced the threat of losing their jobs. 
 Outside the system's main campus downtown, patients said they feared that cuts would affect treatment. Though some acknowledged that the system did seem to have a lot of people standing around doing nothing, they said they considered the public hospital a source of local pride. 
 ''Jackson doesn't turn anyone away,'' said Humphrey Williams, 50, an unemployed technology worker. ''You are welcomed here with open arms.'' 
 Two weeks ago, he said, Jackson doctors removed a large cancerous tumor from his side.
 ''This is a very, very beautiful hospital,'' Mr. Williams said. ''And a hospital like this should never be allowed to go under.''

HEADLINE: Extended Family Households Are on Rise

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The extended family is making something of a comeback, thanks to delayed marriage, immigration and recession-induced job losses and foreclosures that have forced people to double-up under one roof, an analysis of Census Bureau figures has found. 
 ''The Waltons are back,'' said Paul Taylor, executive vice president of the Pew Research Center, which conducted the analysis. 
 Multigenerational families, which accounted for 25 percent of the population in 1940 but only 12 percent by 1980, inched up to 16 percent in 2008, according to the analysis.
 The analysis also found that the proportion of people 65 and older who live alone, which had been rising steeply for nearly a century -- from 6 percent in 1900 to 29 percent in 1990 -- declined slightly, to 27 percent.
 At the same time, the share of older people living in multigenerational families, which plummeted to 17 percent in 1980 from 57 percent in 1900, rose to 20 percent. 
 While the pre-World War II extended family may have been idealized as a nurturing cocoon, the latest manifestation is too recent and a result of too many factors, positive and negative, to be romanticized.
 ''It calls to mind one of the famous lines in American poetry, from Robert Frost: 'Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in,' '' Mr. Taylor said. ''I don't know that I can offer a value judgment of whether it's good or bad. It reflects our time.''
 The decline of extended families coincided with an exodus to the suburbs, where many young adults preferred to raise their children, and the enactment of Social Security and Medicare, which made older adults more financially independent. 
 The latest overall shift coincides with a number of demographic changes, including delayed marriage, greater longevity, more grown children (the baby boomers) with whom the elderly can share a household, Medicare cuts enacted in 1997 and the growing number of immigrants, who are more likely than native-born Americans to live in extended families.
 The shift appears to have been accelerated by the recession. In 2008, at the beginning of the recession and the latest year for which figures are available, 2.6 million more Americans lived in a multigenerational household than did the year before. 
 Perhaps as a result of job losses and foreclosures that have affected young adults, in particular, a majority of multigenerational households that include a family member 65 or older are headed by that older adult. 
 The growth of extended families has also been facilitated by another phenomenon: the average single-family home is about twice as big as it was several decades ago.
 The shift to extended families was evident across the board, but it was more widespread among blacks and Asian- and Hispanic-Americans than among non-Hispanic whites.
 While the share of 65-to-84-year-olds living alone began to decline, as Americans lived longer and healthier lives, the proportion of those 85 and older living by themselves grew, to 39 percent in 2008 from 22 percent in 1970.
 Among adults 65 and over, half are married, a share that has remained fairly constant since 1900. Among the unmarried, a century ago, only 1 percent were divorced or separated and 8 in 10 were widowed; today, nearly 1 in 4 are divorced and 6 in 10 are widowed. 
 Nearly half the 49 million Americans living in extended families are in households made up of two adult generations, with the youngest adult at least 25 years old. Almost as many live in households with three or more generations.

HEADLINE: Prices of Consumer Goods Hold Steady, Indicating That Inflation Is at Bay

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The price of consumer goods held steady in February, the government reported Thursday, the latest sign that near-zero interest rates and billions of dollars in stimulus money had yet to set off inflation.
 Prices showed no movement over all last month, the Labor Department said, but when volatile food and fuel costs were excluded, costs as measured by the Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent. 
 The index also indicated that the price of cars rose last month, with used vehicles rising 0.7 percent and new vehicles climbing by 0.4 percent. Medical care costs increased 0.5 percent, and food prices rose 0.1 percent. But the increases were offset by a 0.5 percent drop in energy costs, tied to a drop in gasoline prices. 
 As the United States tries to emerge from a deep downturn, the stability in prices offered reassurance that the government's efforts to stimulate the economy had not yet spurred inflation. The Federal Reserve has set a target inflation rate near 2 percent, and since February 2009, prices have increased 1.3 percent, excluding food and fuel. 
 ''There is absolutely no rationale for any premature tightening by the Fed in this environment,'' said Brian A. Bethune, chief financial economist for IHS Global Insight. ''This report is a checkered flag for low interest rates.''
 A snapshot of wholesale costs on Wednesday offered a similar message: the Producer Price Indexdropped 0.6 percent in February and was virtually unchanged when food and fuel costs were excluded.
 Subdued prices have stirred talk about the risk of deflation, which occurs when weak demand causes prices to fall. Though helpful for consumer pocketbooks, deflation can quickly derail a recovery. But many economists say they believe that as the recovery gains steam, demand will be strong enough to overcome that threat. 
 ''Lean inventories and improving demand will eventually lead to a pickup in inflation,'' said Michelle Meyer, an economist for Barclays Capital.
 Economists expect the nation's high unemployment rate -- currently at 9.7 percent -- to help keep prices down. 
 With jobs scarce, bargaining power effectively rests in the hands of company managers. Employers can set wages without worrying that their workers will decamp for more lucrative positions. As a result, paychecks generally decline, forcing businesses to lower prices to compete for struggling customers. That cycle keeps prices -- and inflation -- tame.
 On Thursday, the labor market showed small signs of improvement, with the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims falling by 5,000 to 457,000 last week. 
 Some sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, are beginning to increase hiring. A Fed survey on manufacturing in the Philadelphia region released Thursday showed that activity continued to accelerate, despite a series of storms. Hiring improved, registering its best reading in nearly three years.
 Despite scattered growth, the economy continues to shed jobs each month. At many factories, machines sit idle, with the capacity utilization rate far below historical averages. 
 Those pressures have kept costs down for now, but policy makers continued to monitor shifts in prices as they worked to revive the economy.
 As it seeks to normalize monetary policy, the Federal Reserve has begun scaling back some of its broad interventions, like a program to buy troubled mortgage-backed securities. 
 But on Tuesday, facing an economy that was still grappling with pervasive unemployment and a sputtering housing market, the Fed pledged to keep its benchmark federal funds rate near zero for an ''extended period.''
 Economists interpret the Fed's language to mean six months or more, although if producer and consumer prices hold steady, it could be longer. Some analysts said they believed the economy might not be strong enough to return to higher rates for one to two years.

HEADLINE: Upgrading Water Projects: A View From the Industry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Repair Costs Daunting as Water Lines Crumble'' (''Toxic Waters'' series, front page, March 15): 
 Innovative approaches to navigate the complex, expensive and necessary upgrades to America's water infrastructure are essential to protecting public health and ensuring adequate access to water resources, as your article clearly illustrates.
 But relying solely on the government is no longer an easy answer. In these times of decreased tax revenues and increased federal debt, the government simply cannot shoulder this burden. The good news is it doesn't have to.
 There could be billions of dollars in private money available for infrastructure investment, and several efforts are under way in Congress to free up those dollars by removing impediments to private investment. Two such proposals would adjust the tax code to expand the use and availability of tax-exempt bonds for water projects and develop an infrastructure bank to supplement loan funds for infrastructure while increasing private capital investment.
 The American public may also consider the value of reliable infrastructure and safe water to their families, their neighbors, and the environmental and economic health of their communities. A simple understanding that, just as there is no free lunch, our nearly universal access to high-quality drinking water and 24/7 effective water management does not come free could go a long way in addressing these challenges.
 When it comes to something as essential to life as water, we must investigate all options for moving forward, even if they look very different from our current systems. Within the challenges there are opportunities, and we have many of the tools at hand to make real progress.

HEADLINE: Insurer's Large Public Offering Could Lift Japanese Markets

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG --If things go according to plan, the Japanese insurance group Dai-Ichi Mutual Life on April 1 will stage the world's largest stock market debut since Visa's listing two years ago.
 The giant initial public offering, expected to raise 1.08 trillion yen ($12 billion), should provide a welcome lift for the Japanese market. 
 Some analysts suggest that the value of initial public offerings and other share offerings in Asia this year could surpass the heights of 2007. But with investors nervous and global stock markets volatile, sentiment toward many new listings has started to turn sour.
 Many bankers and analysts say they believe that issuers of public offerings everywhere, even in relatively buoyant Asia, will have to settle for less lofty valuations. Investors this year have been buffeted by worries like Greece's difficulties in servicing its huge debt, and China's moves to restrict lending by banks. In addition, signs indicate that the economic recovery in the United States is still slow.
 As a result, investors are becoming more choosy about what they buy into and at what price.
 So the pricing of Dai-Ichi's public offering, to be determined Friday and announced next week, will be closely watched for signs of what investors are willing to spend. A price range was announced this month.
 So far this year, about $22 billion has been raised with public offerings in Asia. That is up from about $440 million during the first quarter of last year but drastically down from the $42 billion raised during the last three months of 2009, according to Dealogic, a research firm.
 ''Last year, from around May to November, the market was strong, and investors were snapping up everything,'' said Kester Ng, head of Asia equity capital and derivatives markets at J.P. Morgan Securities in Hong Kong. ''This year is more volatile.''
 One recent victim of the changed mood was Zhongsheng, a Chinese car parts dealer that had hoped to raise $1 billion but delayed its offer and now looks set to raise only about half that.
 The performance of public offerings globally has been mixed at best. Shares of the Russian aluminum company Rusal, one of the most prominent debuts in Hong Kong this year, are now trading at about 8.7 Hong Kong dollars ($1.12), well below the 10.8 Hong Kong dollars at which they were priced in January.
 Huatai Securities, which raised $2.3 billion in Shanghai last month, is hovering about 11 percent above its starting price -- a modest showing in the mainland Chinese market, where new issues were, in more buoyant times, often heavily oversubscribed and frequently more than doubled in price upon debut.
 The fact that shares no longer increase sharply when they hit the market is, to some extent, a sign that investors are behaving more soberly.
 Outside of Asia, many new listings have been pared. This week, the shipbuilder OSX Brasil sharply lowered the number of shares it would sell and their price.
 ''Investors will watch pricing very closely, and are being very selective,'' said Ashok Pandit, co-head of Equity Capital Markets for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank. ''Expectations on the side of the issuer have to match those on the buy side, and the market is going through a process of finding that match.''
 Still, some of the issues, like Dai-Ichi, will generate large fees for the banks that advise on the deals. In South Korea, Samsung Life Insurance is expected to raise about $4 billion in May. And if the Chinese authorities allow foreign companies to list their shares in Shanghai, there could be big secondary listings from banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered.
 There will be many smaller deals as well.
 ''There will be plenty of midsize deals by companies whose name may not be recognized by non-China followers raising $1 billion or $2 billion,'' said Simon Aird, co-head of equity capital markets syndicate for Credit Suisse in Asia.
 In mainland China, investors are largely restricted from investing overseas. This means that the local property and stock markets are the only places for them to put their savings, ensuring that share issues always find plenty of takers.
 Mr. Pandit said funds in Asia had more cash than ever to invest. The region was spared the worst of the global economic crisis, and, with the main exception of Japan, is recovering rapidly. Its growing population, while becoming more consumerist, still has a high savings rate, meaning steadily rising flows of money into insurance and pension funds.
 ''It's a bit early to say, but I'm fairly optimistic that 2010 will be as strong as last year,'' he said. ''I think the historical data show that Asia can absorb more issuance than in 2009.''

HEADLINE: Asian Art on View, Tea on the Table

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
With the demise last year of the decade-old International Asian Art Fair, New York dealers have formed competing consortiums to promote walking tours of their galleries during the traditional spring Asia Week. Through next weekend, anyone interested in Asian art can ring the doorbells of galleries, mostly in town houses on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and normally open only by appointment, and climb creaky stairs to learn about luxuries produced during the last five millenniums.
 Pick a culture that thrived somewhere between Sri Lanka and Manchuria, and some dealer this week no doubt has artifacts for sale, starting at a few thousand dollars. (Participating galleries are listed at asiaweeknewyork.org, asianartdealersny.com and jada-ny.org.) Although the defunct Asian fair had the advantage of one-stop shopping, the gallery events give dealers room to go in depth, bringing out dozens of similar objects and reference books. They can also serve visitors tea in traditional handleless cups.
 ''I prefer to meet people in the gallery and get to know what they're looking for,'' said Koichi Yanagi, a dealer at 17 East 71st Street, who is showing 17th-century Japanese screens painted with gold clouds, roses and bamboo groves. 
 Among the week's most tightly focused exhibitions are MD Flacks's 18th-century Chinese boxes, stands and trays carved from zitan (a black hardwood, pronounced zih-TAHN); Mika Gallery's rough Japanese clay vessels and figurines that date back to 3500 B.C.; and Sebastian Izzard's celadon lobed bowls and ridged vessels from 12th-century Korea.
 Mr. Izzard is also showing gilded lacquer boxes this weekend at a Japanese antiques show at the Ukrainian Institute, at 2 East 79th Street, where a tiger painting will be at Leighton R. Longhi's booth. Mr. Izzard often obtains his wares from Japanese collections being broken up. 
 ''There's an economic crisis in Japan, so you can find great things now,'' he said. ''You get a lot of bang for your buck.'' (His celadon prices range from $20,000 for a cup stand to $500,000 for a melon-shaped ewer.)
 The dealers' fare on view will face direct competition at next week's auctions. On Wednesday Christie's will offer Korean celadon vessels with bamboo and chrysanthemum patterns. (Estimates range from $15,000 to $35,000.) Zitan is for sale at Sotheby's, Christie's, Doyle New York and I. M. Chait Gallery/Auctioneers; estimates range from $600 for a shallow bowl carved with plum flowers (Doyle) to $300,000 for a throne teeming with dragons (Christie's).
 What the auction houses can't rival, however, are the dealers' offers to linger over reference books and free cups of tea.
 TRACKING TREASURES
 Lisa Tracy, a journalist who grew up in Lexington, Va., lives there in her grandparents' house and was born in Stonewall Jackson's former house, which was a hospital at the time. Her grandfather moved to Lexington, the burial place of Jackson and Robert E. Lee, in 1891. But many of her ancestors were Union soldiers and sympathizers.
 ''I'll always be an outsider, a 'come-here,' '' she said. ''I'll never be a 'from-here.' ''
 Her childhood sense of rootlessness helped inspire a memoir about her inherited antiques, ''Objects of Our Affection: Uncovering My Family's Past, One Chair, Pistol, and Pickle Fork at a Time'' (Bantam Books).
 Ms. Tracy's mother, Betty, who died in 1993, left behind a houseful of pieces with possibly important provenances. Ms. Tracy devotes much of her book to detective work. She futilely tries to verify reports that a square-backed armchair once belonged to George Washington and that the original owner of two engraved pistols was Aaron Burr. 
 But she does turn up a great-grandfather named Burr Tracy, who was involved in a real-estate scandal. Many of her forebears, she writes, were ''almost famous,'' including two congressmen and a naval surgeon.
 In 2003 she auctioned off the antiques that did not fit into any family member's house. She still regrets aspects of the sale; prices were mostly a few hundred dollars. During the auction, she had hoped to tell buyers about the back stories: how her grandparents entertained on the Canton rose-medallion plates and collected wooden chests while posted with the American military in China and the Philippines, and how the protruding hardware on one trunk always snagged the clothing of anyone walking past.
 But as Ms. Tracy approached successful bidders in the parking lot after the sale, they brushed her off politely. ''I was so dashed by that,'' she said during a recent interview at a Manhattan coffee shop. ''But I realized people wanted to start investing their own stories in the pieces, about how they got it at this auction.''
 Her book is part of a minitrend of literary memoirs based on longtime possessions. Last year the antiques restorer Maryalice Huggins's ''Aesop's Mirror: A Love Story'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux) described her inconclusive research into the origins of a gilded mirror dripping with high-relief fruit. In August Farrar, Straus will publish the British ceramist Edmund de Waal's ''Hare With Amber Eyes: A Family's Century of Art and Loss,'' about his inherited collection of some 360 Japanese ivory carvings that were smuggled to safety during the Holocaust.
 FLYING BOAT FOR SALE
 A wooden seaplane will soon loom over the bamboo trees and mozzarella bar in the atrium of 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street. Bonhams New York, the auction house that occupies the atrium basement, is displaying the aircraft for the first half of April and will auction it on April 13 with an estimate of $300,000 to $500,000.
 The plane, a Curtiss flying boat, was manufactured in 1917 at a Philadelphia naval plant and meant for training pilots. Sold off as government surplus after World War I, it was mainly used for ferrying tourists to an Ohio amusement park. The auction consignor, the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland, acquired the plane in 1963 and has kept it in storage for a decade. 
 The society has a wooden 1910 Curtiss on display. Selling the 1917 version ''was a tough decision,'' said Edward Pershey, the society's vice president for museum special projects and exhibits. But the planes' varnished hulls and fabric-covered white wings are easily damaged and costly to maintain.
 The Cleveland Plain Dealer has reported that the society has quietly sold off millions of dollars in artifacts to pay off credit lines. Shari Kochman, the society's vice president for institutional advancement, said in a phone interview that deaccessioned pieces like the flying boat were ''totally duplicates or non-mission-related or items we cannot properly care for.''
 Bonhams will dismantle the aircraft for transport and reassemble it in the atrium. Buyers will need about 50 feet of open space to accommodate the wingspan. ''Who knows, maybe someone will even hang it from their ceiling,'' said Rupert Banner, the auction house's vice president for business development.

HEADLINE: Citing Recession, U.S. Again Presses China on Revaluing Currency

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's reluctance to allow the value of its currency to rise ''is a real concern'' to both the United States and the country's other major trading partners and could be subject to negotiations in coming weeks, the American ambassador to China said on Thursday.
 At the same time, a Chinese trade official offered the first hint of flexibility on the issue, saying his organization was polling more than a thousand Chinese manufacturers on how a change in exchange rates would affect their business. 
 In a speech to students at Tsinghua University in Beijing, the ambassador, Jon Huntsman, said that economic problems in the United States had increased pressure there for a change in the value of the renminbi, which China currently ties to the value of the dollar. That has kept Chinese exports comparatively cheap and, some contend, hampered other nations' recovery from the global recession.
 ''My Chinese friends like to pitch this as just an American issue. I like to say that there are many countries that feel the same way,'' Mr. Huntsman said. But he focused on the growing political opposition from Americans who say the currency policy is hurting them.
 ''This is a real concern to people in my country. Unemployment is almost 10 percent. It's a difficult economic period,'' he said. ''I'd be misleading you if I left you with the impression that this wasn't a very, very important issue in the United States, and will continue to be.''
 Tensions between China and United States have also risen this year after the United States' decision to sell arms to Taiwan. China also reacted sharply after President Obama's recent meeting with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan religious leader.
 ''To put our relationship on a more stable and secure footing, we have to de-link our differences on bilateral issues from our cooperation on global issues,'' Mr. Huntsman said.
 The Treasury Department is under growing pressure to brand China a currency manipulator in a report to be issued next month. That could open the door to retaliatory measures that could increase the cost of Chinese imports and raise the risk of a trade war between the two nations.
 In his speech at Tsinghua, one of China's elite universities, Mr. Huntsman said he anticipated that recent disruptions in United States-China relations would be rapidly overcome. 
 In a question-and-answer session after his speech, Mr. Huntsman said citizens of both nations should listen to both sides of the dispute, then ''allow negotiators to find a pathway forward.'' China's foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, echoed that at a briefing on Thursday, saying that the American demands were not fair, but that the dispute ''requires that both sides be calm and rational.''
 Separately, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade disclosed Thursday that it was surveying experts in 12 export-related industries to determine how badly they would be affected by a rise in the renminbi's value.
 The quasi-government group's vice chairman, Zhang Wei, predicted that labor-intensive industries like garment and furniture makers would be hard hit by more valuable renminbi.
 ''Their profit margin is already very narrow,'' Reuters quoted Mr. Zhang as saying. ''So for these companies, the consequences would be disastrous.''
 Mr. Huntsman also urged China to ''take immediate action'' to force Iran to comply with international inspections of its nuclear program, and said he hoped the two nations could agree this year on verifiable goals to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.

HEADLINE: Gaza Rocket Attack Against Israel Kills a Thai Worker

BYLINE: By FARES AKRAM and ISABEL KERSHNER; Fares Akram reported from Gaza, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
GAZA -- A foreign worker in Israel was killed Thursday by a rocket fired from the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory of Gaza, according to the Israeli military, soon after the arrival here of the European Union's top foreign policy official.
 The European Union's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, Catherine Ashton, is the bloc's most senior official to visit Gaza since Hamas, the Islamic militant group, took power there in 2007. She told reporters in Gaza that she had come to the region to ''talk with people and politicians about the need to find a picture of peace and security.'' 
 The rocket attack underlined the challenges Middle East peacemakers face.
 The foreign agricultural worker, Manee Singueanphon, 30, from Thailand, was the first person to die from Gaza rocket fire since the end of a three-week Israeli military offensive in Gaza in January 2009. Israel said the primary purpose of its military campaign was to halt years of rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israel. 
 The rocket on Thursday struck an Israeli cooperative farm called Nativ Haasara, near the Gaza border. 
 Ansar al-Sunna, a small, fiercely anti-Western jihadist group that challenges Hamas, claimed responsibility for the attack. 
 Israeli aircraft fired several missiles at Gaza targets early on Friday, including smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border and a metal workshop in Gaza City, Hamas security officials said, according to The Associated Press.
 Gaza, a Palestinian coastal enclave, has remained largely isolated since it came under the control of Hamas, which has refused to accept the conditions set by the so-called quartet of Middle East peacemakers -- the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia. The conditions include renouncing violence, recognizing Israel's right to exist and accepting previous signed agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
 Israel and Egypt have imposed a strict economic embargo on the area, allowing in only basic supplies. 
 The European Union, like the United States and Israel, classifies Hamas as a terrorist organization, and Lady Ashton -- formally Baroness Ashton of Upholland -- was not planning to meet with Hamas representatives in Gaza. She visited a United Nations-run school and met with United Nations officials to learn about humanitarian efforts for the Palestinian population. She was also scheduled to meet with local business and civil society leaders. 
 Lady Ashton met earlier with Israeli officials, including Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, and was scheduled to meet with Palestinian Authority leaders in the West Bank before a meeting of quartet representatives that she was expected to attend on Friday in Moscow. 
 When asked about the rocket attack, she said she condemned ''all forms of violence.'' Later, in a statement, Lady Ashton said she was ''extremely shocked by the rocket attack and the tragic loss of life.''
 Lady Ashton's convoy drove without stopping through areas of northern Gaza that were devastated during the three-week war. Unlike other Western officials who have visited Gaza, she did not call for a lifting of the economic blockade that affects the population of 1.5 million, saying only that she was ''trying to support the aid that needs to find its way through to Gaza.'' 
 Filippo Grandi, the commissioner general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides assistance for Palestinian refugees, said, ''We told Baroness Ashton that we count on her to be the messenger for the suffering of Gazans under blockade.'' 
 Hamas has made some efforts to prevent rocket fire by smaller militant groups. Both Israel and Hamas declared unilateral cease-fires to end the Gaza war. 
 The Israeli military said the rocket that killed the foreign worker was the third to land in southern Israel in 24 hours, and the 30th to have landed since the beginning of the year. 
 The United States Treasury Department said Thursday that it was imposing sanctions on a Gaza bank and Al Aksa television station because they are controlled by Hamas. The Islamic National Bank of Gaza provided financial services to Hamas members and employees, including members of the organization's military wing, the Treasury Department said in a statement. It said the television station ''airs programs and music videos designed to recruit children to become Hamas armed fighters and suicide bombers upon reaching adulthood.''The sanctions call for assets held by the bank and the television station under American jurisdiction to be frozen.

HEADLINE: Many Calls for Avoiding a Repeat of Bank Bailouts

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The idea of requiring giant banks to develop contingency plans that would spell out their orderly demise in a financial crisis gained support on Thursday from major international regulators. 
 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a forum for international cooperation on financial regulation, endorsed the idea, while Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council, and Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who oversees the central bank's regulatory duties, spoke in favor of it.
 The endorsements come as the Senate debates a sweeping overhaul of financial regulation aimed, among other things, at buffering the economy from the kind of systemic threats that companies like Lehman Brothers and the American International Group posed in 2008. 
 But it is not clear whether such contingency plans, also known as living wills, will be worth more than the paper they are written on. 
 Democrats and Republicans agree that taxpayers should never again have to bail out financial institutions that have become so large and interconnected that they are deemed ''too big to fail.'' 
 But economists, lawyers and policy makers are uncertain about how to handle the problem in a way that is sufficiently credible so as to deter the kinds of risk-taking that brought the financial system to the brink of disaster. 
 ''In light of what has happened over the past two years, it is imperative that governments convince markets that they can and will put large financial firms into a resolution process rather than bail out its creditors and shareholders,'' Mr. Tarullo said on Thursday night in a speech in Armonk, N.Y. ''Yet no one can guarantee that future resolutions of systemically important firms will proceed smoothly or predictably.''
 Mr. Summers, who said that an overhaul of financial rules was a priority of the Obama administration, described ''resolution authority'' as one of six major goals the legislation should achieve. 
 ''It is wrong that taxpayers thousands of miles from Wall Street should be at risk because our financial system gives authorities no choice but to commit taxpayer money or to accept collapse and chaos,'' Mr. Summers said. ''Without the prospect of failure, it is difficult to contemplate the application of market discipline.''
 He added: ''That is why we must develop a means to manage the failure of financial institutions. That is why we must insist that institutions go through the exercise of planning for their dissolution in the event of crisis before a crisis comes. Our financial system will not be fail-safe until it is safe for failure.''
 The 44-page final report of the Cross-Border Bank Resolution Group of the Basel Committee called for ''firm-specific contingency planning'' that would help the most interconnected financial companies survive a crisis or, if necessary, be dismantled in an orderly fashion, without risking a global financial crisis. 
 Nout Wellink, the president of the Dutch central bank and the chairman of the Basel Committee, said its recommendations made ''meaningful progress toward addressing systemic risk and the 'too big to fail' problem.'' 
 But as Mr. Tarullo said on Thursday, the goals of financial stability and market discipline are sometimes in tension. 
 The issue does not easily lend itself to partisan divisions: it was under President George W. Bush, a Republican, that the federal government, fearing a financial panic after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, swooped in to rescue some giant financial companies. 
 Even so, there have been some differences.
 Democrats have been inclined to have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has a long history of arranging bank failures, play a similar role for large financial institutions, and they would like to see large banks pay into a fund that would be used to liquidate a failing company. 
 Republicans would like large financial companies to go through normal bankruptcy proceedings as much as possible, and they fear that a fund would symbolize a standing, if implicit, offer of a government bailout. 
 The two members of the Senate Banking Committee who have been working most closely on the issue, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on Thursday that they were in broad agreement on how the ''resolution authority'' should work, even if points of dispute remained. 
 Resolution should be a ''last resort'' and ''so painful that no rational management team'' would ever prefer it to bankruptcy, Mr. Warner said in a talk at the National Press Club.
 Mr. Summers, who spoke before Mr. Warner and Mr. Corker, called for higher capital and liquidity requirements for banks, as well as strengthened regulation, a fee on the largest and most leveraged firms, and restrictions on risk-taking by banks.

HEADLINE: Israel and America: A Time of Friction

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Regarding articles about the current tension between the Obama administration and the Israeli government:
 President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton need to keep in mind that the Israeli people, in free and democratic elections, provided Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the opportunity to form a government based on the Likud's platform of a united and indivisible Jerusalem.
 While the timing of the announcement regarding the construction of new housing in Jerusalem may have been unfortunate, such construction is the will of the Israeli people, which must be respected by the United States government. 
 Meir Mishkoff Jamaica Estates, Queens March 17, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Bibi's Tense Time Out,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, March 17):
 There is a world of difference between fully developed East Jerusalem neighborhoods like Ramat Shlomo in the heart of major Jewish population areas (areas where the majority Jewish population was forced out by the Jordanians in 1948) and the hilltop settlements constructed by activists who refuse to acknowledge Palestinian needs.
 A basic understanding of history and demographics leaves little doubt that the former will remain in sovereign Israel and the latter will become part of a Palestinian state.
 The building announcement was poorly timed, but Jewish homes in Ramat Shlomo are in no way immoral or obstacles for peace. So let's maintain perspective and address the substantive issues that will actually take us forward, not blur distinctions to score political points.
 Yishai Schwartz Bronx, March 17, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Both Thomas L. Friedman (''Let's Fight Over a Big Plan,'' column, March 17) and Maureen Dowd address Israel's insulting and irresponsible decision to expand West Bank settlements. The essential question is: How is Israel's security a vital United States interest?
 The reflexive response of every American administration has been to give unqualified support to Israel. Israel has clearly taken advantage of such a relationship. If a two-state solution is in the United States' interest in the region (and I believe that it is), then perhaps it is time to take a genuine position of neutrality in the dispute.
 Larry Hoffner New York, March 17, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman says that Israel faces a ''dilemma'' in trying to be both a Jewish state and a democratic one.
 Israel can maintain its Jewish and democratic character without being forced to negotiate a two-state solution against its own terms. After almost 20 years of negotiations for a two-state solution since the Oslo Accords of 1993, the talks have led not anywhere but to increased bloodshed on both sides.
 With the social, economic and political divisions between the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza as apparent as ever, it is time to reassess the viability and desirability of a two-state solution.
 It is time that the moderate Arab nations of Jordan and Egypt are offered incentives by the international community to annex territories in the West Bank and Gaza, respectively, and to finally reach a sustainable status quo in the Middle East.
 Yitzhak Bronstein Far Rockaway, Queens, March 17, 2010
 To the Editor:
 ''For Israel and America, a Disagreement, Not a Crisis,'' by Michael B. Oren (Op-Ed, March 18):
 While the Israeli government may want to minimize its culpability for the recent events involving Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and characterize the uproar as a disagreement among friends concerning building permits, the fact remains that the American people were insulted and the peace process was threatened by the timing of the announcement.
 Nothing that Mr. Oren, Israel's ambassador to the United States, has said in Israel's defense has contradicted this or given us any hope that it understands what we are truly angry about.
 Michael Scott San Francisco, March 18, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Michael B. Oren notes that every Israeli prime minister since 1967 has supported ''Israel's policy on Jerusalem.'' But he does not mention that two recent Israeli prime ministers, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, also recognized that Israel would have to give Palestinians sovereignty in some of East Jerusalem as part of any peace deal.
 As Mr. Olmert said in 2008, ''Whoever talks seriously about security in Jerusalem ... must be willing to relinquish parts of Jerusalem.''

HEADLINE: FedEx Profit Doubles, Aided By Strong Business in Asia

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The FedEx Corporation raised its fiscal-year outlook on Thursday after quarterly profit more than doubled, with strong Asian export volumes more than compensating for flat domestic demand.
 Led by exports from Asia, FedEx reported an 18 percent jump in volume from its International Priority business. But average daily domestic package volume rose just 1 percent, reflecting the weak American economy. 
 FedEx and its larger rival, United Parcel Service, tend to do their best at the beginning of a recovery, analysts said.
 FedEx raised its 2010 earnings forecast to a range of $3.60 to $3.80 a share from a previous outlook of $3.45 to $3.75. Analysts on average expected $3.64, according to Thomson Reuters.
 The company said profit for the third quarter, which ended Feb. 28, rose to $239 million, or 76 cents a share, from $97 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. That bested the analysts' average estimate of 72 cents a share.
 Revenue rose 7 percent to $8.7 billion, higher than the average Wall Street forecast of $8.4 billion.
 ''An improving global economy drove solid financial performance in the quarter,'' Fred Smith, the company's chief executive, said during a conference call with analysts. ''In fact, the recovery is broadening.''
 FedEx and U.P.S. handle such a huge chunk of American and global shipping that they are considered economic bellwethers.
 FedEx said it had reinstated employee compensation programs it had cut earlier in response to the recession, despite the dampening effect they will have on earnings in the fourth quarter and into 2011.
 The company forecast fourth-quarter earnings of $1.17 to $1.37 a share. Analysts expected $1.26.
 FedEx also raised its capital spending outlook for 2010 to $2.9 billion, from $2.6 billion, citing additional investments in Boeing aircraft. And it said it was taking aircraft out of storage in the desert for a return to service.
 FedEx shares gained $2.87, or more than 3 percent, to $92.67 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

 AMBROSE AKINMUSIRE - YARON HERMAN PROJECT (Friday) Mr. Akinmusire, a trumpeter, and Mr. Herman, a pianist, share some perspective on contemporary jazz, drawing from a range of textures. In this ensemble, which they jointly lead, that means a string quartet, along with bass and drums. At 7 p.m., Rubin Museum, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea , (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; $20; $7 for student standby. (Nate Chinen)20100318
 DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Tuesday) ''Infernal Machines'' (New Amsterdam), one of the most celebrated jazz releases of 2009, was the debut of this ultramodern big band, led by Mr. Argue, an indefatigable young composer. Girded with indie-rock textures and a generous sense of drama, it still captures only part of what the group can pull off live -- as it sets out to demonstrate here, as part of the 40th-anniversary festivities for the New England Conservatory jazz program. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25. (Chinen)20100318 
 JOHN BUNCH TRIO (Thursday) John Bunch, an articulate pianist well into his 80s, leads his longstanding swing trio with the guitarist (and fellow octogenarian) Bucky Pizzarelli and the bassist (and sometime singer) Jay Leonhart, in a free series organized by Smalls Jazz Club but held in Midtown, at a restaurant near Rockefeller Center. At 7 and 9 p.m., Brasserie Ruhlmann, 45 Rockefeller Plaza, at 50th Street , (212) 974-2020, brasserieruhlmann.com; free. (Chinen)20100318
 REGINA CARTER AND REVERSE THREAD (Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Carter, one of the most charismatic violinists in jazz, has explored timbres both rustic and urbane throughout her career. Her current preoccupation -- and the promising subject of her forthcoming album, ''Reverse Thread'' (E1), due out in May -- is folkloric music of the African diaspora. She previews that material here, in a group that includes Yacouba Sissoko on kora, Will Holshouser on accordion, Chris Lightcap on bass and Alvester Garnett on drums. (Through March 28.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway , (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)20100318

 LARRY CORYELL AND BOMBAY JAZZ (Friday) The guitarist Larry Coryell was one of the pioneering figures in jazz-rock, and he has continued to explore the idea of fusion. In this group, formed some seven years ago, he explores ragas and modal jazz with help from George Brooks on reeds, Ronu Majumdar on bansari flute and Aditya Kalyanpur on tabla. At 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village , (212) 352-3101, skirballcenter.nyu.edu; $25; $18 for students. (Chinen)20100318
 AARON DIEHL QUARTET (Monday) A smart young pianist with a fastidious grasp of jazz traditions, Aaron Diehl turns his attention here to the music of the Modern Jazz Quartet, with an able assist from Warren Wolf on vibraphone, David Wong on bass and Rodney Green on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway , (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $20, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)20100318
 MARTY EHRLICH QUARTET (Wednesday) Marty Ehrlich is a proficient clarinetist and saxophonist whose music leans toward a jangly sort of lyricism. He has a lot of history with the trombonist Ray Anderson, his fellow frontman in a quartet that also includes John Hebert on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. They appear as part of the 40th-anniversary festivities for the New England Conservatory jazz program. At 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25. (Chinen)20100318
 JOHN ESCREET/LOGAN RICHARDSON (Wednesday) Mr. Escreet is a young British pianist, now based in New York, whose music tends toward a busy brightness. Mr. Richardson, an alto saxophonist, makes music with a contemporary sheen. Both have been making waves on the New York scene in recent years; they appear back to back with working bands here. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street , (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20100318
 BILL EVANS AND ROBBEN FORD (Tuesday through Thursday) Virtuosity, the chief ingredient shared by blues-rock, bluegrass and fusion, will be in copious supply during an engagement jointly led by the saxophonist Bill Evans and the guitarist Robben Ford. (Through March 28.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)20100318
 SULLIVAN FORTNER TRIO (Thursday) Sullivan Fortner is a young pianist of growing reputation, a New Orleans native and recent Oberlin Conservatory graduate who seems on the verge of establishing a strong presence in New York. He appears here with a trio featuring Christopher Mees on bass and Kassa Overall on laptop and drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village , (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; first set, $15, and $10 for members; second set, $10 and $5. (Chinen)20100318
 VINNY GOLIA (Wednesday) A pillar of the West Coast free-improvising scene, and a force as both a multireedist and a composer, Mr. Golia appears in responsive company during an early set here, at 8 p.m.: the trumpeter Darren Johnston, the alto saxophonist Steve Adams, the bassist Ken Filiano and the drummer Harris Eisenstadt. His second set, at 10, will be in sparse tandem with Mr. Filiano, a semiregular duet partner. At 8 and 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, (718) 789-2762, thestonenyc.com; $10 per set. (Chinen)20100318
 ROY HAYNES 85TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Friday through Sunday) The redoubtable drummer Roy Haynes just turned 85, though you'd never guess it from the freshness and ferocity of his playing. He has been celebrating here in the company of his excellent Fountain of Youth band, as well as with some high-impact guests, like the pianist Chick Corea (on Friday and Saturday). At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)20100318
 HSBC JAZZ FESTIVAL (Thursday) This bank-sponsored smooth-jazz festival, making its first landing in the heart of Times Square, kicks off a three-day run with two proven brands: Spyro Gyra, the long-running lite-fusion proposition, and Jonathan Butler, the uplifting South African singer-songwriter. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street , (800) 745-3000, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $39.50 to $79.50. (Chinen)20100318
 LAGE LUND QUARTET (Friday) The guitarist Lage Lund has a fine new album, ''Unlikely Stories'' (Criss Cross), that stays true to his relaxed but extravagantly fluent style, while introducing a handful of sleek new compositions. Celebrating the album's release, Mr. Lund leads an ace quartet, with Aaron Parks on piano, Orlando Le Fleming on bass and Eric McPherson on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village , (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20; $10 for members. (Chinen)20100318
 RUSSELL MALONE QUARTET (Friday through Sunday) On his most recent album, ''Live at Jazz Standard, Volume 2'' (MaxJazz), Russell Malone reasserts his stature as a prime guitarist in the jazz mainstream. He's likely to manage a similar feat with this quartet, which includes Rick Germanson on piano, Tassili Bond on bass and Johnathan Blake on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30; $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)20100318
 ANDRE MATOS (Sunday) Mr. Matos is a bright young guitarist from Portugal whose new album, ''Quare'' (Inner Circle), advances a pointedly contemporary air.

At 8:30 and 10 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)20100318
 ALLISON MILLER'S 'BOOM TIC BOOM' (Thursday) With ''Boom Tic Boom'' (Foxhaven), her rollicking but thoughtful new album, the drummer Allison Miller puts a personal spin on the post-bop continuum, leading the same capable cohort that appears here: Myra Melford on piano, Jenny Scheinman on violin and Todd Sickafoose on bass. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)20100318

 NEC JAZZ FACULTY ALL-STARS (Wednesday) The New England Conservatory is celebrating the 40th anniversary of its jazz programs next week, with a smattering of shows around the city.

 THE PUBLIC OPTION/NOAH PREMINGER (Monday) This double bill begins with the Public Option, an updated hard-bop quintet led by the trumpeter Jason Palmer, at 7 p.m. Then, at 10, Mr. Preminger, a serious-minded young tenor saxophonist, leads a group stocked with flexible partners: the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Matt Wilson. 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village , (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; no cover for the first set; $10 after 9:30 p.m. (Chinen)20100318

 KURT ROSENWINKEL STANDARDS TRIO (Thursday) Last year the guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel released ''Reflections'' (Wommusic), the first album featuring his Standards Trio. With songs by the likes of Wayne Shorter and Thelonious Monk, it's the closest thing to a conventional guitar-trio album that Mr. Rosenwinkel has made -- and yet it has the same luminescent, nearly weightless quality of all of his work. Revisiting the album's premise here, he enlists the bassist Matt Clohesy and the drummer Ted Poor. (Through March 26.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30. (Chinen)20100318

For this rare New York stand at the Stone, Rova plays two sets: first, at 8 p.m., in standard quartet form, unveiling some new music; then, at 10, with yet another saxophonist, John Zorn, who runs the place. The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village , thestonenyc.com; $10 per set. (Chinen)20100318
 SCIENSONIC EVENING OF NEW MUSIC WITH SCOTT ROBINSON (Friday) Outer space and early swing are equal preoccupations for the multireedist Scott Robinson, who's best known as a stalwart sideman. He has two new recordings on his own label, ScienSonic Laboratories: one featuring the Sun Ra Arkestra bandleader Marshall Allen (on alto saxophone, flute and electronics) and the other featuring Justin Thayer (on bass). Both of those collaborators will appear at this release party, with Mr. Robinson and others. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $15, with a $6 minimum. (Chinen)20100318
 JOHN SCOFIELD NEW QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) John Scofield, one of modern jazz's leading guitarists for the better part of 30 years, introduces a promising lineup featuring one of his well-traveled contemporaries, the pianist Mulgrew Miller. Anchoring the group is a muscular young rhythm team, with Ben Street on bass and Kendrick Scott on drums. (Through March 27.)

 BECCA STEVENS BAND (Friday) Familiar to some as the gutsy lead singer of Travis Sullivan's Bjorkestra, Becca Stevens seeks out folksier, more interior sounds with her own band, backing herself more than capably on an array of stringed instruments. Each of her sidemen contributes background vocals; in addition, they manage accordion, banjo, piano, bass and drums. At 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village , (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; no cover, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)20100318
 RALPH TOWNER AND PAOLO FRESU (Wednesday) Mr. Towner, an acoustic guitarist of pristine touch and reflective temperament, has a typically gorgeous new album, ''Chiaroscuro'' (ECM), consisting entirely of duets with the warm-toned Italian trumpeter Paolo Fresu. The duo is performing a select number of dates in the United States, including this one, in an acoustically favorable setting. At 8 p.m. Italian Academy at Columbia University, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, between 116th and 118th Streets, Morningside Heights , (212) 854-1623, italianacademy.columbia.edu; $20. (Chinen)20100318
 DAN WEISS TRIO (Saturday) Dan Weiss is a drummer of adaptable flow and microscopic focus, as he has shown in a range of instrumental settings. His own working trio, with the pianist Jacob Sacks and the bassist Thomas Morgan, just released its first album, ''Timshel'' (Sunnyside), proof that Mr. Weiss is on equally sound footing as a bandleader. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village , (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20; $10 for members. (Chinen)20100318
 STEVE WILSON QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The saxophonist Steve Wilson combines economy and modernity in his playing and engages deeply with his supporting cast, which consists here of the pianist Orrin Evans, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Bill Stewart. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village , (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20100318

HEADLINE: Why We Reform

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
One way or another, the fate of health care reform is going to be decided in the next few days. If House Democratic leaders find 216 votes, reform will almost immediately become the law of the land. If they don't, reform may well be put off for many years -- possibly a decade or more.
 So this seems like a good time to revisit the reasons we need this reform, imperfect as it is. 
 As it happens, Reuters published an investigative report this week that powerfully illustrates the vileness of our current system. The report concerns the insurer Fortis, now part of Assurant Health, which turns out to have had a systematic policy of revoking its clients' policies when they got sick. In particular, according to the Reuters report, it targeted every single policyholder who contracted H.I.V., looking for any excuse, no matter how flimsy, for cancellation. In the case that brought all this to light, Assurant Health used an obviously misdated handwritten note by a nurse, who wrote ''2001'' instead of ''2002,'' to claim that the infection was a pre-existing condition that the client had failed to declare, and revoked his policy.
 This was illegal, and the company must have known it: the South Carolina Supreme Court, after upholding a decision granting large damages to the wronged policyholder, concluded that the company had been systematically concealing its actions when withdrawing coverage, not just in this case, but across the board. 
 But this is much more than a law enforcement issue. For one thing, it's an example those who castigate President Obama for ''demonizing'' insurance companies should consider. The truth, widely documented, is that behavior like Assurant Health's is widespread for a simple reason: it pays. A House committee estimated that Assurant made $150 million in profits between 2003 and 2007 by canceling coverage of people who thought they had insurance, a sum that dwarfs the fine the court imposed in this particular case. It's not demonizing insurers to describe what they actually do.
 Beyond that, this is a story that could happen only in America. In every other advanced nation, insurance coverage is available to everyone regardless of medical history. Our system is unique in its cruelty. 
 And one more thing: employment-based health insurance, which is already regulated in a way that mostly prevents this kind of abuse, is unraveling. Less than half of workers at small businesses were covered last year, down from 58 percent a decade ago. This means that in the absence of reform, an ever-growing number of Americans will be at the mercy of the likes of Assurant Health.
 So what's the answer? Americans overwhelmingly favor guaranteeing coverage to those with pre-existing conditions -- but you can't do that without pursuing broad-based reform. To make insurance affordable, you have to keep currently healthy people in the risk pool, which means requiring that everyone or almost everyone buy coverage. You can't do that without financial aid to lower-income Americans so that they can pay the premiums. So you end up with a tripartite policy: elimination of medical discrimination, mandated coverage, and premium subsidies.
 Or to put it another way, you end up with something like the health care plan Mitt Romney introduced in Massachusetts in 2006, and the very similar plan the House either will or won't pass in the next few days. Comprehensive reform is the only way forward.
 Can we afford this? Yes, says the Congressional Budget Office, which on Thursday concluded that the proposed legislation would reduce the deficit by $138 billion in its first decade and half of 1 percent of G.D.P., amounting to around $1.2 trillion, in its second decade.
 But shouldn't we be focused on controlling costs rather than extending coverage? Actually, the proposed reform does more to control health care costs than any previous legislation, paying for expanded coverage by reducing the rate at which Medicare costs will grow, substantially improving Medicare's long-run financing along the way. And this combination of broader coverage and cost control is no accident: It has long been clear to health-policy experts that these concerns go hand in hand. The United States is the only advanced nation without universal health care, and it also has by far the world's highest health care costs.
 Can you imagine a better reform? Sure. If Harry Truman had managed to add health care to Social Security back in 1947, we'd have a better, cheaper system than the one whose fate now hangs in the balance. But an ideal plan isn't on the table. And what is on the table, ready to go, is legislation that is fiscally responsible, takes major steps toward dealing with rising health care costs, and would make us a better, fairer, more decent nation.
 All it will take to make this happen is for a handful of on-the-fence House members to do the right thing. Here's hoping.

HEADLINE: On the Verge of Reform

 BODY:
The best chance in decades of fixing this country's broken health care system has now come down to whether the House's Democratic majority will approve the already strong Senate version of the bill -- with a promise of some changes. 
 On Thursday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a package of amendments that would, on balance, make the Senate bill better. House Democrats should do what is best for all Americans and approve it. 
 They can then challenge the Republicans -- who are refusing as a bloc to support reform -- to explain in this fall's campaign why they are so devoted to a status quo that denies affordable health care to tens of millions of uninsured Americans and means that millions more Americans could be just one layoff away from losing their coverage.
 Even without amendments, the Senate bill is well worth passing. It would cover some 31 million of the uninsured by 2019, force the insurance companies to stop refusing coverage or charging high rates based on pre-existing conditions, reduce deficits over the next two decades, and make a start at controlling the costs of both insurance and medical care. 
 The amendments would first be voted on in the House and, if the package passes, in the Senate under reconciliation rules that require only a majority. They would make a strong bill stronger. 
 According to the official scoring by the Congressional Budget Office, it would cover slightly more of the uninsured. And it would cut deficits more sharply -- by $138 billion over the first 10 years compared with $118 billion under the Senate bill, and by even greater amounts in the second decade. It would accomplish both of those with some additional, but still reasonable fees, taxes and Medicare savings. 
 Struggling to comply with the very stringent rules governing reconciliation bills, the Democrats made some reasonable trade-offs between enhancing benefits and finding additional savings and revenues. 
 Their package would increase the Senate bill's subsidies to help low- and middle-income people pay for insurance in the initial years, scaling them back in more distant years. It would do a bit more to help close a gap in Medicare coverage for prescription drugs (the so-called doughnut hole), a welcome benefit for chronically ill beneficiaries who run up big drug costs. It would also remove some of the noxious special deals inserted in the Senate bill to win the support of fence-sitting senators. 
 It is disappointing that the reconciliation package would postpone for several years the strongest cost-cutting feature in the Senate bill: an excise tax on insurers who issue high-cost policies. But the retreat is not disabling. The main cost-cutting feature -- an annual index that would subject more and more plans to the tax and encourage workers and employers to find cheaper coverage -- has actually been strengthened.
 To make up for the loss of revenue from the excise tax and help cover the enhanced benefits, the reconciliation package would extend the Medicare payroll tax for high-income Americans to include investment income, putting the burden on people who can clearly afford it. And it would squeeze even more savings out of the private Medicare Advantage plans that receive heavy and clearly unfair subsidies to participate in Medicare. 
 All told, these and other modest changes to the Senate bill look reasonable. Liberals in Congress need to recognize that this is about the most generous package of benefits that can possibly be passed in the midst of recession. And fiscal hawks need to recognize that this bill would reduce deficits more than any in recent years. 
 Like most historic legislation, the process leading up to these last votes has been agonizingly long, relentlessly frustrating, and far too easy for opponents to misrepresent and demagogue. But a willingness to compromise and good sense should prevail. The country needs comprehensive health care reform.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100318 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KIKI SMITH: SOJOURN,' through Sept. 12. Kiki Smith's installation ''Sojourn'' was inspired by an 18th-century needlework, Prudence Punderson's ''First, Second and Last Scene of Mortality.'' There are rich ideas in that work, about the female life cycle and the life of the artist; to these Ms. Smith adds religious, mystical and personal symbolism. The installation's many drawings, peopled with women at various stages of life, can be quite affecting. But Ms. Smith has a tendency to sugarcoat death with craft: flowers, papier-mache, antique glass, gold and silver leaf and glitter everywhere. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100318
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'TO LIVE FOREVER: ART AND THE AFTERLIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT,' through May 2. Drawing from its own world-class collection of Egyptian art and artifacts, the Brooklyn Museum has assembled an exhibition exploring all facets of the Egyptian funerary industry. It's not a blockbuster, but it is fascinating. It presents more than 100 objects, from massive stone sarcophagus covers and elaborately decorated wooden coffins to little statuettes and elegant ink drawings on sheets of papyrus. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100318
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN USA: CONTEMPORARY INNOVATION,' through April 4. Less an exhibition than an extra-large design seminar in your head, this dense display presents work by all 78 recipients of the annual National Design Awards, which were established in 2000. Encompassing several generations, it honors individuals and corporations and recognizes historic achievements and some of the latest things. One of these is a specially programmed iPod Touch that serves as an exhibition guide; it puts the show in the palm of your hand and is free. Don't even think about not using it. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)20100318
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CONTEMPLATING THE VOID: INTERVENTIONS IN THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM,' through April 28. In what it calls ''a self-reflexive folly,'' the museum completes the 50th-birthday festivities for Frank Lloyd Wright's building by inviting more than 200 artists, architects and designers to have their way with the landmark rotunda -- imaginatively speaking, of course. Some 193 responded, usually in digital photographs, depicting it as everything from a place to exhibit their work; to a site for trampolines, forests and aquariums; to a jumping-off point for a redesign. The architects tend to be more Oedipal, but not one really improves upon the space. The list of invitees, while global, is a trifle predictable, overloaded with sculptors and installation artists and noticeably short on painters and photographers, who also have imaginations. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)20100318
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ANISH KAPOOR,' through March 28. This exhibition by the celebrated British sculptor consists of just one work, but it's a doozy. Viewable only from three partial perspectives, ''Memory'' is an enormous, egg-shaped volume of Cor-Ten steel, wedged into a boxy side gallery like a dirigible that drifted off course and got stuck. One approach offers only a square window allowing you to behold the impenetrable, seemingly infinite darkness inside. Call it a womb with a view. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Ken Johnson)20100318
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'TWILIGHT VISIONS: SURREALISM, PHOTOGRAPHY AND PARIS,' through May 9. Considering how revolutionary Surrealist photography was back in the day, it may seem paradoxical that nostalgia would be the mood suffusing this resonant exhibition. But it makes sense. Caught in the throes of sweeping change in the cultural capital of the Western world, photographers like Andre Kerte, Ilse Bing, Man Ray and others were as preoccupied with what was being lost as with what might be gained by modernization, and the images they made are darkly meditative. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)20100318
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERING THE ART OF CHINESE PAINTING: XIE ZHILIU (1910-1997),' through July 25. This philosophically intriguing exhibition presents drawings and paintings by a 20th-century Chinese artist and professor who was trained in traditional artistic methods in his youth. That meant primarily copying and tracing drawings and paintings by past masters. Xie's elegant but unimaginative copies are interesting mainly for what they reveal about how classical artists arrived at works of seemingly effortless perfection: not by observing nature but by repeatedly imitating other artists. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100318
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERPIECES OF FRENCH ART DECO,' ongoing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20100318
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PLAYING WITH PICTURES: THE ART OF VICTORIAN PHOTOCOLLAGE,' through May 9. This seemingly modest, startlingly reverberant exhibition reveals that upper-class Englishwomen of the 1860s and '70s devised an early form of collage, the supposedly Cubist breakthrough. Adding cutout photographs of family, friends, royals and celebrities to the watercolor albums that were already an acceptable female activity, they created all kinds of witty effects -- drawing-room scenes, trompe l'oeil designs, human-animal hybrids. The effects of Darwinism and the publication of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' register in these amazing works, as does the collective, even osmotic nature of invention. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100318
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE DRAWINGS OF BRONZINO,' through April 18. Agnolo Bronzino was the hand to hire for a power portrait in mid-16th-century Florence. He could turn toddlers into potentates and make money-mad Medicis look like decent people. At his peak, in the 1550s, he was the most influential artist in Florence. So why, given his fame, he has had to wait some 500 years for a museum solo is a puzzle. But that solo has now arrived at the Met. Encompassing all but 2 of the 61 works on paper currently attributed to the artist, and justifying each attribution in its gorgeous catalog, the show is scholarly tour de force and a breathtaking demonstration of a sovereign hand at work and at play. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20100318
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100318
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' continuing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100318
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DEMONS AND DEVOTION: THE HOURS OF CATHERINE OF CLEVES,' through May 2. The need for new bindings creates the rare, maybe one-time chance to see 93 of the 157 surviving miniatures from the extraordinary illuminated book of hours commissioned around 1440 by Catherine of Cleves (1417-1479) in the southern Netherlands. Among the masterpieces of a golden age by an anonymous artist known only as the Master of Catherine of Cleves, it features exquisite, jewel-like miniatures that locate the Holy Family, apostles, and saints in the here and now, among detailed interiors and landscapes and trompe l'oeil borders. The kingdom of God gives way to that of the real. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)20100318
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROME AFTER RAPHAEL,' through May 9. This exhibition of 16th-century Italian drawings from the Morgan's collection covers a lot of ground. It moves, in fits and starts, from the High Renaissance to Mannerism and the nascent Baroque. And it's enlivened by the classic match-up of Raphael versus Michelangelo; drawings by both artists, and their followers, pit Raphael's sprezzatura, or relaxed refinement, against Michelangelo's vein-popping muscularity. Look for drawings by Parmigianino (in Raphael's camp) and the sumptuous Farnese Hours by Giulio Clovio (in Michelangelo's), in addition to splendid Late Mannerist studies by Anibale Carracci. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100318
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'BIGGER, BETTER, MORE: THE ART OF VIOLA FREY,' through May 2. Viola Frey's giant ceramic sculptures of men and women are among the underappreciated wonders of late-20th-century art. Rising 11 feet and higher, wearing business suits and ties and nondescript dresses, they have a spookily imposing physical presence and a clunky, cartoonish ugliness. With their blank or seemingly angry expressions, they may remind you of what it was like to be a child among grown-ups troubled by incomprehensible problems. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100318
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SLASH: PAPER UNDER THE KNIFE,' through April 4. The third show in the museum's Materials and Process series, ''Slash'' explores the sometimes violent, always intricate art of paper cutting. The art is impressively detailed and eager to please, though rarely challenging. Among the highlights are 12 site-specific installations that engage the architecture of the museum's year-old home at Columbus Circle in savvy ways. Jane South's ''Wall'' evokes fire escapes, ventilation systems and other elements of the urban-industrial landscape; in Mia Pearlman's ''Inrush,'' whorls of white paper descend on the gallery with gale force from a recessed window. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100318
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARINA ABRAMOVIC: THE ARTIST IS PRESENT,' through May 31. The long-building energy wave of performance art hits the Museum of Modern Art with this four-decade survey of work by one of the form's more visible and magnetic figures. And the show's combination of stressed-out bare flesh on film and live bodies, some nude, in the galleries, makes pretty radical fare for the museum. The exhibition is part true endurance-test grit, part pure diva hokum. And it comes with a mission: to demonstrate that it is possible to preserve an ephemeral medium through live re-creations of past work in a museum setting. The demonstration falls flat, but Ms. Abramovic herself is performing a new piece. It consists of her sitting absolutely still and staring straight ahead in MoMA's atrium for almost the entire time the museum is open during the show's run, an estimated 716 hours and 30 minutes, all told. Visitors are invited to participate by taking a seat across from her and meeting her gaze. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Holland Cotter)20100318
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 7: MIRAGE BY JOAN JONAS,' through May 31. It helps to think of time as cyclical, or at least non-Western and nonlinear, when encountering Joan Jonas's ''Mirage'' at the Museum of Modern Art. The latest installation of a piece conceived in 1976, it suggests that Ms. Jonas's art has a longer-than-usual life span because it's constantly being reborn. In its current form at MoMA, ''Mirage'' consists of six moving-image works arranged in a loose circle and accompanied by a series of props: metal cones, chalkboards, a mask and a wooden hoop, among other objects. Performance, drawing, dance and video combine and recombine in arcane but thrilling ways. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100318
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TIM BURTON,' through April 26. Given the tremendous visual appeal of Mr. Burton's movies, you would expect that this expansive retrospective of his nonmoving art would be equally exciting. Alas, it is a let-down. Focused mainly on hundreds of Victorian-Gothic-Expressionist cartoons dating from his teenage years to the present and including paintings, sculptures, photographs and a smattering of short films on flat screens, it is an entertaining show, but there is a sameness to all Mr. Burton's two- and three-dimensional output that makes for a monotonous viewing experience. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Ken Johnson)20100318
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WILLIAM KENTRIDGE: FIVE THEMES,' through May 17. This well-designed exhibition of prints, drawings, films and film installations from the last 30 years showcases the artist's dazzling fusion of charcoal drawing and stop-action animation to excellent effect. The 1990 animations that meditate on the ravages of apartheid remain especially powerful. As the show traces a kind of progression away from, and back to, political subject matter, through a gallery that offers a dreamlike visit to his studio, it also traces his growing role in his own work, first as image, then as actor. And with a forthrightness that is almost touching, the exhibition also confirms that in the contest between still and moving images, moving almost always wins. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Roberta Smith)20100318
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Roberta Smith)20100318
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: '185TH ANNUAL: AN INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART,' through June 8. This year the National Academy's Annual has been pared down to 65 artists from the usual 120 or so. Reduced finances are to blame, but happily this juried exhibition doesn't suffer. Quality is high over all, and congestion has been minimized. Painting dominates, as always here, but with everything from photorealism to geometric abstraction, the show still feels rich in variety. The lineup includes the Chelsea habitues Dana Schutz, Ghada Amer and the fast-rising Alison Elizabeth Taylor, whose impressive marquetry work graces a marbled alcove. National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Rosenberg)20100318
 NEW MUSEUM: 'SKIN FRUIT: SELECTIONS FROM THE DAKIS JOANNOUS COLLECTION,' through June 6. This exhibition of works from the collection of a New Museum trustee selected and installed by the art star Jeff Koons might conceivably have pulled a rabbit out of its ethically sticky headgear. Instead it teems with usual suspects, and its overcrowding benefits no one, especially the several larger, more admittedly festivalist works that form its high points. This museum has some rethinking to do, and high on the list should be coming to grips with the size and limitations of its often poorly proportioned galleries. Ultimately the air of complicity is less disturbing than the look of complacency. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20100318
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Ken Johnson)20100318
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: DANIEL BOZHKOV AND DUKE RILEY, through April 25. Two young and opportunistic artists -- Daniel Bozhkov and Duke Riley -- have found a way to make the most of the Queens Museum's transitional state. (The museum is in the process of expanding.) Egged on by trusting curators and a residency program, Launch Pad, that encourages exploration of the site and the Queens community, they have turned to the surrounding park and its former ice rink for materials and inspiration. Their adjacent solo installations are well worth seeing, if only because they are profoundly at odds with each other: Mr. Bozhkov salvages, while Mr. Riley torches the place in a ''naumachia'' (Roman naval battle). Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100318
 SCULPTURE CENTER : 'LEOPARDS IN THE TEMPLE,' through March 30. Inspired by a Kafka short story, this exhibition says a lot about the state of contemporary art. It presents an international array of artists who riff on familiar conventions of modern art. Kitty Kraus's squared-off lengths of men's suit fabric lying flat on the floor evoke Carl Andre but with a feminist twist. Don't miss the funny, magical films by the team of Joao Maria Gusmao and Pedro Paiva in the basement. 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Ken Johnson)20100318
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20100318
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'COLLECTING BIENNIALS,' through Nov. 28. Start your Whitney Biennial experience on the fifth floor, with this permanent-collection show of works by artists who were in past Annuals and Biennials. It caps off an extravaganza of brand-new art with a humbling and diverting mix of classics, oldies and one-hit wonders. Figurative paintings from the 1950s Annuals are paired with contemporaneous Abstract Expressionism, and some big names from the 1980s (Schnabel, Condo) look refreshed. Most eye-opening is the fact that some of the most influential artists (Warhol, Hammons) barely register on the Biennial scorecard. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100318
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: '2010 WHITNEY BIENNIAL,' through May 30. In the spirit of the economically bleak two years it represents, the Whitney has made efforts to under-pitch its 2010 Biennial, and the show lives up -- and down -- to its billing. There are fewer artists than in the past. Its installation is spartan. Spectacle is out. Much of what's in is quiet and hermetic to the point of looking blank. The prevailing aesthetic is the art of the tweak, minute variations on conventional forms and historical styles: abstract paintings stitched like quilts, performance pieces channeling the 1960s, and so. The show feels empty where it reflects the retrenched, art-about-art spirit of the moment. But it also has strong work, particularly in video and photography, that speaks of life beyond the art factory. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20100318
 Galleries: Uptown
 MILTON AVERY: 'INDUSTRIAL REVELATIONS,' through May 1. This knockout exhibition is the first exhaustive look at the artist's depictions of New York City's waterways, bridges and railroad yards from the late 1920s and early '30s, a period most associated with his portraits. But here he is out in the open, already summoning the deft abbreviations of form, space and light that would dominate his mature, far more pastoral landscapes. With more than three dozen works -- one-third of them oils -- this show provides an exciting new view of Avery's development and reminds us that his many-splendored achievement is still not fully visible. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street , (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com. (Smith)20100318
 OTTO DIX, through Aug. 30. The first Dix retrospective in this country provides heady glimpses of the achievement of this ''wild man'' of German art. Few things escaped his remorseless eye -- from the horrors of World War I to the hypocrisies of the Weimar Republic. He made every stop on the itinerary of German modernism (including Realism, Dada, Surrealism, Expressionism, folk, visionary), had a few Cubist moments and, of course, qualified as ''degenerate'' under the Nazis. This exhibition of more than 100 paintings, prints, watercolors and drawings (organized with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) doesn't have the scope -- or the space -- to do Dix justice, but it begins to make up for lost time. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20100318
 'PAINTINGS OF FELIX VALLOTTON,' through April 10. The Swiss artist Felix Vallotton (1865-1925) was and still is much admired for his elegantly simplified, erotic woodcut prints. This show of paintings from 1905 to 1912, all depicting attractive young women in different states of dress and dishabille, is a revelation. Inspired by Ingres, these works offer a weird, frankly lubricious classicism. It would be great to see more. Michael Werner, 4 East 77 Street , (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Johnson)20100318
 Galleries: Chelsea
 JOE BRADLEY AND CHRIS MARTIN, through March 27. This combination of two sympathetic but quite different abstract painters -- one boisterous, one restrained, both basic in approach -- was an excellent idea that should have been carried out more convincingly. Showing several blank canvases, some of them shaped in the manner of Ellsworth Kelly, Mr. Bradley in particular plays it too cool. The more genuine collaboration is the book that accompanies the exhibition. Devoid of text and filled with photographs of artworks, exhibitions, family and friends, it generously surveys the artists' common ground. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street , (212) 744-7400, miandn.com. (Smith)20100318
 GEORGE AFEDZI HUGHES: 'LAYERS,' through March 27. Born in Ghana and living in the United States since 1994, George Afedzi Hughes is a multitasking artist, working as poet, performer and painter. There's a sense of all these disciplines working together in the collage-style paintings in this substantial show, which insert single words and tweeter-style abbreviations among images of soccer players, soldiers and animals. Silvery figures float like rising souls above a battered landscape made from cut-out high school yearbook portraits. Gold is everywhere in the paintings: in the sunburst of a lion's mane, in a dollar sign, in a disembodied brain. Values, like objects, seem to be in violent motion. Skoto Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, fifth floor , (212) 352-8058, skotogallery.com. (Cotter)20100318
 CHARLES W. HUTSON: 'A SURVEY,' through March 27. The Southerner Charles W. Hutson (1940-1935) took up painting at the age of 65, and refusing instruction from his artist-daughter, developed a genre of charmingly awkward yet carefully observed landscapes -- first in watercolor, then pastels and finally oils. The pastels and oils are best. Their powdery surfaces works well with Hutson's rounded, sometimes clumsy shapes and radiant colors. But it's more than that. Hutson as much paid attention to light, reflections and space as any Impressionist. His best scenes have a sense of atmosphere and depth that invites us into enter into their beatific calm. Edward Thorp Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street , (212) 691-6565, edwardthorpgallery.com. (Roberta Smith)20100318
 JACCO OLIVIER, through April 3. Mr. Olivier makes films by painting a picture in a loose, representational manner and photographing each stage as he repaints and changes the image. The major attraction here is a mesmerizing, 20-foot-wide wall projection. Colorful, loosely painted images of planets, stars and luminous gases slowly move from left to right against distant fields rendered in Abstract Expressionist-style gestures. It is as if you were seeing the universe through the eyes of God -- or a god -- turning on a central pivot as he surveys his infinite domain. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street , (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com. (Johnson)20100318
 STERLING RUBY: '2 TRAPS,' through March 27. A formidably talented artist -- known for garish ceramics, vandalized Minimalist plinths and spray-paint abstractions -- goes big and relatively bland for his two-piece debut at a big-top gallery. ''Bus,'' a former prison bus with sinister customizing, looks like something Mad Max might drive if he could find the gas; ''Pig Pen,'' a shipping-container-size assemblage of cages made of barred security doors, might imprison Max's competitors for said gas. The qualities that make Mr. Ruby's work compelling are present here, but in uncompelling ratios. Pace Wildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street , (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com. (Smith)20100318
 BANKS VIOLETTE, through April 17. This show has something of a comeback feeling. Its centerpiece is one of the artists best efforts so far: a big, morose chandelier made of white fluorescent lights hung low that resembles a skeletal cabana or giant wind chime, despite the arctic light.

 'THE BRUCENNIAL 2010: MISEDUCATION,' through April 12. This alternative to the Whitney Biennial is the brainchild of the Bruce High Quality Foundation, a five-artist collective that is also in the Whitney show and that is intent on placing some of the art world's more conspicuous functions, like education and the organizing of exhibitions, into artists' hands. The show's fun, but how alternative is it? With its floor-to-ceiling roster of young artists and veteran guest celebrities, it feels like the average Bring-Your-Art bash crossed with a Whitney Biennial of maybe 25 years ago. 350 West Broadway, between Broome and Grand Streets , brucennial.com.

 BETTY PARSONS: 'JOURNEYS'; closes on Saturday. With their maker best known for her groundbreaking gallery of Abstract Expressionists, the paintings of Betty Parsons (1900-1982) haven't always gotten their due. This exhibition of 19 radiant stain-painted canvases from the mid-1950s to 1980 is the largest show in New York in nearly 30 years. It reintroduces an artist who took tips from the painters she showed -- especially Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko and Paul Feeley -- but made them her own, carving out her own small niche in the history of Color Field Painting.

 KYLE STAVER: 'RECENT WORKS'; closes on Saturday. Full of shadows and mystery, Ms. Staver's figurative paintings and prints suggest an admiration for Picasso and Bonnard -- and possibly David Park -- but are far from overwhelmed by it. This may be because there is also more than a hint of Wallace and Gromit in her slightly rubbery figures, and an exuberant freedom to her brushy, line-free forms. But mainly, Ms. Staver portrays women as autonomous beings, whether they are a figure skater soaring above her partner or Lady Godiva smartly reining in her horse. Her faith in the history of her medium may tag her as conservative, but she is a very good painter. Lohin Geduld Gallery, 531 West 25th Street, Chelsea , (212) 675-2656, lohingeduld.com.

HEADLINE: The Broken Society

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The United States is becoming a broken society. The public has contempt for the political class. Public debt is piling up at an astonishing and unrelenting pace. Middle-class wages have lagged. Unemployment will remain high. It will take years to fully recover from the financial crisis.
 This confluence of crises has produced a surge in vehement libertarianism. People are disgusted with Washington. The Tea Party movement rallies against big government, big business and the ruling class in general. Even beyond their ranks, there is a corrosive cynicism about public action. 
 But there is another way to respond to these problems that is more communitarian and less libertarian. This alternative has been explored most fully by the British writer Phillip Blond.
 He grew up in working-class Liverpool. ''I lived in the city when it was being eviscerated,'' he told The New Statesman. ''It was a beautiful city, one of the few in Britain to have a genuinely indigenous culture. And that whole way of life was destroyed.'' Industry died. Political power was centralized in London.
 Blond argues that over the past generation we have witnessed two revolutions, both of which liberated the individual and decimated local associations. First, there was a revolution from the left: a cultural revolution that displaced traditional manners and mores; a legal revolution that emphasized individual rights instead of responsibilities; a welfare revolution in which social workers displaced mutual aid societies and self-organized associations.
 Then there was the market revolution from the right. In the age of deregulation, giant chains like Wal-Mart decimated local shop owners. Global financial markets took over small banks, so that the local knowledge of a town banker was replaced by a manic herd of traders thousands of miles away. Unions withered.
 The two revolutions talked the language of individual freedom, but they perversely ended up creating greater centralization. They created an atomized, segmented society and then the state had to come in and attempt to repair the damage.
 The free-market revolution didn't create the pluralistic decentralized economy. It created a centralized financial monoculture, which requires a gigantic government to audit its activities. The effort to liberate individuals from repressive social constraints didn't produce a flowering of freedom; it weakened families, increased out-of-wedlock births and turned neighbors into strangers. In Britain, you get a country with rising crime, and, as a result, four million security cameras.
 In a much-discussed essay in Prospect magazine in February 2009, Blond wrote, ''Look at the society we have become: We are a bi-polar nation, a bureaucratic, centralised state that presides dysfunctionally over an increasingly fragmented, disempowered and isolated citizenry.'' In a separate essay, he added, ''The welfare state and the market state are now two defunct and mutually supporting failures.''
 The task today, he argued in a recent speech, is to revive the sector that the two revolutions have mutually decimated: ''The project of radical transformative conservatism is nothing less than the restoration and creation of human association, and the elevation of society and the people who form it to their proper central and sovereign station.''
 Economically, Blond lays out three big areas of reform: remoralize the market, relocalize the economy and recapitalize the poor. This would mean passing zoning legislation to give small shopkeepers a shot against the retail giants, reducing barriers to entry for new businesses, revitalizing local banks, encouraging employee share ownership, setting up local capital funds so community associations could invest in local enterprises, rewarding savings, cutting regulations that socialize risk and privatize profit, and reducing the subsidies that flow from big government and big business.
 To create a civil state, Blond would reduce the power of senior government officials and widen the discretion of front-line civil servants, the people actually working in neighborhoods. He would decentralize power, giving more budget authority to the smallest units of government. He would funnel more services through charities. He would increase investments in infrastructure, so that more places could be vibrant economic hubs. He would rebuild the ''village college'' so that universities would be more intertwined with the towns around them.
 Essentially, Blond would take a political culture that has been oriented around individual choice and replace it with one oriented around relationships and associations. His ideas have made a big splash in Britain over the past year. His think tank, ResPublica, is influential with the Conservative Party. His book, ''Red Tory,'' is coming out soon. He's on a small U.S. speaking tour, appearing at Georgetown's Tocqueville Forum Friday and at Villanova on Monday.
 Britain is always going to be more hospitable to communitarian politics than the more libertarian U.S. But people are social creatures here, too. American society has been atomized by the twin revolutions here, too. This country, too, needs a fresh political wind. America, too, is suffering a devastating crisis of authority. The only way to restore trust is from the local community on up.

HEADLINE: An N.C.A.A. Bid Means Name Recognition and More for Oakland

BYLINE: By JOANNE C. GERSTNER

 BODY:
ROCHESTER, Mich. -- It was a scene repeated at 64 other college campuses, but it is hard to imagine any held more joy than at Oakland University.
 The men's basketball team sat nervously on chairs in front of about 800 students, faculty and fans last Sunday, all watching the selection show broadcast on the video board in the university gym. When Milwaukee popped up as the site, No. 3 Pittsburgh as the opponent, and Oakland as the No. 14 seed in the West Region, a roar erupted.
 These are fun and crazy times on the suburban Detroit campus, a quiet, mostly commuter university trying to thrive in the economically devastated metro Detroit region. Amid the pain, the Golden Grizzlies (26-8) joyfully sealed their second N.C.A.A. tournament bid by winning the Summit Conference tournament last week, giving their university an identity it sought when it made the controversial move from Division II in 1997. 
 ''You cannot understate what this means in every way to Oakland, from athletics to academics,'' Oakland's president, Gary Russi, said. ''It would cost us millions of dollars to buy this name recognition. I saw what happened after the last time we were in March Madness. I would be in airports in California or Florida, wearing my O.U. gear, and people would say, 'Go Grizzlies!' to me.
 ''It gave Oakland a name across the country. This time, I think we're going to grow our identity even more. We're very excited about what's happening to us.''
 Long gone are the days cows and horses roamed amid a handful of academic buildings on the pastoral campus. Oakland was founded in 1957 as a public satellite honors college called Michigan State University-Oakland, on the expansive estate of auto and lumber baroness Matilda Dodge Wilson.
 Oakland embarked on a growth spurt under Russi, adding an athletic complex, new buildings and housing, and most recently, a medical school. The school has nearly doubled in size in the past decade and how has 19,000 students. 
 Officials said a big jump in that number came after Oakland made its first N.C.A.A. tournament in 2005, after it dramatically won its conference tournament (then called the Mid-Continent Conference) when a 3-pointer by Pierre Dukes beat Oral Roberts, 61-60. The Grizzlies were 12-18, but they won the play-in game over Alabama A&M to earn the right to get crushed by No. 1 North Carolina, the eventual tournament champion, 96-68, in the first round.
 The result, university officials say, was more than $100,000 in unsolicited donations and a 10 percent surge in student applications in 2005-6. The longtime coach Greg Kampe, whose teams were proven winners in Division II, had a much more seductive recruiting pitch. He returns to the N.C.A.A. field with a far more talented team this time.
 The hotly debated jump to Division I, starting with the 1997-98 season, spawned doubts that Oakland could compete in a local marketplace crowded with powerhouses Michigan State and Michigan, along with established midmajor programs like Toledo and Detroit-Mercy.
 ''I had one person, from our previous conference, tell me to my face that we shouldn't expect to come crawling back when our trip to Division I fails,'' Kampe said. ''We're not ever crawling back. This proves we belong as one of the up-and-coming midmajors. We want to be the next Gonzaga or George Mason. The next step for us is to be back in the tournament every year, and I can see that happening because we are starting to get those kids you need to reach the postseason.
 ''We need to prove we're not a fluke, and I think that's going to bear itself out. Being back in the tournament, this way with a strong team, says a lot about where we are at.''
 The senior guard Johnathon Jones, of Okemos, Mich., came to Oakland because he saw how the 2005 N.C.A.A. experience changed the program, the campus, and how the team is perceived.
 ''Nobody questions why I came here anymore; they can see why: we're winning, selling out our games, we're going somewhere,'' said Jones, who is third in the nation in assists with 6.4 per game. ''We believe. We set as one of our goals before the season to reach the Sweet Sixteen. Why not?''
 The senior forward Derick Nelson, of Lansing, Mich., also sees the momentum.
 ''I don't think people are surprised we are doing well, because we don't hide from anybody,'' Nelson said. ''We know if we want to be the best, we have to play the best. We're not afraid of anything now.''
 Oakland played a tough schedule, including road games against No. 1 seeds Syracuse and Kansas. The tournament-bound teams Wisconsin and Michigan State were also on the schedule. 
 Oakland suffered blowout losses to all of them, but saw dividends later in the season and ended up with a solid ratings percentage index, ranking 51st. The Grizzlies have won 11 games in a row, took the regular-season conference title, and played commandingly in the league tournament. 
 But it is the little things, like a random supermarket encounter, that reveal the power of an N.C.A.A. tournament bid. 
 Kampe, fresh off the Summit League victory, had mentioned in a television interview that he had not gotten much sleep. He was grocery shopping a few days later when an elderly lady, hunched over her shopping cart, stopped and made eye contact with him.
 ''You getting some sleep now?'' the unfamiliar lady asked Kampe.
 He smiled, realizing what she was referencing.
 ''Yes, I got some sleep, thanks,'' Kampe replied.
 She nodded, and slowly walked away.
 Oakland, and its basketball team, are no longer anonymous.

HEADLINE: Germany, in a Reversal, Says Greece Should Turn to I.M.F.

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
After weeks of backing a European rescue for the financially troubled Greece, Germany shifted course on Thursday, signaling that help should come from the International Monetary Fund rather than Greece's neighbors.
 Turning to the I.M.F. would represent a new and potentially humiliating twist in Greece's financial drama, which was set off by doubts about Athens's ability to borrow 53 billion euros this year to finance a yawning budget deficit and refinance waves of debt coming due.
 Worries that investors would shun Greek bonds and force a default shook markets worldwide last month but eased recently after Germany and other members of the European Union signaled they would come to Greece's aid if necessary. The Greek government, in turn, unveiled a long-awaited package of budget cuts. 
 But prospects for both European aid and domestic spending cuts seemed to fade Thursday with Berlin's about-face, as well as a warning from Greece's prime minister that the promised budget cuts might not be enacted unless the country could borrow at lower interest rates.
 ''We will make it, provided that our country can borrow on reasonable terms,'' Prime Minister George A. Papandreou said in a cabinet meeting that was broadcast in Greece. ''Based on those conditions, our country is not seeking and will not seek financial aid, either from our European partners or from the I.M.F., which would be our last resort.''
 Despite Mr. Papandreou's brave talk, it is likely that some form of aid will be needed to help Greece raise the 53 billion euros, which includes 20 billion euros that is needed in April and May alone. And for Greece, as well as the European Union, the maneuvers Thursday amount to fiscal brinksmanship. 
 Greece would prefer that any financial help come from Europe, to avoid the embarrassment of turning to the I.M.F. But with voters in Germany and elsewhere strongly opposed to a bailout for what they see as a profligate government, European leaders want to see proof the Greek government is serious about cutting spending after years of living beyond its means.
 Citing legal hurdles, a government official in Berlin said on Thursday that Germany believed that any external financial support to Athens would best be provided by the I.M.F. 
 ''In the case that the Greeks get into really serious problems, we would support an I.M.F. solution,'' said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. 
 Beside unsettling the markets, Greece's troubles have undermined the euro, the common currency it and 15 and other European nations share. 
 Amid the uncertainty, the euro slipped against the dollar and was quoted at $1.3621 in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, down from $1.3741 early in the session. European stocks also wilted, with the Athens Stock Exchange General Index ending 3.4 percent lower.
 Since the euro's inception in 1999, no member has sought support from the I.M.F., which typically comes to the rescue of emerging-market economies rather than developed countries. The earlier offer of support for Greece did calm markets and take the spotlight off Greece, but European leaders have been vague about how any aid package would actually be structured. 
 The Greek government, however, has been pushing for more clarity on what its neighbors will do in the hope of bringing down its borrowing costs, which have risen as Greece's debt troubles have become more acute. 
 The yield on Greece's benchmark 10-year bonds rose Thursday to 6.265 percent -- a spread, or differential, of 3.14 percentage points over comparable German bonds, the European benchmark for safety.
 Germany says it believes that Athens can live with that premium, but the Greek government thinks it should not have to pay that much to borrow now that it has agreed to measures meant to cut its budget deficit to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. Greece's budget deficit hit 12.7 percent of G.D.P. last year, making it the worst gap in Europe.
 If Athens relies on financing from the markets at high interest rates, ''that undermines the actual measures that you are taking,'' Mr. Papandreou said. ''That money then goes to the interest of those who are loaning to you rather than the implementation of a program.'' 
 The prime minister said that he still hoped for a positive response from Greece's neighbors at a meeting of European Union leaders next week in Brussels. ''We have kept all options open,'' he said.
 Germany's new stance could worsen divisions in Europe, since President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, both favor a European rescue effort rather than an I.M.F.-orchestrated one.
 Already, the varying announcements from Berlin have left some politicians in Europe cold. ''I find what has happened, or rather what has not happened over the past few days and weeks, incomprehensible,'' said Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and the current president of the Liberal Democratic bloc in the European Parliament. ''It is incomprehensible because it is precisely a European response that is the quickest and least costly solution.''
 In Washington, Caroline Atkinson, the I.M.F.'s director of external relations, said on Thursday that the fund had not yet been approached by Athens. 
 ''We expect the euro-zone countries to want to and to plan to resolve this question by themselves,'' Ms. Atkinson said. She added that the I.M.F. was ready to respond to a request from Greece for a loan.

HEADLINE: Looking Back, Greenspan Says Wall Street Needs a Tighter Rein

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Is Alan Greenspan, famous for his libertarian leanings and hands-off approach to Wall Street, having some second thoughts?
 After more than six decades as a skeptic of big government, the former Federal Reserve chairman, now 84, is gingerly suggesting that perhaps regulators should help rein in giant financial institutions by requiring them to hold more capital.
 Mr. Greenspan, once celebrated as the ''maestro'' of economic policy, has seen his reputation dim after failing to avert the credit bubble that nearly brought down the financial system. Now, in a 48-page paper that is by turns analytical and apologetic, he is calling for a degree of greater banking regulation in several areas.
 The report, which he is to present Friday to the Brookings Institution, is by no means a mea culpa. But in his customarily sober language, Mr. Greenspan, who has long argued that the market is often a more effective regulator than the government, has now adopted a more expansive view of the proper role of the state. 
 He argues that regulators should enforce collateral and capital requirements, limit or ban certain kinds of concentrated bank lending, and even compel financial companies to develop ''living wills'' that specify how they are to be liquidated in an orderly way.
 And he acknowledged shortcomings in regulation -- an area on which the central bank has placed far greater emphasis under Mr. Greenspan's successor, Ben S. Bernanke.
 ''For years the Federal Reserve had been concerned about the ever-larger size of our financial institutions,'' Mr. Greenspan wrote. Fed research has not been able to find economies of scale as banks grow beyond a modest size, he said, and in a 1999 speech, Mr. Greenspan warned that ''megabanks'' formed through mergers created the potential for ''unusually large systemic risks'' should they fail.
 Mr. Greenspan added: ''Regrettably, we did little to address the problem.''
 The former Fed chairman also acknowledged that the central bank failed to grasp the magnitude of the housing bubble but argued, as he has before, that its policy of low interest rates was not to blame. He stood by his conviction that little could be done to identify a bubble before it burst, much less to pop it.
 ''We had been lulled into a sense of complacency by the only modestly negative economic aftermaths of the stock market crash of 1987 and the dot-com boom,'' Mr. Greenspan wrote. ''Given history, we believed that any declines in home prices would be gradual. Destabilizing debt problems were not perceived to arise under those conditions.''
 His new thoughts on regulation appeared to be a turnabout from Mr. Greenspan's past views on bank size. Sanford I. Weill, the former Citigroup chief executive, wrote in a 2006 memoir that when Citigroup was formed in 1998 out of the merger of banking and insurance giants, Mr. Greenspan told him, ''I have nothing against size. It doesn't bother me at all.''
 In a lengthy footnote, Mr. Greenspan wrote that it was ''interesting speculation'' to ask whether investment banks would have avoided taking on extraordinary leverage -- as much as 20 to 30 times tangible capital -- had they remained partnerships instead of incorporating, as a 1970 ruling permitted broker-dealers to do.
 ''To be sure, the senior officers of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers lost hundreds of millions of dollars from the collapse of their stocks,'' he wrote. ''But none to my knowledge filed for personal bankruptcy and their remaining wealth allowed them to maintain much of their previous standards of living.''
 The main policy prescription in Mr. Greenspan's paper was higher capital requirements and liquidity ratios, which he argued would be the most effective way to blunt the impact of future crises. And he suggested that discussions under way to designate regulators to detect systemic financial risks would be of limited use.
 ''Unless there is a societal choice to abandon dynamic markets and leverage for some form of central planning, I fear that preventing bubbles will in the end turn out to be infeasible,'' Mr. Greenspan wrote. ''Assuaging their aftermath seems the best we can hope for.''
 Mr. Greenspan, who stepped down as Fed chairman in January 2006, has defended his once-celebrated 18-year tenure previously. But the Brookings paper is his most extensive examination to date of the crisis's origins.
 The paper, titled ''The Crisis,'' argues that a global housing bubble was primarily caused by a sharp drop in long-term interest rates from 2000 to 2005, brought about by export-oriented growth in developing economies, especially China, after the end of the cold war. China, saving the dollars it was earning, in effect made money available for cheap loans.
 ''In short, geopolitical events ultimately led to a fall in long-term mortgage interest rates that in turn led, with a lag, to the unsustainable boom in house prices globally,'' he wrote.
 Mr. Greenspan also tried to refute, or at least deflect, the criticism he has received for the Fed's conduct of monetary policy in the years after the burst of the dot-com bubble in 2001 and the subsequent recession. John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist, has been the most influential exponent of that criticism.
 In response, Mr. Greenspan argued that the rise in home prices had become unhinged from other measures of inflation. While conceding that the low fed funds rate, the benchmark interest rate the Fed controls, made it easier for borrowers to use adjustable-rate mortgages, he said he suspected -- ''but cannot definitively prove'' -- most home purchasers would have taken out 30-year fixed-rate mortgages had the adjustable-rate ones not been available.
 ''The global house price bubble was a consequence of lower interest rates, but it was long-term interest rates that galvanized home asset prices, not the overnight rates of central banks, as has become the seemingly conventional wisdom,'' Mr. Greenspan wrote.
 In addition to endorsing higher capital and liquidity requirements, Mr. Greenspan said banks and possibly all financial intermediaries should be required to hold bonds that automatically convert to equity when capital falls below a certain threshold. That could help reduce the ''moral hazard'' that exists because the banks that failed did not suffer the full costs of their actions.
 The Senate is contemplating a mechanism by which the government can seize and dismantle a huge, interconnected financial company before panic spreads.
 For a big, interconnected company, regulators should initiate a special bankruptcy process, he wrote. A bankruptcy judge would require creditors to take a haircut before the company is reorganized. The company should then be split up into separate units, ''none of which should be of a size that is too big to fail,'' Mr. Greenspan wrote.

HEADLINE: A Delicate Balancing Act for the Black Agenda

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
What a difference hard times make. 
 Until recently, most black discontent with the Obama administration -- especially in Barack Obama's hometown, Chicago -- was largely kept in the family and out of the mainstream press, even as black business, civil rights and political leaders quietly grappled with and debated how best to support and challenge the nation's first black president without hurting the causes of racial and economic justice.
But as the economic crisis continues to slam black America disproportionately hard, while bonuses rain down on Wall Street, the debate has spilled into the open and will get its loudest and most public hearing yet on Saturday, in a forum held just a few miles from Mr. Obama's house in Kenwood, at Chicago State University. 
 Tavis Smiley, an author and talk show host and a frequent -- and until recently rare -- black critic of the president, is scheduled to convene a panel of civil rights leaders and scholars called ''We Count: The Black Agenda Is the American Agenda.'' 
 The discussion will be nationally televised on C-Span, and the invited panelists include Cornel West, a Princeton University professor; Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader; and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, president of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
 ''A black agenda is jobs, jobs, jobs, quality education, investment in infrastructure and strong democratic regulation of corporations,'' Dr. West said. ''The black agenda, at its best, looks at America from the vantage point of the least of thee and asks what's best for all.'' 
 During his run to the White House, voters, black and white, projected all sorts of hopes and dreams onto Mr. Obama, no matter what he said or did. When it comes to race, for example, Mr. Obama has forcefully tried to avoid the subject. The one notable exception was his now-famous speech in Philadelphia in 2008, and only then when his campaign was in peril from the fiery words of his former Chicago pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright. 
 Mr. Obama's black supporters were willing to give him a pass, to give him ''time to learn his way around the White House.'' But too many homes have been lost to foreclosure, too many fathers have lost jobs, too many mothers are losing hope for his most loyal bloc to be happy with what many are now saying is more symbolism than substance coming from Mr. Obama's administration in regard to black America. 
 ''The question I hear a lot on the street is, 'Would we have been better off with Hillary Clinton?' '' said Hermene D. Hartman, publisher of the weekly N'Digo newspaper in Chicago.
 Others, though, like Jacky Grimshaw, a senior adviser to former Mayor Harold Washington, are reading more into the timing and location of the black agenda meeting 14 months into Mr. Obama's presidency. 
 ''If the idea is to embarrass the president,'' Ms. Grimshaw said, ''this is a good way of doing it.'' 
 Given Mr. Smiley's vocal criticism of Mr. Obama -- raising questions about the president's effectiveness in pursuing the agenda many black voters favor -- some see the meeting as a sign of a division among blacks here and across the country. On one side are those who believe Mr. Obama is doing his best under tough circumstances. On the other are those who feel let down by a perceived lack of action by Mr. Obama on behalf of black Americans. By hosting the forum in Chicago, Mr. Smiley seems to be spotlighting the discussion in a place most likely to draw national attention. 
 Mr. Smiley said the goal of the event was not to attack or embarrass Mr. Obama in his Chicago backyard, but to pressure other black leaders to develop and press for a black agenda, an action plan for tackling poverty, poor schools, infant mortality and an unemployment rate among blacks that is at least twice the national average. 
 ''Black people are getting crushed,'' Mr. Smiley said. 
 No one argues that point. But since announcing the event last month, Mr. Smiley and the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of Mr. Obama's most vocal supporters -- ''Barack's pet preacher,'' as one Chicago activist put it -- have conducted a sometimes heated debate on black radio about the wisdom of convening the ''We Count'' panel discussion. 
 Mr. Sharpton seems to have the numbers on his side. Support for Mr. Obama among black Americans is hovering around 90 percent in polls. 
 Mr. Sharpton said he would not attend the Chicago gathering. ''Yes, we need a black agenda,'' he said. ''But the president shouldn't be leading it. Black leaders should be.'' 
 Herman Brewer, the acting president and chief executive of the Chicago Urban League, expects to attend, although with some trepidation. 
 ''I think it's O.K. if folks are critical of the president,'' Mr. Brewer said. ''But I wouldn't want it to be viewed as a condemnation, a smackdown of the president. Hopefully, it can be viewed as constructive.'' 
 Mark Allen, a longtime civil rights advocate on the South Side, said that just a couple of months ago if he had made even a mild public criticism about Mr. Obama's not doing enough for the poor or for small businesses in the inner city, ''black middle class folks would curse me out.'' 
 The message was clear: If you are black, you just didn't air complaints about ''our homeboy,'' Mr. Allen said, certainly not in public where the news media could see and hear. Doing so was seen as undermining the first black president, of giving comfort to the enemy, of betraying the race. 
 But these days, even in Chicago, Mr. Allen said: ''It's not as taboo anymore. You get cursed out a lot less.''
 Some blacks in Chicago seem to be having a case of unrequited love. 
 ''Barack is ignoring the black community,'' said Ms. Hartman, the publisher. ''There's no communication, no reaching out, no speaking out. Every black business I know is hurting. Trickle down is not trickling down.'' 
 Mr. Obama worked 20 years ago as a community organizer in the Altgeld Gardens public housing development on Chicago's South Side. There, Bamani Obadele, who runs a youth program in Roseland, and Cheryl Johnson, who runs an environmental justice organization at the sprawling development, recently discussed Mr. Obama and the We Count event. 
 Mr. Obadele said Mr. Obama attended several antiviolence rallies that Mr. Obadele organized in the Robert Taylor Homes public housing development in the 1990s. 
 ''He helped me carry a casket through the streets,'' Mr. Obadele said, referring to an antiviolence mock funeral. ''He absolutely understands the struggle of black folks. But he's not the same Barack I knew. The Barack I knew wouldn't bail out the banks and let the people go hungry. I think his advisers are giving him bad advice.'' 
 Ms. Johnson said: ''It's complicated. He's inherited a mess we haven't experienced since the Great Depression. Let's give him some time.'' 
 Mr. Obadele added: ''I hope we don't end up being a national embarrassment on Saturday, fighting about the black president. I hope something positive comes out of it. But we have to do something. There's just too much suffering out here.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Is Quietly Closing A Pipeline for Charitable Gifts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, New York City's richest man and biggest philanthropist, is quietly pulling the plug on an unusual program that has poured nearly $200 million of his fortune into nonprofit groups across the five boroughs, in a sign of major change under way in his charitable giving plans. 
 His decision, which is not yet public, has set off alarm in the city's arts and social services worlds, which depend heavily on his largesse and are grappling with deep budget cuts and a brutal fund-raising climate.
 Since he was first elected mayor in 2001, Mr. Bloomberg has provided money to hundreds of mostly small neighborhood, arts and cultural groups through the Carnegie Corporation of New York, a philanthropic trust, in a process that was remarkably informal and closely coordinated with City Hall. 
 The gifts reflect the often blurred roles Mr. Bloomberg plays in the city as mayor, tycoon and philanthropist. And while the donations earned him praise from grateful recipients, who regarded him as an enlightened billionaire, they also drew rebukes from elected leaders who argued that he bought political acquiescence with his checkbook. 
 That tension was heightened during the mayor's 2008 push to rewrite the city's term limits law. His aides asked several groups that had received Carnegie grants to lobby for the change publicly, which allowed him to remain in office for four more years.
 The full impact of Mr. Bloomberg's decision to end the program was not immediately clear. He is increasingly focusing on his charitable efforts at his family foundation, where he has expanded hiring and operations in recent months as he prepares to put greater emphasis on needs in the United States.
 The mayor and his aides declined to be interviewed. Asked if there were specific plans to replace the Carnegie gifts, which have helped support some 600 theaters, dance troupes, museums and other groups, Vartan Gregorian, Carnegie's president, said he did not know of any. 
 But two people familiar with the mayor's charitable work said that his family foundation could eventually provide grants to the groups.
 For many of the groups, the mayor's money helped spare them from financial crisis after the attacks of Sept. 11 and the downturn that followed.
 ''It will be extremely hard to replace -- there is no question about it,'' said Carol Ochs, executive director of the 52nd Street Project, a theatrical workshop for children in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan that has received about $400,000 from Mr. Bloomberg since 2002. ''The really scary thing is the threat of it going away.'' 
 The program was unusual in many ways: Mr. Bloomberg technically gave the money as an anonymous donor, but it was an open secret that it came from him; each year the Carnegie Corporation published a list of the donations and recipients, and the mayor's press office alerted reporters to its release. 
 The money was given to the groups in unrestricted gifts that had surprisingly few reporting or accounting requirements.
 Mr. Bloomberg never demanded that Carnegie provide him with a detailed report on how the money was spent. He would simply send a single check for tens of millions of dollars every December. 
 There was no application process, which freed the groups from the red tape and paperwork that often accompany grant-seeking, but also added to the mystery of why some groups received money and others did not.
 And Mr. Bloomberg's closest adviser, Patricia E. Harris, now the first deputy mayor, was consulted about the gifts for the groups, which were often also receiving money from the city's Department of Cultural Affairs.
 Mr. Gregorian, who agreed to speak extensively about the program, though he would not discuss the identity of the donor, said such communication would help Carnegie avoid giving large gifts to groups that had received financing from City Hall. 
 For example, Department of Cultural Affairs officials would inform him that the city had long financed a particular arts group. ''Did you know that?'' he said, recalling the kind of conversations he had with City Hall staff. ''Thank God you told me,'' he said. ''I was going to give them more money.''
 Mr. Gregorian called it ''information, not coordination.'' He added: ''We are not a shadow cultural organization for the city.'' 
 The arrangement has given Ms. Harris, who oversees the Department of Cultural Affairs, unprecedented influence over the city's arts and cultural groups, since she helps manage the mayor's private donations and the dissemination of taxpayer money. When recipients of the Carnegie donation express gratitude to the mayor, he is known to respond, ''Don't thank me, thank Patti.''
 It was Mr. Gregorian who, in fall 2001, approached Mr. Bloomberg with the idea that he find a way to help the smaller New York City organizations reeling from the effects of the downturn. The fund was established as an emergency response, and Carnegie agreed to administer it free.
 By his own account, the conversation was strikingly casual: he bumped into Mr. Bloomberg, a close friend, on the street in Manhattan and made the suggestion. Mr. Bloomberg responded on the spot that he would do it but that Mr. Gregorian would have to run it. 
 In interviews, the leaders of the organizations described their euphoria at opening an envelope and discovering they were receiving significant sums of money that could be used at their discretion. 
 Queens Theater in the Park, which had an annual budget of nearly $2 million, lost hundreds of thousands in revenues after Sept. 11, when ticket sales plunged, forcing the group to cut its employees' workweek to four days from five. Then it received a check for $100,000 from Mr. Bloomberg. 
 ''This kind of thing just does not happen to groups like ours,'' said Jeffrey Rosenstock, the executive director of the group, which has received $800,000 of the mayor's money since 2002. He said the money helped plug holes ''that could have become much bigger and damaged the organization.''
 There have been hints over the past two years that the program may be drawing to a close. In summer 2008, Carnegie notified recipients that further donations were ''under review by the donor'' and could undergo significant changes. 
 At the same time, Carnegie encouraged the groups to participate in a training program, financed by Mr. Bloomberg, to help strengthen their management and fund-raising skills. 
 Mr. Gregorian said it was almost impossible to capture how meaningful Mr. Bloomberg's contributions were to the city's arts and social services communities. Even as the mayor shifts his charitable giving to his foundation, Mr. Gregorian is certain Mr. Bloomberg will continue to be a major philanthropic force.
 ''He shares Andrew Carnegie's notion that the person who dies rich dies disgraced, because he does not have the imagination to reinvest the money into society,'' he said.

HEADLINE: One Classroom, From Sea to Shining Sea

BYLINE: By SUSAN JACOBY. 
Susan Jacoby is the author of ''The Age of American Unreason.''

 BODY:
AMERICAN public education, a perennial whipping boy for both the political right and left, is once again making news in ways that show how difficult it will be to cure what ails the nation's schools. 
 Only last week, President Obama declared that every high school graduate must be fully prepared for college or a job (who knew?) and called for significant changes in the No Child Left Behind law. In Kansas City, Mo., officials voted to close nearly half the public schools there to save money. And the Texas Board of Education approved a new social studies curriculum playing down the separation of church and state and even eliminating Thomas Jefferson -- the author of that malignant phrase, ''wall of separation'' -- from a list of revolutionary writers. 
 Each of these seemingly unrelated developments is part of a crazy quilt created by one of America's most cherished and unexamined traditions: local and state control of public education. Schooling had been naturally decentralized in the Colonial era -- with Puritan New England having a huge head start on the other colonies by the late 1600s -- and, in deference to the de facto system of community control already in place, the Constitution made no mention of education. No one in either party today has the courage to say it, but what made sense for a sparsely settled continent at the dawn of the Republic is ill suited to the needs of a 21st-century nation competing in a global economy. 
 Our lack of a national curriculum, national teacher training standards and federal financial support to attract smart young people to the teaching profession all contribute mightily to the mediocre-to-poor performance of American students, year in and year out, on international education assessments. So does a financing system that relies heavily on local property taxes and fails to guarantee students in, say, Kansas City the same level of schooling as students in more affluent communities. 
 President Obama's proposed revisions to his predecessor's No Child Left Behind law appear, on the surface, to offer an example not of local control but of more federal intervention. Yet many experts agree that the main reason President George W. Bush's original law has failed to raise student achievement significantly is that states have dumbed down their exams. Diana Senechal, a former New York City teacher, demonstrated this in an inventive fashion when she showed that anyone could pass New York's middle-school promotion examinations by simply ignoring the questions and answering, ''A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D'' in order. 
 The new proposals being offered by the Obama administration will not significantly change a setup that combines the worst of both worlds: broad federally mandated goals and state manipulation of testing and curriculum. Nationwide testing is useless unless it is based on a curriculum consensus reached by genuine experts in the subjects being taught -- yes, the dreaded ''elites.'' That is how public education is administered in nearly all industrialized nations throughout Europe and Asia, whose students regularly outperform Americans in reading comprehension, science and math. 
 By contrast, the Texas board's social studies revision forms a blueprint for bad educational decision-making. Chosen in partisan elections, the board members -- most lacking any expertise in the academic subjects upon which they are passing judgment -- had already watered down the teaching of evolution in science classes when they turned their attention to American and world history. Thus was Jefferson cut from a list of those whose writings inspired 18th- and 19th-century revolutions, and replaced by Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin and William Blackstone. This is certainly the first time I've ever heard the ''Summa Theologica'' described as a spur to any revolution. 
 No Frenchman could conceive of a situation in which school officials in Marseille decide they don't like France's secular government and are going to use textbooks that ignore the Napoleonic code (and perhaps attribute the principles of French law to Aquinas). But publishers will have to comply with Texas requirements in order to sell history books to that state's huge school system. Indeed, they will likely start producing one edition for conservative states and another for the saner precincts of American schooling.
 That is exactly why local control of schools is often an enemy of high-quality public education. The real question is whether anything, in the current polarized political climate, can be done about educational disparities that are inseparable from our fragmented system of public schooling. I can imagine at least three baby steps that would pave the way for success.
 First, even though a national curriculum cannot be imposed, serious public intellectuals of varying political views need to step up and develop voluntary guides, in every academic subject, for use by educators who do not disdain expert opinion. The historians Diane Ravitch and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who disagreed politically on many issues, advocated for just such a set of national history standards in the late 1990s. These guidelines met with approval from just about everyone but the extreme fringes of the left and right. 
 Second, the federal government must invest more in training and identifying excellent teaching candidates. France, faced with a teacher shortage in the early 1990s, revamped its training system so that aspiring teachers would receive a partial salary in the last year of their studies. Prestigious institutes for teacher training were also set up to replace less rigorous programs, with admission based on competitive national examinations. Which makes more sense -- investing resources upfront in attracting the brightest young people to teaching, or penalizing teachers who fail further down the road, as No Child Left Behind attempts to do? 
 Finally, the idea that educational innovation is best encouraged by promoting competition between schools and pouring public money into quasi-private charter schools should be re-examined by both the left and the right. One of the worst provisions in the Obama administration's $4.3 billion ''Race to the Top'' program strongly encourages states to remove restrictions on the number of privately managed charter schools. Here again, we have the worst of both worlds: a federal carrot that can lead only to a further balkanizing of a public education system already hampered by a legacy of extreme decentralization. 
 Daniel Webster, eulogizing Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, who both died on July 4, 1826, spoke of ''an unconquerable spirit of free inquiry ... and a diffusion of knowledge throughout the community'' as two of the fundamental requirements of American democracy. He predicted, ''If they fall, we fall with them; if they stand, it will be because we have upholden them.'' These great principles cannot be upheld if the quality of our public schooling continues to depend more on where a student lives than on a national commitment to excellence.

HEADLINE: Three Vacancies at the Fed

 BODY:
With three of seven seats to fill on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, President Obama has an opportunity to put the economy in the hands of experts untainted by the failures that led to the financial crisis. In the process, he can help restore public confidence in the Fed as steward of the economy. 
 Early word indicates he is on the right track. Possible nominees are still being vetted. But Mr. Obama appears to be seeking board members with broad economic and legal expertise, including a keen sense of how policies affect what the Fed would call ''the household sector.'' This is a welcome shift from decades in which the Fed has focused increasingly on financial markets as a proxy for the economy -- mistaking asset bubbles for growth and debt-driven gains for prosperity.
 The Times has reported that the top choice for vice chairwoman of the board is Janet L. Yellen, an economist who is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and an expert in the causes and implications of unemployment. For the other vacant seats, Peter A. Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an authority on taxes and retirement, is under consideration, as is Sarah Bloom Raskin, a lawyer who is the Maryland commissioner of financial regulation. Other candidates include economists, lawyers and executives with expertise in labor and housing issues.
 Those kinds of perspectives would help ensure that the Fed weighs the impact that its decisions have, not only on markets, but on jobs, consumer protection, long-term wealth accumulation and other neglected fundamentals of economic well-being. They also could mean a shift away from pro-market, anti-regulatory theories, notably the belief that markets are always efficient and institutional investors reliably sophisticated. 
 Though discredited by the crisis, those beliefs are embedded in American economic thought and need to be replaced at the highest levels of economic decision-making. Wall Streeters would scream at that, because they have benefited from the discredited status quo and would like to see it restored. Mr. Obama must be prepared to let them scream.
 The new members will join the Fed board at a critical juncture. The economy is showing signs of recovery but is vulnerable to renewed recession or prolonged stagnation. If the Fed moves too soon to end the lax policies and low interest rates that are propping up the economy, it risks derailing the recovery -- and worsening already high unemployment. If it moves too late, it risks inflation. Achieving the right balance in the economy will require achieving the right balance on the board.

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama signed a jobs bill into law on Thursday, but declared that the measure, which is intended to spur employment by providing businesses incentives to hire new workers, ''is by no means enough.'' 
 Mr. Obama appeared in the Rose Garden to sign the measure, which passed the Senate Wednesday by a vote of 68 to 29, a rare example of bipartisan support in a capital that has become bitterly divided over Mr. Obama's health care overhaul. The president said he was pleased that more than a dozen Republicans ''were willing to break out of the partisan morass'' in Washington to vote for the bill.
 ''I hope it is a prelude to further cooperation in the days and months to come, as we continue the work of digging out of this recession and rebuilding our economy in a way that works for all Americans,'' Mr. Obama said in remarks prepared for the event.
 The bill gives employers an exemption from payroll taxes through the end of 2010 on workers they hire who have been unemployed for at least 60 days. It also extends the federal highway construction program, shifts $20 billion to road and bridge building and allows small businesses to accelerate the depreciation on investments they make in equipment, by allowing them to write off purchases of up to $250,000 right away.
 But while Mr. Obama began the year vowing to focus on ''jobs, jobs, jobs,'' he and the Congressional Democratic leadership have taken a largely incremental approach. Some economists have said the measure Mr. Obama signed will have only a modest impact on unemployment, and Democrats are already planning to follow it up with legislation that would extend more than $30 billion in corporate tax breaks and aid to small businesses.
 ''Now, make no mistake,'' Mr. Obama said in his Rose Garden remarks. ''While this jobs bill is absolutely necessary, it is by no means enough. There is a lot more we need to do to spur hiring in the private sector and bring about a full economic recovery.''
 With his health care bill hanging in the balance, and a critical vote in the House expected over the weekend, Mr. Obama has spent much of this week talking to members of Congress in an effort to try to corral the necessary 216 votes to pass that measure. The quick Rose Garden appearance -- barely 14 hours after the Senate sent Mr. Obama the jobs bill for his signature -- offered the president a brief respite from the intense health care effort, giving him a chance to spotlight, albeit briefly, his work on the issue that polls say Americans care about most: jobs.
 Mr. Obama acknowledged that while economic indicators suggest the nation is beginning to move out of its deep recession, those figures are not reflected in the lives of ordinary Americans.
 ''Through the eyes of most Americans, recovery is about something more fundamental,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Do I have a decent job? Can I provide for my family? Do I feel a sense of financial security?''

HEADLINE: A Reminder of One Who Got Away

BYLINE: By THAYER EVANS and BILLY WITZ

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Baylor once dreamed of making the N.C.A.A. tournament with the sensational freshman point guard John Wall.
 The Bears did everything they could to recruit him, even going as far as to hire his Amateur Athletic Union coach, Dwon Clifton, in July 2008 to a newly created position before Wall's senior year of high school.
 That hiring practice was used by Kansas to attract top recruits like Danny Manning, who led Kansas to a national championship in 1988, and Mario Chalmers, the hero of the Jayhawks' 2008 national championship team. But in October the N.C.A.A. approved a rule for men's basketball that prohibits the hiring of non-coaching personnel associated with players two years before or after the player's actual or anticipated enrollment. 
 Ultimately, Wall's desire to play for Kentucky Coach John Calipari won out. Wall has starred for the Wildcats this season, averaging 16.9 points and 6.5 assists, and will probably be the top overall pick in June's N.B.A. draft if he leaves college early as expected.
 ''I made a decision for myself,'' Wall said of choosing Kentucky.
 Although Wall's recruitment did not turn out as Baylor had hoped, the Bears are still at the N.C.A.A. tournament with him this week. The third-seeded Bears (26-7) and the No. 1 Wildcats (33-2) are in separate regions, but both are playing here at New Orleans Arena.
 It is a bittersweet reminder of what could have been for Baylor, which struggled in beating No. 14 Sam Houston State in the first round Thursday for its first N.C.A.A. tournament victory since 1950.
 ''It would have been great to have him,'' Baylor guard LaceDarius Dunn said. ''He would have brought a lot to the table, like he's brought success to Kentucky. It would have been the same here. That would have been crazy.'' 
 DEEP NEW ORLEANS ROOTS When the basketball left Danero Thomas's hands, all Willie Mae Thomas could do was hope and pray.
 ''Oh, Lord, the whole game is in my child's hands,'' Willie Mae said in a telephone interview Friday. ''I kept saying, 'Lord, let this ball hit this net.' When it went in, oh man, I was so excited I didn't know what to do.''
 If Miss Willie Mae, as she is known, believes that the Lord works in mysterious ways, the proof of that may not be only in her youngest child's winning shot, which lifted Murray State to a 66-65 upset of Vanderbilt.
 It may also rest in the unlikely convergence of Danero Thomas and the coach who drew up the play, Billy Kennedy.
 They grew up in New Orleans, a generation apart and at opposite ends of the city -- socially, economically and geographically. It was that connection that brought them together to a small, basketball-mad town in western Kentucky.
 Kennedy grew up in the comfortable suburbs of Metarie, where he starred at Holy Cross, a private Catholic school. Several miles to the east, Thomas grew up in the Florida Avenue projects, where he attended public schools and learned to shoot by cutting out the bottom of milk crates and nailing them to a telephone pole. As Kennedy, 46, bounced around as a college basketball assistant, working at eight schools in 12 seasons, he continually returned to tap the talent pool in New Orleans. The relationships he built were even more important when he became the head coach at Centenary and then at his alma mater, Southeastern Louisiana.
 When Kennedy left after leading Southeastern to an N.C.A.A. tournament berth in 2005 to take an assistant job at Miami, he was aware of Thomas, who played on the same traveling team as D. J. Augustin, now with the Charlotte Bobcats, and Louisiana State's Tasmin Mitchell.
 At the same time, Thomas left New Orleans to attend Mount Zion Academy, a prep school in Durham, N.C., that is noted for its basketball program. 
 When Kennedy was hired at Murray State in 2006, one of the first calls he made was to Thomas's high school coach in New Orleans. Thomas committed to Murray State without visiting the campus.
 ''We were in a dire situation,'' Kennedy said. ''We needed bodies. Fortunately, we were able to get in there. That's why we got him, the connection from New Orleans.''
 Thomas's life, like those of many others, had been turned upside down six months earlier by Hurricane Katrina. Willie Mae had moved from the projects to the Lower Ninth Ward, which was devastated by flooding.
 Quiet by nature, Thomas is trying to get comfortable being in the spotlight after his shot Thursday. When he checked his phone after practice 24 hours later, it had 52 text messages.
 The 13th-seeded Racers will be underdogs again Saturday against fifth-seeded Butler, but for at least two of them, inspiration can be drawn from where they still have roots.
 ''We're trying to ride the Who Dat nation wave,'' said Kennedy, aware that if their beloved Saints could win a Super Bowl, there's no telling the limits of hope and prayer. BILLY WITZ

HEADLINE: Outlook Uncertain

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
 Connected to Google by both love and money, 23andMe seems the epitome of a 21st-century company -- a cutting-edge merging of biotechnology and the Internet, with a dash of celebrity thrown in. 
 The scarce ingredient so far is customers. 
 23andMe is the most prominent of a trio of companies that in 2007 began using the Web to market personal genomics services. The companies scan people's DNA, promising to tell them their risks of getting dozens of diseases. 
 Propelled by its co-founder Anne Wojcicki, the wife of Google's billionaire co-founder Sergey Brin, 23andMe attracted attention by holding swanky ''spit parties'' where people gave saliva samples for DNA analysis. Rich and famous people like Rupert Murdoch, Harvey Weinstein and Ivanka Trump became customers and in some cases investors. 
 But for the common consumer, 23andMe's service -- and those from its main competitors, Navigenics and DeCode Genetics -- have been a much harder sell. 
 Two and a half years after beginning its service, 23andMe has only 35,000 customers. And at least a quarter of them got the service free or for only $25, instead of the hundreds of dollars on which the business model is based. Navigenics and DeCode have even fewer customers. 
 The low turnout suggests that many people have not yet embraced the genomics age -- despite efforts by the companies to present genetics in an understandable and even entertaining way. It does not help, either, that the services cost $300 to $2,000 and have been trying to catch on during a severe recession. 
 But the services face an even more fundamental problem: in most cases, the current level of DNA scanning technology and science is unable to offer meaningful predictions about the risk that a person will get a disease. 
 ''It is a really wonderful form of recreation,'' said Scott R. Diehl, a geneticist at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. But as for applying it to health care, he said, ''It's very premature.'' 
 The companies have been forced to adjust. Named for the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, 23andMe went through two rounds of layoffs last year. The company, which is privately held and based in Mountain View, Calif., now has fewer than 40 employees, down from a peak of about 70. The company's other founder, Linda Avey, left last September to start an Alzheimer's disease research foundation, though she remains a director. 
 The company declined to make Ms. Wojcicki or other executives available for interviews. As this article was being completed, 23andMe e-mailed comments, said to be from Ms. Wojcicki, in response to questions. 
 ''The business is moving ahead in a positive trajectory,'' Ms. Wojcicki wrote. ''We've hit some bumps in the road but we are learning and continuing to evolve. We did not start this company thinking it was going to be easy to create an entirely new market.'' 
 Esther Dyson, a technology investor who sits on 23andMe's board, said that the employee cutbacks were part of a necessary adjustment. 
 ''We've become a business from being a scientific adventure company, basically,'' Ms. Dyson said. 
 Navigenics, based in Foster City, Calif., is on its third chief executive in a year and has also trimmed its work force. It is now marketing to doctors and corporate wellness programs rather than consumers.
 People close to the company estimate that Navigenics has about 20,000 customers, at least 5,000 of whom were given big discounts to be in a study. 
 And DeCode Genetics, based in Iceland, passed through bankruptcy after heavy spending to develop drugs and diagnostic tests. The DecodeMe personal genomics service, while only one part of the company's business, apparently attracted fewer than 10,000 customers. 
 DeCode's new owners are focusing on individual disease-risk tests sold to doctors for several hundred dollars apiece. DeCode recently doubled the price of the consumer DecodeMe scan to an uncompetitive $2,000 -- twice as much as its nearest rival -- in an apparent effort to keep the consumer service from undermining the product for doctors.
 It is not unusual, of course, for new technologies to fall short of enthusiastic early expectations, only to succeed more gradually. Experts say that as the cost of reading DNA continues to plummet, and as scientists gain better understanding of the link between genes and medicine, analyzing people's genetic make-ups will no doubt become an essential part of health care. 
 But that might take a few years and require sequencing a person's entire genome, not just sampling selected bits, as the companies do now. And it raises the question of whether the pioneers can all survive until then, or be overtaken by nimbler new players that might emerge. A fourth company, Pathway Genomics, based in San Diego, began offering service last summer at a lower price than the others. 
 For now, 23andMe appears to have some staying power. The company raised $27.8 million last year, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December. A portion came from an earlier $10 million loan from Google's Mr. Brin, which was converted into 23andMe stock, according to Google's regulatory filings. Google itself invested $2.6 million in the round, adding to the $4.4 million it invested in 2007. New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm, is also a big investor. Some $4 million of the proceeds from the fund-raising were used to pay back a loan to the company from Ms. Wojcicki. 
 Along with its competitors, 23andMe uses so-called gene chips to sample a person's DNA at a half-million to a million spots among the three billion total possibilities. Variations at those locations correlate with higher or lower risk of various diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and various cancers. 
 But what has become clear to geneticists only in the last year is that the genetic variations known so far can explain only a very small part of the risk of getting most diseases. The rest involves still unknown genetic factors or environmental ones, like a person's diet. Experts say that, for now at least, in most cases there is little a person can do to act on the information from genome scans. 
 ''The average lifetime risk of breast cancer is 12 percent,'' said Sarah S. Murray, a geneticist at the Scripps Research Institute who took tests from both 23andMe and Navigenics. ''My risk is 10 percent. But what does that really mean?''
 The predictions are also uncertain. James P. Evans, a genetics professor at the University of North Carolina, sent the same DNA samples to both 23andMe and DeCode. In about one in three cases the results differed, with one company saying the risk of a disease was higher than average and the other saying it was lower than average. 
 To make their tests more useful, the companies are adding more ''actionable'' information beyond disease risk. Both Pathway Genomics and 23andMe now test for genetic variations that determine whether certain medications, like the anti-clotting drugs Plavix and warfarin, will work for people or cause side effects. Navigenics is about to add that capability. 
 Pathway and 23andMe are also offering so-called carrier testing -- to tell prospective parents if they harbor mutations that could result in their children developing inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or Tay-Sachs. 
 23andMe is also emphasizing another part of its service that tells people about their ancestry. A new feature proving popular with customers lets people find and then contact distant cousins by comparing their own genes with others in the company's database. 
 The company also hopes to make money from research based on its patient database, while vowing that customer privacy will be protected. 
 It is asking its customers to fill out online surveys on subjects ranging from their sports injuries to their experiences with swine flu. By comparing, say, the DNA of people who suffered miserably from swine flu with the genes of those who did not, the company might discover information useful to a drug company or research institute. 
 23andMe last year announced a Parkinson's disease study, which was paid for mainly by Mr. Brin, who has a gene that predisposes him to the disease. 
 The company aimed to sign up 10,000 people with Parkinson's disease in as little as a month by offering them its service for only $25. After a year, however, fewer than 4,000 patients had signed up. Another effort to recruit 1,000 patients with each of 10 diseases has so far fallen far short of that goal. 
 Other than Mr. Brin, no one has yet paid 23andMe to conduct research or receive access to its genetic information. But the company's directors say such contracts are in the works. 
 ''We're going to be businesslike,'' Ms. Dyson said. ''We're going to make money off research. We're going to market more effectively. And over time the product is going to be better, because over time, the data is going to be more meaningful.''

HEADLINE: Irish Port Town Puzzled to Find Itself Part of a Multinational Terrorism Inquiry

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Eamon Quinn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WATERFORD, Ireland -- When two North African men under investigation in an alleged terrorist plot to kill a Swedish artist appeared in the gray pillared courthouse here this week, many native Waterford residents reacted as much with puzzlement as dismay, as if Islamic extremism had no conceivable place amid the tranquillity of this quiet old harbor town.
 ''I think everybody is asking why should it come here; it's something that doesn't belong,'' said one of the pinstriped lawyers who use the chilly courthouse lobby to caucus with clients. His face darkening with anxiety, he quickly asked that he not be named. 
 A fellow lawyer standing nearby saw it differently, saying it was precisely because Waterford is something of a backwater, 100 miles south of Dublin, that it may have attracted people intent on developing a terrorist underground.
 ''For people like that, the quieter the place, the better,'' said Tom Walsh, a cheerful 54-year-old taking a break from a case involving a property dispute.
 Like the rest of Ireland, Waterford has taken a severe blow with the recession that brought a crashing end to the ''Celtic Tiger'' years, dating from the mid-1990s, when Ireland became a byword for rising prosperity. Unemployment has soared, and civic pride, as well as local pocketbooks, was bludgeoned when Waterford Crystal Ltd. closed its plant last year, and the company's new American owners moved production to Germany and the Czech Republic.
 But if the loss of jobs has been a harsh reverse, the scenes at the courthouse struck many here as surreal.
 Although Waterford has had its share of Muslim migrants in the past 15 years, many of them drawn here in pursuit of jobs during the boom, most were absorbed quickly into the local landscape, attracting little attention in a town whose busy port has always drawn its share of outsiders.
 Not so Ali Charaf Damache, a 44-year-old Algerian, suspected of being the ringleader of seven Muslims arrested March 9 by the Irish counterterrorism police acting in concert with the F.B.I. The Americans identified the suspects here during their investigation of an alleged plot to murder a Swedish artist, Lars Vilks, who drew a cartoon published in Swedish newspapers that showed the Prophet Muhammad with the body of a dog.
 For his court appearance on Monday, Mr. Damache dressed in the traditional garb of the Touareg nomads of the North African desert, with a flowing black overgarment and a turban of black cotton wrapped so as to leave only a narrow slit for his eyes.
 For greater effect, the Algerian raised his manacled fists to photographers, in what seemed like a calculated gesture of defiance.
 The first arrest in the case involved a Philadelphia-area woman, Colleen R. LaRose, a Muslim convert who called herself JihadJane on the Internet. On Thursday, Ms. LaRose, 46, pleaded not guilty in Philadelphia to multiple counts of conspiring with jihadist fighters and pledging to commit murder in the name of an Islamic holy war.
 Law enforcement officials said it was her arrest last fall, after stepping off a plane from Ireland, that led to the four men and three women arrested here.
 In Waterford, five of the seven people arrested have been released, including a second American woman who is a Muslim convert, Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, 31, of Leadville, Colo., who has been living with Mr. Damache in Waterford since last fall and is several months pregnant. She remains in Dublin, and F.B.I. officials have been urging her to return to the United States for further questioning.
 The police in Ireland say that their inquiry in the case is continuing, and that the relatively minor charges against Mr. Damache and a 32-year-old Libyan man, Abdul Salam al-Jahani, could be broadened later to include conspiracy to commit murder.
 On Friday, the Waterford court remanded Mr. Damache for another week on a charge of threatening another Irish Muslim by telephone. Mr. Jahani pleaded guilty to a charge of presenting false documents to Irish police officers who arrested him, and was sentenced to three months in prison.
 Lawyers familiar with the case say that Irish investigators have hinted at a larger plot than just the threat to kill Mr. Vilks, the artist.
 ''Al Qaeda has been mentioned during the questioning,'' one lawyer said, asking for his identity to be withheld because of the delicacy of the case.
 In court on Monday, prosecutors, urging that Mr. Damache be denied bail, said he had plans to visit Algeria and Afghanistan.
 Dozens of Qaeda-linked plots have been investigated in Britain in recent years, especially since the suicide bombings on the London transit system in July 2005. But Ireland has mostly escaped the contagion.
 People familiar with the Muslim community here -- numbering about 40,000 people, including the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland -- say one reason may be that the community is ethnically diffuse, unlike Britain, where more than two-thirds of the 1.5 million Muslims have family origins in Pakistan, which has served as a base for many of the plots discovered in Britain.
 In Waterford, as elsewhere in Ireland, Muslims hail from wide parts of the Islamic world -- South Asia, the Middle East and North and East Africa. Most have arrived here since 1990, when a census put the number of Muslims in Ireland at 4,000, drawn by jobs or university education.
 Others came as asylum seekers, attracted by the relative ease of crossing borders within the European Union, their paths eased by a generous system of state support for migrants. Prosecutors said Mr. Damache, after 10 years in Ireland, was living off welfare benefits at the time of his arrest, as was Mr. Jahani.
 But whatever may have helped to incubate Islamic militancy in Waterford, it seems not to have been difficult for Muslims to find a welcome here. While there have been frictions of a kind common across Europe, the government has usually stepped in at an early stage to resolve them.
 After the government upheld the right of Muslim schoolgirls to wear the hijab, the traditional Muslim head covering, in the classroom, one commentator mocked those who sought to ban it, saying no one had ever objected to Catholic nuns wearing veils in the classroom.
 ''After all, for generations the veil has played a central role in education here,'' wrote the commentator, Emma O'Kelly, the education correspondent for RTE, the Irish state broadcaster. ''Countless generations of Irish children have been educated in Irish schools by Irish women wearing veils. Some still are. The only difference now is that it's pupils, not teachers, who are covering their heads, and they're not Catholic, they're Muslim.''

HEADLINE: More Food Banks Helping to Feed Pets

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The exploding demand among the needy for food banks is rapidly expanding to desperate pet owners who can no longer afford to feed their animals, according to the Humane Society of the United States. 
 Animal shelters around the country are being flooded with hungry pets, and to tackle the problem, charitable organizations are setting up pet food banks, with products offered within regular food pantries.
 ''One of our goals is to keep pets in their homes if we can,'' said Jane Hoffman, president of the Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals, a nonprofit that works to find ways of limiting the number of animals in New York City that are euthanized. ''It's heartbreaking when an animal has to go to a shelter simply because its family doesn't have the money to feed it.''
 She compared it to City Harvest, a nonprofit group in New York that distributes excess food from the city's restaurants to the needy.
 The Mayor's Alliance is working with the Petco Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the pet store chain, to build a national network of pet food banks supplied in part out of donation bins that Petco is putting in its stores.
 The idea grew out of a program the foundation started after the recession hit that aimed to keep pets with their families by providing some financing to animal welfare groups to support food supply, temporary shelters, new adoption programs and the like. 
 It has supported, for instance, a program Meals on Wheels started in 2006 to supply the elderly with food for their pets as well.
 ''In the last year or so, we've just had more and more groups asking for food and started thinking of ways we could address that need,'' said Peter Jolly, the executive director of the Petco Foundation.
 Petco asked each of its stores to team up with a pet food bank operation. Those organizations will be responsible for collecting and distributing the food that is collected in the bins. It will spend $100,000 on the program.
 ''We also envision in the future going to our pet food vendors and asking them to run a special program so that if, say, someone buys a bag of Hill's Science Diet dog food to put in the bin, then Hill's Science Diet would match that gift with another bag,'' Mr. Jolly said.
 PAWS Chicago, which aims to prevent animal deaths in that city, will distribute Petco food and products through its spay-and-neuter clinic.
 Last year, the organization distributed 29,000 pounds of food for 745 dogs and cats, said Rochelle Michalek, executive director of PAWS, which stands for Pets Are Worth Saving.
 ''People don't want to give up their pets, but they're getting to a point where they have to make choices between putting food on the table, paying the electric bill, getting school supplies or buying pet food,'' she said. ''Giving them a three-month supply of pet food means they don't have to make that choice.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a growing demand by pet owners for food banks to provide food for animals as well as humans misstated the given name of the executive director of the Petco Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the pet store chain. He is Paul Jolly, not Peter Jolly.

HEADLINE: At 108, Queens Man Pulses With Vigor

BYLINE: By JANO TANTONGCO and FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Seventy-two years ago, a 36-year-old German immigrant named Carl Berner moved into a modest single-family house in Middle Village, Queens.
 He still lives there. 
 Doing the math, that makes Mr. Berner -- a former toolmaker, toymaker, factory owner and civic activist -- 108 years old.
 It also makes him almost certainly the city's oldest man, according to the Gerontology Research Group, which tracks centenarians worldwide. And with the death earlier this month of a 111-year-old woman in Staten Island , Mr. Berner is probably only a few days shy of being the oldest person in the city -- he was born on Jan. 27, 1902, 12 days after Julia Morrell, who lives in a nursing home in Manhattan.
 In any case, Mr. Berner is very, very, very old. On a recent Tuesday, he welcomed a visitor and offered a glimpse into his world. 
 A pair of monkey wrenches rested on a windowsill. Mr. Berner said he once used them to repair his furnace. He closed his eyes and gave his head a quick shake, as if stirring a submerged memory to the surface. ''I was good in creating,'' he said.
 Mr. Berner came from Stuttgart. His parents died from tuberculosis when he was very young. He learned to make tools, but could not get a job doing so when he went to New York in 1928. He found work in maintenance at the Chrysler Building and eventually became night-shift supervisor.
 Still, he wanted to create with his hands. Skilled at cutting the plush material used to make stuffed animals and dolls, he opened a toy manufacturing business in his garage in Jackson Heights. He met a woman named Margaret and married her. They bought the brick house on 81st Street in Middle Village. They had a daughter, Emily. Later he bought a factory on Long Island.
 Mr. Berner's wife died years ago. His daughter still lives with him.
 One cloudy afternoon last month, Mr. Berner sat in his dining room, Emily by his side.
 His eyes widened when he talked about the past. At one point, he mimicked cutting plush on his dining table, exposing hands weathered by industry and age.
 ''Even though life is disgusting sometimes, I'll get up again,'' Mr. Berner said.
 The dining room is lined with awards and plaques, including one from the Department of Sanitation for his efforts to keep the neighborhood clean.
 Mr. Berner complained that neighbors no longer knew each other as they used to, that inflation abounded and that the neighborhood was building up too much, too quickly.
 ''New York has changed between day and night,'' he said.
 He said that he was still energized but that his health had been failing him. ''I'm not very well in my heart,'' he said. ''This I know. This I can feel.''
 Mr. Berner has recently recovered from a broken left hip, but he said he still felt spirited.
 ''I still have some...,'' Mr. Berner said, leaving the sentence unfinished. He searched for words, but could only close his eyes, raise his fists and shake them with vigor, energy still pulsing.

HEADLINE: China's Rapid Growth Shifts the Geopolitics of Oil

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Last summer, Saudi Arabia put the final bolt in its largest oil expansion project ever, opening a new field capable of pumping 1.2 million barrels a day -- more than the entire production of Texas. The field, called Khurais, was part of an ambitious $60 billion program to increase the kingdom's production to meet growing energy needs.
 It turns out the timing could not have been worse for Saudi Arabia.
 Only two years ago, consumers were clamoring for more supplies, OPEC producers were straining to increase their output, and prices were rising to record levels. But now, for the first time in more than a decade, the world has more oil than it needs. 
 As demand slumped because of the global recession, Saudi Arabia was forced to shut about a quarter of its production. After raising its capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day, Saudi Arabia is now pumping about 8.5 million barrels a day, its lowest level since the early 1990s. 
 ''2009 was painful for us as it was for everybody else,'' said Khalid A. al-Falih, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, the kingdom's state-owned oil giant, and a company veteran who was promoted to the top post at the beginning of last year. ''We experienced the same cash flow constraints that everybody did. But we adjusted quickly and, certainly, everything that was strategic to us was not touched.'' 
 The recession also precipitated a milestone for Saudi Arabia and the global energy market. While China's successful economic policies paved the way for a quick rebound there, the recession caused a deeper slowdown in the United States, slashing oil consumption by 10 percent from its 2005-7 peak. As a result, Saudi Arabia exported more oil to China than to the United States last year.
 While exports to the United States might rebound this year, in the long run the decline in American demand and the growing importance of China represent a fundamental shift in the geopolitics of oil. 
 ''We believe this is a long-term transition,'' Mr. Falih said in a recent interview. ''Demographic and economic trends are making it clear -- the writing is on the wall. China is the growth market for petroleum.''
 Saudi officials have said they favor prices of around $80 a barrel. Despite soft demand and high levels of inventories, oil futures in New York have averaged $75 a barrel over the last six months. On Friday, they closed at $80.68. 
 In the United States, some experts believe that energy-efficiency measures, as well as the government's push for biofuels and its plans to limit carbon emissions, are putting the nation on a long-term path to lower oil consumption.
 The American talk about energy independence rankles Saudi officials, who maintain that the goal is unrealistic and could end up damaging energy markets by undermining investment now, thus leading to higher prices in the long run. 
 Mr. Falih said he welcomed energy-efficiency measures but insisted that fossil fuels would dominate energy demand for decades.
 ''I was here in the 1980s after the 1970s price shocks, and I remember all the debates,'' Mr. Falih said. ''But ultimately the policies were reasonable. And the United States continues to search for that reasonable ground.''
 Saudi officials have recognized that structural changes are taking place in the United States. A few months ago, Aramco sold its storage facilities in the Caribbean, a signal that it was abandoning the East Coast market, according to analysts. (The Saudis stopped striving to be the top foreign supplier to the United States years ago. The kingdom now trails Canada, Mexico and Venezuela for exports to the United States.)
 That is not to say the Saudis are cutting ties with the United States. Aramco is expanding its Motiva refinery, in Port Arthur, Tex., which it owns with Royal Dutch Shell, to increase its capacity to 600,000 barrels a day. That will make it the largest refinery in the United States, overtaking Exxon Mobil's Baytown refinery.
 Edward L. Morse, an energy expert who heads global commodity research at Credit Suisse in New York, said the transformation was a healthy development in relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States. It also means the end of the ''U.S. discount,'' where Aramco sold oil to American refiners for about $1 a barrel less than to Asia.
 ''The Saudis don't see the need to subsidize their oil exports to the United States anymore,'' Mr. Morse said. 
 Last year, Saudi exports to the United States fell to 989,000 barrels a day, the lowest level in 22 years, from 1.5 million barrels a day the previous year, according to the Energy Information Administration.
 Meanwhile, Saudi sales to China surged above a million barrels a day last year, nearly doubling from the previous year. The kingdom now accounts for a quarter of Chinese oil imports. 
 Saudi Aramco recently inaugurated a huge refinery in the Fujian province, in the southeast coast of China, which is projected to receive 200,000 barrels a day of Saudi crude, and is looking at a second project in the northeast city of Qingdao. 
 It is also planning to build two refineries in Saudi Arabia, as joint ventures with Total and ConocoPhillips, that are primarily destined to ship products to Asia.
 India is also courting Saudi attention. After a visit in March to Riyadh by India's prime minister, Saudi Arabia outlined a goal to double its exports to India. The kingdom already accounts for 25 percent of the Indian market after its exports grew sevenfold from 2000 to 2008. 
 ''Oil flows are shifting from West to East, and Saudi supplies that used to go to Europe and the United States are now headed for Asia,'' said Jean-Jacques Mosconi, the senior vice president for strategy at Total of France.
 Brad Bourland, a former State Department official who heads research at Jadwa Investment in Riyadh, said: ''Saudi Arabia used to be very much an American story, but those days are gone forever. That's just a reflection of a globalized world and the rise of Asia. They now see their relationship with China as very strategic, and very long term.''
 Some energy and security experts have pointed out that the Saudi government is keen on displacing Iranian oil sales to China to persuade Beijing authorities to back tougher sanctions against Iran's nuclear program, a position that has the support of the United States.
 ''We know the Saudis and others have delivered the message to the Chinese that instability in the gulf is not in their interest,'' Douglas C. Hengel, the deputy assistant secretary for energy, sanctions and commodities at the State Department, said last week during a conference in Houston.
 But Jon B. Alterman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that the falling dependence of the United States on Saudi oil could turn into a problem for the Saudis, because the United States guarantees their security in the Persian Gulf. 
 ''The Saudis are particularly concerned about the shape of the global market where all the growth comes from the east and all the security comes from the west,'' Mr. Alterman said. 
 China's oil demand is set to grow by 900,000 barrels a day in the next two years. Chinese oil consumption reached 8.5 million barrels a day last year, compared with 4.8 million in 2000. It will account for a third of the world's total consumption growth this year. 
 While China is by far the fastest-growing oil market in the world, the United States is still the top consumer: despite the slump, Americans consumed 18.5 million barrels a day in 2009. That amounts to 22 barrels of oil a year for each American, compared with 2.4 barrels for each Chinese.
 ''To me, this is a long-term business,'' said Mr. Falih during the interview.
 ''And that is how I look at the United States and China -- as markets for commodities that will be in demand for years.''

HEADLINE: City Tally Finds Bigger Number Living in Street

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration said Friday that the number of people living on New York's streets and subways soared 34 percent in a year, signaling a setback in one of the city's most intractable problems. 
 Appearing both startled and dismayed by the sharp increase, a year after a significant drop, administration officials attributed it to the recession, noting that city shelters for families and single adults had been inundated.
 Robert V. Hess, the commissioner of homeless services, said in a subdued news conference that the city began feeling the increase in its vast shelter system more than two years ago. ''And now we're seeing the devastating effect of this unprecedented poor economy on our streets as well,'' Mr. Hess said. 
 The city's annual tally indicated an additional 783 homeless people on the streets and in the subway system, for a total of 3,111, up from 2,328 last year. That is in addition to almost 38,000 people living in shelters, which is near the city's high. 
 The count came from an annual census of homeless people that is typically conducted on a cold January night, when more than 2,500 volunteers walk the streets and subway system between midnight and 4 a.m. to search for and identify the homeless. It took place this year on Jan. 25.
 There were more homeless people found on the streets in every borough. The largest increase was in Brooklyn, where an additional 228 people were counted, more than double the total in January 2009. Manhattan had a 47 percent increase, or 368 more homeless people. In Staten Island, there was an increase of 45 percent, or 54 people; in Queens, a 14 percent increase, or 14 people; and in the Bronx, 6 percent, or 10 people.
 Volunteers found 109 additional people -- an increase of 11 percent -- on subway trains and in stations.
 Some of the homeless were found in out-of-the way corners in Queens and Staten Island. 
 A higher-than-usual concentration of homeless people have been recently seen in Pennsylvania Station. And a pocket of homeless men in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, appears to be new immigrants from Poland, trying to find work as day laborers.
 The homeless population on the streets this year was down 29 percent from 2005, the first year of the count. The numbers had been steadily declining each year until the latest tally. 
 New York officials said the city still had a relatively small population of homeless people on the streets when compared with other large American cities. 
 There is one homeless person for every 2,688 people in the general New York population, compared with 1 in 154 for Los Angeles, 1 in 1,810 for Chicago and 1 in 1,844 for Washington. Among other cities conducting homeless counts this year, only Seattle, which showed a slight decrease, has so far announced results.
 Mr. Hess promised that there would be new measures to encourage more of the homeless to get off the streets and into shelters. In the next month, the city will open two new housing facilities with 105 beds. And street-outreach workers will survey people to help understand why they are homeless.
 Mr. Hess said he wanted to allow more people to go directly from the street to a shelter bed without an intake process and to cut out some of the bureaucracy that deterred them from entering shelters. 
 Tim Marx, the executive director of Common Ground, a nonprofit organization that provides homeless street outreach services in Brooklyn, Queens and parts of Manhattan, said he was not surprised by the increase. 
 ''It just says that we have to keep up our efforts and intensify them,'' Mr. Marx said. ''The more people we have on the streets, the more they are making demands of our emergency shelter system, emergency rooms, detox centers and jails.'' 
 Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, said he saw the count's results as a sign that the administration needed to revamp its policies. 
 ''Based on the increase reported today, I hope we can agree that we need to change our approach,'' Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. ''I continue to believe that we can do more to take on the growing problem of homelessness, including expanding prevention programs, re-examining our housing policies and maintaining support for critical services -- such as drop-in centers and faith-based shelter beds -- that often are all that stands between single homeless adults and the streets.''
 The count has attracted its share of skepticism since it was first conducted in 2005. Advocates for the homeless have questioned the city's methodology and have frequently accused the administration of underestimating the number.
 The city says it follows a national standard and includes decoys as a way to measure the accuracy. The decoys, who are volunteers, station themselves around the city and note whether the official counters come by. In January, 90 percent of the decoys were counted, so the city assumed that 10 percent of the homeless were missed and adjusted its tabulation accordingly.
 Last year, city officials said that the count revealed a 30 percent drop in the street homeless population since 2008, an announcement that was made at an elaborate news conference attended by volunteers, formerly homeless people and Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, who spoke briefly.
 This year's event was quiet and spare by comparison. Ms. Gibbs's commissioner, Mr. Hess, made the announcement in a conference room, seated at a long table.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Shuts Seven Troubled Banks

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators shut down seven banks in five states on Friday, bringing to 37 the number of bank failures so far this year. 
 The closings follow the 140 banks that succumbed in 2009 to mounting loan defaults and the recession.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over the First Lowndes Bank, in Fort Deposit, Ala.; the Appalachian Community Bank in Ellijay, Ga.; the Bank of Hiawassee, in Hiawassee, Ga.; and the Century Security Bank in Duluth, Ga.
 The agency also closed down the State Bank of Aurora, in Aurora, Minn.; the Advanta Bank Corporation, based in Draper, Utah; and the American National Bank of Parma, Ohio.
 The F.D.I.C. was unable to find a buyer for Advanta Bank, which had $1.6 billion in assets and $1.5 billion in deposits. The regulatory agency approved the payout of the bank's insured deposits and it said checks to depositors for their insured funds would be mailed on Monday.
 The deposits and assets at the remaining banks, all valued at less than $1 billion, were assumed by other nearby institutions.

HEADLINE: When Not To Pay Down A Mortgage

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
This week, the Federal Reservereaffirmed its intention to stop buying mortgage-backed securities, signaling the likelihood that the mortgage rates you can get today are as good as they're going to be for a long while. Once the Fed stops buying, after all, rates are likely to go up.
 And current rates are quite good. At about 5 percent, in fact, they're so good that they've helped change the age-old debate over whether homeowners should make extra mortgage payments to pay off their debt well before their loan periods are up.
 Back when rates ran at 7 or 8 percent, making extra payments offered what amounted to a guaranteed return on your money. When you're ridding yourself of debt that costs you much less, however, it's easier to imagine a future when you could more easily earn a higher return by investing those potential extra mortgage payments someplace else. 
 Meanwhile, at a time when just about everyone knows someone who is unemployed or who owes more on a home loan than the house is worth, keeping extra cash someplace more liquid than a mortgage seems like a safer approach.
 So is the case against extra payments closed for good, given that so many people have locked in rock-bottom mortgage rates for the long haul?
 The answer depends on two things: how likely you are to leave the extra money in savings and how good it would feel to wipe your debt out years earlier than your mortgage requires. 
 THE BASICS First, let's dispense with the standard boilerplate. Don't even think about making extra mortgage payments unless you've paid off higher-interest debt. Credit card debt is the easiest win here. 
 Also, if you're not saving enough to get the full match from your employer in a 401(k) or similar account, increase your savings there first. And don't make extra mortgage payments if you don't already have a decent emergency fund set aside.
 YOUR REAL INTEREST RATE Now, take a look at the interest rate on your mortgage. That 5 percent? It's not your real rate if you get some of the interest back each year in the form of a tax deduction.
 Let's say you have a household income of $175,000 and are paying 35 percent of that in total to the state and federal tax collectors. If you pay $20,000 in mortgage interest each year on a loan that charges 5 percent, the deduction effectively brings your taxable income down to $155,000. 
 As a result, you're paying $7,500 (35 percent of $20,000) less in taxes than you would have without the deduction. So ultimately, you're not really paying $20,000 in interest at all; your net cost is $12,500 after you subtract the $7,500 tax savings. 
 And that makes your effective, after-tax interest rate on your loan just 3.25 percent, which is simply 35 percent (your tax rate) less than the original 5 percent.
 BETTER RETURNS? So any money you set aside in lieu of making extra mortgage payments would need to earn more than 3.25 percent annually. That seems like a reasonable possibility in the future. 
 In fact, you could have done that well during the supposedly lost decade we just finished. Vanguard Wellington, for instance, a popular low-cost mutual fund that holds about 65 percent stocks and 35 percent bonds and other short-term securities, earned an average annual return of 6.15 percent in the 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2009. 
 The Vanguard Balanced Index Fund would not have outperformed our 3.25 percent benchmark, however, as it only returned 2.64 percent over the same 10-year period. 
 STORING THE SAVINGS Wouldn't taxes eat into the returns from the money you'd save instead of making extra mortgage payments? Not if you place it into an account shielded from taxes. A Roth individual retirement account would fit the bill here, as would a 529 college savings account or health savings account. 
 Bruce Primeau, whose note to his financial planning clients at Wide Financial Group in Minneapolis on this topic inspired me to re-examine it, adds that this isn't simply about keeping more assets under his watch so he can earn a better living. ''I'm not telling them that the money has to come to me,'' he said. ''A 401(k) match beats the return on paying a mortgage off automatically. There's real estate and buying employer stock through a purchase plan at a 15 percent discount and all kinds of things.''
 Then you need to preserve those savings. When extra money goes toward a mortgage, it's hard to get at it when the urge strikes to flee to an Asian beach for a few weeks of playtime. If the money is not locked up in retirement or college savings, however, you may be tempted to spend it. 
 THE LIQUIDITY PROBLEM Capital-gains taxes might eventually come due with some of these investments, and the rate could well rise above the current 15 percent long-term rate before too long. Still, having some of your savings in a taxable account makes sense for several reasons.
 If you hit a stretch of long-term unemployment after having plowed most of your extra cash into paying down your mortgage, your bank probably won't pat you on the back for being a good saver and give the money back to you. Nor is it likely to let you borrow it through a home equity loan if you have no income with which to repay it. 
 Elaine Scoggins, who had the mortgage department chief reporting to her at a bank before she became a financial planner, suggests imagining a situation where you need to move quickly but can't sell your home or extract equity to use as a down payment in your new town. Given that possibility, why create more home equity through extra mortgage payments than you have to?
 ''The whole housing debacle has reminded us all, including me, that real estate is not liquid,'' said Ms. Scoggins, who is the client experience director for Merriman, a planning firm in Seattle. ''And it takes cash to support it.''
 Those who have used their cash in an attempt to be conscientious have learned some tough lessons, meanwhile. Imagine people who scraped together a 5 percent down payment and bought a home in Florida or Arizona in 2005 and then made extra mortgage payments the first two years to try to increase their equity. Now, post-collapse, they owe, say, 30 percent more than their homes are worth and need to seriously consider walking away from the loan -- and all of those extra payments.
 REASON AND EMOTION So the reasoned case for making no extra payments is very strong. But there's one counterpoint that almost always carries the day, even when there's only a mild risk with the financial strategy of putting extra money elsewhere.
 And it's this: I need to be able to sleep at night.
 Even Mr. Primeau concedes here. ''Emotionally, you're right, and financially I'm right, and emotionally, you win,'' he said. ''If emotionally, people want to pay down their debt, than that's what I help them to do.''
 If you've just started paying down your mortgage, any extra payments should go toward principal (make sure your mortgage company is applying it properly). That will have the effect of shortening the term of your loan from, say, 30 to 25 years, depending on how many extra payments you make. The extra payments won't lower your monthly payment, but they will reduce your balance.
 Many people who are years into their mortgages -- and perhaps paying less in interest and getting less of a tax break as a result -- tend to develop stronger feelings about making extra payments. Those feelings are often even more acute as retirement approaches and homeowners become determined to quit work with no debt to their names.
 Those who do retire their debt rarely regret it or wring their hands over the big gains they might have scored by investing the money elsewhere. Tim Maurer, a financial planner and co-author of ''The Financial Crossroads,'' describes the feeling that washes over people who have paid their last mortgage bill as ''beholden to no one.''
 So he doesn't feel as if it's his business to separate people from their emotions if they feel strongly about working toward a debt-free existence. ''The whole point of planning is to make life better,'' he said. ''It's not to have more dollars at the end of the day.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 25, 2010

 CORRECTION:
The Your Money column on Saturday, about whether to pay off mortgage debt early, included an incorrect calculation in an example of tax treatment of mortgage interest. A household in the 35 percent tax bracket paying $20,000 a year in mortgage interest would reap tax savings of $7,000, not $7,500, making the net cost $13,000, not $12,500.

HEADLINE: Band Between Buzz and Big Break at South by Southwest

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
In the blog-accelerated time zone that the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference occupies, the cycle of buzz turns so fast that bands caught up in it can find themselves in the paradoxical state of being brand-new and old hat at the same time. 
 Case in point: Surfer Blood, a five-piece group from West Palm Beach, Fla., playing its first South by Southwest. Formed not quite a year ago, the band released its debut album, ''Astro Coast'' (Kanine), in January, and many here are seeing the group for the first time. Yet the introductory phase of Surfer Blood's life span is to some extent already over, having peaked in October at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York, where the band blitzed through 13 shows in a week and inspired enough tweets to jump-start a career. 
 Like every hungry act at South by Southwest -- which ends its 24th annual installment on Sunday -- Surfer Blood must seize every flicker of buzz in the air. But its challenge is also to maintain the momentum it has already established, and, as a somewhat known quantity, to throw its weight around a bit. To that end, the band has been keeping its equivalent of a leisurely schedule: only 10 gigs, interspersed with interviews, photo shoots and enough sneaker swag to keep it ambulatory for years.
 ''We started off thinking we would take it easy and not work ourselves to death,'' J. P. Pitts, 23, the lead singer, said during a brief rest on Thursday afternoon before Show No. 3. ''But we got so many awesome offers. How can you say no? And what is more fun than playing shows?''
 A day spent darting from gig to gig with Surfer Blood shows how far the band has come since CMJ, and yet how underground it remains. On the big-shot side of the ledger, it was booked for National Public Radio's high-profile day party, and gave a live interview to Carrie Brownstein, the former Sleater-Kinney guitarist who is a blogger for NPR. On Friday it played a party for The Village Voice, which five months ago had predicted that the band might break up before the end of CMJ.
 On the still struggling side: no roadies. To get to the NPR show the musicians lugged their own equipment four blocks down Sixth Street, the mobbed central artery of South by Southwest, and made it with four minutes to spare. (They would have gotten there earlier had they not paused to select pairs of sneakers to take home, courtesy of Saucony. On Friday the schedule called for more free footwear, from Keds.)
 Aside from exposure, many bands come to South by Southwest to make ancillary business deals like licensing and foreign representation. Surfer Blood, with some of those deals in place already, is somewhere in the middle of that process, and had a dinner with a publisher scheduled between gigs. 
 Surfer Blood was founded 11 months ago by Mr. Pitts and T. J. Schwarz, the drummer, and the band's brief career has been a mixture of hard work and very good fortune. By last summer all the members had dropped out of college (they range in age from 20 and 24) and begun an aggressive touring schedule. On a self-booked, highly efficient sweep through New York in August, they met many of the prime players of the Brooklyn underground scene and signed a two-album deal with Kanine Records. (So far ''Astro Coast'' has sold 18,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.)
 The band draws on the broad, bouncing chords of surf-rock as well as the serrated textures of grunge. Its clear melodies, economical songwriting style and affinity for the occasional West African-inspired guitar line are somewhat reminiscent of Vampire Weekend. But Lio Cerezo, who runs the label with his wife, Kay Quartararo, sees Surfer Blood as something of a wholesome, all-American antidote to the cleverness wars of the New York scene.
 ''It's something a normal kid that rides a skateboard can aspire to,'' he said between Show No. 4 and a Rolling Stone photo shoot. ''These aren't kids with Bowie haircuts. These are kids wearing Levis and average flannel, happy about their lives and having a good time with their friends.'' 
 Onstage at the NPR party on Thursday, Brian Black, the band's bassist, wryly hinted at slacker-class roots: ''I'd like to thank NPR for facilitating my life as a delivery driver,'' he announced. 
 Mr. Pitts, whose baby face betrays no sign of his unusually clear understanding of the requirements and limitations of indie-rock success, said the band's influences included Built to Spill and the Flaming Lips. ''A lot of people say that our music makes them nostalgic for the melodic guitar music they grew up listening to,'' he said.
 What sort of people say that?
 ''People 25 or older,'' he answered.
 Since playing CMJ, the band has toured almost continuously and lined up business highlights for the coming year, including the Pitchfork Festival in Chicago in July, and All Tomorrow's Parties in Minehead, England, in May. Its songs have been licensed for the CW television shows ''The Vampire Diaries'' and ''Life Unexpected.'' The band has accepted free dinners from major label scouts, but says it isn't quite ready for the big leagues yet. 
 ''What we want more than anything is a career,'' Mr. Pitts said before Show No. 5, at a cavernous bingo hall off Interstate 35. ''Although it is nice to be written about and have those resources behind you, right now we are not ready for it. The goal is just to keep making records and touring and growing.'' Ms. Brownstein offered her advice for surviving the yearlong Internet hype machine, which will continue to churn long after the bands of South by Southwest leave Austin.
 ''Yes, the Internet obviously foments a lot of buzz and chatter,'' she said, ''but there's nothing more exciting than having a friend tell you that they saw a great show by a great band and that you should check it out. So hopefully by the time you're on your 10th show, every single person that wants to see you will see you and go back to their towns across America and the world and preach about Surfer Blood. That's the only way to keep a band on your radar.''
 ''The blogs,'' she added, ''will already be on to something new.''

HEADLINE: Up North, Real Estate Is Booming. Seriously.

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- Marie-Yvonne Paint, a real estate agent in Montreal, has the kind of problem most of her counterparts in the United States can only dream about.
 ''We have a shortage of inventory right now,'' said Ms. Paint, who focuses on the exclusive and expensive municipality of Westmount. ''It's very annoying. We have buyers ready to buy and not much to show.''
 Ms. Paint's experience is not an isolated example. Like most of the world, Canada's real estate market slumped during the recession. But now, instead of worrying about the recovery of the real estate market, some Canadians are concerned about the prospect of a price bubble. The Canadian Real Estate Association reported that the average price of existing homes rose 19.6 percent in January compared with those in the month a year earlier, the latest in a string of substantial gains dating back through last autumn. By contrast, the average price of existing homes rose 2.6 percent in the United States in the same period, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 Such drastic percentage gains are not just a reflection of the market's earlier depths. In some Canadian cities, particularly Toronto and Vancouver, prices appear to be heading toward record levels.
 ''It's no surprise the housing market responded to low interest rates,'' said Craig Alexander, the deputy chief economist of the Toronto-Dominion Bank. ''The real question is what's going to happen in the next year. It can't continue at the current pace, otherwise a bubble will form.''
 Canadian home buyers, of course, are not unique in having access to low-interest mortgages. But Mr. Alexander and others attribute the Canadian market's revival to a series of measures that ensured that the recession in Canada did not turn into a real estate disaster.
 Perhaps chief among them is the country's retail banking system, which is effectively an oligopoly dominated by five national banks, including Toronto-Dominion.
 Most of the time, that arrangement is less than popular among Canadians, who think that a lack of competition leads to, among other things, low interest rates on savings and high service fees. 
 Public resentment has repeatedly caused politicians to block mergers between the banks. But in the lead-up to the credit crisis, the closed-shop nature of banking in Canada proved to be the government's, and the economy's, best friend.
 Mindful of government oversight, Canadian banks by and large avoided the structured debt products that imperiled many of their American counterparts. They also maintained comparatively tight controls on mortgage lending to consumers. When zero percent down payments on mortgages were widely available in the United States, Canadians were typically required to put down at least 10 percent. American-style amortization periods stretching beyond 25 years were also relatively unknown in Canada.
 ''In Canada, standards got nowhere near as low,'' said Timothy D. Hockey, the chief executive of TD Canada Trust, Toronto-Dominion's Canadian retail banking operation. ''When the crisis came upon us, the standards didn't have to change.''
 One result of that, said Phil Soper, the president and chief executive of Brookfield Real Estate Services of Toronto, is that the slump in housing starts and existing home prices was delayed by about a year in Canada until late 2008. Then, when interest among buyers began to return last year, Canada's still-healthy banks were able to provide mortgages, and housing prices were not depressed by a glut of defaulted properties in forced sales.
 ''One of the things we see in American businesses that we don't see in our Canadian businesses is a willingness to really push the limits,'' said Mr. Soper, whose operations include Royal LePage, one of Canada's leading real estate brokers. ''When bubbles burst, sometimes the turtle wins.''
 While demand from buyers has returned, most real estate analysts agree that sellers have been slower to move. There are a variety of theories for that reluctance. Winter is not seen as a optimal season for selling homes in most parts of the country, given Canada's climate. Some economists speculate that many sellers are holding out for more definitive signs of a market comeback. And others think that many sellers have delayed putting their homes on the market because they are undertaking repairs prompted by recently expired home renovation tax credits that were part of Canada's economic recovery plan.
 But whatever the cause, the expectation -- or perhaps the hope -- is that the arrival of spring and the upward trend in prices will inspire increasing numbers of people to list their homes. The increase in supply, in turn, should prevent prices from escalating to bubble levels. January's statistics, both for resales and housing starts, suggest that pattern may be developing.
 But Mr. Soper is among those who caution against reading too much into the current market buoyancy about long-term price trends.
 ''Canadians in the financial and real estate sectors feel a little bit smarter than they should about the strength of the economy and industry over the last few years,'' he said. ''Certainly the underlying economy isn't strong enough to support the prices we've seen over the last few weeks.''

HEADLINE: Philanthropy in the Form of a Fat Cash Prize

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
NOT long ago, a wealthy philanthropist would be content with having a building named after him or her, or simply donating to medical research. But in the last decade, more of the wealthy have been creating prizes in hopes of drawing attention to a particular cause. It doesn't hurt that their names are on the prizes.
 According to a report released last year by the consultant McKinsey & Company, the dollar amount for prizes over $100,000 has tripled in the last decade to $375 million a year. There has also been a shift from prizes that recognized past accomplishments to what McKinsey calls ''inducement-style prizes that focus on achieving a specific, future goal.''
 The Kravis Prize fits into this category. Established by Henry and Marie-Josee Kravis five years ago, the $250,000 prize seeks to recognize leadership among nonprofit groups worldwide and share their best practices. 
 ''We're hoping the winners can leverage the prize in order to get additional grants to expand their reach,'' Mr. Kravis said in an interview. Past winners have ranged from a project on rural land development to this year's recipient, Pratham, which educates children in rural India. The group will receive its award on Tuesday in Manhattan at the Museum of Modern Art.
 But creating prizes is not as straightforward as setting aside a pot of money. If the amount is too small, the prize may fail to attract enough high-quality entrants to accomplish the stated goals. If it is too large, it could draw people away from other fields where their skills would be better served. Then there is the cost of administering and publicizing the prize. 
 So if you're a wealthy philanthropist, here are some issues to consider before you decide to create a prize: 
 WHY A PRIZE? Prizes are nothing new. Determining longitude at sea was discovered through an incentive prize set up by the British government in the 18th century. But the growth in prizes over the last decade has been driven by the desire to effect change and bring attention to a social issue or a practical problem. 
 The McKinsey study said that 10 years ago a third of all prizes went to the arts, but today only a 10th do that. The focus now is on the environment, science, engineering and aviation, where the dollar amounts of prizes have increased sevenfold, according to the study. 
 Entrepreneurs who made their money in fast-growing industries of the last decade, like technology and biotechnology, particularly like prizes because of their ability to spur people to do work in a particular area, said Tom Riley, vice president of the Philanthropy Roundtable, an organization of philanthropists. 
 ''There's an increasing recognition that setting up prizes is a good way to spur innovation and bring about the outcomes they want,'' Mr. Riley said. ''Fortunately, money is a great tool to bring about the outcomes you want.'' 
 He argued that wealthy individuals are far better placed than governments or businesses, with their bottom-line concerns, to spur innovation. 
 GOALS Once philanthropists decide on setting up a prize, they still have to ask themselves what they want to accomplish with it. Then, they have to decide whether the prize should be a reward for past work, an incentive to do more of what someone is already doing or an inducement to draw new people to a cause. 
 On the surface, the goal of the Kravis Prize is to help a service-oriented organization expand what it is doing. But for the Kravises, there are at least two other objectives. 
 Mrs. Kravis, an economist by training, said she was interested in identifying institutions that delivered their services efficiently and then sharing those best practices with other nonprofit groups. She said the work of the Rural Development Institute, the first Kravis Prize recipient, has become a case study at the Stanford Business School for how it addressed rural landlessness in India. 
 The other goal was to use the prize to add to the work already being done at the Kravis Leadership Institute at Claremont McKenna College in California, Mr. Kravis's alma mater.
 Yet not all prizes have such clearly defined objectives. Lisa Philp, the global head of philanthropic services at J. P. Morgan Private Bank, administers the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize. Its goal, Ms. Philp said, is to recognize ''an artist who has made the world a more beautiful place.'' 
 The best-known new example of an incentive award is the X Prize, which gives out a prize of at least $10 million for the first group to achieve a specific goal. The winner of the Ansari X Prize for space flight had to create a spacecraft that could carry three people to 100 kilometers above the Earth twice in two weeks. 
 ''That clarity is helpful,'' Mr. Riley said. ''It's a nice sorting mechanism as opposed to 'We have a huge pot of money and we'll judge if you cross our threshold.' ''
 SCOPE Once the goal is defined, another major issue is the scope of the prize. How broad or narrow do you want the prize to be? And how will the prize fit into your overall philanthropic goals? 
 Ms. Philp said prizes were rarely the starting point for philanthropists and usually came after more traditional ways of donating, like financing research. 
 This was the case with the Kravises. Their prize is only a small part of their overall charitable giving to arts and educational institutions. (BusinessWeek estimated the Kravises gave $239 million to charity from 2004 to 2008.)
 Mr. Kravis is honest about the relatively small size of the prize. His hope for it lies elsewhere. ''The $250,000 isn't huge, but it helps the institution,'' he said. ''The prize gives them added credibility.'' 
 COST In traditional grant making, a philanthropist is financing a particular program or area of research to achieve a goal. If no one knows about it, the money still advances a cause. Prizes, on the other hand, need publicity to attract applicants and give the winner a boost beyond the dollar amount. 
 ''If you give a prize and no one knows about it, it's a waste,'' said Melissa A. Berman, president and chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. ''Getting it known costs money.'' 
 Ms. Berman said it commonly cost as much as the value of the annual award to administer and publicize the prize. If the prize is under $250,000, she said, the cost can actually be more than the value of the prize. 
 CONSIDERATIONS The problem with this uptick in interest in prizes is that certain fields are becoming overrun, and this can dull a prize's effectiveness. This is why not all ideas should be supported through prizes.
 Ms. Berman said there were generally three reasons for not setting up a prize. The first is if there are too many prizes in a field. The second is having inadequate resources to support and publicize the prize. And the third is a lack of a structure to manage the prize thoroughly and fairly. Entrants, after all, need to believe that winning your prize will mean something to their careers or their efforts. 
 Ms. Philp cautioned that some donors could be disappointed if the objectives of their prizes were too broad. This could make it hard to measure their effectiveness. ''You may not succeed in changing perceptions,'' she said. This is why a prize often works best as part of a broader philanthropic effort.
 Five years into their prize, the Kravises are happy with how their prize is evolving -- having learned from past mistakes. ''It's trial and error,'' Mrs. Kravis said. ''You're not going to hit a home run each time.''

HEADLINE: In Fight for Influence, Special Council Election in Brooklyn Is Filled With Intensity

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
Collectible rabbi trading cards have been used as campaign props, and hundreds of voters attended a debate. An 18-year-old candidate's jump into politics ended when he was thrown off the ballot after legal challenges from seasoned rivals. There have been allegations of smears and strong-arm tactics to neutralize opposing supporters.
 No one expected the race to replace Simcha Felder on the City Council to be sedate. 
 Still, it was hard to predict the level of intensity and theatrics that have surrounded the special election, scheduled for Tuesday, in a Brooklyn district that includes the Orthodox Jewish precincts of Borough Park and Midwood, where Pakistani-Americans are also asserting their political clout, as well as Bensonhurst, the Italian stronghold that has had an influx of Chinese, Russian and Arab immigrants.
 The Jewish Press, in its endorsement of one candidate, Joe Lazar, noted ''the unusual seriousness with which this race is being taken.''
 The drama has not been a total surprise, considering that legacies were at stake. Mr. Lazar, the son of Holocaust survivors who has worked for the City Department of Buildings and the State Office of Mental Health, has enjoyed the energetic backing of Assemblyman Dov Hikind, the longtime power broker of Borough Park. David G. Greenfield, another contender, was at one time said to be favored by Mr. Felder, who on Jan. 31 left the seat he held since 2002 to become the city's deputy comptroller, though Mr. Felder has not endorsed anyone.
 The race has become, at once, a contest for influence and bragging rights among the legendarily powerful Orthodox blocs of voters, and a platform for the area's other ethnic groups jockeying to prove their power.
 The voters are deciding among two Democrats -- Mr. Greenfield, 31, a father of two and the executive director of the Sephardic Community Federation; and Mr. Lazar, 61, whose Web site said he was recently appointed to a Police Department committee dealing with emotionally disturbed people -- and a Republican, Kenneth Rice, 27, a recent law school graduate who works as a lawyer for the Police Department. 
 Until recently, there were also two other young candidates. 
 One, Abraham Tischler, a sophomore at Touro College, ran on a platform that included keeping firehouses open and easing his neighbors' parking-ticket woes. ''I think my age is a great advantage,'' he said. ''I'm energetic and I don't owe any favors.''
 He got no favors from his older rivals: Mr. Greenfield and Mr. Lazar challenged Mr. Tischler's petitions in court or with the Board of Elections, though each man sheepishly tried to pin the blame for eliminating the ambitious young college student on the other. 
 Another candidate, Jonathan J. Judge, perhaps represented more of a threat. Mr. Judge, a Republican, was courting voters on the edges of the Orthodox Jewish community, including the Italian-Americans of Bensonhurst. Mr. Greenfield challenged his petitions and Mr. Judge, a 24-year-old graduate student who talks about politics the way his peers talk about sports, was removed from the ballot. 
 Mr. Lazar declined several interview requests. His campaign slogan is straightforward: ''In these tough economic times, we need a City Councilman who actually understands the budget.'' His name and picture also appear on trading cards featuring 20 different rabbis that are being collected by children in yeshivas.
 And he has a wealth of high-profile supporters, including Comptroller John C. Liu, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, Mr. Tischler, the former candidate, and, behind the scenes at least, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. ''Joe Lazar has been a friend of Speaker Silver for many years,'' a spokesman said. ''Beyond that, we do not have further comment.''
 Mr. Greenfield, on the other hand, has been criticized for an abrasive manner that has antagonized influential players, including Mr. Silver and Mr. Hikind. In response, he said, ''When you speak up for individuals, you'll invariably upset the status quo.'' He was also faulted for living outside the district, but said he was driven out by rising rents, and moved back two months ago to be near his widowed mother.
 One recent evening found him knocking on doors along East Third Street in Midwood. The voters he encountered, including many from the Sephardic community around Ocean Parkway, already seemed to know who Mr. Greenfield was. 
 They voiced concerns both parochial and familiar throughout the city: safety, tuition and the widely held belief here that the Police Department unfairly singles out the district's residents for parking tickets. One man asked him for a job (Mr. Greenfield seemed to offer one). Another asked if it was too late to register to vote (it was). 
 A woman mentioned that she was the mother-in-law of the real estate developer Joseph J. Sitt, who she said took care of most of her problems. She wished the candidate luck.
 Many expect an unusually large turnout for an off-season special election. Ezra Friedlander, a lobbyist and publicist who has been watching the race, said that many Hasidic groups would be supporting Mr. Lazar, noting that ''it's in their interest to generate as many of their followers to vote as proof of their relevance to future candidates.''
 Mr. Greenfield, using Mr. Lazar's high-profile supporters as leverage, is hoping to tap into voter resentment, according to Mr. Friedlander. ''He's trying to turn himself into a David versus Goliath candidate, saying, 'If anything is wrong with the community, it's because of the organizational structure.' ''
 He has a powerful adversary working against him. Mr. Greenfield worked as Assemblyman Hikind's chief of staff for a few months in 2001, but they clashed. Mr. Greenfield said he was in the midst of quitting when Mr. Hikind fired him.
 ''We had differences of opinion,'' Mr. Greenfield said. Mr. Hikind said, ''I really don't think of him much.''
 That spat hovers over the current race. Mr. Friedlander said of Mr. Hikind, ''By endorsing Joe to the point of being mostly identified with his campaign, Dov has to win big in order to retain his title as the undisputed king of Borough Park politics.'' 
 Mr. Hikind denies that the race is ultimately about his influence. ''This is an important race for me, it's an important race for everyone,'' he said. ''People are taking it very, very seriously.''

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Chief Urges a 'Fire Brigade' for Rescuing Failed Banks

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Sewell Chan contributed reporting from Washington, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Europe should have a ''fire brigade'' backed by funds from governments and the private sector to deal with failures of large banks, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund said Friday. 
 ''What I think is needed is a European Resolution Authority, armed with the mandate and the tools to deal cost-effectively with failing cross-border banks,'' the monetary fund's chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said in the text of a speech delivered to a conference on banking supervision in Brussels. 
 ''Fire damage can best be contained when the fire is detected and extinguished early,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said. ''But even the best fire prevention system needs a fire brigade.'' 
 European Union members have agreed to the principle of burden-sharing for cross-border banking workouts, but they have yet to make it operational and binding. 
 In the United States, the Senate is also debating an overhaul of financial regulation aimed at, among other things, buffering the economy from systemic threats like those posed by companies like Lehman Brothers and the American International Group in 2008. 
 The recent financial crisis exposed several flaws in Europe's financial regulations, including the lack of any well-defined mechanisms for dealing with larger lenders that operate across national borders. 
 Several European banks, like KBC of Belgium and Swedbank of Sweden, expanded aggressively in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the last decade, then ran into difficulties when the crisis hit. 
 Support for important lenders then was worked out in an ad hoc manner, by national supervisors acting with colleagues from other countries, and sometimes multilateral institutions like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is based in London. 
 This week, the Basel Committee of the Bank for International Settlements issued a series of recommendations, yet to be agreed nationally, intended to strengthen cross-border bank support tools. 
 The 44-page final report of the cross-border group called for ''firm-specific contingency planning'' that would help the most interconnected financial companies survive a crisis or, if necessary, be dismantled in an orderly fashion, without risking a global financial crisis. 
 Nout Wellink, the president of the Dutch central bank and the chairman of the Basel Committee, said its recommendations made ''meaningful progress toward addressing systemic risk and the 'too big to fail' problem.'' 
 In his speech, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said the new authority should be able to bail out ''at least the major cross-border banking groups, as well as all banks running large-scale cross-border operations.'' 
 A mechanism should be established to ensure that the losses ''are borne in the first place by shareholders and holders of equitylike instruments, and in the second place by uninsured creditors,'' he said. 
 ''As much as possible, the system should be prefinanced by the industry -- including through deposit insurance fees and any levies on the relevant financial institutions.'' 
 But, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, there would also have to be a role for government. ''To be robust, such a system needs access to financing and a fiscal back-up mechanism for any net resolution costs,'' he said. 
 Speaking at the same conference, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, endorsed a proposal to limit the disruptive potential of credit-default swaps as a step toward preventing finance from spiraling ''out of control.'' 
 Mr. Trichet added his backing to proposals for default swaps to be traded on a central clearing platform, as is routine for other kinds of derivatives. Currently most default swaps, a form of insurance against default by bond issuers, are traded directly between issuers like investment banks and buyers like hedge funds. A clearinghouse would allow regulators to see who is buying and selling the swaps, which some politicians, including the leaders of Greece and Germany, have blamed for inflaming the Greek debt crisis.

HEADLINE: Closing an Auto Plant: Toyota's Side of the Story

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Toyota objects to the picture of the situation at the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. plant in Fremont, Calif., that Bob Herbert presents (''Workers Crushed by Toyota,'' column, March 16). 
 He asserts that NUMMI, a 50-50 joint venture between Toyota and General Motors, remains an economically feasible operation. General Motors' decision last June to cease ordering vehicles from this already struggling joint venture severely undermined the economic viability of NUMMI.
 Mr. Herbert does not mention NUMMI's high business, supplier and logistics costs relative to Toyota's 13 wholly owned North American facilities, or the impact of the 30 percent market decline on Toyota's operations. This downturn is even more severe for framed trucks like the Tacoma manufactured by NUMMI.
 Toyota has voluntarily committed approximately $280 million to pay for bonuses for NUMMI's 4,700 team members, while G.M. and Motors Liquidation Company are not contributing anything at all -- even though NUMMI team members produced more than one million G.M. vehicles since 1985.
 We have always based our relations with team members and suppliers on a philosophy of mutual trust and respect. While we regret the difficult but necessary decision to end our production contract with NUMMI, it's clear that we have done our part to help ensure a smooth transition for NUMMI team members.

HEADLINE: A Ruinous Meltdown

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
A story that is not getting nearly enough attention is the ruinous fiscal meltdown occurring in state after state, all across the country.
 Taxes are being raised. Draconian cuts in services are being made. Public employees are being fired. The tissue-thin national economic recovery is being undermined. And in many cases, the most vulnerable populations -- the sick, the elderly, the young and the poor -- are getting badly hurt.
 Arizona, struggling with a projected $2.6 billion budget shortfall, took the drastic step of scrapping its Children's Health Insurance Program. That left nearly 47,000 low-income children with no coverage at all. Gov. Jan Brewer is also calling for an increase in the sales tax. She said, ''Arizona is navigating its way through the largest state budget deficit in its long history.'' 
 In New Jersey, the newly elected governor, Chris Christie, has proposed a series of budget cuts that, among other things, would result in public schools receiving $820 million less in state aid than they had received in the prior school year. Some well-off districts would have their direct school aid cut off altogether. Poorer districts that rely almost entirely on state aid would absorb the biggest losses in terms of dollars. They're bracing for a terrible hit.
 For all the happy talk about ''no child left behind,'' the truth is that in Arizona and New Jersey and dozens of other states trying to cope with the fiscal disaster brought on by the Great Recession, millions of children are being left far behind, and many millions of adults as well.
 ''We've talked in the past about revenue declines in a recession,'' said Jon Shure of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, ''but I think you have to call this one a revenue collapse. In proportional terms, there has never been a drop in state revenues like we're seeing now since people started to keep track of state revenues. We're in unchartered territory when it comes to the magnitude of the impact.''
 Massachusetts, which has made a series of painful cuts over the past two years, is gearing up for more. Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, told The Boston Globe: ''There's no end to the bad news here. The state fiscal situation is already so dire that any additional bad news is magnified.''
 California has cut billions of dollars from its education system, including its renowned network of public colleges and universities. Many thousands of teachers have been let go. Budget officials travel the state with a glazed look in their eyes, having tried everything they can think of to balance the state budget. And still the deficits persist. 
 In the first two months of this year, state and local governments across the U.S. cut 45,000 jobs. Additional layoffs are expected as states move ahead with their budgets for fiscal 2011. Increasingly these budgets, instead of helping people, are hurting them, undermining the quality of their lives, depriving them of educational opportunities, preventing them from accessing desperately needed medical care, and so on. 
 The federal government has tried to help, but much more assistance is needed.
 These are especially tough times for young people. ''What we're seeing now in Arizona and potentially in New Jersey and other states spells long-term trouble for the nation's children,'' said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a pediatrician who is president of the Children's Health Fund in New York and a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. 
 ''We're looking at all these cuts in human services -- in health care, in education, in after-school programs, in juvenile justice. This all points to a very grim future for these children who seem to be taking the brunt of this financial crisis.''
 Dr. Redlener issued a warning nearly a year ago about the ''frightening'' toll the recession was taking on children. He told me last April, ''We are seeing the emergence of what amounts to a 'recession generation.' ''
 The impact of the recession on everyone, of whatever age, is only made worse when states trying to balance their budgets focus too intently on cutting services as opposed to a mix of service cuts and revenue-raising measures.
 As Mr. Shure of the Center on Budget noted, ''The cruel irony is that in a recession like this, the people's needs go up at the same time that the states' ability to meet those needs goes down.''
 Budget cuts also tend to weaken rather than strengthen a state's economy, especially when they entail furloughs or layoffs. Government spending stimulates an economy in recession. And wise spending is an investment in everyone's quality of life.
 All states have been rocked by the Great Recession. And most have tried to cope with a reasonable mix of budget cuts and tax increases, or other revenue-raising measures. Those that rely too heavily on cuts are making guaranteed investments in human misery.

HEADLINE: One Subject Pushes Talk of Any Other to the Margins

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One weekend last month, American forces drove into the Marja area of southern Afghanistan, opening the biggest military operation of the Obama presidency. In the five weeks since then, President Obama has made 38 speeches, statements or other public remarks and never once mentioned the operation.
 In fact, amid roughly 100,000 words uttered in these mostly scripted events during that period, the terms ''Taliban,'' ''Marja'' and ''terrorist'' have never passed his lips. Nor has he had anything to say about settlement construction in East Jerusalem, militants in Pakistan or terrorist trials in New York. By contrast, he has used the words ''health,'' ''insurance'' or some variation of those terms more than 800 times. 
 The battle over health care in recent weeks has consumed Mr. Obama's presidency, not to mention the rest of the nation's capital, overshadowing virtually every other issue, foreign and domestic. Although his administration and Congress continue to work in other areas, like immigration, energy and jobs, by and large the nation's leadership has been so fixated on health care that it would be easy to think it is the only issue of real import.
 Mr. Obama's decision to put off his trip to Indonesia and Australia to lobby for health care has undercut his own argument that he was paying attention to the region after his predecessor supposedly neglected it. And even some Democrats worry that his failure to talk about Afghanistan misses an opportunity to rally the public behind the war effort and to express support for the dangerous work of the troops.
 ''He's concerned about health care -- it's his major challenge and I understand that,'' said Representative Ike Skelton, a Missouri Democrat and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ''But at the end of the day, if Al Qaeda can pull off another one, you'll have a bunch of dead Americans. That worries me. We're playing hard ball over there. We're playing for keeps.''
 The president, of course, still spends time behind the scenes monitoring Afghanistan and weighing in on other policy matters. Aides said his personal engagement with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia in recent days appears to have broken through a logjam holding up a new arms control treaty. And advisers are juggling negotiations with lawmakers on matters like the handling of terror suspects.
 But presidential travel and the bully pulpit are vital tools used to send messages internationally and command attention at home, and Mr. Obama has chosen in the last couple months to focus those tools largely on his campaign for health care legislation.
 All of which may be the smart use of his limited time and public voice, given how critical health care has become to his presidency. If he had left on Sunday for Jakarta and Canberra as the central domestic project of his term fell apart in the Capitol, it would have been seen by many as a strategic mistake. As it was, Democratic lawmakers were unhappy that he kept the trip on the schedule as long as he did, given the do-or-die nature of the debate.
 But the decision to delay the trip until June came just days after the White House described it as vital because, as one official told reporters, ''America has been somewhat absent from the region over the last several years and we are committed to re-establishing that leadership.''
 Now America, or at least the president, will be absent from the region for another three months. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said regional alliances ''are critical to America's security and economic progress, but passage of health insurance reform is of paramount importance.'' Other aides said the Indonesian and Australian governments recognized it would be better to delay until a time when the president would not be distracted by events back home.
 Still, Michael J. Green, who was the top Asia adviser to President George W. Bush, said that Asian governments were frustrated by the lack of progress by Mr. Obama in advancing trade. ''They can sense that health care has absolutely sucked all the oxygen out of the room,'' Mr. Green said.
 The lack of public attention on Afghanistan has bothered some who otherwise support Mr. Obama's policy. In the 38 speeches and public remarks since the battle for Marja began, Mr. Obama mentioned ''Afghanistan'' four times, always in passing -- once to acknowledge an Afghan woman attending an International Women's Day event and three times to thank visiting Irish and Greek prime ministers for troops and police officers serving there. 
 Other than health care, the main topics in that time have been jobs, energy and education. (The count covers remarks posted on the White House Web site, not interviews, which generally are not released by the president's staff.)
 Supporters of the Afghan effort said it was important for the president to explain to the public what the United States is doing there. Peter D. Feaver, a former national security aide to Mr. Bush, said Mr. Obama risks sending the message that ''his heart's not in it.'' Mr. Feaver added, ''Even if it's an unfair inference, and I think it probably is an unfair inference, it's one the allies will be happy to glom onto for their own interests.''
 But Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton, who is retired from the Army and is now a senior adviser at the National Security Network, a group advocating a ''progressive national security'' policy, said Mr. Obama's silence should not be overinterpreted. ''We say he's a wartime president, but he has so much on his plate right now,'' he said. ''I'm not offended that a particular topic like health care has sucked up all the oxygen in Washington, D.C.''

HEADLINE: Renewed Support for an Everglades Land Deal, but Cost Is Still in Question

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Gov. Charlie Crist reaffirmed his commitment this week to the $536 million purchase of 73,000 acres of land from United States Sugar, declaring that it would heal both the Everglades and the coastal estuaries that are vital to Florida's tourist economy. 
 But with its original plan to borrow money for the deal being questioned by internal auditors, the state water district responsible for the acquisition has begun to explore alternatives that could require severe cuts to restoration projects already in motion -- and the sale of a reservoir -- or a renegotiated, smaller purchase. 
 ''I buy into the deal and the vision because I think it's the right thing,'' said Eric Buermann, chairman of the advisory board at the South Florida Water Management District. ''What I'm struggling with now is the financial part of it.''
 District officials are essentially assessing risk: how much can the agency stretch to pay for potential future benefits, without putting the present at risk? 
 The water district has a complicated mission. Formed in 1949, it represents the interests of 16 counties that support it with property taxes. In return, it accepts responsibility for ''balancing and improving water quality, flood control, natural systems and water supply.'' 
 Everglades restoration became an important component in 2000, when the district became the lead agency for the largest environmental restoration effort ever attempted. But with fickle weather and a complicated system of canals, pumps, lakes and artificial marshes, the district struggles with protecting its residents and nature. 
 There are a handful of worst-case events that it is trying to avoid. 
 In one, cutbacks to current water-quality projects as a result of the cost of the land acquisition would lead to a level of pollution in the Everglades that violates court-mandated agreements. Another would involve a flood, caused or aggravated by outdated equipment that could not be upgraded because of the deal. 
 The question is, what can be cut with the biggest financial gains and smallest risk? 
 Some decisions have already been made; construction on the 16,000-acre A-1 reservoir on the northeastern edge of the Everglades has been suspended. But more tough choices are expected. An internal budget document earlier this month listed 15 possible operating reductions, along with several potential land sales. 
 Mr. Buermann called the document ''budgetary war games'' that did not necessarily reflect what might actually happen. It is nonetheless an outline of the potential costs of the deal, to the Everglades and to the district's broader mission. 
 The biggest item is the L-8 reservoir, which the district estimates it would be able to sell for $250 million. Critics including Dexter Lehtinen, a lawyer for the Miccosukee Tribe -- whose members live in the Everglades -- maintain that if it were sold, water from the reservoir would go to support future residential development in Palm Beach County, rather than the wildlife refuge it was intended for. 
 There are also millions of dollars in cuts to projects intended to help the estuaries Governor Crist toured this week while promoting the deal. ''It's the result of overpaying'' for the United States Sugar property, Mr. Lehtinen said. ''It's the result from putting conceptual metaphysical benefits ahead of real benefits.''
 Mr. Buermann, Governor Crist and environmentalists all denied that the price for the land is too high, though independent appraisers found it to be at least double the current market value. Karl Wickstrom, coordinator of the Rivers Coalition Defense Fund, said the effect of the potential cutbacks from the high price was ''not much,'' compared with the potential benefits from projects on the land to be acquired. 
 But some of that land may end up on the chopping block, too. Three United States Sugar parcels that the budget document says are worth $127 million are listed as candidates for ''sizing down.'' District officials have said that all of the land they were buying was vital for restoration, but in an interview on Friday, Mr. Buermann acknowledged that some parcels were better than others. 
 If the district had bargained for a lower price -- United States Sugar entered negotiations at one of the most financially difficult times in its history -- the district might have had an easier time paying for it all. Its list of potential cutbacks might be shorter, too. Instead, Mr. Buermann said, the district may have to narrow its ambitions. 
 ''We do want the land,'' he said. ''But whether we can or should at this point buy all of the 73,000 acres is probably going to be subject of negotiation.''

HEADLINE: Saints Preserve Us

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
On Friday, as Democrats were flopping around madly over the upcoming vote on health care, Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted brightly that it was the feast of St. Joseph the Worker, ''where we remember and pray to St. Joseph to benefit the workers of America. And that's exactly what our health care bill will do.'' 
 A blogger instantly retorted that it was actually the feast of St. Joseph, Husband of Mary. ''The Feast of St. Joseph the Worker is May 1,'' Scott Richert wrote on About.com. 
 ''The way she sees it is -- this is the same St. Joseph,'' said a spokesman for the speaker of the House. 
 The moral here is that nothing about health care reform is easy. Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
 As the House prepared for its big, historic, achingly close vote on Sunday, the joys of being undecided seemed so great that legislators kept jumping on the fence, just to feel the love. After all, Representative Dennis Kucinich got four meetings with the president and a trip on Air Force One. Dennis Kucinich! 
 A congressman from South Boston, who supported the bill but opposed including a public option last time around, announced that he was now voting against the bill because it lacks a public option. Others suddenly discovered that their states had unmet needs. President Obama made yet another postponement of his Asia trip and invited the entire House Democratic caucus to the White House Saturday, which qualifies as possibly the worst way to spend your weekend in the history of the world. 
 On Sunday, the House is expected to finally vote on the bill that the Senate approved on Christmas Eve after a debate so endless that the wiped-out majority leader, Harry Reid, initially voted ''no'' by mistake. If it passes, it theoretically goes to the president. In the real Congressional world, there are still major complications involving a second bill making changes in the first one, under parliamentary procedures so abstract that they verge on the metaphysical.
 That would bounce back to the Senate, where the Republicans are vowing to find some way to stretch the process out even longer. (Friday was also the feast of St. Pancharius, a Roman senator who was beheaded by the emperor in 303. No matter how bad it gets, this is not be the sort of thing we want to encourage.) 
 Nevertheless, Sunday feels as if it's going to be the critical moment, and if the House votes yes, it will be kind of incredible.
 We live in an era in which the power of the new hypermedia is so intense and politics so rabid that it's almost impossible for Congress to do anything more difficult than tax cuts or highway construction. Yet, here's this huge, complicated, controversial reform -- bigger than any domestic program in decades. 
 If it passes, the short-term political consequences are unknowable. But in 10 years, people will look back in amazement that we once lived in a time when Americans couldn't get health care coverage if they were sick, when insurance companies could cut off your benefits for being sick, and when run-of-the-mill serious illnesses routinely destroyed families' financial security.
 And if it passes, Barack Obama will have validated his presidency. 
 He came into office on the wave of hope so enormous there was no way he was not going to disappoint. He broke promises -- we still remember that one about holding health care negotiations on C-Span. He sure failed to deliver on that more respectful, bipartisan spirit in Washington. He seemed, day to day, so much less Obama-like than the guy who made people faint at campaign rallies.
 But the core qualities that got him elected were his coolness under pressure and the sense that he would never stop fighting for change. No matter what you think of it, this health care bill is one heck of a change. And no matter what you think of the White House strategy, Obama has been incredibly tenacious in pushing for it.
 All year, his party has been begging him to drop health care and do something about jobs -- or more specifically, give the impression of doing something about jobs. The government has only so much power to stimulate the economy. And even at the height of his postelection power, Obama could only get a medium-size stimulus bill through the Senate. 
 What many Democrats really wanted was just a change of conversation -- away from the complicated, frustrating subject of health care to rewarding fights for proposals that would embarrass the Republicans even if they didn't pass, and small, symbolic programs that would be the 2010 equivalent of supporting public school uniforms. Plus lots of photo-ops at construction sites.
 He stuck to his guns. Speech after speech, phone call after phone call, sit-down with one frightened or greedy or confused legislator after another, he kept on the case. ''Do not quit. Do not give up,'' he told yet another rally on Friday. ''We are going to get this done.''
 This weekend, we'll see. But the man gets points for trying.

HEADLINE: Likely Successor Emerges To Lead U.S. Forces in Iraq

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The leading candidate to succeed Gen. Ray Odierno as the top American commander in Iraq is Lloyd J. Austin III, an Army lieutenant general who has done two tours in Iraq and currently serves as a senior aide to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior military and civilian officials say. 
 Acting on the recommendation of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, President Obama has asked General Odierno to extend his tour in Baghdad until September. That means that General Odierno will be in charge when the United States reduces its troop level to 50,000 in August and officially proclaims the end to its combat mission in Iraq. 
 But the next phase of the American presence in Iraq will involve an array of challenges. Not only does the American command need to train and support Iraqi forces, which continue to struggle with bombings and insurgent attacks, but it faces a series of other problems, including tensions between Arabs and Kurds and Iran's attempts to extend its influence in Iraq -- all while Iraqi politicians struggle to form a new government after recent parliamentary elections. 
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has said that the Obama administration's Iraq legacy will depend in part on whether a stable and representative Iraqi government takes hold after American troops leave, adding to the importance of American efforts to help the Iraqi government improve its ability to deliver goods and services, develop the economy and establish the rule of law. 
 General Austin has the reputation of an operationally proficient officer with a well-prepared staff. He has led troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and was awarded the Silver Star, one of the Army's most important combat decorations. The officials who discussed his candidacy spoke on the condition of anonymity about a decision that has not formally been made. 
 A physically imposing officer who served in the 82nd Airborne Division, he has kept a lower profile and is more reserved than many of his peers. 
 The job of top American commander, however, requires special skills: engaging Iraqi political leaders and government ministers and encouraging Iraqi efforts to improve the governing of their country. To some who have served in Iraq, General Austin is a safe choice, but lacks the luster of a Gen. David H. Petraeus, who oversaw the so-called surge in Iraq, valued free-thinking advisers and helped pressure Iraqi leaders to make good on military and political promises. 
 But Gen. Jack Keane, the retired vice chief of the Army and a mentor to General Petraeus, said General Austin was well suited to the new role. ''For most of these guys, when they take a job it is the first time they have to take on these responsibilities,'' General Keane said. ''That is just the nature of the hierarchy. But has he had the proper preparation? Absolutely. The same thing was true for Ray Odierno. He had the corps under Petraeus and then had to step up and do a job that was more geopolitical than tactical and operational.''
 Administration officials said the post would continue to be a four-star position. 
 The Pentagon had a number of potential choices. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the vice chief of staff of the Army, was a logical candidate. He has long stressed that economic and political progress is essential for the military effort to stabilize Iraq. He served as the leader of the multinational corps in Iraq in 2006 and did an earlier stint in Baghdad as the commander of the First Cavalry Division. But keeping General Chiarelli, who is widely seen as effective as the Army's second-ranking officer, in his current position would provide continuity as Gen. George W. Casey Jr. approaches the end of term as Army chief of staff in 2011. 
 Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the leader of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, seemed to be another possibility. Known to have impressed Mr. Gates during a stint as acting commander of American forces in the Middle East, he oversaw efforts to train the Iraqi Army from September 2005 to June 2007. Like General Odierno, he is seen as a candidate to succeed General Casey. 
 General Austin was the assistant commander of the Third Infantry Division, which marched to Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. From February 2008 to April 2009, he led the multinational corps as the second-ranking officer in Iraq and the day-to-day commander of coalition forces. It was a tumultuous period that included Prime Minister Nuri Kamal el-Maliki's push to take control of Basra -- mounted with little advance notice to the United States but requiring considerable American support -- and an American-Iraqi effort to take control of Sadr City in Baghdad. 
 Last year, General Austin took over from Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, now the top American commander in Afghanistan, as director of the Joint Staff, the military staff that works for Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. General Austin has been the commander of the 10th Mountain Division, which served as the nucleus of a task force in Afghanistan. He is a West Point graduate. 
 General Odierno's next assignment has not been made public. Some officials said he was likely to lead the Joint Forces Command, based in Norfolk, Va. He is also regarded as one of the candidates for the posts of Army chief of staff, vice chief of staff or chairman of the Joint Chiefs

CORRECTION-DATE: March 25, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Saturday about Lt. Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III as the leading candidate to succeed Gen. Ray Odierno as the top American commander in Iraq misspelled the surname of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is Adm. Mike Mullen -- not Mullin.

HEADLINE: Scouting Out Dank Alleys and Corporate Wastelands

 BODY:
Each week on the City Room blog, editors select a New Yorker to answer readers' questions. Here are excerpts from last week's Q. and A. with Nick Carr, who has worked for the past five years as a film location scout in New York and who runs the Web site ScoutingNY.com. 
 Next week, Michele LoBianco, who teaches ''Recession Proofing Your Career'' at NYU's School of Continuing and Professional Studies, will respond to questions about career transition and career change in New York. 
 Q. When approached with a location request, how often do you think, ''I know just the place,'' versus ''I need to hit the road and actively look''? 
 Jeff Keesee
 A. While I rarely feel confident to say I know a perfect place, I usually have a pretty good idea of where to start. Most screenplays shooting in New York are almost guaranteed to have the usual array of locations we've all scouted for again and again -- office building, luxury apartment, apartment with view of the elevated subway train, dank alley, etc. -- and within the locations department, we pool a list of ''film-friendly'' options we know from experience to start our search with. If the director passes on those, we do more research, eventually going neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street. 
 Personally, my favorite locations to scout for are those that don't come readily to mind. I had to scout old train cars on one film, which took me to a collector in New Jersey who owns dozens of beautiful old cars. On another film, I was asked to find a castle to stand in for medieval England -- you'd be surprised how many great options there are within an hour of New York!
 Q. What's the best abandoned place in New York City you've discovered in your travels? (And is it still there?)
 L. W. A. A few favorites: First, I love the building at 4 East 43rd in the heart of Midtown that is thankfully being saved in the next few years. Fort Totten in Queens, a former Army post, has some amazing properties, including a farmhouse in sorry shape. Staten Island's Sea View Hospital also has some impressive ruins that have been dying for decades now. And the state of the old Boyce Thompson Institute in Yonkers is tragic.
 But my favorite ''almost-abandoned'' property is Alder Manor in Yonkers: the inside is incredible, with a second-floor indoor pool and a main level that seems to re-create the Clue board game layout. 
 I have to be honest: When I first started scouting, all I wanted to do was get into as many abandoned places as possible. After seeing a few, the mystique quickly wore off, and I started to see them for what they are: once beautiful, vibrant buildings that have been left, forgotten, to die a slow, painful death. Sounds melodramatic, but when you see the typical modern construction in New York, it's pretty depressing. 
 Q. How does one become a film location scout? What would you recommend to people who feel they know most nooks and crannies in the city and would be interested in this career?
 Sarah K. 
 A. Call the New York City Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, and ask for a list of movies currently shooting in the city. Then, send off resumes and brief cover letters addressed to the locations department of each film saying you would like to get some locations experience, and are interested in working as either a locations production assistant (on-set position doing mainly grunt work) or a locations coordinator (office job dealing with contracts, scheduling, billing, etc.). 
 These are the two typical entry jobs into locations, and while you won't be scouting in either position, you will learn a lot about how a movie works, what requirements are needed for a shooting location (easily as important as having a grasp of New York), and make valuable contacts. Once you're in the film world network and have shown that you're a reliable employee, the job offers will continue, and you'll soon be scouting. 
 Q. Have you ever found yourself in any danger while out scouting? Details, please!
 Mary V. A. I've never been directly threatened, thankfully, though I've run into my share of questionable situations. A few years ago, I went to scout a large rundown building in East New York looking for an apartment with a view of the elevated subway train. I had spoken with the landlord, who assured me that I could photograph any of the apartments, and that they'd be very open to filming. 
 Only problem was, he hadn't told any of the tenants. To make matters worse, it was a freezing winter day, and the heat had gone out in the building. The landlord took me around the building, literally unlocking doors at random and telling me to go in while tenants screamed at us for barging in, and hey, what the hell happened to the heat? The landlord just ignored them as if they weren't even there, calmly telling me to take pictures of whatever I wanted as they hollered at us to get out. 
 Needless to say, we didn't film there. 
 Q. I work on Water Street and John, across from what still is, but no longer identifies itself as, the A.I.G. building. Frequently assembled there are the various trucks you see at movie shoots, yet I can't imagine what fascination this area would hold for anyone; and it only becomes more of a corporate wasteland as you proceed down Water, toward the Battery. What are they doing here?
 Red Olent 
 A. I wish there was a more exciting answer, but Water Street just happens to be the largest and most permit-friendly place to park trucks when shooting in Wall Street, the South Street Seaport or the Battery. 
 As a side note, if a shoot is in fact looking for a corporate wasteland-type building, the Battery actually has some of the best options in the city. The width of the street allows enough space to actually step back and get the entire thing into the frame, whereas you less commonly see more than a piece of anything farther uptown.

HEADLINE: Academic Paper in China Sets Off Alarms in U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF and DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
It came as a surprise this month to Wang Jianwei, a graduate engineering student in Liaoning, China, that he had been described as a potential cyberwarrior before the United States Congress. 
 Larry M. Wortzel, a military strategist and China specialist, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 10 that it should be concerned because ''Chinese researchers at the Institute of Systems Engineering of Dalian University of Technology published a paper on how to attack a small U.S. power grid sub-network in a way that would cause a cascading failure of the entire U.S.''
 When reached by telephone, Mr. Wang said he and his professor had indeed published ''Cascade-Based Attack Vulnerability on the U.S. Power Grid'' in an international journal called Safety Science last spring. But Mr. Wang said he had simply been trying to find ways to enhance the stability of power grids by exploring potential vulnerabilities. 
 ''We usually say 'attack' so you can see what would happen,'' he said. ''My emphasis is on how you can protect this. My goal is to find a solution to make the network safer and better protected.'' And independent American scientists who read his paper said it was true: Mr. Wang's work was a conventional technical exercise that in no way could be used to take down a power grid. 
 The difference between Mr. Wang's explanation and Mr. Wortzel's conclusion is of more than academic interest. It shows that in an atmosphere already charged with hostility between the United States and China over cybersecurity issues, including large-scale attacks on computer networks, even a misunderstanding has the potential to escalate tension and set off an overreaction. 
 ''Already people are interpreting this as demonstrating some kind of interest that China would have in disrupting the U.S. power grid,'' said Nart Villeneuve, a researcher with the SecDev Group, an Ottawa-based cybersecurity research and consulting group. ''Once you start interpreting every move that a country makes as hostile, it builds paranoia into the system.''
 Mr. Wortzel's presentation at the House hearing got a particularly strong reaction from Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California, who called the flagging of the Wang paper ''one thing I think jumps out to all of these Californians here today, or should.'' 
 He was alluding to concerns that arose in 2001 when The Los Angeles Times reported that intrusions into the network that controlled the electrical grid were traced to someone in Guangdong Province, China. Later reports of other attacks often included allegations that the break-ins were orchestrated by the Chinese, although no proof has been produced.
 In an interview last week about the Wang paper and his testimony, Mr. Wortzel said that the intention of these particular researchers almost did not matter. 
 ''My point is that now that vulnerability is out there all over China for anybody to take advantage of,'' he said. 
 But specialists in the field of network science, which explores the stability of networks like power grids and the Internet, said that was not the case. 
 ''Neither the authors of this article, nor any other prior article, has had information on the identity of the power grid components represented as nodes of the network,'' Reka Albert, a University of Pennsylvania physicist who has conducted similar studies, said in an e-mail interview. ''Thus no practical scenarios of an attack on the real power grid can be derived from such work.''
 The issue of Mr. Wang's paper aside, experts in computer security say there are genuine reasons for American officials to be wary of China, and they generally tend to dismiss disclaimers by China that it has neither the expertise nor the intention to carry out the kind of attacks that bombard American government and computer systems by the thousands every week. 
 The trouble is that it is so easy to mask the true source of a computer network attack that any retaliation is fraught with uncertainty. This is why a war of words, like the high-pitched one going on these past months between the United States and China, holds special peril, said John Arquilla, director of the Information Operations Center at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.
 ''What we know from network science is that dense communications across many different links and many different kinds of links can have effects that are highly unpredictable,'' Mr. Arquilla said. Cyberwarfare is in some ways ''analogous to the way people think about biological weapons -- that once you set loose such a weapon it may be very hard to control where it goes,'' he added.
 Tension between China and the United States intensified earlier this year after Google threatened to withdraw from doing business in China, saying that it had evidence of Chinese involvement in a sophisticated Internet intrusion. A number of reports, including one last October by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, of which Mr. Wortzel is vice chairman, have used strong language about the worsening threat of computer attacks, particularly from China. 
 ''A large body of both circumstantial and forensic evidence strongly indicates Chinese state involvement in such activities, whether through the direct actions of state entities or through the actions of third-party groups sponsored by the state,'' that report stated. 
 Mr. Wang's research subject was particularly unfortunate because of the widespread perception, particularly among American military contractors and high-technology firms, that adversaries are likely to attack critical infrastructure like the United States electric grid. 
 Mr. Wang said in the interview that he chose the United States grid for his study basically because it was the easiest way to go. China does not publish data on power grids, he said. The United States does and had had several major blackouts; and, as he reads English, it was the only country he could find with accessible, useful data. He said that he was an ''emergency events management'' expert and that he was ''mainly studying when a point in a network becomes ineffective.''
 ''I chose the electricity system because the grid can best represent how power currents flow through a network,'' he said. ''I just wanted to do theoretical research.''
 The paper notes the vulnerability of different types of computer networks to ''intentional'' attacks. The authors suggest that certain types of attacks may generate a domino-style cascading collapse of an entire network. ''It is expected that our findings will be helpful for real-life networks to protect the key nodes selected effectively and avoid cascading-failure-induced disasters,'' the authors wrote.
 Mr. Wang's paper cites the network science research of Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, a physicist at Northeastern University. Dr. Barabasi has written widely on the potential vulnerability of networks to so-called engineered attacks.
 ''I am not well vested in conspiracy theories,'' Dr. Barabasi said in an interview, ''but this is a rather mainstream topic that is done for a wide range of networks, and, even in the area of power transmission, is not limited to the U.S. system -- there are similar studies for power grids all over the world.''

THE MAKING OF AFRICAN AMERICA
 The Four Great Migrations
 By Ira Berlin
 304 pp. Viking. $27.95
 My parents bought their first house in 1960, six years after emigrating from Ireland. They'd grown up with a fierce sense of place -- of land, family, history -- and they were determined to recreate that sense for their children. That little house in the middle of a nondescript block on Detroit's East Side was going to be their home forever. 
 It didn't work out that way. In the early 1970s the first African-American couple moved into the neighborhood. They were young teachers, I think, though I don't remember that anyone asked them. Immediately the ''for sale'' signs began to appear, one or two at first, then more and more until the panic was complete. Within a year or so whites were selling their homes for whatever they could get, running for the suburbs as fast as they could. My parents waited awhile before joining the rush. They sold their house in 1977, their cherished sense of place swept aside by the terrible power of race. 
 I kept thinking of them as I read Ira Berlin's majestic new history, ''The Making of African America: The Four Great Migrations.'' Over the course of his distinguished career teaching history at the University of Maryland, Berlin has redefined our understanding of American slavery. In this relatively thin book he goes a step further. It's time, he says, to reconceptualize the entire African-American experience from the 1600s to the present -- to set aside the long dominant ''slavery to freedom'' narrative, the story of a people moving slowly but inexorably toward equality, and to put in its place what Berlin calls a ''contrapuntal narrative'' of ''movement and place, fluidity and fixity,'' the story of a people uprooted and searching for home.
 Berlin builds this new narrative around four massive migrations: the horrific trans-Atlantic passage that brought slavery to North America in the 17th and 18th centuries; the forced movement of a million slaves from the East Coast to the inland South's cotton kingdom in the early 1800s; the Great Migration of six million African-Americans from the South to the urban North in the first half of the 20th century; and the current influx of immigrants from Africa, South America and the Caribbean, a movement so large that in the last decade of the 20th century it accounted for a quarter of black America's population growth. 
 Each of the migrations followed a similar pattern, Berlin says. They were triggered by the inexorable demand for labor: planters needed slaves to work their fields; Northern factories needed men and women to work the machines; today, the service economy needs cab drivers, doctors, domestics and software engineers. The movements shattered longstanding relationships and traditional patterns of behavior, often violently, sometimes under the sheer weight of distance. 
 But African-Americans gradually claimed the new ground as their own, building on it new families, new churches, new forms of artistic expression, even new identities. This process of reconstruction, in turn, fostered an intense attachment to the places they had remade. After Emancipation, Northern officials were surprised to see that most freedmen didn't move far from where they'd been enslaved. But as one group of African-Americans explained, they weren't about to leave ''land they had laid their fathers' bones upon.'' 
 Berlin readily admits that by stressing the interplay of movement and place, destruction and restoration, he's putting African-American history within the broader story of American immigration. The labor market dictated the movement of Poles, Italians, Mexicans and Filipinos as much as it did for Africans and their descendants; even those fleeing persecution or famine wouldn't have come to the United States if they didn't think they could find work. These newcomers invariably felt the old ways slipping away from them, though sometimes they were happy to let them go. 
 Most immigrants eventually managed to construct new lives, drawing on, and different from, the ones they left behind. And they often clung tenaciously to whatever fragment of America they'd claimed for themselves. In 1862 a Union officer marching through the South claimed that blacks were ''more attached to familiar places'' than any other people in the nation. Maybe he was right. Or maybe he'd never been to South Boston. 
 But Berlin also insists that the African-American experience was fundamentally different from that of other immigrant groups. It's not simply that their migration was forced rather than free. As Berlin rightly points out, immigration can't be categorized so simply: Jewish families driven from home by czarist pogroms had not become immigrants by choice. What sets the African-American story apart is the terrible strain of oppression than runs through it. Other groups suffered from discrimination, of course. But nothing comes close to matching the ferocity of racism. 
 In the book's most moving section, Berlin brilliantly evokes the horrors of the Middle Passage: the shackles, the branding irons, the decks choked with the smell of urine, feces and fear. He shows us how slavery's inland march tore black families apart, and he forces us to feel the inconsolable grief of separation. He follows the rise of systematic segregation in the late-19th-century South as it strangled the promise of independence and equality that Emancipation had created. He traces -- too quickly -- the creation of a segregated North in the first few decades of the 20th century: the way that employers pushed African-American workers into the lowest-paying, most dangerous jobs they had to offer; the way that real estate agents, bankers, insurance agents and white homeowners restricted black migrants to the most dilapidated neighborhoods, hemming them into ghettos many of them would never escape. And he touches on, though doesn't detail, the profound inequalities that continue to plague African-American communities -- poverty, segregation, incarceration -- despite the obvious triumphs of the last 40 years. Here, then, is the other piece of Berlin's contrapuntal narrative: the interweaving of African-American assertion and racist reaction, the making and remaking of America's relentless racial system.
 Not that Berlin sees victimization as the main theme of black history. ''The Making of African America'' is primarily a story of the resilience, creativity and courage African-Americans drew upon as they engaged in the difficult process of piecing together new lives in an unfamiliar land. That's my parents' story too. And more than likely, it was the story of that young black couple that moved in down the block: ordinary people looking for a decent house, a measure of security, a piece of land no matter how small, a home of their own. People like us -- except for the color of their skin. And as this brilliant book shows again and again, that made all the difference.

HEADLINE: America's Real Dream Team

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Went to a big Washington dinner last week. You know the kind: Large hall; black ties; long dresses. But this was no ordinary dinner. There were 40 guests of honor. So here's my Sunday news quiz: I'll give you the names of most of the honorees, and you tell me what dinner I was at. Ready?
 Linda Zhou, Alice Wei Zhao, Lori Ying, Angela Yu-Yun Yeung, Lynnelle Lin Ye, Kevin Young Xu, Benjamin Chang Sun, Jane Yoonhae Suh, Katheryn Cheng Shi, Sunanda Sharma, Sarine Gayaneh Shahmirian, Arjun Ranganath Puranik, Raman Venkat Nelakant, Akhil Mathew, Paul Masih Das, David Chienyun Liu, Elisa Bisi Lin, Yifan Li, Lanair Amaad Lett, Ruoyi Jiang, Otana Agape Jakpor, Peter Danming Hu, Yale Wang Fan, Yuval Yaacov Calev, Levent Alpoge, John Vincenzo Capodilupo and Namrata Anand. 
 No, sorry, it was not a dinner of the China-India Friendship League. Give up?
 O.K. All these kids are American high school students. They were the majority of the 40 finalists in the 2010 Intel Science Talent Search, which, through a national contest, identifies and honors the top math and science high school students in America, based on their solutions to scientific problems. The awards dinner was Tuesday, and, as you can see from the above list, most finalists hailed from immigrant families, largely from Asia. 
 Indeed, if you need any more convincing about the virtues of immigration, just come to the Intel science finals. I am a pro-immigration fanatic. I think keeping a constant flow of legal immigrants into our country -- whether they wear blue collars or lab coats -- is the key to keeping us ahead of China. Because when you mix all of these energetic, high-aspiring people with a democratic system and free markets, magic happens. If we hope to keep that magic, we need immigration reform that guarantees that we will always attract and retain, in an orderly fashion, the world's first-round aspirational and intellectual draft choices.
 This isn't complicated. In today's wired world, the most important economic competition is no longer between countries or companies. The most important economic competition is actually between you and your own imagination. Because what your kids imagine, they can now act on farther, faster, cheaper than ever before -- as individuals. Today, just about everything is becoming a commodity, except imagination, except the ability to spark new ideas. 
 If I just have the spark of an idea now, I can get a designer in Taiwan to design it. I can get a factory in China to produce a prototype. I can get a factory in Vietnam to mass manufacture it. I can use Amazon.com to handle fulfillment. I can use freelancer.com to find someone to do my logo and manage by backroom. And I can do all this at incredibly low prices. The one thing that is not a commodity and never will be is that spark of an idea. And this Intel dinner was all about our best sparklers.
 Before the dinner started, each contestant stood by a storyboard explaining their specific project. Namrata Anand, a 17-year-old from the Harker School in California, patiently explained to me her research, which used spectral analysis and other data to expose information about the chemical enrichment history of ''Andromeda Galaxy.'' I did not understand a word she said, but I sure caught the gleam in her eye.
 My favorite chat, though, was with Amanda Alonzo, a 30-year-old biology teacher at Lynbrook High School in San Jose, Calif. She had taught two of the finalists. When I asked her the secret, she said it was the resources provided by her school, extremely ''supportive parents'' and a grant from Intel that let her spend part of each day inspiring and preparing students to enter this contest. Then she told me this: Local San Jose realtors are running ads in newspapers in China and India telling potential immigrants to ''buy a home'' in her Lynbrook school district because it produced ''two Intel science winners.''
 Seriously, ESPN or MTV should broadcast the Intel finals live. All of the 40 finalist are introduced, with little stories about their lives and aspirations. Then the winners of the nine best projects are announced. And finally, with great drama, the overall winner of the $100,000 award for the best project of the 40 is identified. This year it was Erika Alden DeBenedictis of New Mexico for developing a software navigation system that would enable spacecraft to more efficiently ''travel through the solar system.'' After her name was called, she was swarmed by her fellow competitor-geeks.
 Gotta say, it was the most inspiring evening I've had in D.C. in 20 years. It left me thinking, ''If we can just get a few things right -- immigration, education standards, bandwidth, fiscal policy -- maybe we'll be O.K.'' It left me feeling that maybe Alice Wei Zhao of North High School in Sheboygan, Wis., chosen by her fellow finalists to be their spokeswoman, was right when she told the audience: ''Don't sweat about the problems our generation will have to deal with. Believe me, our future is in good hands.'' 
 As long as we don't shut our doors.

HEADLINE: The Case For Financial Reinvention

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
IT'S painfully clear that the financial crisis that began in late 2008 shook the foundations of American capitalism. But what really caused the crisis, and how can recurrences be prevented? 
 In their provocative and refreshing book, ''The Road From Ruin: How to Revive Capitalism and Put America Back on Top'' (Crown Business, $27), Matthew Bishop and Michael Green blame ''toxic ideas'' rather than ''toxic assets,'' and call for a fundamental reinvention of the free-market system.
 ''The years that preceded the crisis were dominated by a set of ideas that celebrated the wisdom of markets,'' the authors say, later adding: ''The bust has pushed an alternative set of ideas to the forefront that call for comprehensive intervention in financial markets and bigger government. Working out which of these ideas are toxic and could poison our future prosperity is the most urgent, and difficult, challenge we face.'' 
 Mr. Bishop and Mr. Green are both British and have obvious affection for America. A former faculty member of the London Business School, Mr. Bishop is the United States business editor of The Economist. Mr. Green, who taught economics at the University of Warsaw and served in the British government, is a former New York bureau chief of the magazine. The two are also authors of a 2008 book, ''Philanthrocapitalism: How Giving Can Save the World.''
 They are also unabashed admirers of John Maynard Keynes, widely known for advocating government intervention and deficit spending during economic crises. And they praise Adam Smith, who is best known for the free-market philosophy of ''The Wealth of Nations'' but who also emphasized the importance of moral values in a lesser-known book, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments.'' 
 Mr. Bishop and Mr. Green contrast the theories of Keynes and Smith with those of contemporary, number-crunching economists who say they believe unswervingly in the so-called efficient-market hypothesis, stipulating that market forces will determine the correct price for stocks and bonds. Mr. Smith, they note, warned of the ''overweening conceit'' of human beings, while Mr. Keynes wrote of the influence of ''animal spirits'' on the economy. 
 The authors enumerate five ''wrong turns'' that they say nations are prone to make amid economic crises. Disdaining both liberal and conservative orthodoxies, they say that the following ideas, though frequently held, are just plain wrong: that financial bubbles are wholly bad, with no redeeming value; that governments must always avoid bailing out the financial sector; that crises can be solved without addressing underlying economic issues (global imbalances, in the case of the current crisis); that economies always recover naturally on their own; and that a rush to tighter regulation of financial markets will fix the problems. 
 The book is at its best in re-examining what did -- and did not -- lead various nations to ruin in the past. Mr. Bishop and Mr. Green contend, for example, that the infamous boom and bust in tulip prices in Holland in the 17th century was not an example of sheer madness. Rather, they say, it was the unfortunate upshot of the ''price-discovery process'' after the introduction of what proved to be an enduring and important financial product: the limited liability corporation. 
 ''In reality, the bubble was a blip, and the Dutch economy was barely affected, in large part because no serious effort was made to stifle financial innovation'' after prices collapsed, the authors say. 
 As for the current crisis, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Green mince no words in analyzing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. ''Capitalism as we knew it ended on Sept. 15, 2008,'' they declare in their opening sentence. They fault former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. as failing to foresee that deciding not to bail out Lehman would set off a market panic. 
 The authors say the ensuing loss of confidence prompted the huge -- and, in their minds, otherwise avoidable -- government bailouts that Mr. Paulson initiated in following days. (For his part, Mr. Paulson contends in his current book, ''On the Brink,'' that he lacked the legal authority to save Lehman.)
 MR. BISHOP and Mr. Green are a bit disappointing and not entirely original when prescribing cures for what they think ails capitalism. They warn against resurrecting regulatory measures like the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking until its repeal in 1999; they fear that such restraints would hamper the competitiveness of American banks internationally. 
 They also advocate replacing the dollar with a new world reserve currency, which they say would increase American exports and help level the playing field of international trade. That, as they concede, is an idea borrowed from Mr. Keynes. So, too, is their argument that the economy might have benefited from more government stimulus spending, and still might be helped by it. 
 Likewise, one of their big ideas is recycled from ''Philanthrocapitalism.'' This hybrid term describes a kind of enlightened capitalism currently personified, in their view, by Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett, who are giving much of their fortunes to charitable causes. Beyond that, the authors call for programs to improve financial literacy in the media and the general public, and for shareholders and institutional investors to demand that corporate managers focus on long-term success rather than on quarterly profits. 
 But if their book has its shortcomings, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Green make a persuasive case that America needs to transform its basic economic theory and practice, or the road out of our current mess will be at least as long and winding as the road that got us in it.

HEADLINE: In Search of Excitement

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
This is an excerpt from the On the Runway blog, written by Cathy Horyn, the fashion critic for The Times. You can also follow Ms. Horyn on Twitter at
 @CathyHorynNYT. 
 MARC JACOBS is again in the running for women's designer of the year from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and top accessory maker as well; his fall collection of beautiful and modest clothes makes him deserving. Ditto Donna Karan, who has sharpened up her collections in recent seasons. And Alexander Wang is fast building a brand. (The nominees for men's designer of the year are Michael Bastian, Tom Ford and David Neville and Marcus Wainwright of Rag & Bone.)
 I'm more intrigued by the contest for the Swarovski young designer award -- namely, among Prabal Gurung, Jason Wu and Joseph Altuzarra. The winner will have the personal satisfaction of being recognized by his New York peers, but a more meaningful measure of success these days is possession of a vision that excites people on an international stage, plus good business connections. Making good clothes is not enough, though it was gratifying during the economic crisis to see the level of quality in Mr. Gurung's and Mr. Altuzarra's work; they had just started their businesses. And Mr. Wu got the tip from Michelle Obama.
 But who in three or four seasons has provided the creative stretch that runway mavens look for? Whose name is mentioned quietly among European houses as someone to watch and, maybe eventually, design or advise behind the scenes? And who keeps a bit of a distance from the pack? Beyond the C.F.D.A. awards night on June 7, I would keep my eye on Mr. Altuzarra.
 From the Readers
 Only Joseph Altuzarra and Prabal Gurung are worthy to be short-listed. Very disappointing they always pick up Jacobs and Karan every year ... market and business rules dictates far too much who is the best!
 Posted by Micino, Milan
 Isabel Toledo trumps them all handily. So sad she doesn't have a big backer. Posted by Caroline, Washington, D.C.
 Can I say I just don't get it, with Altuzarra. The clothes looked like exactly the same body-con, tough girl, leather and black ''wookie'' fur thing that was, well, everywhere on the runway (particularly in Milan) last fall, and has been conspicuously covered by bloggers (particularly Tommy Ton) for a whole winter, now. And the red stitched dresses, have we forgotten the dress that made Elizabeth Hurley famous? How was it new? How did that look address the needs of the modern woman? You couldn't wear any of it to work, that's for sure.
 Posted by Jessica, Portland, Ore.
 Great list of nominees for young designer. I would be so tempted to include Sophie Theallet in that mix.
 Posted by RC, New York
 Where are all the female nominees?

HEADLINE: In Vietnam, Cauldrons on Every Corner

BYLINE: By DAVID FARLEY

 BODY:
''YOU like congealed pigs' blood?'' my travel companion asked, pulling me over to a street cart in Ho Chi Minh City. Before I could answer, two bowls of chao, a rice porridge bobbing with slices of pork sausage and cubes of coagulated blood, were plopped in our hands. 
 Pigs' blood porridge isn't something I'd normally try. I may not have even wandered over to see what was cooking in the streetside cauldron on wheels. But then again, I wasn't on this culinary trek with any ordinary traveler. I was with Michael Huynh (pronounced ''win''), a New York chef and restaurateur who was taking me on an eating tour of his native city. 
 Cooking, you might say, is in Mr. Huynh's blood. He grew up in the kitchen at his mother's restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City, which residents still call Saigon. Now 45, Mr. Huynh, who is better known by his nickname, Bao, reigns over a mini-empire of Vietnamese restaurants in New York City. In the last year alone, he's staked a claim as one of New York's most prolific chefs. (His tricks, he says, are that his menus are set at recession-friendly prices and that he can negotiate a lease in his favor.) 
 My journey with Mr. Huynh actually began thousands of miles away, at his new Lower East Side Vietnamese beer garden, Bia. During my visit -- research for my trip -- I was pleasantly surprised to find the frenetic Mr. Huynh at Bia. I asked where I should eat while in Ho Chi Minh City. ''Why don't I take you to my favorite places myself,'' he said. I thought he was joking, but it turned out he was headed to his hometown to scout locations for a new restaurant (surprise, surprise) when I was going to be there.
 Our tour, he told me when I met with him one more time before the trip, wouldn't necessarily be hitting the city's ''it'' restaurants. Instead, we would eat our way through Mr. Huynh's version of the city, stopping at the places he goes to when in town, his tried-and-true spots. 
 What Ho Chi Minh City, the country's biggest metropolis, lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in chaotic energy and, of course, in its cuisine, both of which seem to be ubiquitous. Amid an incongruent jumble of low-lying buildings, its narrow streets and tiny alleys overflow with no-frills restaurants that open onto the sidewalk and look as if they could double for someone's garage. Seemingly on every corner are portable carts powered by a gas burner and an old woman who, in many cases, is the umpteenth generation to stir that very pot. Patrons sit on low-rise stools or plastic child-size chairs in these makeshift dining spots, hunched over bowls of noodles.
 Mr. Huynh and I were to arrive the same day, but given his hectic schedule, I wasn't surprised when he called me just before I was boarding my flight to say he was coming the following day. Three days later, he finally turned up. True to his word, he wasted no time introducing me to his native city's cuisine.
 After beginning with the pig's blood porridge -- we paid less than a dollar for the two of us -- we headed for District 3, a neighborhood outside the city center. Our destination, Com Nieu Sai Gon, he told me, is beloved by locals and is increasingly on the radar of food-focused tourists. Its former owner, Madame Ngoc, became well-known with travelers after appearing on Anthony Bourdain's travel show ''No Reservations'' in 2005. Madame Ngoc has since passed on, but her restaurant continues to pack in the diners.
 Once seated, Mr. Huynh hardly glanced at the 300 or so items on the menu before spitting out a long order for our waiter. Meanwhile, the sound of shattering pots rang throughout the restaurant. The reason wasn't clumsiness. It turned out that the house specialty, rice cooked in a clay pot, is served after a ritual you aren't likely to find in New York: before serving, waiters break the clay pots and then scrape out the crispy patties of rice that remain.
 To ensure there are no lingering shards of clay, glove-clad waiters toss the rice patties across the room to each other before depositing them on diners' tables and sprinkling them with a scallion-spiked sauce. (According to Richard Sterling, a friend who lives in Ho Chi Minh City and wrote Lonely Planet's ''World Food: Vietnam,'' this is an ancient tradition in Southeast Asia, but one that is rarely performed these days.) As the baked rice landed on our table, a waiter showed me a scar on his thumb from breaking a pot, a hazard of the job.
 A few minutes later, a procession of dishes began arriving: Japanese eggplant, sauteed with enough garlic to take out a vampire; steamed blood cockles; caramelized fish hatchlings cooked in a clay pot; and lotus root salad. All were washed down with a bia da, beer with ice, a time-honored southern Vietnam tradition.
 But Mr. Huynh, I would quickly learn, never settles for just one meal. Every time we met, whether for breakfast, lunch or dinner, we'd make several stops, snacking our way down the street. Sometimes we'd slurp up a bowl of pho before he'd guide me down alleyways for one of the many variations on the theme of bun (pronounced ''boon''), a vermicelli noodle bowl filled with pork and veggies.
 Then we'd stop at a cart for sticky rice or a pork-crammed banh mi sandwich and then, finally, sit down on a sidewalk stool for a dosa-like shrimp-and-pork-stuffed banh xeo. (Whether we were eating street food or at a restaurant, the meal for two, plus a couple of beers, rarely exceeded $20.) ''The most authentic food in Saigon is at street carts and simple restaurants,'' he said during one of our multi-stop extravaganzas. 
 One day, while Mr. Huynh had a business meeting, I stopped into the Black Cat, a restaurant owned by a friend of a friend, Geoffrey Deetz, originally from the Bay Area. Over cold bottles of Vietnamese beer, he took my guide's comments a step further: ''It's more about style than substance at the new trendy restaurants,'' he said, explaining that most Vietnamese chefs have yet to successfully elevate traditional cuisine. As Vietnam's robust economy continues to grow and newly built skyscrapers devour blocks that once offered no-frills food options, finding decent dining in the central District 1 is becoming a challenge. 
 Unless, of course, you're with Mr. Huynh. The following day, he took me to Minh Duc, in the city center. The restaurant, which features simple decor and communal metal tables, offers yet another surprising form of entertainment: the open-to-the-street dining room is across a busy road from the kitchen, so while Mr. Huynh and I munched on a feast of simply prepared dishes, we watched a steady stream of tray-carrying waiters carefully play a real-life version of the classic arcade game Frogger, struggling to cross the scooter-crammed street. Once it arrived, though, the food was the real star of the show. 
 ''You can't eat like this in America,'' said Mr. Huynh, scanning the table. ''Vietnamese food is similar to Chinese, but the difference is that we cook food slower,'' he said. Case in point: the caramelized pork belly was so tender it came apart in chunks when my chopsticks hit it. The braised catfish was equally tender -- Mr. Huynh instructed me to eat the belly first, which was soft and rich and melted when it hit the tongue.
 On another night, after our usual impromptu stops at food carts for sticky rice or a glass of mung bean milk, we took a taxi out to District 10 to dine at Lang Nuong Nam Bo, one of a handful of restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City that specialize in Mekong Delta-style barbecue. Diners prepare their own meat on miniature charcoal grills at each table. Crates of beer are left at diners' feet, along with a bottle opener on the table.
 As waiters wandered by, plopping big chunks of ice in our beer mugs, we snacked on small embryonic duck eggs. Then the raw meat began arriving: wild boar, then goat breast. Mr. Huynh carefully flipped the meat on the grill until he determined it was done. Both were smoky and tender. Finally, a surprise: Mekong rat, a delicacy in the south. Mr. Huynh said he wouldn't eat it, but refused to say why, leaving the flattened, just-grilled rat on a plate staring at me. I gave it a go. There wasn't much meat, but it was edible: chewy, dark and well-charred. 
 Several beers and small mammals later, our clothes reeking of smoked meat, we paid the bill and jumped in a cab, directing the driver back to District 1. Tomorrow would be a new day, and I had a feeling that meant another marathon, eating our way through the city's chaotic food-strewn streets.

HEADLINE: Moody's and the Debt Threat

 BODY:
We were, briefly, chilled when the credit rating agencies -- Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch -- warned that they might have to downgrade the triple-A debt of the United States if it failed to bring its budget deficit under control. Then we remembered it was not too long ago that these agencies were tripping over one another to bestow triple-A ratings on many of the incomprehensible financial confections the banks crafted out of mounds of dicey mortgages. 
 That doesn't mean we shouldn't worry about the deficit. But it is a reminder that for all of their sophisticated mathematical models and financial expertise, the raters are certainly not omniscient, they are not even disinterested observers. As the Securities and Exchange Commission suggested in a 2008 report, their ratings of mortgage-backed securities were undermined by a fundamental conflict of interest: they were paid by the very same banks whose securities they rated. 
 Right now the agencies seem to be following Wall Street's new favorite meme that ''runaway government spending'' in response to the (brought to you by Wall Street) crisis represents a mortal threat to the American economy.
 Republicans are also deploying it against the Obama administration, presumably hoping voters will forget how the previous Republican administration turned a budget surplus of 2.4 percent of the nation's gross domestic product into a deficit of 3.2 percent of G.D.P., or how the world economy nearly imploded on their watch. 
 The nation's leaders will have to deal with the long-term budget imbalances. But focusing on it now is exactly the wrong course. With consumers and businesses shocked into sudden frugality, the only thing that has saved us from a real depression has been government stimulus spending. With unemployment still near 10 percent, we need more such spending, not less. 
 We also suspect the downgrade will never happen since downgrading the United States would probably require downgrading all the American banks -- the agencies' main clients. 
 Even if it did, it is hard to envisage that it would have a huge impact. Despite all the concern expressed by raters, Republicans and Wall Street talking heads, the yields on Treasury bonds are at their lowest levels in 30 or 40 years. Investors still seem to trust the Treasury more than they do the raters.

 BODY:
THE MEDIA RELATIONS DEPARTMENT OF HIZBOLLAH WISHES YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY: Unexpected Encounters in the Changing Middle East, by Neil MacFarquhar. (PublicAffairs, $15.95.) MacFarquhar, the United Nations bureau chief for The Times, grew up in a Libyan oil town and spent more than 13 years as a correspondent in the Middle East. His knowledge of Arabic and familiarity with the region give him a deep and nuanced understanding of its culture and politics. In this ''funny (yet penetrating) account about real Arabs,'' as Thanassis Cambanis described it in the Book Review, he ''nods to the prejudices about Middle Eastern fanatics and then sets off merrily to dispel them.'' 
 A WORLD OF TROUBLE: The White House and the Middle East -- From the Cold War to the War on Terror, by Patrick Tyler. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $18.) Tyler's detailed study ranges across the Middle East, from Suez to the Iranian revolution to the Iran-Iraq conflict and both Iraq wars, and, of course, to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Tyler, who has reported for The Times and The Washington Post, ''writes vividly, allowing the reader access to White House meetings, huddles in the corridors of power, seats at international summits,'' our reviewer, Adam LeBor, said. SECRET SON,by Laila Lalami. (Algonquin, $13.95.) This novel chronicles the recruitment of its sensitive protagonist, a student of English literature and a resident of a Casablanca slum, into an assassination plot. Lalami, a Moroccan-American, offers an insider's view of the dysfunctional politics and dispossessed psyches that allow Islamists to win converts. 
 THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, by Stieg Larsson (Vintage, $15.95.) Lisbeth Salander, the angry punk hacker in Larsson's 2008 best seller, ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,'' returns in another thriller. This one has an intricate story line that ''advances at a brisk, violently cinematic clip,'' our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, said, and combines reportorial description with lurid melodrama. 
 A STRANGE EVENTFUL HISTORY: The Dramatic Lives of Ellen Terry, Henry Irving, and Their Remarkable Families, by Michael Holroyd (Picador, $28.) Terry and Irving were the greatest English-speaking actors of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and among the first to achieve stardom in the modern sense. (Irving was also an innovative theater manager who introduced numbered seats, free programs and the custom of dimming the houselights as the curtain went up.) Holroyd writes about their work together with verve and an unparalleled knowledge of the period. He extends the story to Terry's and Irving's offspring, particularly Terry's son, Edward Gordon Craig, a groundbreaking stage designer. 
 THE MISSING, by Tim Gautreaux (Vintage, $15.) The pointlessness of vengeance is the theme of this novel by Gautreaux, a Louisiana author. A man whose parents were killed when he was an infant avoids the carnage of World War I (when a fellow soldier asks how he earned the nickname Lucky, he says, ''For missing everything'') and takes a job as a store security guard in New Orleans. After he fails to stop two thugs from kidnapping a little girl, he pursues them in the hope of making ''another family whole.'' 
 FIFTY MILES FROM TOMORROW: A Memoir of Alaska and the Real People, by William L. Iggiagruk Hensley (Picador, $15.) Hensley probably could see Russia from his childhood home, north of the Arctic Circle and just 50 miles from the international date line. Born in 1941 at ''the twilight of the Stone Age,'' he was raised in a village of 300 people with no electricity or telephones. The book is both a coming-of-age story and a gripping primer on cold weather survival; Hensley writes about killing seals, constructing sod homes, chopping chunks of ice to get water for coffee. After high school and college in the Lower 48, he was elected to the new Alaska Legislature and became an influential voice on Alaskan Native issues. 
 THE REBELLION OF RONALD REAGAN: A History of the End of the Cold War, by James Mann. (Penguin, $17.) Reagan's role in ending the cold war was crucial, Mann argues, but it was not the one his backers often claim. Reagan, he says, was an idiosyncratic hawk who was devoted to peace and found nuclear weapons repugnant. His belief that the Soviet economy would collapse of its own inefficiency put him at odds with Nixon and Kissinger. Neither ''just being tough against the Soviets'' nor ''just being trusting'' of them could end the cold war, our reviewer, Christopher Caldwell, wrote. ''It required a subtle mix of both approaches, and Reagan found that mix.'' William Kleinknecht, on the other hand, is not a Reagan admirer. In THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD: Ronald Reagan and the Betrayal of Main Street America(Nation Books, $16.95), he addresses what he calls the ''disconnect between the Reagan of myth and the Reagan of reality'' and attempts to ''document the harm that Reagan's policies have brought'' to Americans. 
 A PINT OF PLAIN: Tradition, Change, and the Fate of the Irish Pub, by Bill Barich (Walker, $15.) Traveling around Ireland, Barich discovers that inauthenticity and modernization have killed Irish bar culture. At the same time, the Irish Pub Concept (sold by a multinational conglomerate) has become a hot commodity around the world.

HEADLINE: Ending the Internet's Trench Warfare

BYLINE: By YOCHAI BENKLER. 
Yochai Benkler is a professor and co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 IMAGINE that for $33 a month you could buy Internet service twice as fast as what you get from Verizon or Comcast, bundled with digital high-definition television, unlimited long distance and international calling to 70 countries and wireless Internet connectivity for your laptop or smartphone throughout much of the country. 
 That's what you can buy in France, and similar speeds and prices are available in other countries with competitive markets. But not in the United States. Prices here are three to five times that much for the fastest speeds -- the highest prices among advanced economies. 
 The Federal Communications Commission's National Broadband Plan, announced last week, is aimed at providing nearly universal, affordable broadband service by 2020. And while it takes many admirable steps -- including very important efforts toward opening space in the broadcast spectrum -- it does not address the source of the access problem: without a major policy shift to increase competition, broadband service in the United States will continue to lag far behind the rest of the developed world.
 Take the commission's ''100 Squared Initiative,'' which aims to get 100 megabits-per-second service to 100 million households, at affordable rates, by 2020. Meeting the speed target shouldn't be difficult; industry is well on track to achieve it within the decade. 
 Affordability is the hard part -- because there is no competition pushing down prices. The plan acknowledges that only 15 percent of homes will have a choice in providers, and then only between Verizon's FiOS fiber-optic network and the local cable company. (AT&T's ''fiber'' offering is merely souped-up DSL transmitted partly over its old copper wires, which can't compete at these higher speeds.) The remaining 85 percent will have no choice at all. 
 Last year my colleagues and I did a study for the Federal Communications Commission showing that a significant reason that other countries had managed to both expand access and lower rates over the last decade was a commitment to open-access policies, requiring companies that build networks to sell access to rivals that then invest in, and compete on, the network. 
 These countries realize that innovation happens in electronics and services -- not in laying cable. If every company has to dig its own holes, the price of entry is too high and competition falters; over time, innovation lags, and the goal of broader and better access suffers.
 Existing local companies argue that they deserve control over a market because they've sunk enormous amounts of money into digging trenches and laying cables for their telecommunications network. And to be fair, it is expensive. But other countries are exploring creative ways for competitors to share the costs and risks of fiber investments, sometimes coupled with public investment, so that incumbent companies can accommodate competitors without unnecessarily hamstringing themselves.
 Making such an arrangement work is ultimately a matter of political will. In Japan and many European countries, regulators fought hard to bring existing providers around to open access. They won, and today these countries have more competition, lower prices and higher speeds. Such political will is glaringly absent in the commission's plan.
 The 1996 Telecommunications Act did, in fact, point the United States in the direction of open access. But after eight years of intense litigation and lobbying from telephone companies, the Federal Communications Commission gave in, deciding that competition between one telephone incumbent and one cable incumbent was enough -- in essence, it rejected open access as a way to create competition.
 But without a strong commitment to open access, things will get worse. Because of the high price of laying their own next-generation fiber optics, would-be competitors like AT&T and Qwest have largely abandoned their goal of bringing fiber to the home, leaving the highest-speed tiers to the cable companies. 
 Those companies aren't keeping their excitement quiet: a recent Time-Warner investor briefing touted the company's ability to set higher prices in markets in which its potential competitors provide only DSL services.
 The F.C.C. broadband plan doesn't completely give up on competition. It recommends several elements that kick the can -- albeit productively -- down the road: for example, it would require data collection about rates, which would demonstrate how monopoly structures increase prices and hurt access.
 Unfortunately, though, senior commission staff members have essentially conceded in interviews that lobbying pressure from the monopolies is too strong even to begin exploring open access right now. 
 They may be right. But their decision comes with real risks. If we stay the present course, the commission's new policy will build a better wireless network around a more entrenched monopoly system, lodging an insurmountable obstacle in the path toward bringing America's broadband network up to speed with the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: Larry Korman

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Korman, 46, is a co-president of Korman Communities.
 The company, which is based in Philadelphia, develops three hybrid residential real estate/hotel brands: AKA, its extended-stay hotels; AVE, which provides furnished apartments; and ARK, which offers furnished and unfurnished units.
 Q How do your responsibilities differ from those of your brother Bradley, a co-president? 
 A My brother Brad and I each have a 50-50 autonomous role in the company. Brad's involved in all the financial aspects -- acquisitions, disposition, financial recording. My role is on the operational side -- the management, marketing and maintenance of the brand.
 Q Speaking of brand, much of the company's focus seems to have been on AKA. What's new there?
 A We have eight AKA properties. AKA Central Park is our flagship property. It opened three years ago, but it just recently finished its metamorphosis.
 We created the A Lounge, where from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. residents can go for a drink; it's very private. They have the AKA Cafe; the breakfast is very high end. There's a fitness center that's 14 feet high with a 60-foot-wide projection video arc and spa amenity features. Gunnar Peterson is a good friend of ours, so when we were developing the fitness program we talked to him.
 The second floor has a technology lounge that we're doing with Sony, where residents can try out eBooks, DVDs and Blu-rays. And there's a media theater, so they can watch the latest movies.
 Q What's the average occupancy rate for AKA?
 A Our occupancy is about 85 percent at AKA portfoliowide.
 Q And at AVE and ARK?
 A AVE averages 90 to 95 percent. And about 95 percent for ARK.
 Q How did business fare in the New York region during the recession?
 A New York probably has been hit a lot harder than other markets because it's the epicenter of the financial industry. We haven't gone down like our competitors because we were still growing.
 In the good economy, everyone in the hotel sector saw an influx from international travelers: they were coming for 10, 14 days, sending their empty luggage in advance, then buying New York City up because the dollar was weak. That has dissipated, and what we've seen take its place is the entertainment industry.
 Q Can you name names?
 A Here's the thing: We have some of the top production companies, producers, directors, musicians and entertainers, but the reason they stay here is for anonymity. So I want to respect that. But trust me, it's some of the leading, leading people. We have people doing Broadway plays, television series or movies.
 Now in Washington, D.C., it's almost all government based. One weekend we had all three presidential candidates' security and the pope's security stay with us, because we're a block and a half from the White House.
 Q Have we reached the bottom?
 A I definitely think the bottom is over. I think the hotel sector really is starting to come back. Our January and February blew away not only 2009 but also 2008, so we're having the best start we've ever had.
 Q How much of an increase?
 A Thirty to 40 percent in revenues.
 Q What are your current projects?
 A We're in the early braining stages of AVE to get a Vegas-esque concept out there. At ARK, we're doing major club renovations. We're also redoing all the roofs. With AKA, we're looking at adding properties in London, Los Angeles and New York.
 Q Where in New York?
 A The Upper East Side and SoHo are areas where we're looking. We don't have specific properties in mind right now.
 Q Where do you see the company in the next five years or so?
 A The goal is to have 10 AKA properties in the next three- to five-year period. At AKA, I could see a few floors dedicated to long-term residence. I could also see fractional ownership. We've already had residents that have done a one-year lease. It's their pied-a-terre on demand.
 Q How much does that cost?
 A It's maybe 5 percent less than our monthly rate, so if it's $295 a night it might be $285.
 Q You also work with your father, Steven, the C.E.O., and brother Mark, president of the KCI Commercial Real Estate division. How has that been?
 A My brothers are my best friends -- we all went to Duke, all live a mile from each other. Our families are very close, and we enjoy working with each other. What could be better than that?

HEADLINE: Legislating Fairness in Co-ops

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
CO-OP boards have long had the power to reject an application without explanation, leaving buyers and sellers to wonder whether discrimination was a motivating factor. 
 Barbara Ford, a lawyer and Realtor in Floral Park and the chairwoman of the Common Interest Ownership Committee of the Long Island Board of Realtors, found that troublesome. 
 ''Because they never had to give a reason why the person was rejected,'' she said, ''it became a license to break the law.'' 
 There are more than 9,300 co-op units in Suffolk County, with sizable developments in Coram, Patchogue, Bay Shore and Islip. Last year 294 units were sold, with an average price of $156,766.
 Ms. Ford, determined to get the State Legislature to pass an antidiscrimination bill aimed at co-ops, made several attempts over the course of 15 years. But despite her group's lobbying, ''we were told that our efforts weren't going anywhere,'' Ms. Ford said, because organizations that own co-ops held more sway. Even when the House passed a bill, it would go on to fail in the Senate. 
 Last year, Ms. Ford decided she might have better luck with the county than the state. Along with her colleagues at the Realtors' board -- Randy L. Kaplan, the director of government affairs, and Kathy Engel, the president -- she approached the Suffolk County Legislature.
 Steve Levy, the county executive, ''immediately embraced'' co-op antidiscrimination legislation, and within four months it passed.
 The law took effect at the end of last year -- and it now appears likely to be introduced this year to the Legislature in Nassau County, which has concentrations of co-op communities in Great Neck, Mineola, the Five Towns and Long Beach. Last year in Nassau, 643 units sold, with an average price of $230,709.
 The ordinance requires ''fairness in cooperative homeownership.'' Co-op boards must now state in writing why they have denied an application.
 Mr. Levy described the new legislation as dovetailing with a 2007 housing bill that empowered local human rights divisions to investigate complaints. 
 Real estate transactions are generally protected by antidiscrimination rules, Mr. Kaplan said. But because co-ops sell corporation shares rather than actual real estate, they fall through a ''loophole in the law to allow discrimination.'' 
 But the law has not been unanimously embraced. Thomas Flood, general manager and vice president of Richland Management, oversees 20 co-op buildings in Great Neck and 215 units in Hempstead. He described it as ''too complicated'' to have to give every potential buyer a reason for rejection. ''The law fails to recognize that when you have a co-op you have five to seven people making a decision,'' Mr. Flood said. ''It's the totality of the application and there are a lot of different factors.''
 On the other hand Mr. Levy, explaining why he thought a buyer should have a chance at self-defense after board rejection, insisted: ''A person is left pondering, 'Why was I rejected; was it that they thought I couldn't afford it, or was it because they had some kind of prejudice?' '' 
 If applicants are being rejected for economic reasons, Mr. Levy said, they should ''have the opportunity to dispel misconceptions'' and show their earning power, whether it is child support not taken into account, or the future income of the self employed. 
 Recently, Mr. Kaplan and Ms. Engel of the Realtors' board met to discuss the law with Edward P. Mangano, the Nassau executive. He later expressed his support by describing its passage as ''a matter of putting pen to paper.'' 
 Martha Krisel, Nassau's chief deputy county attorney for special projects, said that although county housing law applied to all housing, including co-ops, and although it prohibited discriminatory practices, ''co-op boards do have their own rules.''
 Moreover, according to Ms. Engel, the law also ensures that boards no longer drag their feet in considering applications. 
 ''The co-op boards must within 45 days give an acceptance or a rejection for the prospective owner,'' she said, ''and they had not done that in the past. They just put it off and put it off.'' 
 In the 1980s, Ms. Engel recalled, she was ''a victim of discrimination when it came to mortgages,'' because she was a single mother. ''It was horrible,'' she said. ''I had to get a co-signer. Do you know how embarrassing that is? I was the bread earner.''
 Under the new law, co-ops must use a standardized application. ''They can't arbitrarily make a more onerous application for someone they want to eliminate,'' Ms. Ford said.
 In a survey four years ago, she added, local Realtors were polled about transactions in which ''they knew discrimination was involved.'' In more than 100 they described ''a situation where the buyers had been rejected and they felt strongly that it had been discrimination.'' 
 Similarly, when she did co-op conversion work in the 1980s, Ms. Ford recalled, ''it was blatantly brought up that they didn't want to let that person in'' for reasons that included race, ethnicity and disability. ''All you had to do was reject them,'' she said. ''You didn't have to give a reason.''
 She added, ''If a bank declines to give you a mortgage, they have to tell you why. But this segment of the real estate market has been able to avoid those kinds of responsibilities.'' 
 V. Elaine Gross, the director of Erase Racism, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Syosset, said the new law was ''definitely a step in the right direction.''
 Mr. Levy called the legislation ''a preventive measure'' and hoped it would be instituted statewide.

With cash in shorter supply across much of the economy, more people have turned to a form of commerce that existed before cash was invented: bartering. Craigslist started a barter category on its site in 2001 and is now posting about 200,000 new barter ads a month. That's up 10 percent from February of last year, which in turn was up about 100 percent from February 2008, according to its chief executive, Jim Buckmaster. (He explained that the ''stupendous'' growth rate had cooled along with the worst of the economic crisis.) But the appeal is clear: via bartering, consumers can use their time, skills and possessions instead of money to obtain goods and services like piano lessons, dental work and dog training -- and to meet new people along the way.

HEADLINE: The Value of Free TV

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Buried Treasure in Your TV Dial'' (Economic View, Feb. 28), which suggested selling the portion of the radio spectrum used for over-the-air television: 
 The column greatly undervalues the role of free and local TV and the enormous benefits consumers will reap in the digital era. No communications medium more efficiently delivers timely, often life-saving information than broadcasting. Far from being ''nearly obsolete,'' broadcasting in the United States is now in a technology leadership role as a result of the transition from analog to digital and HDTV.
 Local TV is poised for a renaissance, thanks to the explosion in free digital program choices delivered via inexpensive ''back to the future'' high-tech antennas.
 Tens of millions of Americans rely every day on broadcast TV for local news, entertainment, and emergency weather warnings. We should be praising this free and remarkable service, not burying it.

HEADLINE: Ready for Life's Encore Performances

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif.
 IN the back room of a neighborhood restaurant here, a small group of men and women in their 50s gathered recently to mark a milestone. ''I feel like when historians look back and think about this salmon lunch at MacArthur Park, they'll see this was a real turning point,'' said Marc Freedman, who started a pilot program for baby boomers to transition into second careers. 
 These 10 executives had all left their high-paying jobs in the private sector and joined the pilot program, and this was their formal graduation. They had taken a step familiar to some high school or college students: take a year off to regroup, rethink and figure out what they want to be when they grow up. 
 They dived into what are called Encore Fellowships, six-month or yearlong paid stints with nonprofit organizations in fields like education and the environment. The privately financed fellowship was named for what Mr. Freedman, 51, a leading expert on the changing nature of retirement and the founder of Civic Ventures in San Francisco, calls the Encore Generation. It is the model for a program that would expand to all 50 states under federal legislation enacted last spring. 
 The idea that many workers reaching their mid and late 60s think they are too young to retire and, particularly in the wake of the recession, may have no choice but to keep working, is not particularly new. And as Mr. Freedman writes in his book ''Encore: Finding Work That Matters in the Second Half of Life,'' there are plenty of retired Americans who have gone back to full- or part-time work after retiring, perhaps turning their ''golden years'' into their ''Wal-Mart years.''
 But with growing evidence of a demographic wrench being thrown into the classic arc of the life course -- essentially a bonus decade or three added to the average life span over the last century -- researchers are now exploring an entirely new developmental stage for people roughly between the ages of 55 and 75, challenging the notion that these years are marked by an inevitable mental and physical decline. 
 Research into the changing -- and increasingly aging -- work force has also been accompanied by encouraging findings on the mental abilities of the aging. While older people's memories and ability to process information are not as sharp, their knowledge increases over time, and many say that is a vast untapped resource. 
 All of this points to the possibility of a kind of intellectual rejuvenation at a time of life typically thought best suited to winding down. Sociologists studying the implications of the lengthening life span, with an average gain in industrialized countries of roughly 30 years over the last century, are watching the pilot program here closely. 
 ''We are nibbling around the edges of ways to change life, asking, 'Should people retire at 67 or 69?' '' said Laura L. Carstensen, a psychology professor at Stanford and the director of its Center on Longevity. ''But the enormity of this has not hit people.'' 
 Some of the names researchers are using for this life chapter, which Mr. Freedman compared to the idea of adolescence -- a stage, not an age -- are ''Midcourse,'' ''New Old Age,'' ''Young Old Age,'' and ''The Third Age.'' 
 Bill Pace, 56, who joined the Encore Fellowship after retiring from his job in financial consulting and finding that volunteer work was not fulfilling enough, said he had been using the word ''spanners'' to describe himself and his peers. ''The spanners, they are spanning what basically used to happen between when you stopped working and when you died,'' said Mr. Pace, who plans to work with Civic Ventures to develop training and education, primarily at community colleges, for people seeking new skills for this work transition. 
 Seven months into his fellowship, Mr. Pace was out sailing and had a heart attack, from which he has recovered. The odd thing, he said, was that he had already made all the radical life changes one often contemplates after looking death in the eye: leaving a job that required long hours and frequent international travel, working half time for Civic Ventures and an educational nonprofit, along with volunteering. 
 ''If I had been doing what I had been doing the previous 30 years at that moment, I would have said, 'This is the epiphany, this is someone sending me a message I better pay attention to,' '' Mr. Pace said, ''But I had had that epiphany.'' 
 THE way the life script is written now, the young study, the middle of life is packed with work and raising families, the old rest or volunteer, and everybody is doubled over with anxiety about Social Security drying up, Dr. Carstensen said. 
 ''The culture hasn't had time to catch up,'' she said. ''All the added years of life have been put into leisure, and that's crazy.''
 A paper published last October in the Lancet predicted that half of all the babies born since 2000 in the United States and several other developed countries could live to 104. 
 The baby boom generation will be the longest living, healthiest group of people in their 50s, 60s and 70s thus far in history, experts say, although life expectancy could level off for younger generations in the United States because of health issues like obesity. The number of Americans age 55 and older, 71 million today, is projected to increase by 2030, to 110 million, according to Census figures.
 And boomers are the guinea pigs for experiments like the one here, which was funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and Hewlett-Packard, where several of the Encore fellows worked until taking buyout packages or early retirement. 
 Nine of the 10 fellows, who were paid a $25,000 stipend, are staying on in some capacity at the nonprofit organizations to which they were assigned. Eight of the 10 nonprofits, which for the next class of fellows will be required to pay at least half the $25,000 stipend, are sponsoring fellows again. 
 There is no way to accurately measure how many baby boomers nationally may be making the kind of career and life changes the Encore fellows have. But Mr. Freedman and others suggest this is the beginning of a movement that could have the kind of enormous impact on the work force that women's liberation did. 
 Still, some of what they envision can sound like the description of a utopian society in which employers won't think twice about hiring people in their 50s and 60s, and people would float in and out of the work force between the ages of 20 and 80, with reduced work weeks for those raising families and droves of elderly college students. 
 Indeed, Mr. Freedman acknowledged there are still only ''weak signals from the future'' indicating any significant shifts in public policy, 
 Several recent surveys conducted by Civic Ventures, the AARP and other groups, show that a majority of Americans approaching retirement want to continue working past traditional retirement age and have a strong desire to remain productive and set new goals. Many plan to continue either working full time or part time into their 70s, and a substantial number into their 80s.
 THE pilot project here will double to 20 fellows next month. Civic Ventures is working to expand it to five states this year, and if that happens, 100 Encore fellows would be in place by the end of 2010. 
 The national service act that President Obama signed in April not only tripled the size of the AmeriCorps program begun by President Clinton, but for the first time included baby boomers in the paid volunteer slots. The new program, which has a ''senior corps'' for older Americans, focuses on five service areas -- poverty, education, energy efficiency, health care and assistance to veterans. It provides for 10 one-year Encore Fellowships per state, although the funding has not yet been allocated.
 In early 2007, when Gina Cassinelli, 53, received an e-mail message offering early retirement packages at Hewlett-Packard -- where she had worked, most recently in marketing, for 26 years -- she said it took her ''30 seconds'' to take one. The recession hadn't hit yet, but she said she was ready. She wasn't entirely sure what she was ready for, but she retired and drove with a friend across the country, stopping at many of the places, she said, she used to fly above in her constant, exhausting travel. 
 ''I was done and I was ready for something different and it wasn't giving me that energy,'' she said of her job, noting that she loved it for many years, especially when Silicon Valley was spinning with excitement at the height of the dot-com boom. 
 ''I knew it was time for me to see what I could do to contribute back. It was all building, building, taking, taking, buying, buying. And I was sick of it, and I was like, how can I give back?''
 But she was perplexed: what to do? Then she learned of the Encore Fellowship and was placed part time at an organization that runs after-school programs for middle school students. She is now working full time as the interim executive director, although she said she would probably not stay on there once that job is filled but will look for more work in the nonprofit sector. 
 ''I'm hooked,'' she said. 
 Ms. Cassinelli's idea about contributing to future generations, or giving back, is another subject that has gained growing attention in recent years among researchers looking at the implications of longer life expectancy. 
 The psychologist Erik Erikson, who is best known for his work in the 1950s exploring the stages of identity and development from birth to death, called the desire to further the well-being of future generations ''generativity.'' The Encore Fellowship's emphasis on new kinds of work in the second act -- though it is paid work -- is closely tied to this concept, and research has shown that generativity is linked to greater satisfaction in life.
 Most of the Encore Fellows were or are working for far less money than they made in the corporate world. The question is whether others can afford to do so.
 One of the Encore Fellows, Nigel Ball, 52, who had worked in marketing for Hewlett-Packard before taking the fellowship, decided to return to the private sector because of financial concerns. He recently took a job as a vice president at the software firm Oracle. He has three children, 20, 17 and 12, and said he wanted to make sure the family's financial future would be secure. Still, he joined the board of directors of the nonprofit he was assigned to and said he suspects it won't be too long before he returns to what Mr. Freedman and others describe as ''social purpose work'' in the public sector. 
 ''Being 50-plus is now so different for my generation,'' Mr. Ball said. ''I am as active in every way, in fact more so than 20 years ago. I play squash, tennis, ski, bike. I am fitter physically and mentally than I have ever been, so why would I stop being the person I am, which includes managing, making decisions, solving problems? I just want to do these things in a different context.''

HEADLINE: Letters: A Brand-New Era of Managed Care?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Managed Care: Get Used to It'' (Economic View, March 14): 
It is correct that many health policy experts insist that the only way to control health care costs in this country is for payers to manage care. They believe that our skyrocketing costs are generated by well-insured patients, who treat health care as an all-you-can-eat buffet: because services are essentially ''free'' to them, they demand too many. Therefore, managed care reduces costs by restricting ''excessive'' services, while protecting the profits of insurance companies and providers.
 However, it is important to remember that other developed countries pay much less than we do, yet cover all their citizens and achieve better health outcomes -- without managing care. Instead, they often control costs by regulating prices and keeping private insurers nonprofit. Managed care need not be our fate: we have a good alternative.

HEADLINE: What the Still Photo Still Does Best

BYLINE: By HANK KLIBANOFF. 
Hank Klibanoff, a former managing editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, is co-author with Gene Roberts of ''The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle and the Awakening of a Nation,'' winner of the 2007 Pulitzer Prize in history.

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Charles Moore was a news photographer who became a photojournalist and died a visual journalist -- not because he changed, but because the technology, nomenclature and just about everything else involving his profession did.
 Shooting first for Montgomery newspapers in his home state of Alabama, then more famously for Life magazine, Mr. Moore was probably the most influential of a battalion of still photographers who swept across the South to capture, with compelling clarity, the dramatic collision of massive and passive resistance, black and white, right and wrong.
 Mr. Moore raced on foot to scenes, sometimes with the camera already at his eye, often with his feet moving backward. Relying mostly on short-range lenses, he moved closer to the action than any photographer, began shooting, then moved even closer. 
 The television medium was barely 15 years old, and large-format magazines were wildly popular, when Life devoted 13 pages to photos by Mr. Moore, Flip Schulke and others at the University of Mississippi showdown in 1962, then 11 pages to the deployment of dogs and fire hoses in Birmingham the next year.
 The unsettling images from civil rights battlegrounds, followed closely by the disturbing images from Vietnam battlefields by Horst Faas, Eddie Adams, Nick Ut and others, created a golden era for photojournalism.
 Today, everyone with a cellphone is a photographer/videographer and streaming video has become a national obsession. But has the proliferation of images devalued photojournalism and dulled its influence?
 As director of multimedia for MSNBC.com, Stokes Young sees phenomenal still images and videos running across his screen from across the world. He can quickly reel off a dozen names of photographers producing riveting work that provokes strong reactions.
 The economic crisis has undermined the quantity of photographers in the print media, especially among local newspapers in the United States, but ''the quality of work at the top end of photojournalism is astounding,'' he said.
 Meanwhile, the surge in the number of photos and videos from nonprofessionals gives news outlets more eyes on news. Editors are busier than ever sorting through citizen offerings of earthquakes, tornadoes, riots and, of course, dogs dressed up for St. Patrick's Day, and then confirming the veracity of those from politicized situations.
 ''In the diffuse media landscape it is much harder for any particular image, much less a piece of serious photojournalism, to command the consciousness of a nation or the world,'' Mr. Young said.
 But, he added, ''the nonprofessional picture increasingly has the possibility of punching through to center stage.''
 That's what happened last year when Neda Agha Soltan, an antigovernment protester in Tehran, was shot and killed. Her death was captured in a cellphone video that spread quickly through the digital world. A close-up ''screen grab'' of her bloody face, plucked from the video as a still, was soon distributed, an excision that has become journalistically more acceptable with improvements in the quality of videography.
 There is concern among many professionals that the journalistic standards of the golden era aren't being handed down. For decades, photographers would cram into workshops and conferences where Mr. Moore, Mr. Adams, Mr. Ut and others would discuss the important values of their craft. Those courses have been replaced by Webinars.
 Still, at many new-media Web sites that accentuate photojournalism, the social awareness that guided Charles Moore endures. ''Documenting social injustice is the cornerstone of our profession'' and remains a powerful motivating force in photojournalism, said Brian Storm, founder of MediaStorm.org, which this year became the first Web recipient of the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards for broadcast journalism.
 As a constant reminder, Mr. Storm need only look at a wall in his Brooklyn office, where he has placed an 11-by-14-inch black-and-white photograph from Birmingham showing a black woman and two black men pounded and pinned to a storefront wall by a fire hose's white laser stream. The picture was taken by Charles Moore.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Freeze Frames: Photographs taken by Charles Moore, like the one above, helped crystallize a nation's sensibilities about race relations, freezing the drama of the Birmingham police's use of dogs and fire hoses on antisegregation protesters. In London in 2004, far left, a commuter's cell phone caught the aftermath of the Underground bombings
last June in Iran, a frame grab from a cellphone video helped make the dying Neda Agha Soltan a global icon of protest against apparent electoral fraud. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY CHARLES MOORE/BLACK STAR, 1963

HEADLINE: A Blue State Deep in Debt Rethinks What's Important

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
You know taxes are too high when even the liberals root for spending cuts.
 New Jersey's tough-talking new governor, Christopher J. Christie, the first Republican elected in 12 years, is grappling with a deficit in the billions by squeezing nearly everyone -- school children, the elderly, mass transit, cities, suburbs, subsidized renters and home owners.
 Other states are making painful cuts, too: Arizona, to name one, is ending state-funded all-day kindergarten and health coverage for 47,000 children from low income families, though its Republican governor is pressing for a sales tax increase to avoid even deeper sacrifices. 
 But what's most surprising about New Jersey is how in such a blue, labor-dominated state, Democrats and union members seem to be cracking under the pressure of the state's tax burden, revealing a kind of split-personality disorder.
 The syndrome surfaced last summer during Mr. Christie's campaign, when he vowed to bring New Jersey's property taxes, the nation's highest, under control. As a candidate he saved his sternest threats for the teachers' and state workers' unions, whose healthy pay and benefits packages, he argued, were slowly strangling the schools and running the state's finances into the ground. Union members, state workers and teachers, it turned out, weren't offended by his rhetoric. In fact, public opinion surveys showed they ate it up.
 Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll, said the surprising reactions were a reminder that Democrats and union members are also home owners, job seekers and parents -- and that things have gotten so bad that even they might be willing to swallow some tough medicine and embrace once-unthinkable policies.
 ''They're property tax payers, too,'' Mr. Murray said. ''People are willing to take cuts in programs that they think do good things, but they think we simply can't afford.''
 While Democratic governors have mostly closed deficits with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases, Mr. Christie's insistence on doing less with less puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with red-state governors like Bobby Jindal in Louisiana and Haley Barbour in Mississippi, ambitious conservatives like Tim Pawlenty in Minnesota, and his fellow newcomer in Virginia, Bob McDonnell.
 But while those governors may prefer the knife for ideological reasons, Mr. Christie's choices are also pragmatic: New Jersey's property, income and business tax burden is already one of the nation's most onerous.
 No polls have been taken since Mr. Christie's budget speech, but it held few real surprises. ''Voters felt Christie was being honest about what the situation was, and what he needed to do to move forward, and then he did exactly what he said he was going to do,'' Mr. Murray said. ''It's a sad statement, but that's almost unheard of.''
 Of course, if the economy doesn't recover in a year, the bad-cop governor could find himself being interrogated by an angry public on why this year's cuts haven't worked. If it does rebound, then his conservatism could be put to the test, by depriving him of his rationale for keeping a lid on spending.
 For now, though, his refusal to even consider raising taxes on the rich -- he dug his heels in opposition to extending an income tax surcharge on people making more than $400,000 -- would seem to pave the way for a showdown with Democrats who control the Legislature and quickly called his spending cuts an assault on the middle class.
 But there's a good chance that the battle may not prove all that cataclysmic.
 Talk to leaders of the interest groups on the receiving end of the budget ax, and even some Democratic lawmakers, and you'll hear the predictable apocalyptic warnings. But privately, many liberals who feel like they can't afford all of their ideals anymore will also admit to cheering Mr. Christie on, out of sheer pocketbook politics.
 ''There's a lot of that,'' said Raymond Lesniak, an influential Democratic state senator.
 ''There'll be people howling,'' said another Democrat who operates behind the scenes. ''But people at night are saying, 'I'm paying too much, I'm worried about my job, something has to change. The guy's cutting, and yes, things have to cut -- just don't cut me.' ''

HEADLINE: Does Icahn Still Make Them Tremble?

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
HE is a billionaire several times over. He has spent the better part of four decades terrorizing corporate chiefs and battling entrenched boards. His name is emblazoned on a stadium on an island in the East River, a laboratory at Princeton, a science center at the Choate Rosemary Hall school in Connecticut and charter schools in the Bronx.
 Yet, for all of his high-profile successes, Carl C. Icahn says he feels misunderstood.
 ''There's a misperception out there that we bust up companies. Or that I believe that all people on boards are bad,'' growls Mr. Icahn, the 74-year-old investor, as he sets a coffee cup on a small mahogany table in his office on the 47th floor of a Midtown Manhattan tower. ''It's just that, in some cases, the C.E.O.'s are so wrong,'' he grumbles, then quickly flashes a big smile and laughs at his own joke. 
 While Mr. Icahn likes to pull out his Rodney Dangerfield-esque why-can't-I-get-any-respect? routine, he has over the years perfected the art of stirring up trouble for companies and making money -- sometimes lots of it -- for his investors and himself.
 And while many of his peers from back in the day -- names including T. Boone Pickens, Saul P. Steinberg, Robert M. Bass -- keep significantly lower profiles these days, Mr. Icahn has not gone quietly into the night. 
 ''He is a survivor,'' said Chris Young, a director at Institutional Shareholder Services, a Rockville, Md., proxy advisory firm. ''If you look at the proxy pipeline, he's involved with a bunch of contentious situations.''
 On Friday, Mr. Icahn made a hostile offer to buy the Hollywood studio Lionsgate Entertainment; meanwhile, through the $8 billion hedge fund and other assets he oversees -- $6 billion is his money -- he is waging proxy fights to get new or additional board seats at the biotech companies Biogen Idec and Genzyme. They are also warring with Donald Trump and debt holders in a New Jersey bankruptcy court over ownership of three casinos in Atlantic City that bear Mr. Trump's name. In recent months, Mr. Icahn has bought a partly built casino on the Las Vegas strip and the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City from bankruptcy.
 It is too early to tell whether he will prevail in these battles. But after all these years, a career of victories and occasional misses, one thing can certainly be said of Mr. Icahn: He is one of Wall Street's most colorful, controversial and complicated characters.
 Wearing slightly rumpled khakis and waving his eyeglasses to punctuate key points, Mr. Icahn is constantly jumping from one topic to another in an endless stream of dialogue. In that respect, he more closely resembles an absent-minded professor than a master of the universe. 
 Corporate executives visiting his offices walk through hallways adorned with paintings of battle scenes and sculptures of cowboys on bucking broncos. One large painting in the conference room features a lion gazing at the bones of an animal in a desert.
 Yet he bristles at being labeled a ''raider,'' despite the fact that he is widely viewed as a founding member of the clan that roamed Wall Street in the 1980s, occasionally pursuing hostile takeovers with ruthless abandon.
 He prefers to paint his role in those years with the same ''activist investor'' brush he holds today, arguing that he has created tens of billions of dollars of value for shareholders in companies in which he invested. (In conversations, he declares that he has created $30 billion, $40 billion and even $50 billion worth of value for shareholders. What is a few billion among friends?)
 Last year, his hedge fund, highly concentrated in a handful of stocks and bonds, soared 32 percent, after fees, according to a letter sent to investors. That's a reversal from 2008, when it fell 36 percent, including fees. Mr. Icahn's firm declined to provide an after-fees figure.
 To some people, Mr. Icahn and activist investors of his ilk are the heroes of the financial system. ''They are the ones who are holding corporate America's feet to the fire and incentivizing companies to perform better,'' said Frank Partnoy, a professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego. Mr. Partnoy contributed to a study that examined activist investing from 2001 to 2006 and found that activists held stocks longer than others and that the companies they pursue often outperform the market. 
 But some fellow activists contend that Mr. Icahn's strong-armed methods of arguing to get on a board and then pushing for a quick change -- such as paying a dividend, buying back stock, merging with another company or cleaving off an underperforming unit -- are sadly out of date in today's corporate boardrooms. 
 ''There are times when you push back and be harsh and times when you roll up your sleeves and work with management, getting more involved with operations,'' said Eric Jackson, an activist investor in Naples, Fla. ''Carl's record on that score hasn't been as successful.''
 Mr. Icahn and his defenders say he has improved several companies he has invested in or owns. (Besides the hedge fund, he oversees Icahn Enterprises, a hodgepodge of companies he has collected over the years in the automotive, metals and real estate industries.) 
 Late one recent Friday afternoon, Mr. Icahn, a workaholic night owl who rarely appears at glittering high-society functions, dismissed thoughts about going out to dinner with his wife, Gail, or -- gasp -- taking a bigger break from the business altogether. 
 ''What else am I going to do?'' Mr. Icahn asked before returning to his office for a meeting on his real estate holdings. ''Play shuffleboard?''
 IN the spring of 2008, Roy J. Bostock, the chairman of Yahoo, and his fellow directors were coming under a barrage of criticism from investors after Microsoft abruptly broke off merger talks. 
 Mr. Icahn, who had a large stake in Yahoo, jumped into the fray. In a scathing letter to Mr. Bostock, he said the board had ''acted irrationally'' and ''completely botched'' the merger. Mr. Icahn's solution included putting up a slate of 10 directors picked by him. (The company eventually settled, placing Mr. Icahn and two of his other nominees on the 11-member board.) 
 What Mr. Icahn did or did not accomplish in his 15 months on the Yahoo board -- he stepped down last fall -- is the subject of hot debate. 
 But what's surprising about that debate is that one of Mr. Icahn's biggest detractors is Mr. Jackson, a fellow activist investor. And his biggest supporters are some other Yahoo directors.
 ''I think in the first couple of meetings, there was a lot of trepidation: Will he just be disruptive and not constructive? Can this work?'' said Maggie Wilderotter, the C.E.O. of Frontier Communications, who resigned from Yahoo's board last year. ''Carl doesn't worry about what people around the table think about him. He's blunt. If there's an elephant in the room, he puts it on the center of the table.'' 
 And while Mr. Bostock recalled with humor at least one conversation with Mr. Icahn that involved many ''four-letter words going back and forth,'' he said he appreciated Mr. Icahn's persistence and the different point of view he brought to discussions.
 ''Carl brought financial acumen to the board and a good, solid understanding of the strategic imperatives that faced the company, particularly what it would take to compete longer term with the likes of Google, Microsoft and others from a capital-expenditures point of view,'' Mr. Bostock said. ''It was one of the reasons he was pushing for a Microsoft deal.''
 But Mr. Jackson, who manages a small activist hedge fund called Ironfire Capital, says Mr. Icahn blew it with Yahoo.
 ''There was a sense that shareholders were going to go to Sunnyvale with pitchforks,'' Mr. Jackson said, referring to Yahoo's California base. ''He saw that and thought he could ride in on a horse and take control of the company. He didn't realize that he had to articulate to investors what it was he was going to do if he actually had the keys to the car and was driving things.'' 
 ''He's the granddaddy of activist investing. Anyone who practices activist investing has to pay homage to him and the trail that he's blazed,'' Mr. Jackson added. But ''I would say his involvement with the company did nothing for shareholders and hurt his own investors in the stock.''
 Mr. Icahn said that while his firm did not make money in Yahoo, it was supportive in bringing on board Carol Bartz, the company's C.E.O., and instrumental in eventually forging an Internet search and advertising partnership with Microsoft. As for the criticism from Mr. Jackson that his methods do not work, Mr. Icahn said, ''To say that we don't add value is absurd.''
 MR. ICAHN grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, and started his first business at the age of 13, when he snapped pictures of neighbors' homes. He developed the photographs in his basement and glued them to the covers of matchbooks that he would buy for 50 cents a box. He sold the boxes to homeowners for $1.50. 
 When he turned 15, he played his own version of the ice futures market as a cabana boy at a beach club, ordering extra ice on hot mornings to sell to visitors who would run out later in the day. After graduating from Princeton with a degree in philosophy and briefly serving as a medic in the Army, Mr. Icahn landed on Wall Street, opening his own brokerage firm in 1968. In the late 1970s, he waged his first proxy battles.
 When the buyout barons and corporate raiders ruled Wall Street in the 1980s, he was one of the kings. He made plays for some of the largest companies in America, including Phillips Petroleum, the steel giant USX, Texaco and T.W.A. Some were big victories for Mr. Icahn; others were perhaps more trouble than they were ultimately worth.
 ''He had a very devil's-advocate way of reviewing investments,'' said Gary Siegler, who worked with Mr. Icahn from 1985 to 1990. ''You had to be able to support your point of view.''
 After the junk bond market collapsed and boards adopted anti-takeover measures, some raiders moved on in the early 1990s to other things. Mr. Icahn stayed the course, battling for control of the comic book publisher Marvel Entertainment and badgering RJR Nabisco to split its food and tobacco units. 
 Some of his fights in recent years have involved technology and entertainment companies, including Time Warner, Motorola,Blockbuster and the video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software. 
 ''He's had a mixed record on returns'' and in understanding the evolution of the media business, said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at research firm Wunderlich Securities who is watching Mr. Icahn's moves against Lionsgate. Among other things, Mr. Icahn is angling to get his son and fellow chess player, Brett, who works at Mr. Icahn's company, on the studio's board.
 Associates of Mr. Icahn say that his company made money on its Time Warner investment and that while his Motorola investment has not gone as well, they believe it will eventually pay off.
 ''We hold these things for a long time and the jury is still out,'' Mr. Icahn added.
 He has fared better in some of his biotech holdings, which make up a big chunk of the hedge fund's investments.
 ''The biotechs have been his big winners recently,'' particularly investments in ImClone Systems and MedImmune, said Mr. Young at Institutional Shareholder Services. ''His thesis, which is no secret, is that biotech firms should be purchased by Big Pharma, which is always in need of new products. In his mind, that's a match made in heaven.'' 
 Mr. Icahn says he has also made money in industrial and gambling companies he has acquired out of bankruptcy and nursed back to health.
 He said that a couple of years ago, for instance, his company booked a $1 billion profit after selling gambling properties, including the Las Vegas Stratosphere hotel and casino, that it had picked up largely in bankruptcy proceedings. Similarly, he made an additional $1 billion or so selling energy companies he had acquired years earlier.
 In those cases and others, Mr. Icahn argues that he is not given enough credit for holding companies for long periods and investing even more of his own money into the businesses to help them grow. He specifically cites his investments in a rail-car business and the automotive parts supplier Federal-Mogul. 
 ''What gives me the greatest excitement and joy is building a company,'' Mr. Icahn said. ''By the way, it's also the way to make the most money.''
 It may not, however, be the easiest way to make a buck. One of the companies in which he owns a majority stake -- XO Communications -- has been fighting lawsuits by R2, a Fort Worth, Tex., fund controlled by a hedge fund called Q Investments. The hedge fund is run by Geoffrey Raynor, a former investment banker who worked for the Bass family of Texas. R2 accuses Mr. Icahn of engaging in ''sweetheart'' transactions and ''self-dealing'' in his oversight of the communications company.
 In another suit against Mr. Icahn, Mr. Raynor, through another fund, contends that ''material misinformation'' was included in a recent $2 billion bond offering. Mr. Raynor declined to comment for this article.
 Mr. Icahn, who denies all of the accusations made against him, filed his own $100 million lawsuit against Mr. Raynor recently, saying Mr. Raynor's lawsuit caused economic harm to the bond offering. Mr. Icahn called Mr. Raynor a ''serial sue-er,'' and in a court document he contends that the hedge fund has filed 45 lawsuits against various parties in the last four years.
 Disputing that figure, a spokesman for Mr. Raynor says that in the last 10 years, the firm has been a plaintiff in 16 non-bankruptcy proceedings, along with the two legal disputes with Mr. Icahn.
 ''I've put $1 billion into this company. I don't get a salary, and I spend hours on it each week,'' Mr. Icahn said, his tone rising in frustration. ''About $80 million of the company's revenues each year are coming from introductions I brought in.''
 Later, as further proof of his involvement with the communications company he proudly showed off the latest addition to a row of awards arrayed on a cabinet just outside his office. It is a large glass cup engraved with his name, declaring him XO's ''salesman of the decade.''
 LATE last year, Donald Trump was sitting in his office when he was alerted that Carl Icahn was on the phone. 
 Mr. Icahn told him that he had joined the Texas banker D. Andrew Beal in his effort to gain control of three Atlantic City casinos bearing Mr. Trump's name, acquiring a majority of the first-lien mortgages held by Beal Bank.
 ''He told me he was doing it because he heard I wasn't involved, but he knew I was involved, that I had a deal with bondholders,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I was very surprised and also very disappointed that Carl got involved,'' Mr. Trump added. He said the two had been friends for years and that Mr. Icahn had sought his advice when he was divorcing his first wife. Mr. Trump said the two had not spoken since the call.
 ''I should be the one that is surprised he is upset,'' Mr. Icahn said. ''I might possibly feel bad had I interfered at a time when he was running the business,'' but that's not the case, he added. 
 ''Additionally I find it odd that he's now claiming to be my good friend,'' Mr. Icahn said. ''I was not surprised when I was not invited to his daughter's wedding precisely because we are not good friends.''
 The Trump casino deal shows that Mr. Icahn is not afraid to take on big names if there is money to be made. He also makes it clear in other dealings that he is aggressive in protecting his interests.
 Consider the case involving the activist manager William A. Ackman. Mr. Ackman's fund, Gotham Partners, has sued a company owned by Mr. Icahn over a profit-sharing agreement between the men that was made about seven years ago.
 According to court documents, Mr. Ackman sold his investment in Hallwood Realty to Mr. Icahn in 2003 with an agreement that if the assets were sold or transferred at a profit within three years, Mr. Ackman and his fund would get a share of the action. The assets were sold about a year later and, in an interview, Mr. Ackman said Mr. Icahn owed him about $4.7 million. The New York Supreme Court found in favor of Mr. Ackman, and the First Department appellate court affirmed that decision. Mr. Icahn has not paid any of the money and is disputing the legal fees, which with interest bring the total owed to $8 million Mr. Ackman said. 
 ''I call it my Carl Icahn money market account,'' he said. ''I don't get these sort of rates anywhere else.'' 
 Mr. Icahn responded that ''I never agreed to give him the profit he now claims, and the case will be appealed.''
 Mr. Icahn does not seem to let anything, including a very close friendship, get in the way of protecting his and his investors' profits. Late in 2008, through his hedge fund, he sued Realogy, a real estate company controlled by Leon Black, the head of the private equity firm Apollo Management. Mr. Black was trying to reduce Realogy's hefty debt load by offering to exchange some of the debt with bondholders. 
 Mr. Icahn, a bondholder who has known and been friends with Mr. Black for decades -- the two have been longtime tennis partners -- objected to some terms of the exchange and sued.
 ''Carl and I have been good friends for over 25 years,'' Mr. Black said in an e-mail message. ''Occasionally we skirmish as couples are wont to do, but I believe we both feel that when the chips are down that the friendship is paramount.''
 How, exactly, does one sue and still be good friends with someone on Wall Street? Mr. Icahn smiles sagely over his cup of coffee: ''The two of us have a saying that we always use whenever there is friction in our business dealings. We always say, 'there's only one Maltese Falcon.' ''
 At one point in that classic 1941 film, a character chasing a valuable figurine says to a close associate, ''You've been like a son to me,'' Mr. Icahn explains, paraphrasing from the movie.
 Then, lowering his voice with mock intensity, Mr. Icahn adds that the character says that if you lose a son, it's possible to get another -- ''but there's only one Maltese Falcon.' ''

HEADLINE: Less Drama in Detroit As Lutz Leaves the Stage

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
THE departure of Robert A. Lutz as vice chairman of General Motors may provoke an emergency call to the paint department: the color is leaking from G.M.'s headquarters.
 In an auto industry characterized by public apologies, hairshirt humility and bland company men, Mr. Lutz was more in the vein of the late Henry Ford II, whose lasting epigram was, ''Never complain, never explain.''
 Famously blunt, occasionally stubborn and blessed with a knack to lead, inspire and provoke, Mr. Lutz, a onetime Marine aviator, will wrap up a 47-year career when he retires on May 1.
 His full-circle career includes executive stops at G.M., BMW, Ford, Chrysler and a battery maker, Exide Technologies. In 2001 he made a prodigal return to G.M. with a mission to revive the company as he had helped to rejuvenate Chrysler a decade earlier. 
 The retirement of ''Maximum Bob,'' Detroit's ultimate car guy -- and an occasional lightning rod for critics of the domestic auto industry -- raises an important question: What will insiders talk about now, aside from where Sergio Marchionne of Fiat-Chrysler gets his sweaters?
 Looking even at age 78 like a cigar-chomping general out of central casting, Mr. Lutz still lives for cars, motorcycles, helicopters and his L-39 Albatros, a Czech fighter trainer. He claims to have driven and crashed his first car, a flathead Ford, at age 8 in Switzerland, where he was the car-obsessed son of a Swiss banker. In 1992, he crashed in the service of auto-show hoopla, driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee through a window at the Detroit convention center.
 But if G.M.'s turnaround succeeds, Mr. Lutz may be most remembered for cracking the company's fossilized structure, leading a coup of designers and engineers against the M.B.A.'s and brand managers who had called the shots on car development for decades. And the man who once drew fire from environmentalists for calling global warming ''a crock'' -- followed by a more colorful elaboration -- will have capped his career as the godfather of the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid due out late this year.
 Arriving back at G.M. to find talented but demoralized designers, Mr. Lutz began wielding his vice chairman's clout against G.M.'s ''alien and possibly hostile culture.'' Throughout the Big Three, Mr. Lutz said in his whiskey-and-gravel voice, the people on the truck side of the business ''had never lost the burning desire to kick competitors' butts.'' Cars were another matter, and G.M.'s were resolutely bland.
 Mr. Lutz began holding Friday afternoon design seminars, using cars from, say, Audi and Lexus as examples of the design, materials and fit-and-finish that G.M. needed to emulate. Steadily, the newly empowered designers, engineers and suppliers began raising their game. In one example, Mr. Lutz said in a recent interview, G.M.'s paint quality has improved from lackluster to Lexuslike, as measured in paint competitions.
 Perhaps it's no coincidence that G.M.'s golden age of design and dominance came when other larger-than-life characters imposed their will on the company: Harley Earl, the flamboyant chief stylist and pioneer of the tailfin, and Earl's successor, Bill Mitchell, a profane but inspired designer who during his tenure of 1958-77 helped to create the Corvette Sting Ray and other revered cars.
 G.M. began losing its momentum when designers like Earl were sidelined, Mr. Lutz said. ''It's the syndrome of ''The Empire Strikes Back,'' he said. ''The rest of the company, the finance people, said we've had it with these prima donnas in design.''
 In the 1990s, Eberhard von Kunheim, a former BMW chairman, told Cigar Aficionado about Mr. Lutz's uncanny eye for design. ''He could go into a styling studio and sense when you needed to change a line by a half-millimeter here and a millimeter there,'' Mr. von Kunheim said. ''He was always right.''
 As Mr. Lutz's product revival began to take hold, G.M. began receiving plaudits for models like the Cadillac CTS, Saturn Aura and Chevrolet Malibu. But that wasn't enough to avert bankruptcy in the bleak economy of 2009.
 Mr. Lutz's passionate yet losing efforts to save Pontiac and Saturn included several models that critics praised but buyers ignored, from the reborn Pontiac GTO muscle car to a raft of Saturns based on Opels sold in Europe.
 Though Mr. Lutz acknowledged some self-inflicted wounds at G.M., he said the company -- now freed from a mountain of retiree and health care obligations -- is on track to pay back its $50 billion in government loans and thrive again. New models, including the Chevrolet Camaro and Buick LaCrosse, are highly profitable, he said.
 ''There is no reason for anything but a resurgence of the American industry, especially G.M.,'' he said.
 For all of his car-guy credentials, he was educated not as a designer or engineer, but as a salesman. He received a master's degree in marketing from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1962 after he left active military duty.
 Mr. Lutz's confidence and his maverick streak were evident at an early age. Mr. Lutz, who learned English at 8 while attending a Maine summer camp found himself at odds with instructors back in Europe, a self-described surly teenager who was kicked out of boarding schools.
 ''Many teachers didn't like me because, as always, there was a strong socialist mentality among many of the faculty,'' he wrote in 2007. ''Some of them wanted the Soviet Union to win the cold war, and I was the spoiled American brat. I determined to become a Marine fighter pilot and shoot down MIGs.''
 The Korean War ended just before Mr. Lutz, who holds dual Swiss and American citizenship, could satisfy his taste for combat. But his military training came in handy as he rose to prominence. He was put in charge of global sales and marketing for BMW, became chairman of Ford of Europe and in 1986 was recruited by Lee A. Iacocca to be president of Chrysler.
 Flying the notoriously unreliable military jets of the 1950s, Mr. Lutz said, meant encountering situations ''where if you didn't perform in a flawless manner, you were going to die. So in the corporate world, when everyone else getsunduly panic-stricken, you think back to that and say, 'What's the worst that could happen here?'''
 The bold management style and uncensored quips that endeared Mr. Lutz to reporters also put him at odds with environmentalists, politicians and others that he loved to tweak as guardians of political correctness.
 Some environmentalists viewed him as a throwback, an unrepentant promoter of gas-guzzling muscle cars and a member of the automotive old boys' club that got Detroit into trouble.
 Certainly, as a car guy, Mr. Lutz often doted on his most talented performers, from the Dodge Viper to the Corvette ZR1. He certainly raised eyebrows at the Detroit auto show in 2003 by showing off a mammoth luxury concept car, the Cadillac Sixteen, that had a V-16 engine rated at 1,000 horsepower.
 Yet Mr. Lutz said the media's infatuation with horsepower left him forever linked with cars like the Viper, rather than the more efficient models he also championed.
 ''People who characterize me as a mindless muscle-car, cubic-inches fanatic don't know my background,'' he said. ''I've always had a great fondness for relatively small and underpowered cars,'' citing the 1981 Ford Cockpit, a Ghia-bodied three-wheel concept car that topped 75 m.p.g.; the European version of the Ford Escort; and the inexpensive Pontiac Solstice roadster.
 Mr. Lutz rejected the notion that the Volt represented a late-in-life conversion or penance for past excess. The Volt may be at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Viper, yet he said they have a lot in common: ''The Viper never made the company a nickel, but it was a crucial statement for Chrysler.''
 The Volt will ultimately change people's minds about G.M., he added, recalling ''hoots of derision'' at its unveiling and Toyota's defensive response that lithium-ion batteries weren't safe or ready for prime time.
 ''It was seen as another example of G.M. pulling the wool over everybody's eyes,'' he said, ''with a car that we'd never put into production.''
 In two weeks, Mr. Lutz will hold court at the auto show in New York -- his last show with G.M. -- where journalists will drive Volt prototypes and check out the Chevy Cruze, another crucial bid by the company for small-car sales and respect.
 When the Volt begins rolling off the assembly line in November (silently, under electric power, as Mr. Lutz sees the day), he isn't likely to be there. But if the Volt works as advertised, and G.M. can recover its magic and market share, the plug-in Chevy may indeed be remembered as Bob's last baby, his final, sweet. told-you-so to the skeptics.
 ''The Volt is going to poke a finger in the eye of so many naysayers,'' Mr. Lutz said, as ever flashing the bravado of a pilot cleared for takeoff.

HEADLINE: A Stake In The Sand

BYLINE: By ANDREW RICE. 
Andrew Rice is a contributing writer and the author of a book about Uganda, ''The Teeth May Smile but the Heart Does Not Forget.''

 BODY:
The sands found Destin first. They started off eons ago, from the Appalachian Mountains, washing their way down the rivers that flow into the Gulf of Mexico. Winnowed to pure, hardy quartz, the sediment moved with the gulf's currents and gathered into the necklace of narrow barrier islands that buffer Florida's Panhandle. Time and tides refined the sand into a soft, sun-bleached powder. By the 1830s, when a Yankee sea captain named Leonard Destin sailed down to the wilderness of the Florida Territory, he discovered beaches as dazzling and white as a fresh blanket of snow. The sight evidently impressed the captain, for his reaction -- like that of so many migrants who followed -- was to claim a piece of the shore. Destin landed, built a New England Colonial-style house and started a fishing business, becoming the first recorded white settler in the beach town that now bears his name. 
 For a long time after that, very little changed in the community of Destin. Well into the 1970s, the town still had fewer than 2,000 full-time residents and was traversed by just one east-west thoroughfare, a two-lane highway with shoulders made of crushed seashells. But then word got out about its emerald green water, its mountainous dunes and, most of all, that sugary sand. Beachgoers arrived, followed by developers, who swiftly set about bulldozing Destin's pine barrens to build condominiums, amusement parks, golf resorts and luxury outlet malls, swelling the property-tax base to $4.5 billion. Flush with new tourism revenues, the town fathers adopted a sanguine civic motto: Destin was, they declared, ''the world's luckiest fishing village.''
 Among Destin's many blessings was a gift of coastal dynamics. There's an old saying that buying property is wise, because God isn't making any more of it. But that didn't seem to hold true in Destin. Because of the complexities of currents and bathymetry, the gulf kept bringing its beaches more sand. In the early 1980s, there was a major brouhaha over what to do with 60-some acres that had accreted to a peninsular spit called Holiday Isle, newfound land that was claimed by developers, and though that was an extreme case, all along the coast beaches were growing wider and more alluring. The Panhandle is conservative country, closer to Alabama than Miami, and the desires of property owners were seldom contravened. As speculators strung the coastline with hulking condo construction, only a few longtime residents remained wary of the folly of staking out shifting sands.
 One winter evening, I met a gray-bearded former fisherman named Dewey Destin -- Leonard's great-great-grandson and an elected councilman in his namesake town -- at a seafood restaurant he operates on one of the family's old pieces of waterfront. Gesturing out across a harbor toward Holiday Isle, he told me that before the development boom, ''people didn't build over there, because only a fool would live over there, because hurricanes would wash whatever you built away.'' When he was in high school, in the late 1960s, kids threw campfire parties out on the deserted peninsula. ''You look at it now,'' Destin said. ''You can see all the high-rises.'' And sure enough, a few of the developments over there were in danger of falling into the ocean, as waves encroached on their foundations. The town's luck had suffered a reversal: the sand nature had given, it was taking away. Destin was now eroding.
 In this, the town's plight was far from unusual. Both human interventions, like current-altering jetties, and natural phenomena -- storms, mostly, though rising sea levels should soon start to play a part -- have dire consequences for the world's coastlines, the vast majority of which are currently slipping out to sea. Destin's fortunes began to change in 1995, with Hurricane Opal, a Category 3 storm that wiped out 20-foot dunes and cut into the beach like a knife, changing its former tidal patterns. Over the following decade, its beaches eroded at a rate of roughly five feet per year. In order to safeguard their immense economic value and to augment the oceanfront's protection against future storms, Destin appealed to the government of Florida, which like many states operates a program to counter erosion along its 825 miles of sandy beaches, nearly half of which are designated as critically endangered.
 This ''nourishment'' program, which involves an expensive process of dredging and pumping submerged sand back onto beaches, has been around for four decades and is one of Florida's more popular public initiatives, a lifeline for many communities in a tourism-dependent state. So it came as a great surprise when, in Destin, the prospect of restoring the shore ran into fierce opposition. The battle over the beach, featuring charges of extremism, selfishness and dirty dealing, started as a typical squabble at town hall. But last December, it culminated with an argument before the United States Supreme Court.
 The legal case is complicated, but at its crux, it presents a conflict between private property rights and the public interest, one in which the court is weighing abstruse issues of eroding and accreting power. Yet on a practical level, it has left some legal scholars befuddled. Usually, people protest when they're losing something, not regaining. ''One of the great questions,'' says Benjamin Barros, a law professor at Widener University who has closely followed the case, ''is why would a beachfront property owner oppose beach nourishment?'' To answer that, you have to know the history of another question, one that has long bedeviled Destin: who owns that covetable sand?
 ''Private Beach,''the sign warned, with a big red stop signal. ''No Trespassing.''On a stormy morning, unusually high waves crashed almost to the base of the wooden signpost staked at the edge of Linda Cherry's property. ''The bottom line,'' Cherry was saying, ''is you've got to leave Mother Nature alone.'' As the wind whipped the thin strip of beach that separates the gulf from her three-story Destin vacation home, Cherry tried to explain how she'd become a leader in the fight against Florida's efforts to counter erosion. The details were a tad arcane, but the root justification was simple: she, too, just wanted to be left alone.
 A petite, aggressively effervescent 59-year-old, Cherry bought her beach house in 2004. She and her husband run a political polling firm in Florida's capital, Tallahassee, where she keeps a bronze bust of Ronald Reagan in her office. Cherry worked for both of Reagan's presidential campaigns and shares his conservative belief that government should have strictly limited powers over property holders. That's why she has a problem with nourishment, because under Florida law, a substantial portion of beach the program creates belongs to the state. ''They add 100 feet of sand,'' Cherry said. ''So you no longer own waterfront property, you own public beachfront property.''
 Her concerns were not simply a matter of abstract ideology. During peak summer weeks, an estimated 65,000 visitors descend on Destin, and Cherry would rather see the beach wash away than cede an inch of it to the sunbathing, beer-drinking, stereo-blaring masses. In this sense, the controversy surrounding the shrinking beach is not so much a matter of coastal dynamics, or constitutional rights, but rather the perennial divisions that afflict seaside development. The road Cherry lives on, Scenic Highway 98, was a wide-open strip a generation ago, but now it's lined with million-dollar villas, bunched together like stucco tenements. Yet even as the beach became barricaded with private property signs, developers continued to build at an overheated pace. As a consequence of overexpansion, there's been a surge of conflict over a diminishing resource, sand.
 Cherry, who owns three beachfront rentals in addition to her vacation house, originally came to Destin because of its reputation as an upscale retreat. Her comfortable living room is filled with books -- ''Little Pink House,'' about a Supreme Court clash over property rights, autobiographies of Dolly Parton and Trent Lott -- and has a big bay window, which gives her an expansive view of the usually placid gulf. When Cherry bought the place, she and her husband were looking forward to quiet weekends of reading, but instead, she has found herself dealing with a constant stream of interlopers. ''It's almost become a war zone,'' she said. She doesn't want to stop anyone from strolling past, she stresses, but the quarrels begin when people -- many of them spilling over from a public beach next door -- sit down and start making themselves at home.
 Later that afternoon, in her living room, Cherry introduced me to one of her neighbors, Mike Wright, the plain-spoken proprietor of a string of McDonald's franchises, who also bought his place in 2004. Together they recounted a litany of trespasses. Cherry has a problem with couples staging barefoot weddings outside her back door, while Wright told me he'd discovered people steaming in his hot tub. But mostly it was small-bore stuff, a catalog of gathering annoyances: noise, litter, trampled sea oats. Cherry pulled out a digital camera to show me incriminating pictures of sunny days, beached watercraft and multicolored umbrellas. ''A lot of it is innocent enough,'' Wright said. ''They don't realize it, even though we have signs there that say very clearly that this is private beach. The first words out of their mouth usually are, 'How in the world can you own the beach?' And it's like I tell my kids: through an awful lot of hard work.''
 Much as the homeowners might believe they've paid handsomely for their privacy, however, the public feels viscerally entitled to the shore. The sentiment has some legal basis. Centuries of jurisprudence have upheld the doctrine that a certain portion of the coastline is held in public trust. But what that means to beachgoers varies, in part because the archaic principle was intended to protect activities like fishing and navigation, not building sandcastles. Some states recognize a customary public right to use beaches for recreation, regardless of what property holders say, but others allow greater latitude for exclusion -- an issue that is a cause of widespread litigation. In the last decade, California courts have considered whether Malibu homeowners can post ''No Trespassing'' signs, while Connecticut's have declared that the beaches of Greenwich and other exclusive towns, which once barred nonresidents, are open to all. In Florida, the general rule is that the water belongs to the state, dry land belongs to the deed holder and the middle ground, the wet area between the high and low tide lines, is open to everyone. But because this demarcation involves a boundary -- the waterline -- that always moves, there is continual skirmishing along the border between public and private.
 In Destin, the battle for the beach began about a decade ago, not coincidentally, right around the time the area's real estate market exploded. (The average sale price of residential properties more than doubled during the first half of the 2000s and reached a peak of $950,000 in August 2006, according to data from the Emerald Coast Association of Realtors. Since the crash, the average has fallen back to around $350,000.) Worried that tourists were being chased off the beach, Destin's city council considered an ordinance to declare the first 20 feet of dry sand public. That was tabled, however, amid objections that it amounted to confiscation of property. Instead, the city fell back to what Dewey Destin called a deliberately ''nebulous policy,'' calling for sheriffs' deputies to act as informal arbitrators, determining the high tide line via markers like seaweed. Naturally, this has led to inconsistent enforcement and complaints from both sides.
 One summer day in 2004, Bob Biel, an air-conditioning contractor who had been coming to Destin since childhood, got enraged after he was kicked off the beach in front of a high-rise. ''It was never like this before,'' he told me. ''These are mostly people from up North who bought condos.'' A big Jimmy Buffet enthusiast, Biel got together some other local Parrot Heads -- members of the singer's fan club -- and staged a beach sit-in. In response to the public outcry, he says, the police relaxed their interpretation of the rules. But what Biel sees as victory feels like a violation to some beachfront owners. They say that in return for seeking the enforcement of trespassing laws, they've been sent hate mail and maligned by the local press. Some evictees curse them out or even push them around. ''We have been demonized,'' Mike Wright said, ''because we live the American dream.'' He went so far as to try to get a restraining order against a pair of men who twice tried to set up a row of fishing rods along his beach.
 By the time the proposal to rebuild Destin's beaches was made, Cherry and her allies were scrutinizing the government's every move for evidence of infringement. And they thought they found it in the fine print of Florida's law, which alters the way property boundaries are demarcated on nourished beaches by setting a fixed erosion control line, beyond which the shore is public. It's supposed to be a small trade-off for property owners, who get a bigger -- though shared -- taxpayer-financed beach, not to mention a more effective buffer against hurricanes. But Cherry saw it as a fool's bargain. ''They go into the effort of saying, 'We're doing this to protect the beach and to protect the upland owners,' '' she said. ''I'm sorry, you'll never in a million years get me to believe that. It was strictly to provide the public beach that they sought.''
 In response, Cherry and around 170 other property owners formed an organization called Save Our Beaches. Their cause caught the attention of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative group that advocates for strengthened property rights. Cherry raised money to hire a major Tallahassee law firm and brought a lawsuit to stop the nourishment. Craig Barker -- Destin's mayor and a Republican like most everyone in town -- wondered if some compromise could have been found between the relatively small number of complaining property owners and the larger public that wanted to share the beach, perhaps one centered on that small-town virtue of politeness. But the beach nourishment's opponents saw no constitutional room.
 ''If 10 very nice, well-mannered strangers come into your front yard and begin using your picnic table, and they're very, very nice -- is that acceptable to you?'' asked Shannon Goessling, the Southeastern Legal Foundation's executive director. Being a property owner means having the right to say, ''Keep out,'' she said. ''There is no middle ground.''
 A few miles down Destin's shoreline from Linda Cherry's house, middle ground was just as hard to see, as waves lapped against the base of Jetty East, a seven-story condominium complex. Jerry Stalnaker, an ex-military pilot who is the building's general manager, showed me around as construction equipment labored to replace a recently collapsed seawall. We walked down a boardwalk to a gazebo that was raised on stilts out over the ocean. Stalnaker had earlier showed me a picture of the same structure in 1989, separated from the gulf by hundreds of feet of white beach. ''It used to be you couldn't even see the water,'' he said. Now the sea was eating away at Jetty East.
 For years, Stalnaker -- along with municipal and county authorities -- has been begging the state government to restore some sand. But nothing has happened yet, because Jetty East's phase of the beach nourishment is embroiled in litigation brought by allies of Linda Cherry. ''I think they're a bunch of elitists,'' Stalnaker told me. Of course, you could argue that the original sin was building Jetty East in the first place, near the farthest tip of Destin's Holiday Isle peninsula. ''Nobody likes to admit when they've done something really stupid,'' says Orrin Pilkey, a Duke University geologist who is a world-renowned expert on erosion. He argues that it would be wiser to tear down misplaced properties than to fight an endless battle against the ocean. But that idea doesn't carry much weight in a place like Destin, where billions are invested along the waterline. ''We had to protect the golden goose,'' said Brad Pickel, a marine scientist and consultant who played a key role in devising the area's beach nourishment plan.
 The idea that new beach created through nourishment belongs to the public was upheld by Florida's State Supreme Court in 2008. But in a blistering dissent, one justice accused the majority of having ''butchered'' the law to create a ''dangerous precedent'' that altered the rights of waterfront-property owners. The wording seemed tailored to encourage an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the claim that the majority had acted so capriciously that its ruling amounted to an unconstitutional ''taking'' of property. This judicial takings theory is untested but popular among conservative thinkers affiliated with groups like the Pacific Legal Foundation, which helped the homeowners with their appeal. To universal surprise, the Supreme Court accepted the case.
 Last December, an attorney for the homeowners, Kent Safriet, made his argument before the Supreme Court. In questioning, several justices seemed quizzical about what exactly the property owners were being forced to give up. ''You didn't lose one inch,'' Stephen Breyer said. But others from the court's conservative wing sounded more sympathetic, hatching high-spirited hypotheticals about hot-dog vendors and raucous spring break parties. In the end, though, even Antonin Scalia seemed to waver. ''I'm not sure it's a bad deal,'' he said, later interjecting that the alternative ''may not change the property line, but all of your property might be underwater.''
 Linda Cherry was sitting in the gallery that day, feeling mixed emotions. On the one hand, she felt proud that her argument had made it to the highest court in the land. On the other, it was too late to save her beach from nourishment. Because of technicalities of legal standing, she and many of her neighbors had been ruled out of the case at a lower court level, and only a small subset of plaintiffs made it to the Supreme Court. In 2007, with her legal avenues exhausted, the project went ahead on Cherry's stretch of the beach. Over several days, huge pipes were run across her property, and a grayish slurry, sucked from the ocean bottom, was disgorged along her beachfront. Construction equipment moved the sand until it formed a new, much wider, partly public beach. Cherry wanted to stand in front of the bulldozers in protest, but her lawyers advised against it, for her safety. ''It had to be how the French felt when they saw the German tanks coming across their property,'' she said. ''It was an absolute, total violation of our constitutional rights.''
 When Cherry looks out her bay window to-day, she says she doesn't see any benefit. The waves seem to be creeping closer than ever. In fact, Orrin Pilkey says that restored beaches erode twice as quickly as natural ones. For its part, the state readily acknowledges that it can never add enough sand to win the fight against the tides. A good project is one that needs to be replenished once every 10 years.
 Not long ago, one of the ''No Trespassing'' signs Cherry put along her eastern property line was submerged by the advancing gulf. Cherry took it down but stored it underneath her house. She wants to be ready if the sands ever come back.

HEADLINE: The Optimist's Blogger

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER. 
Mark Oppenheimer writes the Beliefs column for The Times. He is also an editor for The New Haven Review, and his memoir, ''Wisenheimer: A Childhood Subject to Debate,'' will be published in April.

 BODY:
In February 2001,a Brown University graduate with the improbably suave name Lockhart Steele took up occupancy in a one-bedroom third-floor walk-up apartment on Rivington Street, near the intersection with Ludlow. The Lower East Side could still claim, just barely, to be a marginal neighborhood. Storefront synagogues and housing projects were still more typical than bars with ostentatiously unmarked doors. The neighborhood was a good fit for Lockhart Steele: they were both, as they say, in transition. 
 At the time, Steele's most glorious accomplishment was five years in the past. As a college senior, he co-wrote and self-published a compendium about the band Phish that soon became a bible for the band's international tribe of followers. But by 2001, he had left a job with an electronics trade magazine and then presided over the failure of an Internet start-up. Steele was a native of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., where, he says, ''they cared more about where you went to boarding school than where you went to college.'' But Steele (St. Paul's School, Class of 1992) was a city boy now, and when he came home to the Lower East Side he was intrigued by what he saw. New people were moving into the neighborhood -- younger people, interesting people. New restaurants and bars followed. Boutiques, too. Music clubs. Lots of life.
 Over the next year, he began posting to his Web site photographs of the neighborhood, as well as short news items about local goings-on. Soon, Lockhartsteele.com was an eccentric guide to a certain New York, reflecting the author's interests and the era in which he wrote. In October 2003 he posted about, among other things, the disgraced author James Frey, Schiller's Liquor Bar and Friendster. And about real estate -- Lachlan Murdoch's purchase of 11 Spring Street, Moby's rumored move to Essex and Canal. By early 2004, the site was getting about 3,000 page-views a day, largely on the strength of his wide-ranging real estate posts, which covered apartments, condos, restaurant openings and closings -- anything a New Yorker might do with square footage, a lease and a dream.
 In May 2004, Steele corralled his real estate posts onto a new site he called Curbed.com. The next year, Steele broke restaurants away to form Eater.com, a site he founded with Ben Leventhal, who now works for NBC; in 2007, shopping news moved to Racked.com. Since then, Curbed has also expanded to the Hamptons, Los Angeles and San Francisco; Racked is in Los Angeles as well as New York; Eater is in five cities, including Miami and Portland, Ore.; and a blog for travelers, Gridskipper, has joined the empire. But Steele's flagship remains New York Curbed, which, with its mix of original reporting, smart packaging of links and tips from readers, has become a prime purveyor of New York real estate porn: closing prices, zoning scuttlebutt, developers' delays, digital pictures taken at open houses.
 Amazingly, the audience for Curbed NY has grown steadily, even through the real estate downturn. At first, Steele figured that because Curbed was the quintessential read for good times, its finances would suffer in a recession. He laid off three people in New York, several more nationwide (about 10 to 20 percent of payroll, Steele estimates). But for Curbed the hard times never came. The New York site had 2.6 million unique visitors in 2009, its most ever, about 400,000 more than in 2008; Steele says that advertising revenue went up even faster, by 30 percent last year (Curbed won't release dollar amounts), and that the business started making a profit in the second half of 2009. Steele, who is now 36, explains the counterintuitive growth two ways. First, the young business simply kept growing up, getting better at selling ads, for example. Second, real estate companies ''that were buying full-page ads in Vanity Fair'' began making smaller, focused buys, and that was very good for sites like Curbed. 
 Both explanations make sense, but the rosy numbers also seem to validate Steele's original insight: that people are creatures of the neighborhood. Curbed, Eater and Racked are all broken down by borough -- Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens only -- with each borough searchable by neighborhood: NoLIta, SoHo and NoHo/Central Village may all be traversable in one 10-minute perambulation, but in Steele's world, each is its own precinct, with its own heroic architects, villainous developers, quixotic preservationists and celebrity real estate agents.
 Steele says that with the crash, Curbed's editorial tone became less cheeky and more sensitive to people's pain. That may be so, but the site still carries, in an obvious way, the DNA of the gossip site Gawker. Steele was the editorial director of Gawker Media, which also includes gossip sites like Deadspin, Gizmodo and Jezebel, from 2005 to 2007. The Gawker voice -- which Steele helped hone -- is snarky and knowing, but above all, it is episodic. In the Gawker world, every item is potentially part of a longer drama, a narrative to unfold in time (with links to old Gawker posts). At Curbed, the dramatis personae aren't adulterous actors and politicians but buildings, whose fortunes and misfortunes are chronicled in order to help the discerning buyer and to provide schadenfreude to the salivating reader.
 To take one example, the Palazzo Grey, a tenement redeveloped for five condominium units on Grand Street, has been the subject of seven posts in the last 18 months. The first post, in September 2008, mocked the building's Italianate name and inflated price tag. Subsequent posts mocked the owners' inability to find any buyers and the eventual leasing of ground-floor space to a Subway sandwich shop. The last post, from July 23, is a classic of Curbed sass, mocking several other Manhattan properties to boot: ''The city's finest new luxury residential buildings have a long and proud history of rewarding buyers with quick and easy dining options as close as possible to the comfort of their new homes. On 23rd Street, Gramercy Starck brought in the Golden Arches, leading to the 'McStarck' nickname. . . . In Harlem's record-setting 111 Central Park North, the more health-conscious Subway took space. Continuing that trend, and confirming a tipster's report, BelDel beacon Palazzo Grey has unveiled its new tenant. Eat fresh, Palazzo Grey, but know that Palazzo Chupi would never sink to such depths.''
 Curbed's open derision can certainly infuriate the city's developers and brokers. But none of them will say an unkind word about Steele. In part that's surely because he wields a certain amount of power: after what you just read, would you buy a unit in Palazzo Grey? But it's also because Curbed appeals to so many audiences: real-estate daydreamers; neighborhood residents who mourn the loss of local news in other venues; and industry professionals for whom Curbed is essential reading and, for top brokerages like Corcoran, Stribling and Prudential Douglas Elliman, an advertising venue. Above all, Curbed has become a buyer's tip sheet. Along with blogs like Brownstoner.com (based in Brooklyn), StreetEasy.com (heavier on the sales figures and lighter on the gossip) and BrickUnderground.com, Steele's site is a first stop for New Yorkers ready to move.
 Curbed, like Gawker, can be moralizing, even censorious. Just ask architects like Robert M. Scarano Jr. and Karl Fischer, perennial Curbed villains. But that's surely one reason that so many in the real estate community respect Steele. They see in him someone who thinks deeply about the character of neighborhoods. They notice that Curbed reserves its harshest criticism for those who flout zoning laws or -- worse -- do uncreative work. They recognize, above all, that at a time when the real estate market is as soft as a two-minute egg, Lockhart Steele keeps the faith. 
 Steele's implicit optimism -- that real estate, even when it deserves to be mocked, is always worth the attention -- makes him infectious. The first person I asked about Steele was Rachel Sklar, the former Huffington Post media writer, known for not suffering fools and for uncovering a lot of them. I expected a cool appraisal, some choice words putting Steele in context and taking the measure of the man. Here, in slightly condensed version, is what she said:
 ''The first time I met him, I responded the way a lot of people respond, which is, 'You're Lockhart Steele!' And going on and on about how his name sounded like a James Bond character -- how intimidating is that! Lockhart Steele with babes on each arm! Lockhart Steele will engage in a death battle in a back alley and emerge with a martini. Lock has been everywhere. . . . I have been to the Hamptons with Lock. Only once, but that counts. It's the only way to go to the Hamptons. . . . It is de rigueur for Lock to show up at various Manhattan A-list parties. He is that guy now. But he doesn't stray far from his intellectual, classically geeky roots, no matter how fabulously collared his flowered shirts are. . . . He's not just a real estate nerd. He is a fully formed New York renaissance man for the Internet era.''
 But Sklar insisted that while she had been to the Hamptons with Lock, and adored Lock, she wasn't in his inner circle. For that point of view, I had to talk to Brooke Hammerling, who founded Brew Media Relations, a hip public relations firm in New York. She was similarly effusive. ''He knows things are going to happen before they happen,'' she told me. ''He explained blogging to me before blogging was a known thing. Same with Twitter. Same with Foursquare. All mainstream now, naturally. He's my guide through the Internet world. My Yoda is Lockhart.''
 When asked about Steele, Dottie Herman, the head of Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate, the grand white-shoe firm, was less starry-eyed but in her way no less complimentary. She's more famous, and certainly more feared, than Steele, so she didn't sound overawed by him. But she sees in him a fellow entrepreneur and a useful ally -- she often feeds him tips about her new listings. Herman once invited Steele to address her senior managers. The way Steele tells it, she interrupted him at one point to announce to her employees that they had better pay attention to what he was saying. The Internet was the future of real estate, and Lockhart Steele was the Internet. Herman confirms the story: ''I said, 'Listen, the way you do it is over, and you better get with it.' ''
 What she meant is that thanks to people like Steele, the broker's job has changed. ''It's like if you get sick now, a lot of people will go to WebMD first,'' Herman says -- and Curbed is WebMD for real estate, the site where the novice goes to get up to speed. ''Your consumer is more informed, but not necessarily better informed.'' The broker's job is no longer to tell people what a house is worth, or what nearby properties have sold for -- everybody knows that now. Instead, a broker is more useful calming down a buyer agitated by a proliferation of Web gossip. The broker is less salesman, more therapist, or oracle. And by professional obligation, a daily reader of real estate blogs.
 The most sober assessment I heard of Steele came from the man himself. We spoke several times on the phone, then finally met for dinner at Momofuku Ssam Bar, the East Village restaurant owned by David Chang, who is a friend of Steele's. I recognized Steele. We debated against each other in regional competitions in high school, 20 years ago. And here, sitting across the table from me, was the same guy, practically unchanged, with the shaggy bowl cut and the soft voice. I was hoping to see one of the famous flowered shirts that Rachel Sklar had mentioned, but tonight his sweater and button-down could have come from the back of his prep-school closet. He didn't seem cool, which is probably why his cool friends think he's so cool. He wouldn't talk about his romantic life, but in other ways he was earnest and forthcoming. He volunteered that his father drank himself to death three years ago. And he told me that in 1997, he killed a St. Paul's classmate, his best friend, John-Christophe Schlesinger.
 ''If you're going to do a story about me, you should know the story,'' Steele said. ''I was driving early in the morning, and I fell asleep at the wheel, and we crashed and he died. It's something that's with me every day.'' I asked about how Schlesinger's parents treated him after that. ''If at some point in my life,'' he said, ''I am as good to people as they have been to me, that would be amazing.''
 After that, it was tough to ask Steele really pointed questions, but I tried. Curbed seems to waste little space on apartments worth less than half a million dollars, and Steele had already admitted, during one phone call, that Curbed didn't do much, or enough, to cover real estate in the normal person's price range. ''I think it's a fair critique,'' he said. ''I make this joke that blogs exist because people are bored at work -- which is to say people with white-collar jobs and big screens to stare at. That's undeniable.'' But he was not willing to admit that that might be a bad mission. To him, it was virtuous. ''If we're serving our audience, which is what any self-respecting publication should do, then undeniably we're serving a more upscale audience than any slice of New York.'' But it still might be morally ambiguous. ''Part of the job of Curbed is to turn news into something wry and readable. But how do you do that with affordable housing? We try to cover that, but when we do, we end up as dry and self-important as those topics can be.''
 The fact that Curbed doesn't even cover the Bronx, for instance, suggests the limits of the Lockhart Steele vision, as well as the limits of what high-end advertisers want to support. At dinner, he tried, with some success, to have it both ways. ''I am not,'' he said, ''going to deny there is some general societal good in creating entertaining media. It's fun, and I don't think we need to pretend to a higher good than that to justify our existence.'' But, he added, ''if I were going to try to pretend we're doing some great societal good, we're part of this overall trend toward transparency. This industry has been traditionally closed to consumers. . . . We create more of a balance of power between the industry and the people making the biggest purchase of their lives.''
 To create that balance of power, the information needs to be reliable, and Curbed has made strides in ensuring the accuracy of its reporting. ''If you look back at what blogging was five years ago,'' Steele said, ''the rules have transitioned from being a little bit Wild West, anything goes to drawing closer to fundamental rules in play for print publications.'' He pointed to a story Curbed ran on Jan. 21 about a building at 211 Elizabeth Street. ''It's really fancy, a condo building, prices high, has a name-brand interior designer, name-brand real estate brokerage is selling it. Every reason to believe it's a quality project. But we get an e-mail from a reader who has purchased in the building and is very, very unhappy with the quality of work in this place. And she sent us basically a rant -- water leak, flood.'' In the old days, Steele says, he might have just posted the rant. 
 But in this case, Steele said, his writer Joey Arak wrote to the woman. ''He writes back to her, like, 'O.K., if we're going to do this story, like, do you have some photos or other ways to back up your claims?' Sure enough, she sends on a whole bunch of photos. Then we go to the developers, like, 'Hey we got this complaint from a reader, do you want to respond?' And the final post includes the woman's claims, photos and a post from the developer. That is pretty standard journalism.''
 Well, more or less -- Arak didn't ask to see the condo in question or track down other owners in the building. But in the Curbediverse, as the site modestly calls the world whose story it tells, every new building, every architectural misstep, every bit of shoddy construction, every scrumptious Sunday open house and every regrettable ground-floor Subway has its moment on the screen, for all eyes to see. So that neighbors can whisper, so that buyers can reconsider the neighborhood.
 Steele still lives in the same Rivington Street apartment whose sidewalk life inspired him to start blogging. ''I am probably about ready to buy a place and have been too busy working to get around to it,'' he said. He's ''probably overdue for a move.'' It's ''probably ridiculous'' that he has stayed in one place. Then again, it seems doubtful that he's in a hurry to leave. ''I like where I live,'' he said, as if a confession has been forced from him. ''I love my neighborhood.'' 
 And if he were to move, if he were to raise the profile of some new building with his very chic, very flower-shirted presence, then tell me: who would tip off Curbed?

HEADLINE: For Asia, Some Familiar Hallways

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
ASIA is beginning to look a lot more like America -- at least when it comes to hotels. 
 Major United States hotel chains are aggressively expanding into Asia, creating new options for travelers looking for familiar brands abroad. Starwood Hotels & Resorts plans to open 34 to 40 properties in the Asia Pacific region this year, or about three hotels a month, including the first St. Regis in Japan, the first W in Thailand and the first Le Meridien in Taiwan. Hilton plans to open new hotels in Japan and China by year-end. And Marriott will add about 20 properties, including four JW Marriott properties in India, four Courtyard by Marriott properties in China, and a Ritz-Carlton in Shanghai.
 The expansions are being driven by United States hotel companies eyeing largely untapped Asian markets, particularly in India and China, where emerging economies are expected to generate an increase in travel. ''The battle for the foreign traveler is intensifying,'' said Vivian Deuschl, a spokeswoman for the Ritz-Carlton brand, which has six hotels throughout China, with a second Shanghai location in Pudong opening in early May. In the fall, it plans to open what is billed as the world's tallest hotel on the harbor in Kowloon, an area in Hong Kong. 
 But the increasing presence of American hotel chains in Asia is also a welcome development for travelers who like to earn points for their loyalty to a particular chain or who simply don't want any surprises when they walk into their hotel. 
 ''Americans are not as comfortable in Asia yet,'' said Joe Brancatelli, publisher of Joesentme.com, a subscription travel site focused on business travel. Unless booking at the high end with an Asian luxury brand like Taj or Oberoi, he added, Americans ''don't know what they're getting.''
 Indeed, though the Internet has made it easier for travelers to research just about any place online, it can be difficult to tell whether the advertised bathroom with tub and shower really includes a standing shower or just a tub with a hand-held showerhead hose. The American chains, with their cookie-cutter rooms, standard showers and English speakers, offer something of peace of mind in this sense -- a familiar place to return to after the culture shock that can set in when exploring a foreign city. 
 They also tend to offer more value for the money than their United States counterparts. A 50-minute massage at the new Ritz-Carlton Shanghai, Pudong, will cost $90. A 50-minute massage at the Ritz-Carlton Dallas: $125. 
 But travelers say the service and amenities are really what set them apart. ''The biggest difference is the number and quality of restaurants in Asian hotels,'' said J. P. Drevline, an elite Starwood hotel member from Kohler, Wis., who recently stayed at the Sheraton Hong Kong. ''There were multiple places to eat, including a Morton's steakhouse, an upscale bar on the top floor, and an extensive spread at the breakfast buffet,'' he said. ''Compared to the even new, and newly renovated, Sheratons in the U.S., this is a huge difference.'' 
 Mr. Drevline also said he appreciated the small staff-to-guest ratio common in Asian hotels, but added ''it can be overwhelming'' at times. At the Grand Hyatt Mumbai, he said, ''I once had three people trying to help me at once when just walking through the lobby, not needing anything.'' 
 The difference in service and amenities is perhaps nowhere more apparent than in the growing midmarket segment, which in the United States is often made up of no more than gussied-up motels. In Asia, the same hotels are much more robust, typically offering larger rooms, better service and the kind of amenities found in full-service hotels in the United States. 
 Starwood's Aloft brand, for example, offers a ''grab'n go'' area in the United States, where guests can purchase snacks and drinks. In Beijing, it offers a full-service sit-down restaurant. (Three more Aloft hotels are planned to open in India this year and another in Bangkok.)
 Courtyard by Marriott -- with 22 Asian locations including Beijing; Chennai, India; and Phuket, Thailand -- offers at least one sit-down restaurant as well as room service. At the same brand in the United States, guests purchase hot and cold drinks, grab-and-go salads, sandwiches and snacks from a 24/7 market. In Thailand, Courtyard hotels (with the exception of Bangkok) offer a free children's club called Kids World with a mini movie theater, science lab, pool table and video games. That's on top of the usual hotel pool with water slides. 
 And prices are comparable if not cheaper than the United States counterparts that don't offer all the extras. The Courtyard Boca Raton in Florida, for example, was recently listed on the Marriott Web site as $129 a night for a one-night stay in early April. The Courtyard Phuket at Kamala Beach: $110 a night. 
 One of the reasons staff-to-guest ratios and service are so much better in Asia and other regions outside the United States is that the cost of labor is significantly cheaper, allowing hotels to hire more workers and offer more services for less. But the culture also plays a role. 
 ''Asian people are known for their hospitality,'' said Deepi Mehta, owner of a Travel Leaders agency in Houston that books a lot of travel to India and China. ''In India if they meet a stranger on the road and find you are a foreigner, they will invite you to their house.'' 
 Yet even when most of the workers at the hotel are local, staying at an American hotel chain while abroad may be missing the point. And there are plenty of reasonably priced Asian hotel chains for American travelers looking for something more immersive. 
 Jeffrey L. Hunt, who owns a sustainable-wood company in Berkeley, Calif., and his wife, Marion, have found local properties preferable to American chains on recent trips to Asia. Among their favorites is the Caravelle Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where they stayed last year. Instead of lining up at the front desk, Mr. Hunt said, he and his wife were escorted to the business lounge and offered a drink during check-in. ''Upgrades are always offered on the spot, often with no upcharge,'' he said. And turndown happens ''after you go out for the evening, rather than a knock and an offer while you are getting ready to go out.'' 
 Ms. Mehta of the Travel Leaders agency recommends the Oberoi Group's Trident hotel brand and Gateway Hotels from the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces. ''You will pay less but you still have good quality.''

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
CLOSE your eyes and picture your dream apartment. Do you see light streaming through big open windows? Is there a large kitchen? Nice prewar detail? 
 Now open your eyes and remember that you are in New York City -- an extraordinarily expensive place to live, recession or no recession. So, what would you sacrifice to get a great place? 
 For many people, the answer can be summed up in one little word: elevator. If you are willing and able to climb the stairs to the fourth or fifth floor of one of New York City's 147,500 walk-ups, you may be rewarded with a little something extra at the top, like a better price, some private outdoor space or a great view.
 ''I grew up in Europe where there are lots of old buildings, so the stairs are natural,'' said Stephan Wessels, who lives on the fifth floor of a walk-up building with his wife, Elinor, and baby daughter, Juliana. ''I like the light, I like the fact that it's open, I like that nobody is on top of me making noise.'' 
 Nonetheless, Mr. and Mrs. Wessels are trying to sell their Upper East Side apartment. Not to shed those four flights of stairs, he says, but because they want a second bedroom. Their child's crib is now in the hall. 
 ''Fresh Direct delivers all the way up,'' Mr. Wessels said. ''That's a good thing to bear in mind.'' 
 Their apartment, No. 5W at 334 East 83rd Street, has 700 square feet, with good light and a decorative fireplace. It's listed at $400,000, a lower price than comparable apartments nearby that do not require a climb. Last week, a similarly sized one-bedroom in an elevator building a few blocks away had an asking price of $445,000.
 ''Normally in a building that's not a walk-up, the higher you go, the more expensive it is,'' said Philip Horigan, the Corcoran broker with the listing on the Wessels property. ''But in a walk-up, the more you walk up, the cheaper it is. But you still get more light and more square footage.'' 
 In addition to shaving money off the purchase price, a daunting set of stairs might also save an owner money on the monthly maintenance. 
 ''It's a smaller segment of the market that's willing to walk four flights or more,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a partner in Condominium Recovery, which invests in real estate. ''Most of these buildings are co-ops, and the share allocations are smaller as you go up because the value diminishes.'' 
 In a soft market like this one, buyers are often unwilling to make sacrifices. So a drawback -- a location in neighborhoods politely referred to as ''emerging,'' say, or the lack of an elevator -- can be an even bigger-than-usual drag on the price. 
 ''We couldn't believe what we got for the money,'' said Wendy Lichtenberg, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman whose stepdaughter just bought a large one-bedroom in a fifth-floor walk-up on the Upper East Side for under $600,000. ''Up 56 stairs to the Enchanted Egg,'' as we call it. 
 ''It's her stairway to heaven,'' Ms. Lichtenberg added. ''Though honestly, at my age, would I want to walk up all those stairs? No, I would not.''
 For young buyers, hoofing it may be the best way to get a top-notch apartment. 
 When Dani Super was apartment-hunting in her mid-20s, she needed a second opinion. Ms. Super took her mother, a former real estate broker, to a three-bedroom on the fifth floor of a late 19th-century walk-up building in Chelsea -- a place with the bones and architectural details to suggest that a woman in a hoop skirt might swish down the hallway at any moment. 
 ''She walked in and screamed, 'We'll take it!' '' Ms. Super said, demonstrating how her mother marched through the apartment, charged with absolute certainty. ''This is it,'' her mother pronounced. ''You want something like this? You'll walk.'' 
 She walked. But now, a decade later, that apartment, at 140 West 16th Street, is on the market again.
 Ms. Super and her husband, Mike Davis, renovated the apartment two years ago with every intention of staying put. They updated the bathroom and the kitchen and built new closets in the master bedroom -- Ms. Super points out that the closets blend nicely with the Old World style of the apartment, but are outfitted to handle today's shoes. 
 But Ms. Super has a bad hip, and she and her doctors have decided that in the long run, it would be best if she skipped the stairs. So she and her husband are asking $1.295 million for their 1,600-square-foot apartment in the district of the well-regarded Public School 41. 
 ''We'll probably look for exactly the same thing,'' Ms. Super said, ''just in Brooklyn and on the first floor.'' 
 One feature that many top-floor walk-ups share is private outdoor space -- and some buyers think hauling laundry up a few flights is not so bad if you're just a few steps away from a nice quiet place to get a tan. 
 Jerry Minsky, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, is selling a two-bedroom on the fifth floor of 328 Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn for $672,000. The price is no steal for a two-bedroom in that neighborhood -- Clinton Hill -- but at the top of those stairs is a private roof deck with panoramic views of brownstone Brooklyn and the Manhattan skyline.
 ''This is probably the way I should sell it,'' Mr. Minsky said, leaning back in a chair and pointing his face toward the sky. ''I should just sit up here with a buyer for an hour.''
 But that may not cut it. Walk-ups can be a tricky sell, because it takes a delicate blend of circumstances to create a happy walk-up resident. 
 For a buyer of a certain age, all those stairs throw a wet blanket over the thrill of saving thousands of dollars. Having an elderly canine member of the family can make the journeys up and down tiresome, time consuming and kind of sad. And even people in the prime of life with the stamina to launch themselves from the first floor to the fifth without trouble -- hey, it's aerobic exercise, right? -- may find the climb unbearable if they are hauling along toddlers and strollers, too. 
 When Steve Linares moved to New York last year with his wife and two small children, he rented an apartment on the fourth floor of a walk-up in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. At the time he didn't even think about the stairs. 
 ''I figured it was just one of the things that happened when you got to New York,'' he said. ''We moved here from California, I parked the truck outside and started moving things up stairs. I hated it that day.''
 The apartment did not grow on him. 
 ''It would be different if I was by myself,'' Mr. Linares said. ''But a 3-year-old wants to be carried on the way up and on the way down. You have the stroller. You have two backpacks. You frequently have to make two different trips.'' 
 Mr. Linares, who is now separated, moved out this month. He has stairs inside his new rental, but his apartment door is on the ground floor.
 So, would he buy in a walk-up?
 ''No,'' he said. ''Definitely not.'' 
 Banks, too, can be squeamish about stairs. Some will not finance above the fifth floor of a walk-up building. Others will not go above the fourth. 
 ''A lot of banks just won't do it because of marketability,'' said Julie Teitel, a mortgage broker at GuardHill Capital. ''I have a friend who has had a walk-up on the market for a year and a half, and they've lowered the price a lot. I'm tempted to buy it myself, but then no older people will come over.'' 
 Veronica Coppey made a fourth-floor walk-up in Riverdale work for herfor over 45 years -- all the way through her 70s, and through three children. Now 81, she moved to an elevator building in the fall. 
 ''I've always loved it,'' Ms. Coppey said. ''But it became more of a big deal as the years went on. My lady friends found it harder and harder to visit.''
 The apartment has nice prewar detail -- including a dumbwaiter. But since many buyers in New York agree with Ms. Coppey's lady friends, Daniel Wright, a vice president at Halstead, has priced it accordingly. The asking price for her two-bedroom -- at 525 West 238th Street, a prewar building with Tudor flourishes -- is $275,000.
 The Halstead Web site describes it plainly as the top floor of a walk-up. But some brokers are so concerned that the stairs will spook potential buyers that they don't mention this particular feature in the advertisement. They prefer to get the prospective buyer on the phone first, then slip in a mention of the stairs somewhere between descriptions of the light and the view.
 Julie Rhinehart, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens, believes in being upfront. 
 Ms. Rhinehart is selling a small renovated three-bedroom at 397 Seventh Street in Park Slope for $859,000. In exchange for climbing to the fourth floor, you get a 250-square-foot roof deck with views of Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty and the harbor. The online ad is frank about the top floor.
 ''I put it right on the Web site,'' Ms. Rhinehart said, ''because the best way to market a property is to sell it for what it is.
 ''This is what the housing stock is made of. When you get to New York City, walks-up are a way of life.''

HEADLINE: Who Needs Wall Street?

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, an outside director of the Sequoia Fund, is a contributing writer for the magazine. His book ''The End of Wall Street'' will be published next month.

 BODY:
Mike Mayo is a veteran of six Wall Street banks. In the wake of the street's disaster, he found refuge at a boutique brokerage and has lately taken to startling his peers with the question ''What part of Goldman Sachs is good for the country?'' 
 Regular people will be tempted to answer, ''None of it,'' but the question reminds us that, at least in theory, Wall Street serves society (not the other way around). And as opposed to Harrah's, Trump Casino and their ilk, Wall Street is endorsed and regulated -- with marked restraint -- so as to let it perform an important task. 
 Because some people have savings and others need capital, some unifying force must bring the two together. Royalty once taxed its citizens and chartered corporations. Wall Street privatized this function, aggregating the savings of disparate individuals through the sale of stocks and bonds. Industry thus gained access to capital; what's more, public markets performed a miracle of equivalence. Quotations on the stock exchange effectively calibrated, down to the penny, how many hours' worth of wages would afford a share of General Motors. 
 Since the street stood at the intersection of capital and savings -- or, if you will, of insiders and Main Street -- the potential for conflict was rife. No firm better resisted the temptations than Goldman, which, from its founding in 1869 through recent decades, epitomized, with only rare slip-ups, the best of American finance. Serving the client was its lodestar, and its bankers were pillars of society, more conversant in literature than in the vagaries of, say, mortgage securities. 
 Wall Street's emphasis began to change in the '90s, as financiers devised new securities -- the more incomprehensible, or so it seemed, the better. These instruments, in the main, did not involve selling bonds so that a DuPont could build new factories; they were rearrangements -- new permutations, new alignments of risk -- on flows of cash that already existed. Most famous was the trading that stemmed from complex derivatives (like mortgages) with only a remote connection to the underlying product. For all the trading in mortgage-backed securities, homeownership increased only a trivial amount. 
 The benefit to Wall Street was far more direct. The point of these and many other new financial instruments was to charge a hefty fee and to furiously trade them, and no one was in a better position to do that than their Wall Street creators. 
 If trading was, for society, a zero-sum game (someone wins, someone loses), it was, for the street, a gold mine. Greater emphasis on trading affected a subtle change in the culture, in particular at Goldman. In 1999, it sold shares to the public, diluting its long-term ethos. Its traders, formerly restrained by bankers, clamored for more of the firm's capital. 
 In 2006, when Lloyd Blankfein, a onetime gold salesman, assumed command, the coup was complete. But it did not become so stingingly clear until this year, when Blankfein was induced to bare his soul before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. 
 Asked about mortgage securities that Goldman both sold to clients and bet against, Blankfein, while expressing regret for what he admitted was improper behavior, added: ''In our market-making function, we are a principal. We represent the other side of what people want to do.'' He went on to say that when Goldman sells a security that subsequently goes up (i.e., on which the other party makes money), ''we wish we hadn't sold it.'' So much for putting the customer first.
 For much of Wall Street, capital-raising is now a sideshow. At Goldman, trading and investing for the firm's account produced 76 percent of revenue last year. Investment banking, which raises capital for productive enterprise, accounted for a mere 11 percent. Other than that, it could have been a hedge fund.
 Brokers recite, endlessly, that trading is vital because, without it, there wouldn't be a way for shareholders to exit, thus investors would fear to commit capital in the first place. Within limits, this is true. Thus, at modest levels, the willingness of traders to buy and sell from the rest of us gooses confidence.
 But the value of such ''liquidity'' has been vastly oversold. The notion that ever more trading makes for successively better markets is one of Wall Street's great myths. People think liquidity will keep markets stable, but the crisis of 2008 says otherwise. In a crisis, liquidity disappears. 
 Modern markets are more likely afflicted with too much trading. Think of oil and its dizzying fluctuations. As the volume from speculators and momentum traders dwarfs that of long-term investors, prices gyrate further from fundamental value. Raising capital thus becomes, to paraphrase John Maynard Keynes, the byproduct of a casino. 
 The casino charge is most plausibly leveled at credit-default swaps, the bete noire of A.I.G., Greece and others. Such swaps let traders bet on the odds of default (of a corporate or, indeed, a sovereign bond). If swaps traded in Las Vegas -- if bets against, say, Goldman's bonds swamped the casino, causing Goldman's lenders to refuse it credit -- an uproar would ensue. This actually happened to banks in 2008. 
 The social utility of credit-default swaps is ostensibly the insurance function. (Fear that a bond will default? Buy a swap that pays out in the event.) But most traders do not own the bond, and they have nothing to ''insure.'' Like the fellow who takes a policy on his neighbor's house, they are simply betting on disaster. 
 Swaps are used by banks as a hedge against risky loans, but the effect is problematic. The danger of hypertrading is that it affords an illusion of a continuously available exit; investors feel less need to scrutinize their assets. So it is with bankers. If every loan can be traded away, why worry about risk? Thanks to swaps, banks write more suspect loans and, over all, society is more exposed. At least in an actual casino, the damage is contained to gamblers. The street's undertow is more serious. Following the debacle, the economy lost eight million jobs. 
 The question is whether the social balance would improve if Wall Street were less devoted to games of chance. In the 1970s, James Tobin, a future Nobel laureate, proposed a transfer tax to throw ''sand in the gears'' of currency markets. Tobin feared that too much trading could destabilize currencies (he has often been proved right). 
 The idea of a transfer tax, on financial trading generally, has resurfaced. European leaders, like Gordon Brown in England, are in favor. Timothy Geithner, the U.S. Treasury secretary, has resisted the idea. The ideal of a frictionless market is so instinctual that we have lost sight of the peril that comes with speed. Maybe it's time to slow the markets down.

HEADLINE: Character and Career, Both Alive

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
IN the first two seasons of the AMC drama ''Breaking Bad,'' Jesse Pinkman has been party to acts of larceny, blackmail, murder and other felonies; lost his girlfriend as a result of her drug abuse; and fallen back so hard on his own addiction that he eventually ended up in rehab. As Jesse, a seedy, selfish drug maker and dealer endures these hardships, Aaron Paul, the 30-year-old actor who plays him, could hardly be happier.
 ''I'm just so thankful that Jesse's alive and breathing,'' he said in a recent telephone interview.
 Mr. Paul is not simply glad to be working on ''Breaking Bad,'' the acclaimed series that returns for its third season on Sunday, or to be sharing a screen with Bryan Cranston, a two-time Emmy Award-winner who plays Walter White, a cancer patient whose desperation draws him further and further into the drug trade. 
 What he means is, he is grateful that the ''Breaking Bad'' producers have not yet fulfilled their ambitions of killing off Jesse, a role for which Mr. Paul received an Emmy nomination last season, even though they have toyed with the possibility since its very first episode.
 ''In my mind's eye,'' said Vince Gilligan, the creator of ''Breaking Bad,'' ''I pictured a big season-ender for Season 1 in which Jesse Pinkman gets horribly murdered in a drug deal gone terribly wrong.'' This would be, Mr. Gilligan added, ''a very mechanical plot development that would force Walt to be guilty and second-guess his decision to become a drug dealer.''
 But what he and his colleagues realized is that Jesse added necessary ingredients to the ''Breaking Bad'' formula, a contrast to Walt and an element of integrity to two otherwise utterly corrupt characters. 
 Needless to say, when Mr. Paul was cast on ''Breaking Bad'' as Jesse, a crystal-meth cooker who is roped into a partnership with Walter, his former high school chemistry teacher, he had few experiences in common with the character. (''Not at all,'' Mr. Paul said for emphasis. ''Not. At. All.'')
 A baby-faced young man who speaks with a McConaugheyian hey-dude drawl, Mr. Paul (who was born Aaron Paul Sturtevant) moved from his native Idaho to Los Angeles when he was 17 and quickly found acting work in everything from Corn Pops commercials to a Korn music video. 
 He had already been cast on the HBO series ''Big Love'' as the relatively strait-laced boyfriend (now husband) of the rebellious Sarah (Amanda Seyfried) when the ''Breaking Bad'' pilot script came his way. ''I was like, this is the best thing I have ever read,'' Mr. Paul recalled, ''and also there's no way that this show will ever see the light of day. It was so intense from the very first page.'' 
 That prediction proved wrong, as did Mr. Gilligan's original forecast that Jesse would be dead by the end of the first season. (When he informed Mr. Paul that he would be sticking around, Mr. Gilligan recalled, ''he couldn't get past the whole I-was-going-to-kill-off-your-character thing. He got very nervous. I said: 'No, no, no. This is a good thing.' '')
 Instead, over the course of those original seven episodes, Mr. Gilligan said he discovered to his surprise that Jesse was ''a moral center of this show.'' 
 Though Jesse was deep into his own drug activity before he got connected with Walter, he has a naivete and a questioning nature that Mr. Gilligan said makes him ''the good guy of the two bad guys.'' 
 ''The question that arises very quickly in the writers' room,'' Mr. Gilligan said, ''is, how long will Jesse's innocence survive Walt's corrupting nature? If he was a good father figure, he would be getting Jesse out of the business. Instead he's taken him a lot further down that path than Jesse would have ever gone alone.'' 
 Mr. Cranston, who has seen Mr. Paul in various stages of undress, been stranded with him in a recreational vehicle in the Albuquerque desert and been held captive with him in the home of a rival drug lord, agreed that Mr. Paul's inherent virtue was crucial to the role. 
 ''There's an innocence about him,'' Mr. Cranston said. ''Maybe it has something to do with him coming from Idaho.''
 After one particularly grueling location shoot, Mr. Cranston recalled, ''we're wiping our brows and he just said to me, 'Aw, man, that was so much fun.' 
 ''And I looked at him, and he was like a boy to me, and I said: 'Aaron, that's my wish for you. I hope you never lose that enthusiasm.' '' 
 In the coming season of ''Breaking Bad,'' which starts with Jesse in rehab but finds him gradually working his way back to his partnership with Walter, any remaining purity of his character will be tested, Mr. Paul said, and he will largely fail.
 Jesse is still grieving for his dead girlfriend, Jane (Krysten Ritter), and still holding himself responsible for a plane crash caused by Jane's father, an air-traffic controller. Amid that, Jesse ''has come to a realization that there is a dark side to him, and he has to live with that,'' Mr. Paul said. ''He's like, 'I deserve this.' ''
 In preparation for this season, Mr. Paul said, he spent time at a rehabilitation clinic in Albuquerque, where ''Breaking Bad'' is filmed, observing its patients and interviewing its director. ''I was trying to see, why wouldn't Jesse just leave?'' Mr. Paul said. The facility's director told him, ''Whenever they want, there's a door for them to walk out of, but a lot of these people, they want to make a change in their life.''
 That kind of dedication helped earn Mr. Paul an Emmy nomination for supporting actor in a dramatic series. But it has also made him a target of those who begrudge his accomplishments. 
 Mr. Paul said he infrequently returns home to Idaho, partly to avoid awkward encounters with resentful former classmates. 
 ''They would walk by me and go, 'I could do what you do,' '' he said. ''I'm like, 'O.K., well, then, you should do it, buddy.' They're like, 'You're not even that funny.' I'm like: 'I really agree with you. I am not that funny.' Hey, if I can do it, anyone can do it, right?'' 
 So far, Mr. Paul said, the critical esteem for ''Breaking Bad'' has not unleashed a tide of exciting new job prospects. ''The roles that are coming my way are, 'Oh, play our lovable drug addict,' '' he said. ''I'm trying to have some longevity in this business. If that means not working for a while and just picking the right job, so be it.''
 He continued: ''In other words, yes, I'm definitely unemployed.''
 In the meantime, Mr. Paul said, he awaits AMC's decision on a fourth season of ''Breaking Bad,'' for which its producers will almost certainly be bringing him back. 
 ''They're like, 'So, how tall are you?' I'm like, 'Depending on what time of day it is, 5-8, 5-8 1/2.' ''
 Asked why they wanted to know, Mr. Paul was told: ''We need to measure you for your casket. I'm like, 'Oh, fantastic.' ''

HEADLINE: Less Interest in Interest-Only

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
BORROWERS have had fewer mortgage choices in recent years, and now the list is shrinking further.
 Freddie Mac, one of the two government-sponsored companies that set lending standards for mortgages, announced last month that in September it would stop backing interest-only mortgages, or loans that give borrowers the option of paying only the interest on the principal balance for a period of time. 
 Michael Cosgrove, a Freddie Mac spokesman, said the company had actually begun phasing out the loans last year, after big losses on the mortgages in the previous three years. 
 At the end of 2009, Mr. Cosgrove said, nearly 18 percent of the interest-only loans in Freddie Mac's portfolio were at least three months delinquent, versus 7 percent for all of the company's loans.
 Fannie Mae, too, has announced huge losses on interest-only mortgages, but a spokeswoman would not say whether the company might shut off these loans.
 Borrowers will still have options. Smaller lenders say they will most likely continue making interest-only mortgages, but only to the borrowers best suited to them.
 ''For the right people, an interest-only loan is a great product,'' said Michael Moskowitz, the chief executive of Equity Now in Manhattan. The loans work best, he said, for wealthier and financially disciplined borrowers. 
 In a typical interest-only mortgage, borrowers choose a fixed- or variable-rate loan, and they pay only the interest on the mortgage for the first 10 years. They then pay the principal and interest for the next 20 years.
 The monthly mortgage bill, therefore, can jump in the 11th year. On a $500,000 loan with a 5 percent fixed rate for 30 years, the monthly payment for the first decade is $2,083, but then it jumps to $3,300 for the remaining 20. (Payment on a traditional 30-year mortgage would be $2,684.) 
 Because such loans are considered riskier than conventional ones, fewer lenders offer fixed-rate interest-only mortgages, and the rates from those that do are typically a percentage point higher. 
 But interest-only ARMs, or adjustable-rate mortgages, still carry attractive rates. In mid-March, Mr. Moskowitz said, borrowers with good credit could get a 4.5 percent initial rate that would remain fixed for five years, then increase a maximum of five percentage points over the following five years.
 These days, borrowers cannot qualify for the loan unless they show they can pay that 9.5 percent rate, known as the ''fully indexed'' rate. Before the mortgage crisis, borrowers often could qualify for the loans simply by showing that they could afford the lowest rate.
 John P. Bonora, a vice president of Fairfield County Bank in Ridgefield, Conn., says that an interest-only loan is most appropriate for someone who doesn't intend to keep his home for many years, or who needs greater cash-flow options.
 But many of those who took out interest-only loans at the peak of the market did so because that was the only way they could afford the payments, he and other mortgage executives say. 
 These borrowers assumed, given the market's seemingly unyielding ascent, that they could simply sell their homes for a hefty gain before the interest-only period ended. Or, they reasoned, they might refinance the loan into a conventional fixed-rate mortgage as their earning power increased with time.
 Financing out of an interest-only loan may not be easy. 
 Regina Mincey-Garlin, an owner of RCG Mortgage Solutions in Montclair, N.J., says laws in New Jersey stipulate that interest-only borrowers (and all other borrowers, for that matter) refinance only if their payments are going down, or they are adopting a fixed-rate loan. 
 Marissa Aquila, a staff lawyer with Bankers Advisory in Belmont, Mass., says similar laws exist in many states, including New York and Connecticut. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 28, 2010

 CORRECTION:
The Mortgages column last Sunday, about the decision by Freddie Mac -- one of two government-sponsored companies that set lending standards for mortgages -- to stop backing interest-only mortgages, misstated the percentage of the company's loans that were delinquent at the end of last year. It was 3.98 percent, not 7 percent.

HEADLINE: The Low-Hanging Fruit of Saving Fuel

BYLINE: By TIM MORAN

 BODY:
IT'S been a standard trick among miserly drivers for years: shutting off the engine in stopped traffic and at long stoplights instead of burning gasoline while idling. And it is such a straightforward fuel-saver that shutoff systems -- with the addition of automated restart provisions -- are a standard feature of today's hybrids. 
 Now, European and Asian automakers are bringing idle-shutdown systems to market for nonhybrid cars. Porsche's Auto Stop Start is fitted to the 2010 Panamera, and BMW has a shutoff good for fuel savings of some 5 percent on 4-cylinder engines in Europe; the company says the feature will come to the United States. Others, including Mazda, are limiting the technology to specific markets. Automakers also working in this area include Audi, Citroen, Ford, Kia, Mercedes, Opel and Peugeot. 
 Besides wasting fuel, idling engines emit some of the harshest pollution compared with engines at cruising speeds, said Jake Fisher, a senior automotive engineer with Consumer Reports magazine. Mr. Fisher said the magazine had not yet tested any new start-stop systems, but noted that a lot of the fuel savings attributed to the mild hybrids it had tested came from engine shutdown at idle. 
 In the United States, drivers of the Porsche Panamera (and soon, the 2011 Cayenne) need to push a button on each trip to activate the Auto Start Stop system (on European models, the systems are automatically enabled). Porsche's system uses engine sensors to note which cylinder is in the best position to fire after a stop. When the driver presses the gas pedal to drive off, the fuel injectors deliver a squirt of gas and the electric starter motor supplies a quick nudge to restart the engine. 
 Mazda's Smart Idle Stop system, used on European and Asian versions of the 2010 Mazda 3, likewise uses the starter motor only to give the engine a slight rotation for restarting. The main force is supplied by combustion pressure after fuel is delivered to a cylinder and ignited by the spark plug. The restart signal comes when the driver releases the clutch and presses the gas pedal. 
 The systems are expected to produce fuel savings of 5 to 10 percent in congested settings in Europe and Asia. In the United States, though, where traffic flows more smoothly and Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy tests don't factor in much idling time, there are no official estimates of fuel savings. 
 A Mazda spokeswoman, Danica Laub, said that until the E.P.A. had a standard in place that car buyers could understand, like a mileage estimate on a window sticker, Mazda would get no market benefit from bringing the system here.

HEADLINE: Identity Politics Leans Right

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS

 BODY:
The social studies curriculum recently approved by the Texas Board of Education, which will put a conservative stamp on textbooks, was received less as a pedagogical document than as the latest provocation in America's seemingly endless culture wars.
 ''Why Is Texas Afraid of Thomas Jefferson?'' the History News Network asked, referring to the board's recommendation that Jefferson, who coined the expression ''separation of church and state,'' be struck from the list of world thinkers who inspired 18th- and 19th-century revolutions.
 Other critics were more direct: ''Dear Texas: Please shut up. Sincerely, History,'' was the headline of an online column for The San Francisco Chronicle.
 This reaction wasn't altogether surprising. The board's wrangling over the curriculum had been a spectacle for months, not least because its disputes mirrored those taking place across the nation. In mid-September, citizens showed up with firearms at tumultuous town hall meetings on health care reform, and the Tea Party movement emerged as the vehicle of conservative insurgents. 
 The majority on the Texas board, who are also conservatives, seemed to be filtering these protests into their deliberations -- in the proposal, for instance, that students be instructed in ''the individual right to keep and bear arms; and an individual's protection of private property from government takings.''
 Liberals -- on the Texas board and beyond -- detected an attempt to force-feed children conservative dogma, whether it was the putative religiosity of the nation's founders, the historic contribution of the Moral Majority and Rush Limbaugh, or the elevation of John Wayne into the pantheon of patriotic heroes.
 In reality, this controversy is the latest version of a debate that reaches back many decades and is perhaps essential in a heterogeneous democracy whose identity has long been in flux.
 In the 18th century, the American writer Hector St. John de Crevecoeur, himself an immigrant from France, catalogued the continent's bewildering mix of ''English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans and Swedes.'' He wondered, ''What then is the American, this new man?''
 He concluded that in America, ''individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men.''
 That idea was later fortified by Alexis de Tocqueville's concept of American exceptionalism, which suggested that the country was exempt from the bitter conflicts -- class, religion, imperial ambition -- that had convulsed Europe.
 Long afterward, amid America's own convulsions in the 1960s and '70s, the concept of a single ''race of men'' looked outmoded. Didn't race mean ''white race''? And didn't ''men'' exclude women? American exceptionalism might really be a form of cultural insularity.
 So, universities and colleges devised new programs that prompted objections as fierce as those now being made to the Texas curriculum.
 In 1968, when Harvard students demanded a black studies program, ''Faculty hawks warned of the fall of Harvard, and even civilization, as they knew it,'' as Morton Keller and Phyllis Keller note in ''Making Harvard Modern.''
 Soon an ever widening range of subjects, from gay studies to feminist legal theory and anthropology, were added, in keeping with the dictates of identity politics. Some of this thinking eventually filtered to grade schools, with children now celebrating Kwanzaa and composing essays, year after year, on the ''I Have a Dream'' speech.
 Many of the changes were liberating, but some were narrowing and erroneous -- for instance the theories espoused by Leonard Jeffries Jr., who, as head of City College's black studies department in the 1980s, lectured on the differences between African ''sun people'' and European ''ice people.''
 Meanwhile, conservatives like William Bennett and Lynne Cheney defended syllabuses limited to the Western classics, and the liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. warned that attacks on the ''Eurocentric curriculum,'' as some called it, were giving rise to ''the notion that history and literature should be taught not as disciplines but as therapies whose function is to raise minority self-esteem.''
 In fact, Mr. Schlesinger maintained, these new courses of study might actually disserve minority students. ''If a Kleagle of the Ku Klux Klan wanted to use the schools to disable and handicap black Americans, he could hardly come up with anything more effective than the 'Afrocentric' curriculum,'' Mr. Schlesinger wrote.
 Though its authors say the Texas curriculum reinforces American traditions, it may instead reflect the conservative variant of identity politics, and this could invite a similar backlash.
 To be fair, some of the board's recommendations aren't controversial. Most scholars of the cold war, left and right, think that the Venona documents -- communications that record the activities of Americans who secretly spied for the Soviet Union -- illuminate the anti-Communist investigations of the McCarthy period. And historians of the conservative movement will agree that Rush Limbaugh and Phyllis Schlafly are worth learning about, as are the Moral Majority and the National Rifle Association.
 Even the Texas curriculum's most disputed item -- its assertion that the Founders envisioned America as a divinely inspired Christian nation -- is not as radical as it sounds.
 In 1964, in a series of lectures on America's founding documents, starting with the Mayflower Compact, the political scientist Willmoore Kendall theorized that ''the nascent society that interprets itself in the Compact is in some sense a religious, more specifically a Christian, society, which calls God in as witness to its act of founding.''
 Mr. Kendall teased out the implications through close readings of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Federalist Papers. But his analysis stressed the ''symbolic'' aspects of those texts, and his nuanced discussion drew on counterarguments by other scholars.
 In contrast, the Texas board's description of America as a ''Judeo-Christian'' nation treats ideas and events that have been under continual reinterpretation and revision for decades as literal and settled truth.
 It is telling, too, that it is secondary-school children -- not, as in the past, college students -- whose minds are being fought over today on such a scale. This suggests that after so many years of increasingly bitter polarization, Americans stand on the brink of a collective identity crisis and no longer share a set of common ideas about the true character of the country and the true meaning of democracy.
 In ''The American Political Tradition,'' published in 1948, the historian Richard Hofstadter suggested that the fad for popular history at the time was evidence of ''national nostalgia'' -- an effort not to understand the past, but rather to evade the present. ''This quest for the American past is carried on in a spirit of sentimental appreciation rather than of critical analysis,'' he surmised.
 As it happens, a good deal of contemporary popular history is more critical than in Mr. Hofstadter's day. But it is presented through an ever-narrowing aperture.
 The late Howard Zinn's ''People's History of the United States,'' depicts the United States as an epic of oppression in which the privileged abuse the downtrodden. Conversely, ''A Patriot's History of the United States,'' by Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, describes the New Deal as a calamity that wreaked havoc on theAmerican economy.
 The two books seem to have captured the spirit of the moment; both are on The New York Times best-seller list. Both are also, in effect, counternarratives. They seek not to revise but to displace more familiar histories and are utterly different in tone from older popular histories like the Daniel Boorstin trilogy ''The Americans,'' and William Manchester's two-volume work, ''The Glory and the Dream: A Narrative History of America.''
 For all their dissimilarities, Mr. Boorstin and Mr. Manchester convey the impression that America, despite its diversity, is a nation whose citizens share the same essential values, at once democratic and aspirational. But to read these newer books is to inhabit two utterly different Americas that have almost nothing to say to each other. Both are conceived in a spirit of protest, and this explains their appeal at a time when protest seems the most dynamic force in politics.
 Half a century ago, in his essay, ''The Search for Southern Identity,'' the historian C. Vann Woodward explored a parallel phenomenon, the confusion that overtook the South after the Supreme Court had invalidated segregation and the region become more urban and industrial, losing its distinctive agrarian flavor.
 What Southerners should do, Mr. Woodward urged, is subordinate their regional attachment to the country's ''national myths,'' for instance the American ''success story'' that had inspired so many others, like the European immigrants who had ''sought and found identity in them.''
 Southerners might do this, too, if they gave up ''the romantic dreams of the South's past.''
 Today it is not regional or ethnic identity, but ideological commitment that threatens to submerge larger ''national myths.'' But one thing remains unchanged from 50 or 60 years ago. As Americans struggle to see where they are going, they continue to gaze fondly at the past -- and to see in it what they like.

HEADLINE: Obama, Lehman and 'The Dragon Tattoo'

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE same week that Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, a Swedish crime novel titled ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'' was published in America. The book didn't receive a ton of hype, not least because the author, a journalist named Stieg Larsson, was unavailable for interviews; he had died in 2004 of a heart attack at the age of 50. The mixed Times review appeared in the back pages of the Sunday Book Review. Many more readers were riveted instead by the Lehman article on that morning's front page: ''A Wall Street Goliath Teeters Amid Fears of a Widening Crisis.'' 
 Larsson's novel, the first of a ''Millennium'' trilogy he left behind, would nonetheless soar onto best-seller lists in America, as it has in much of the world. It remains a best seller 18 months later, even as the first of what may be two movie adaptations opens this weekend. In the many dissections of this literary phenomenon, much has been said about Larsson's striking title character, a brilliant, if antisocial, 24-year-old female computer hacker who bonds with a middle-age male journalist to crack a chain of horrific crimes against Swedish women. Strangely, far less attention has been paid to the equally prominent villains in this novel -- whether they literally commit murder or not. They are, without exception, bankers and industrialists. At the time of its American release, ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'' was far more topical than most anyone could imagine.
 ''A bank director who blows millions on foolhardy speculations should not keep his job,'' writes Larsson in one typical passage. ''A managing director who plays shell company games should do time.'' Larsson is no less lacerating about influential journalists who treat ''mediocre financial whelps like rock stars'' and who docilely ''regurgitate the statements issued by C.E.O.'s and stock-market speculators.'' He pleads for some ''tough reporter'' to ''identify and expose as traitors'' the financial players who have ''systematically and perhaps deliberately'' damaged their country's economy ''to satisfy the profit interests of their clients.'' 
 What's remarkable is that Larsson wrote all this in a book completed years before the meltdown of 2008 -- and was referring only to Sweden. And yet the overlap with our recent history is profound -- so much so that surely both his prescience and the universal resonance of his villains account for some of his novel's marathon ride through the zeitgeist, its ability to touch the nerves of so many readers in America and throughout the West. 
 If anything, the animus driving ''Dragon Tattoo'' seems more timely every day. The more we learn about the shell games practiced by our own C.E.O.'s during the pre-crash bubble, the more we share Larsson's outrage that none of them are doing time. For instance, we now know, as we didn't in September 2008, that Lehman's collapse wasn't exactly an unexpected, unpredictable calamity to those in its executive suites. The 2,200-page bank examiner's autopsy released 10 days ago concluded that Lehman, in league with its auditor Ernst & Young, used ''materially misleading'' accounting gimmicks to mask its losses, duping investors and the ever-credulous Securities and Exchange Commission alike. 
 Far from being held liable for the chicanery and recklessness that would destroy their company and threaten their country's economy, these executives benefited big time. In a study late last year, three Harvard Law School researchers examined public documents to assess whether one ''standard narrative'' of the crash was true -- that ''the meltdown of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers largely wiped out the wealth of their top executives.'' It turned out to be a fairy tale. ''In contrast to what has been thus far largely assumed, the executives were richly rewarded for, not financially devastated by, their leadership of their banks during this decade,'' the Harvard Law team wrote. The top five executives at both Lehman and Bear collectively took home $2.4 billion in bonuses and equity sales -- that's nearly a quarter-billion dollars each -- between 2000 and their 2008 demise.
 Anyone in Washington who thinks these kinds of revelations will stop and that America will just turn the page as the Dow rebounds is spending too much time with Goldman Sachs lobbyists. Just take another look at the best-seller list. The fastest-selling nonfiction book in America right now -- an instant No. 1 on Amazon -- is ''The Big Short,'' by the journalist Michael Lewis. An even better storyteller than Larsson, Lewis chronicles a few lonely financial renegades who saw through Wall Street's real- estate securitization Ponzi scheme. Some are as brainy and idiosyncratic as Larsson's fictional geek heroine. Lewis's heavies are nothing if not American iterations of the villains of ''Dragon Tattoo.'' 
 ''The problem wasn't that Lehman Brothers had been allowed to fail,'' Lewis writes as he surveys the post-September 2008 wreckage near the end of his book. ''The problem was that Lehman Brothers had been allowed to succeed.'' Without reform of the financial system, that problem remains unsolved. Wall Street will keep incentivizing reckless risk. Too-big-to-fail banks will keep getting bigger. The system will crash again sooner rather than later, once more taking Americans' savings, jobs and tax dollars with it.
 Anger over the last crash and the bailout of its high rollers spans the political spectrum, from neo-New Dealers on the left to Tea Party protesters on the right. As the battle over financial regulatory reform began in earnest with Chris Dodd's introduction of a Senate bill last week, Lewis told an interviewer, ''There is a war that is about to happen over not just who regulates Wall Street but what the rules are.'' 
 The question for the politicians at the center of this battleground is simple enough: Which side of the war are they on? The Republican leadership revealed its hand unequivocally last week. Addressing the American Bankers Association, the party's House leader, John Boehner, promised to delay and fight any finance-reform bill. ''Don't let those little punk staffers take advantage of you, and stand up for yourselves,'' Boehner instructed the poor, defenseless bankers. In late January he met the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, to make a pitch for donations. That may have been unnecessary. Chase and its employees, an A.T.M. for the Democrats in 2008, gave 73 percent of their contributions to the G.O.P. in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
 Republicans in the Senate will be no different. Mitch McConnell's strategy of unmitigated obstructionism remains gospel there. Just as Charles Grassley and Olympia Snowe played the Democrats with months of fruitless negotiations on health care reform, so Richard Shelby and Bob Corker have been stalling a financial reform bill with similarly arid feints at ''bipartisanship.'' Corker insisted that any bill exclude regulation of extortionate ''payday lenders,'' who just happen to be among his biggest campaign contributors.
 Unlike the Republicans, President Obama sends mixed messages on these issues. He says a stand-alone consumer protection agency is a priority. A key appointee, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, says he is determined to fight for serious regulation of derivatives. But the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, still seems more inclined to preserve, not overhaul, the system that failed during his tenure as chairman of the New York Fed.
 Geithner's major calling lately has been a public-relations tour, with full-dress profiles in The New Yorker, The Atlantic and even Vogue, which filled us in on his humble ''off-the-rack'' Brooks Brothers suits. Last week he also contributed a video testimonial to the on-air fifth anniversary celebration of Jim Cramer's ''Mad Money.'' Like the heedless casino culture it exemplified, that CNBC program has long been back to speculative business-as-usual, pumping stocks as if the crash were just a small, inconvenient bump on the road to larger profits and bonuses. The particular ''Mad Money'' episode to which the Treasury secretary lent his imprimatur included such choice Cramer bits as a reference to Nancy Pelosi as ''Politburo president'' and a prediction that the passage of ''Obamacare'' could cause the stock market to tank. 
 Let the G.O.P. be the party of ''Mad Money.'' Once the protracted health care soap opera at last becomes history, the pivot to financial reform could be a great opportunity for the president, a decisive bid for his party to repossess that anti-establishment truck from Scott Brown. The Republicans will once again squeal that it's political suicide for Obama to try to ''ram through'' a bill, and once again decry his ''socialism.'' But while the voters were often genuinely divided about health care, they are not about Wall Street reform: polls have consistently shown for a year that a 60 percent majority favors it. 
 What these voters crave are leaders unambiguously on the side of true fairness and accountability, not apologists for those traitors, as Stieg Larsson aptly called them, whose shell games broke the economy and stuck us with the bill. The fired-up president who energized the health care endgame by taking on insurance companies doesn't have a year to find his voice for the war ahead. Not only is the 2010 election season fast approaching, but it will coincide with angry commemorations of the second anniversary of the fall of Lehman Brothers. Politicians who are still seen as soft on the culprits could yet fall too.

HEADLINE: Stewart L. Udall, 90, Conservationist in Kennedy and Johnson Cabinets, Dies

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER; Cornelia Dean and Sarah Wheaton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stewart L. Udall, an ardent conservationist and a son of the West, who as interior secretary in the 1960s presided over vast increases in national park holdings and the public domain, died on Saturday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. The last surviving member of the original Kennedy cabinet, he was 90.
 Mr. Udall had been in failing health after a fall last week, according to his son Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico. 
 Though he was a liberal Democrat from the increasingly conservative and Republican West, Stewart Udall said in a 2003 public television interview that he found in Washington ''a big tent on the environment.'' 
 The result was the addition of vast tracts to the nation's land holdings and -- through his strong ties with lawmakers, conservationists, writers and others -- work that led to landmark statutes on air, water and land conservation.
 President Obama said in a statement Saturday night that Mr. Udall ''left an indelible mark on this nation and inspired countless Americans who will continue his fight for clean air, clean water and to maintain our many natural treasures.'' 
 Few corners of the nation escaped Mr. Udall's touch. As interior secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, he presided over the acquisition of 3.85 million acres of new holdings, including 4 national parks -- Canyonlands in Utah, Redwood in California, North Cascades in Washington State and Guadalupe Mountains in Texas -- 6 national monuments, 9 national recreation areas, 20 historic sites, 50 wildlife refuges and 8 national seashores. He also had an interest in preserving historic sites, and helped saved Carnegie Hall from destruction.
 ''Republicans and Democrats, we all worked together,'' Mr. Udall said in a television interview with Bill Moyers. But by the time of that interview, Mr. Udall added that Washington had been overtaken by money and that people seeking public office fought for contributions from business interests that viewed environmental protection as a detriment to profit at best.
 In his years in Washington, he won high regard from many quarters for his efforts to preserve the American landscape and to educate his fellow Americans on the value of natural beauty, points he made in his 1963 book ''The Quiet Crisis.'' The book, whose aim, he wrote at the time, was to ''outline the land and people story of our continent,'' sold widely.
 It was Mr. Udall who suggested that John. F. Kennedy invite Robert Frost to recite a poem at Mr. Kennedy's Inauguration. Mr. Udall accompanied Mr. Frost to the Soviet Union in 1962, a trip meant to foster better ties with Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev.
 Mr. Udall also held evenings at the Interior Department with the poet Carl Sandburg and the actor Hal Holbrook. In addition, he invited the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Wallace Stegner to be the department's writer in residence. It was Mr. Stegner's presence that prompted Mr. Udall to write ''The Quiet Crisis.''
 Mr. Udall was also an early supporter of Rachel Carson, the biologist whose book ''Silent Spring'' brought attention to the environmental hazards of pesticide use.
 Mr. Udall stepped onto the national stage in 1954, when he was elected to Congress from Arizona. In the hotly fought Democratic presidential primary of 1960, he urged his fellow Arizona Democrats to support Kennedy. When Kennedy won the White House, he nominated Mr. Udall as interior secretary 
 After Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Mr. Udall was kept on by Lyndon B. Johnson. 
 ''I think probably part of that was Lady Bird,'' Mr. Udall said, referring to Mr. Johnson's wife, with whom he collaborated on beautifying the nation's capital and similar projects. ''She treasured me and we were wonderful friends,'' he added. 
 Roger G. Kennedy, who was director of the National Park Service in the 1990s, said Mr. Udall ''escaped the notion that all public land was essentially a cropping opportunity -- the idea that if you cannot raise timber on it or take a deer off it, it wasn't valuable.'' On the other hand, Mr. Kennedy said, Mr. Udall understood that public lands like parks enhanced the economic value of privately held land nearby.
 This lesson was sometimes communicated with difficulty. For example, in the 1960s, when the Kennedy administration, with Mr. Udall in the lead, began efforts to establish the nation's first national seashores, people in regions including Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, and Point Reyes in California objected that taking coastal land out of private hands would ruinously inhibit economic development.
 Instead, the parks have been beacons for lucrative tourism.
 On this and other fronts Mr. Udall pushed with a formidable combination of political acumen and political allies -- including his brother Morris K. Udall, who succeeded him in Congress and in 1976 ran for president in a campaign that his elder brother managed. Much of the significant environmental and land-protection statutes that became law in the 1970s and '80s, including the Endangered Species Act, bore their stamp and influence.
 ''That was a wonderful time, and it carried through into the Nixon administration, into the Ford administration, into the Carter administration,'' Stewart Udall said. ''It lasted for 20 years. I don't remember a big fight between the Republicans and Democrats in the Nixon administration or President Gerald Ford and so on. There was a consensus that the country needed more conservation projects of the kind that we were proposing.'' 
 Stewart Lee Udall was born on Jan. 31, 1920, in St. Johns, Ariz., a small community in Apache County in the northeast, into a family with strong ties to the Mormon Church. His mother, Louise Lee Udall, was a granddaughter of John Doyle Lee, who was executed in 1877 for his involvement in the Mountain Meadows Massacre in Utah, in which a wagon train of California-bound migrants were killed in 1857.
 Mr. Udall served as a Mormon missionary in Pennsylvania and New York. During World War II, he was a gunner in the 15th Army Air Forces, serving in Europe. 
 He received bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Arizona. After graduating from law school in 1948, he started his own law practice in Tucson, where he and his brother Morris later became partners.
 After leaving Washington, he taught at Yale, practiced law and wrote several books including ''The Myths of August'' an account of the effects of uranium mining and nuclear weapons work in the Western desert.
 That grew out of his representation of thousands of uranium miners, nuclear weapons industry workers, and citizens exposed to radiation from atomic weapons manufacturing and testing in the West. 
 Though he won the first case in 1984 in Federal District Court, an appeals court overturned the ruling and the United States Supreme Court declined in 1988 to hear arguments. Mr. Udall then turned to Congress, working with lawmakers of both parties, particularly Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. The law, administered by the Justice Department, provided up to $100,000 for those sickened by radiation exposure, and issued a formal apology for harm done to those who were ''subjected to increased risk of injury and disease to serve the national security interests of the United States.''
 Throughout his life he relished physical challenges. He was an all-conference guard on the University of Arizona basketball team and he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, in East Africa, and Mount Fuji, in Japan, while heading American delegations to both regions. When he was 84, at the end of his last rafting trip on the Colorado River, Mr. Udall hiked up the steep Bright Angel Trail from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the south rim, a 10-hour walk that he celebrated at the end with a martini.
 Mr. Udall's wife, the former Irmalee Webb, died in 2001. Besides his son Tom, he is also survived by his other sons, Scott, Denis and Jay, and his daughters, Lynn and Lori, as well as eight grandchildren.
 At his death, Mr. Udall was a senior member of one of the nation's last and largest political dynasties -- in the West it was often said there were ''oodles of Udalls'' in politics. David King Udall served in the Arizona Territorial legislature; Levi Udall was for decades an elected judge in the Arizona Superior Court and later a justice and chief justice of the Arizona Supreme Court; Mr. Udall's brother Morris was followed to Washington by his son Mark Udall, elected in 2008 as a senator from Colorado, the same year that Tom Udall was elected.
 But Tom Udall said that in recent years his father had become greatly concerned over the state of politics in the country, worrying ''we were losing the bipartisanship in the environmental area.'' 
 He added that Mr. Udall had recently written a letter to his grandchildren, urging them to focus on ''trying to transform our society to a clean energy and clean job society.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 24, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Monday and in some editions Sunday about Stewart L. Udall, a former interior secretary, referred incorrectly to Mr. Udall's support for John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. He backed Mr. Kennedy in Arizona's county and state conventions, not in a presidential primary. (Arizona did not hold a Democratic primary for that election.) And the version of the obituary on Sunday omitted one of his four surviving sons. Besides Tom, Scott and Jay, he is survived by Denis.

HEADLINE: In Shadow of Health Care Vote, Immigrant Advocates Keep Pushing for Change

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Immigrant advocates, frustrated with President Obama's lack of progress on legislation to overhaul the immigration system, called one month ago for a march in Washington that they said would display the strength of their numbers and would give the president the push he needed to get the debate rolling in Congress. 
 That was then. 
 In the space of a few weeks, with the acrimonious health care debate eclipsing other issues in Washington, the results advocates can expect from the scheduled rally of tens of thousands of their supporters on the Mall here on Sunday appear to have diminished. Now the question for advocates, who planned their go-for-broke mobilization as a catalyst to jump-start a bill in Congress, is whether it will at least help to keep a conversation about immigration going in Washington between now and the November elections. 
 As luck would have it, the immigration rally will not even be the main event here on Sunday, when most of the nation's attention will be on the crucial health care vote in the House of Representatives. 
 But advocates say the mobilization has already achieved results. In large part because of their prodding, President Obama held meetings last week with groups engaged in the immigration issue. On Thursday, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, unveiled a blueprint for a bill that would offer a path to legal status for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, and also included new provisions for expanded workplace and border enforcement. 
 Mr. Obama immediately embraced the blueprint. But after repeated promises last year that he would move an immigration bill in early 2010, the president scaled back last week, saying only that he would work to ''forge a bipartisan consensus'' this year. And while advocates are insisting that Mr. Obama must lead the way, he is throwing it back to them, calling on immigration groups to help round up at least one other Republican sponsor for the legislation put forth by Mr. Schumer and Mr. Graham.
 On top of the difficulties any bill to overhaul immigration would confront with unemployment near 10 percent, the near-term obstacles became clear on Friday when Mr. Graham pointedly reiterated a warning that an immigration bill would be ''the first casualty'' if Democrats adopt health care legislation by an expedited process that circumvents Republican votes. 
 ''If the health care bill goes through this weekend, that will, in my view, pretty much kill any chance of immigration reform passing the Senate this year,'' Mr. Graham said.
 Still, the rally allows advocates a chance to show a coalition that has broadened since popular opposition roundly defeated a Bush administration immigration proposal in 2007. Evangelical Christian churches have joined the effort, led by the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, the largest group of Latino evangelicals, and by the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents 450,000 churches nationwide.
 African-American organizations, which in 2007 were skeptical, fearing that immigrants could pose competition to black workers, are more fully on board, and Benjamin T. Jealous, president of the N.A.A.C.P., is a scheduled speaker. While the A.F.L.-C.I.O. did not support the 2007 overhaul proposal, this year organized labor has united. Gay and lesbian groups, which had not been active on the issue, are now involved.
 But business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which strongly backed the 2007 legislation, are less enthusiastic this year and will stay away Sunday. Mr. Schumer and Mr. Graham have said that the rift between business and labor over their proposal will be one of the hardest to bridge. As soon as their blueprint was released, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. blasted provisions for a temporary guest worker program to handle future immigration of blue-collar laborers. 
 Immigrant groups are also coming to protest deportations and immigration enforcement at workplaces that they say continue to affect immigrant communities. Federal agents executing an arrest warrant at two restaurants in Maryland detained more than 20 immigrants on March 11, the day the immigration groups were meeting with Mr. Obama. 
 Some advocates met Friday with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to criticize the enforcement. In an interview later Friday, Ms. Napolitano said the administration's strategy would continue unchanged, with the emphasis on capturing and deporting immigrants who have committed crimes. 
 Organizers of the march said on Saturday that their goal was to persuade Mr. Obama to take up immigration legislation once the smoke has cleared from the health care debate. 
 ''We are trying to send a strong message that when health care is past us, this is the issue that needs to be up at bat,'' said Angela Maria Kelley of the Center for American Progress. ''We've been in the bullpen for a long time, and now we want to show the strength of the team and the power of the issue.''
 But even if the rally is a success, its organizers may face hard decisions about how to manage the expectations of their followers in a political season when the prospects in Congress for immigration have dimmed.

HEADLINE: With Eyes Wide Open

 BODY:
I'M a fifth-generation journalist. My family moved from France to Switzerland to London, where my father ran the photo business for United Press International.
I remember the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, when I was 12. It was a huge event globally, not just in the United States. My father brought me to his office, where everyone was in shock. It was then that I decided to become a journalist.
 I graduated from the Lycee Francais, a French high school in London, in 1968. That spring there were student revolts in Paris with worker strikes, and I used to go back to France and join the protests. I enrolled in the Sorbonne there and got a part-time job as a photojournalist with U.P.I. 
 My parents had relocated to Brazil, and in 1970 I visited them and decided to stay. I dropped out of college and got a job as a sports editor for the local English-language newspaper, a daily for the ex-pat community. We used a hot lead press and set type one letter at a time.
 Six months later I became editor in chief, at age 20. I like to think that was not a reflection of the paper's quality. A military junta was in power, and the censors would call in the morning and tell me what topics we couldn't publish. It was a heady time for me. I learned all the details of putting a newspaper to bed each day.
 In 1973, I left for mandatory military service in the French Army and served in French Guyana. When I returned, we started a weekly section about computers that I decided to spin off as a separate publication for Brazilians.
 I found local investors and we started a Portuguese-language publication called Data News just as the computer industry was transitioning from mainframes to smaller computers. The Brazilian government, however, decided that computers were a matter of national security and had to be manufactured in Brazil, so in one fell swoop we lost our advertisers, all of which were foreign-based. My backers pulled out, too.
 I had sent a copy of the magazine to Patrick McGovern, head of International Data Group, which published Computerworld, and he suggested I contact him if I needed anything. I told him that there was no way Brazil could stick by its ban on foreign computers, given the country's need to modernize, but that I needed help to get through this rough patch. He bought the magazine. I joined I.D.G. as vice president for Latin America, and we established a network of magazines in the region.
 I spent the next 10 years building I.D.G.'s businesses there. I moved to the United States in 1986 to become president of InfoWorld, an I.D.G. magazine. In 1989, Bill Ziff, owner of Ziff Davis, hired me as publisher of PC Magazine. After that I was president and then C.E.O. of Ziff Davis.
 Last June, I became C.E.O. of The Huffington Post. The advent of new media has meant that publishers can reach more people than ever before. The news cycle is now constant -- by the second -- as opposed to a few years ago, when people relied on daily newspapers and the evening news. Today's technology allows people to engage with the news, to write comments, to blog about events and to share on social Web sites.
 The Huffington Post has roughly doubled in size each year since launching four and a half years ago. There's still a gap between the time people spend on the Internet and advertisers' online budgets. Most advertising dollars are still spent on TV, but that is shifting. We believe that the golden age of advertising on the Internet is still to come.
 My career has taught me that you have to go through life with your eyes wide open and be curious. If you do this, you'll find incredible opportunities.
 Just jump on them and follow your instincts.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transcription error, the Boss feature last Sunday about Eric Hippeau, chief executive of The Huffington Post, misstated his description of the company's growth rate. He said that its revenue and its traffic have roughly doubled each year in its four-and-a-half-year history -- not that they have doubled over that entire period. The column also misidentified the magazine where Mr. Hippeau was once publisher. It was PC Magazine, not PC World.

HEADLINE: The Long Road Back

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG, JEFF ZELENY and CARL HULSE; Jackie Calmes and Eric Lichtblau contributed reporting.

 BODY:
This article is by Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Jeff Zeleny and Carl Hulse.
 WASHINGTON -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi was at her wits' end, and she let President Obama know it.
 Scott Brown, the upstart Republican, had just won his Senate race in Massachusetts, a victory that seemed to doom Mr. Obama's dream of overhauling the nation's health care system. The White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, once Ms. Pelosi's right hand man on Capitol Hill, was pushing Mr. Obama to scale back his ambitions and pursue a pared-down bill.
 Mr. Obama seemed open to the idea, though it was clearly not his first choice. Ms. Pelosi scoffed. 
 ''Kiddie care,'' she called the scaled-down plan, derisively, in private. 
 In a series of impassioned conversations, over the telephone and in the Oval Office, she conveyed her frustration to the president, according to four people familiar with the talks. If she and Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, were going to stick out their necks for Mr. Obama's top legislative priority, Ms. Pelosi wanted assurances that the president would too. At the White House, aides to Mr. Obama say, he also wanted assurances; he needed to hear that the leaders could pass his far-reaching plan.
 ''We're in the majority,'' Ms. Pelosi told the president. ''We'll never have a better majority in your presidency in numbers than we've got right now. We can make this work.''
 Now, in what could become a legislative Lazarus tale -- or at least the most riveting cliffhanger of the Obama presidency so far-- the House is set to take up the health bill for what Democrats hope will be the last time. 
 For Mr. Obama, who vowed earlier this month to do ''everything in my power'' to see the bill to fruition, the measure's passage would be an extraordinary triumph. Its defeat could weaken him for the rest of his days in office.
 That Mr. Obama has come this far -- within a whisper of passing historic social legislation -- is remarkable in itself. But the story of how he did it is not his alone. It is the story of how a struggling president partnered with a pair of experienced legislators -- Ms. Pelosi and, to a lesser extent, Mr. Reid -- to reach for a goal that Mr. Obama has often said had eluded his predecessors going back to Theodore Roosevelt. 
 Their journey over the last two months, interviews with White House aides, lawmakers, outside advisers, lobbyists and political strategists show, involved tensions, resolve, political spadework -- and a little bit of luck.
 When Anthem, a California insurer, notified policyholders of an increase in premiums of up to 39 percent, the move played right into the hands of a White House that had spent months demonizing the insurance industry. 
 A cross-Capitol feud erupted when Ms. Pelosi demanded that Mr. Reid provide a letter with the signatures of 51 senators willing to pass a package of legislative changes under the complex parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation. (On Saturday, the leader announced that he had a ''significant majority.'')
 And Mr. Obama's decision to hold a bipartisan health care summit meeting proved a strategic success. The move privately mystified some Democrats. But it created an important cooling off period and helped shift attention to Mr. Obama and away from Capitol Hill, freeing the speaker to work on convincing recalcitrant members of her caucus that it would be politically disastrous for them simply to walk away.
 Mr. Obama did not need any prodding from Ms. Pelosi, his aides say. The Scott Brown election came on the eve of his first anniversary in office, and he told aides he was irritated that his presidency appeared to be stalled. He was eager to do what he had done so often in the presidential campaign: cast caution aside in favor of bold action.
 ''We are this close to the summit of the mountain,'' Mr. Obama told his close advisers in a meeting in late January, said one participant. ''We need to try one more time.''
 Responding to a Setback
 The polls were still open in Massachusetts on Jan. 19 when Mr. Obama met in the Oval Office with David Plouffe, his top outside confidant and former campaign manager. Mr. Brown's victory -- he would take Senator Edward M. Kennedy's old seat -- was all but certain, and Mr. Obama's 60-vote supermajority in the Senate had suddenly vanished. 
 Mr. Brown had made clear his objections to the health care legislation. ''One thing is clear,'' he proclaimed on election night, ''voters do not want the trillion-dollar health care bill that is being forced on the American people.''
 At that moment, the president did not know whether, or how, to proceed. The House and Senate had passed different versions of the bill and could not come to terms. Republicans were unified in their resistance. He considered his options, including Mr. Emanuel's ''skinny bill.'' Whatever the course, aides said, Mr. Obama was insistent that health care not be put into a ''time capsule,'' never to be opened again in his tenure.
 Tom Daschle, a close outside adviser, said Mr. Obama believed that health care would be his legacy. ''This is what his presidency is about,'' he said. 
 On Jan. 21, Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and a powerful committee chairman, headed to the White House for a banking industry announcement. He had been openly skeptical about the prospects for the health measure.
 Mr. Obama pulled him aside. ''He said, 'I have to talk to you,' '' the congressman recalled. ''He was very passionate about it, and he convinced me that we could put some fixes in.''
 Others were not so easily convinced. ''You have to let my colleagues work through their five stages of grief,'' Representative Robert E. Andrews of New Jersey, a Pelosi adviser, told a friend. Asked what stage the House was in several weeks later, Mr. Andrews responded, ''Still in denial.''
 The speaker, though, was determined to go ahead. ''We will go through the gate,'' she said at a news conference on Jan. 28. ''If the gate is closed, we will go over the fence. If the fence is too high, we will pole vault in. If that doesn't work, we will parachute in. But we are going to get health care reform passed.''
 If there was one thing Ms. Pelosi knew she could not do, though, it was force the House to pass the Senate bill. (House liberals objected to its lack of a government-backed insurance plan, conservatives thought it too permissive on abortion financing, and the entire caucus felt queasy about special deals like the so-called Cornhusker kickback that would have given Nebraska extra money to pay for Medicaid.) 
 But House action on their bill was exactly what Democratic senators wanted when Mr. Obama addressed them at a policy retreat on Feb. 3.
 The televised session was polite, with the talk centered on the economy; Mr. Obama, after bipartisan battering, had vowed to make ''jobs, jobs, jobs'' his new focus. But in an off-the-record panel discussion after the president left, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, got an earful over health care. Senator Al Franken, the freshman Democrat from Minnesota, led the charge.
 ''David, I'm doing a slow burn here -- do you know what a slow burn is?'' one participant recalled him saying. Mr. Franken demanded to know Mr. Obama's plan, and then told Mr. Axelrod that the president needed to have the House pass the Senate bill. 
 ''That's fine,'' Mr. Axelrod replied. ''If you've got 218 votes in your pocket, we'll do that.''
 The session exposed the mistrust between the House and the Senate, tensions that Mr. Obama's health care team worked mightily to smooth over. To the Senate Democrats in the room, it seemed as if Mr. Axelrod was brushing them off, and that Mr. Obama really had no plan. 
 The next day, the president invited the Democratic Congressional leaders to the White House. They had a blunt conversation, with Ms. Pelosi expressing dismay that Mr. Obama had yet to state publicly, in crystal clear terms, what he wanted to see in a health bill. The two had clashed in the past; once when Ms. Pelosi challenged the president, he snapped, ''I'm not a stupid man,'' said a Congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
 But the sense of urgency after the Democrats' debacle in Massachusetts seemed to change the chemistry between the president and the speaker. ''The two of them became real partners,'' said one person close to both.
 That night, Mr. Obama offered hints of his strategy, surprising even some of his closest advisers with his candor. In a question-and-answer session at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, Mr. Obama said he wanted Republicans, Democrats and health care experts to bat around ideas together. ''And then,'' he said, ''I think that we've got to go ahead and move toward a vote.''
 In early February, the White House got news from California that the administration would seize on.
 Anthem Blue Cross had alerted customers that some would see a rate increase of nearly 40 percent by March 1. At a senior staff meeting, Mr. Axelrod, who learned of it by e-mail from a friend in Chicago, raised it with the president.
 ''I thought if we were in a trial,'' Mr. Axelrod later told one associate, ''I had just opened up my BlackBerry to Exhibit A.''
 The president first mentioned the Anthem story in passing in a speech to the Democratic National Committee on Feb. 6. He repeated it again in a pre-Super Bowl interview with Katie Couric. By then, advisers knew they had finally latched onto a story line that might sell their plan: why people with insurance should care about the health care bill and its cost controls. 
 It also dovetailed with what Mr. Obama had been hearing from his unscientific sounding board: the 10 letters he reads every day from ordinary Americans, culled by junior aides in the White House mailroom. One letter, from an Ohio woman named Natoma Canfield, stood out. 
 A Crucial Meeting
 Mr. Obama's idea for a health care meeting at the end of February flabbergasted Democrats on Capitol Hill. He felt that such an event could be an antidote to some of the cynicism about Washington expressed by voters. Ms. Pelosi did not oppose it, but she was not enthusiastic. In the Senate, some Democrats thought the idea was pointless; convinced they would never get Republican support, they figured that each passing day made it more difficult to tackle a health care bill.
 Some White House allies say the session proved critical in putting health care back on the national agenda. ''When the history of this is written, it will be looked at as both a turning point and a brilliant idea,'' said Chip Kahn, who as president of the Federation of American Hospitals has been one of the administration's main supporters.
 The event enabled Mr. Obama to claim the high ground on bipartisanship; after the Brown victory, he needed to be seen as reaching out to the other side. He also wanted to force Republicans to put their ideas on the table, so that the public would see the debate as a choice between two ways to attack a pressing problem, not just a referendum on what Republicans derisively called ''ObamaCare.''
 The meeting also gave the Democratic leadership the gift of time. While the spotlight shifted to Mr. Obama, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid immersed themselves in figuring out their parliamentary options and, in Ms. Pelosi's case especially, soothing her members' jangled nerves.
 ''The main thing was Pelosi sticking with it and doing the quiet work of bringing people back to saying, 'We're doing this,' '' said John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. ''It was almost illusionist, drawing your attention to something that isn't important, so that you're not watching what's happening, which really is important.''
 And one day after the meeting, the White House deployed its secret weapon: Ms. Canfield.
 In a meeting with insurance executives, Mr. Obama read her letter aloud. In seven poignant paragraphs, she wrote that 16 years after being treated for cancer, she could no longer afford her health insurance and was terrified she would get sick and lose the house her parents built. 
 From studying polls and focus groups, the White House knew public opinion seemed to be slowly shifting in favor of some elements of the bill. And Ms. Canfield's story allowed Mr. Obama to personalize the debate, reminding Americans that it was not just about numbers, but lives. The president and his communications team had no way of knowing then that Ms. Canfield would soon receive a new diagnosis, leukemia.
 The White House shared her letter with the news media. Within an hour, camera crews were at Ms. Canfield's door.
 The Push for Votes
 Last week, with a vote drawing near and dozens of House Democrats still wavering -- many terrified a vote for the bill would cost them their jobs -- House leadership aides arrived at Ms. Pelosi's office with a list of 68 lawmakers to lobby, turn or bolster. The aides presumed the Democratic leadership would divvy up the names.
 ''I'll take all 68,'' Ms. Pelosi declared.
 By this time, the parliamentary path was clear: in a legislative two-step, the House would approve the original Senate bill anda package of changes through reconciliation.Republicans accused Democrats of procedural trickery and warned that the speaker was leading her caucus to political disaster.
 ''She is a strong speaker, there isn't any question about that,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. ''So you pass a very unpopular bill. You shove it down the throats of the American people and you lose your majority. How good is that? How smart is that?''
 Like Mr. Obama, Ms. Pelosi regards passing health legislation as a moral imperative, and sees herself making history if she can get it done. 
 Many Democrats say her upbeat, unflappable attitude buoyed them through the darkest days after Massachusetts. But faced with a member she considered intransigent, she could be ''scary tough,'' as one person involved in her strategy sessions said. She would stand up, her high heels and imperiousness exaggerating her height, and talk sternly. 
 On Wednesday, she spent 45 minutes listening and talking with Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, a Catholic opposed to abortion coverage. Ms. Pelosi returned for another 40 minutes on Thursday, though on Saturday, the congresswoman remained undecided.
 At the White House, Mr. Obama's political arm was mobilizing, as Jim Messina, a deputy chief of staff, guided a team of party strategists. Fed by information from lobbyists, Hill aides and others, they tracked how every lawmaker intended to vote and prepared a television and radio campaign to counter the bill's opponents, who were vastly outspending them.
 The coalition of about 50 groups, from the AARP to labor unions -- some of whom called themselves ''Winter Soldiers'' to describe their steadfast support -- held daily conference calls. They isolated three dozen lawmakers and had influential people in their communities -- doctors, insurance agents, business owners -- reach out to them.
 But it is the president, many Democrats say, who has made the biggest difference, by finally providing the sustained, deep personal involvement Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid had been yearning for. He crisscrossed the country for health care rallies and devoted hours to cajoling Democrats. 
 ''Taking it out into the country, the speeches, the rallies, taking on the insurance companies has been important,'' said Representative Raul M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona. ''That button had been on mute in the White House.'' 
 Last week alone, Mr. Obama called or met with 64 lawmakers. He scored the vote of one reluctant Democrat, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, after an Air Force One ride from Cleveland. 
 On Saturday he went to Capitol Hill to make a last-minute appeal to House Democrats, telling them: ''We're a day away. After a year of debate, after every argument has been made, by just about everybody, we're 24 hours away.''
 In his private sessions with lawmakers, the president has drawn the consequences for himself in the starkest terms. In a meeting with members of the House Progressive Caucus, who are angry that the bill lacks a government-backed insurance plan, the president warned that his other priorities -- jobs and immigration -- would be tougher to achieve if the health bill does not pass. There was silence, Mr. Grijalva said, when Mr. Obama laid out the risks.
 ''If we fail at this,'' Mr. Grijalva recalled Mr. Obama saying, ''it's going to be harder for us to pull the line on this other stuff. It is going to weaken our presidency.''

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Takes Aim at Banks As Obama Pushes Overhaul

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
KISSIMMEE, Fla. -- Giant banks that are perceived as ''too big to fail'' are among the ''most insidious barriers to competition in financial services,'' the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Saturday.
 In a speech here to a convention of the Independent Community Bankers of America, Mr. Bernanke also argued that the Fed should retain its powers to oversee small and medium-size community banks. 
 The Senate is contemplating a regulatory overhaul that would focus the Fed's attention on the largest and most interconnected financial institutions and strip its supervision of roughly 4,900 bank holding companies and 850 state-chartered banks that are members of the Fed system.
 While Mr. Bernanke had made similar arguments in testimony to Congress, his assessment of the dangers posed by giant banks was sharper and more pointed. 
 ''One of the greatest threats to the diversity and efficiency of our financial system is the pernicious problem of financial institutions that are deemed 'too big to fail,' '' Mr. Bernanke said. 
 That line, and others, elicited applause from the bankers, who have been wary of the overhaul, which would enhance consumer protections and tighten capital and liquidity requirements.
 ''It is unconscionable that the fate of the world economy should be so closely tied to the fortunes of a relatively small number of giant financial firms,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''If we achieve nothing else in the wake of the crisis, we must ensure that we never again face such a situation.'' 
 Institutions perceived as ''too big to fail'' can borrow money on better terms and take on excessive risks because they face limited ''market discipline,'' he said.
 To address the problem, Mr. Bernanke outlined a three-part strategy: create ''significantly tougher rules and oversight''; improve the resilience of the system; and establish a process to seize and then sell, merge or break up a systemically important institution on the verge of failure. 
 President Obama used his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday to make a similar point, as he pressed the case for comprehensive changes to the financial system and called on the Senate ''to resist the pressure from those who would preserve the status quo.''
 Pointing out that the Senate Banking Committee was scheduled to begin debate on the overhaul on Monday, Mr. Obama repeated his support for creating an agency to protect consumers from abusive and deceptive practices by banks, mortgage companies and other lenders.
 Mr. Obama said he had been ''a vigorous defender of free markets,'' but added that ''without reasonable and clear rules to check abuse and protect families, markets don't function freely.''
 Mr. Obama said: ''I won't accept any attempts to undermine the independence of this agency. And I won't accept efforts to create loopholes for the most egregious abusers of consumers.''
 The bill being taken up on Monday has no Republican support. It was presented by the committee chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who had engaged in months of talks to reach a bipartisan compromise before deciding that he could no longer wait.
 In December, the House adopted, largely along party lines, a regulatory overhaul similar to one the White House put forward last June. Mr. Obama called Mr. Dodd's proposal ''a strong foundation for reform.'' 
 Mr. Obama also took aim at Republicans. Citing news accounts of a January meeting between the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Obama said Mr. Boehner had ''made thwarting reform a key part of his party's pitch for campaign contributions.'' And he said that opponents of a consumer agency had begun a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign.
 ''You might call this 'air support' for the army of lobbyists already arm-twisting members of the committee to reject these reforms and block this consumer agency,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Perhaps that's why, after months of working with Democrats, Republicans walked away from this proposal.''
 A spokesman for Mr. Boehner, Michael Steel, said of the president, ''It should be beneath him to use the official weekly address to make inaccurate partisan attacks.''

 BODY:
ABRAHAM LINCOLN, AX SWINGER: ''Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,'' Seth Grahame-Smith's follow-up to the surprise smash hit ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,'' enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4, and not everybody is happy about it. 
 In an interview with The Daily Beast, Richard Norton Smith, the founding director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Ill., denounced the conceit of Honest Abe as an ax-swinging slayer of the undead as ''the most inane idea imaginable'' and ''a true bastardization of the Lincoln story.'' But this hasn't stopped Smith's colleagues in Springfield from organizing an exhibition of artifacts showcasing the 16th president's goth side, including an ax given to Lincoln, in a highly suspicious historical convergence, the day before Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox. Lincoln, it turns out, was something of a horror buff, an avid reader of Edgar Allan Poe who anonymously published his own rather dull true-crime story, ''The Trailor Murder Case,'' in 1846. While Lincoln is not known to have written about actual monsters, the connection between vampirism and slavery developed by Grahame-Smith dates at least to Lincoln's own time, as The Daily Beast points out. ''I despair of the Republic while slavery exists therein,'' the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison once said. ''If we had any regard for our safety and happiness, we should strive to crush the vampire which is feeding upon our lifeblood.''
 MITT ROMNEY, PALIN HUNTER: Mitt Romney's ''No Apology: The Case for American Greatness'' enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1, and no one seems to be professing more surprise than the author himself. ''I don't pretend this is going to be a best seller,'' Romney told The Boston Globe. ''I think Sarah Palin, they printed two million books. We're printing like 100,000.'' (His publicist promptly corrected the figure to 200,000.) In the book, Romney emphasizes foreign policy and economic competitiveness over social issues, taking his well-polished technocratic ax to the populism he sees menacing America from both the right and the left. (O.K., mostly the left.) In a recent appearance on David Letterman's show, Romney took a genial swing at Palin, whose ''Going Rogue'' is parked at No. 34 on the nonfiction extended list. ''She's terrific,'' he said when asked about his rival. ''She really is! She's terrific. She's got energy, passion -- by the way, you know, be careful what you say about her. . . . She has a rifle.
 DANIELLE STEEL, BORSCHT BELTER: Danielle Steel, whose novel ''Big Girl'' falls to No. 6 on the hardcover fiction list, can claim five marriages, nine children, a couple of glamorous homes and some 600 million books in print. All that and funny, too! In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Steel described her role as the family's designated pooper scooper: ''I'm the person they announce to, 'Oh, the dog just went in the dining room.' . . . I always said I shared a dog with my husband. He had the front end, and I had the back end.''

 BODY:
ON THE BRINK
 Inside the Race to Stop the Collapse of the Global Financial System
 By Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 Illustrated. 478 pp. Business Plus/Grand Central Publishing. $28.99.
 When offered the job of Treasury secretary in the spring of 2006, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was then the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, turned it down. President Bush had half a term in office left, the economy appeared strong, and there seemed little the next secretary could accomplish. But then, Paulson had second thoughts -- ''Do you really want to be 75 and telling people, 'I could have been Treasury secretary'?'' a friend asked -- and finally agreed to take the job on condition he be granted more power and visibility than Bush's previous secretaries.
 He was sworn in on July 10, 2006. Thirteen months later, the country was in the throes of a financial crisis. By early 2008, Paulson was stage-managing the rescue of Bear Stearns. And in his final, madcap four months of service there was barely a week in which this lifelong free-marketer was not rescuing somebody (the bailouts continued through his final day). 
 Abandoning the laissez-faire principles he espoused during his more than 30 years at Goldman, Paulson bailed out Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, A.I.G. and Citigroup, among others; lobbied Congress to enact the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and invest public dollars in private banks; guaranteed money market funds; and, most controversially, declined to rescue Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy in September 2008.
 Along the way, he was racked with self-doubt. As Lehman tottered, Paulson admitted to his wife, ''I am really scared.'' He was tortured by insomnia; on the verge of taking a sleeping pill, a violation of his Christian Science faith, he flushed a bottle's contents down the toilet. Knotted by tension, he was reduced on numerous occasions to doubling over with painful dry heaves. 
 Paulson's ''On the Brink: Inside the Race to Stop the Collapse of the Global Financial System'' zips through his career (including an early stint as an aide in the Nixon White House) and concentrates on his extraordinary 30 months at Treasury. Reflection is not Paulson's strong suit. As he is one of a raft of authors on the financial crisis (I am another), the primary, and sizable, contribution of this book is the inside view it affords of the often limited powers of the federal government.
 Paulson's account is replete with blunt sentences (''I'm a straightforward person''; ''I'm a hands-on manager''), as one might expect of a plain-spoken former Eagle Scout. Born in 1946 and bred on a farm in Illinois, he milked cows and baled hay as a boy. Even when he was the highest-paid executive on Wall Street (a fact he omits when taking credit for an enlightened approach to pay), Paulson wasn't the flashiest; his idea of entertainment was a documentary on the ivory-billed woodpecker. Despite such homey touches, ''On the Brink'' is not especially stylish. Paulson, known in his Dartmouth College days as ''the Hammer,'' slams us with fact after fact; it's a pretty good approximation of the pace he maintained on the job.
 As Treasury secretary, he had to devote as much energy to politics as to finance, and the two agendas did not mix. He was repeatedly forced to demonstrate to Congress that the economic situation was dire, at the risk of further panicking the markets. His political sympathies, too, may come as a surprise. The Democrats controlled the House after 2006, yet his biggest troubles were with Republicans who reflexively opposed his every attempt to put a safety net under the banks. ''The facts didn't seem to matter to some in this group,'' Paulson writes. He formed an effective alliance with Barney Frank, the Democratic chairman of the powerful House Committee on Financial Services. Early on, when Paulson wanted to seek broader powers through legislation, Frank cautioned that he didn't have the votes but urged him to interpret his existing powers broadly. ''I'm not going to raise legal issues,'' Frank assured him.
 Paulson paints an admiring portrait of President Bush and depicts him as asking simple but sensible questions and supporting Paulson's often politically unpopular remedies. Future historians will have to grapple with the contrast between the presidential ''courage'' attested to by Paulson and the image of a pliant president, manipulated by Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld on Iraq, and by supply-siders on tax cuts. Perhaps Bush was capable of being just as good, and just as bad, as those who advised him.
 Barack Obama was in frequent touch with Paulson during the 2008 campaign and impressed him as an informed, thoughtful candidate. John McCain, on the other hand, seemed so intent on scoring political points by railing against bailouts that Paulson threatened to hold him to public account. Dishing gossip isn't Paulson's style, but Sarah Palin was clearly not a favorite. When McCain introduced her on a conference call, ''right away she started calling me Hank,'' he writes. ''Now, everyone calls me Hank. . . . But for some reason, the way she said it over the phone like that, even though we'd never met, rubbed me the wrong way.''
 Paulson gives short shrift to a subject that has much occupied the press: his penchant for hiring and relying on former Goldman cronies. But he makes clear that even the Treasury secretary often depends on independent channels for information. It took a call from Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, to warn Paulson that the Wall Street crisis was spreading dangerously. Also surprising is the extent to which Paulson had to plead with China and Japan to keep faith in United States banks and government securities -- perhaps a harbinger of America's future as a weakened power.
 Paulson portrays Richard Fuld, the fallen Lehman king, as a forlorn figure, begging the government to resuscitate Lehman even after it filed for bankruptcy. Otherwise, Paulson is too kind to his banking chums. Of Robert Rubin -- Citigroup executive, former Treasury secretary, the author's former boss at Goldman -- Paulson ventures, ''Bob put the public interest ahead of everything else.'' Ahem: Rubin, at the time, was lobbying to enlist taxpayer support for Citi. 
 Paulson also seems blind on executive pay. His reflection that ''I guess it's fair to say that the excesses of investment bankers were just an extreme example of conspicuous consumption in a disposable age'' is simply dimwitted. Eight-figure bonuses illustrate Wall Street's singular corruption. A more serious flaw is Paulson's vastly overstating his effectiveness in staving off home foreclosures. He calls the Bush administration policy ''an overall success.'' In fact, the foreclosure rate soared to a record on his watch.
 I expected that Paulson would defend the A.I.G. bailout on the basis that A.I.G. was a solvent firm suffering a temporary liquidity problem, and he does. I also expected him to say there was no way the government could have rescued Lehman, and he does. Neither argument is convincing. Indeed, Paulson admits that his no-bailout stance on Lehman was partly a bluff to induce a bid from private parties: ''If we had to reverse ourselves . . ., so be it.'' 
 These chewed-over cuds matter less than it might seem. While he had the stalwart help of Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner, Paulson had to wrestle with more, and more burning, crises than any Treasury secretary in history. Some less-than-perfect decisions were hardly to be avoided. His account bolsters the view that however little he anticipated the bust, he did his earnest best to restore order. And who can deny, as Paulson writes: ''It could have been so much worse.''

HEADLINE: The HBO Auteur

BYLINE: By WYATT MASON. 
Wyatt Mason teaches nonfiction in the Bennington Writing Seminars and is a contributing editor at Harpers. He wrote for the magazine about the poet Frederick Seidel.

 BODY:
It was a bright, warm, blue-skied December afternoon in Central City, New Orleans, and in this neighborhood of humble shotgun houses and overgrown empty lots, a convoy of white trucks and trailers idled incongruously while unmarked police cars blocked intersections nearby. On any other morning, a police presence would have meant more bad news: in a city that has one of the highest homicide rates in the United States, this neighborhood -- roughly a mile from the French Quarter -- has a murder rate that, in recent years, has hit quadruple that of the city as a whole. This morning, however, the 20 drivers, as well as 80 other crew members who hefted and humped a boggling array of gear at the tumbledown corner of Second Street and South Liberty, had anything but murder in mind: they were six hours into a day of filming the third episode of ''Treme,'' David Simon's new HBO drama -- co-created by the seasoned television writer and producer Eric Overmyer -- which is set in post-Katrina New Orleans and will make its debut on April 11. The production was only two scenes into the six on the call sheet; at that pace, they were looking at a 15-hour marathon -- yet another in the 11-day ultramarathon that shooting an hour of episodic television on location can demand. 
As the novelist George Pelecanos, a staff writer on ''Treme,'' told me of the years he spent on set as a writer-producer on ''The Wire,'' Simon's breakthrough series: ''If you got out with a 12-hour day, that was the luckiest day of the series. Try doing that for seven months straight. Only young people can do it. You don't see many people in their 50s carrying around lights.''
Though they weren't carrying around lights, two men of nearly 50 were on set, carrying on a conversation on a sunny street corner. One was David Mills, the writer credited with this episode and also a producer on ''Treme.'' Big and tall with a boyish face, Mills worked on ''ER'' and ''NYPD Blue'' but won his two Emmy Awards for adapting his old friend David Simon's nonfiction book ''The Corner,'' written with Edward Burns, into the miniseries of the same name for HBO. ''I'm a fan of TV,'' Mills told me. ''I can even watch an episode of 'Hawaii Five-0' and appreciate the way it's constructed to satisfy you. People used to think, It's HBO; you get to curse; it's gotta be better. But I wrote for The Washington Post. Just because there are certain words you can't use in The Post that, say, you can in The Village Voice, does not mean that the writing in The Village Voice is necessarily better than The Post. The liberty you have with HBO has nothing to do with the quality of storytelling. You have to earn it.''
 On the sunny corner with Mills stood Simon, a bald, big-featured, unprepossessing man who looks more like hired muscle going gently to pot than the most critically acclaimed writer-producer working in television today. The two had just been across the street in a corner house that serves as the location for Poke's, a bar central to ''Treme.'' Behind the building's flagrantly drooping corrugated-iron awning, inside the gutted space appointed with a bar and not much else, stood Simon and Mills, watching the director of the episode -- the imposing, dreadlocked Ernest Dickerson, a veteran of ''The Wire'' and cinematographer of such Spike Lee hits as ''Do the Right Thing'' -- as he rehearsed the two actors in the next scene. Though brief, the scene reads powerfully on the page. A young man who left New Orleans immediately before Katrina has just come back for the first time and has gone to the Lower Ninth Ward (the area hardest hit by the levee breaches) to see the home in which his father, now missing, chose to ride out the storm. The young man goes to Poke's to find an old friend of his father's, an independent contractor, explicitly to ask for advice about what can be done with the family home but implicitly in the hope that the man might have some word on his father's fate. In the script, it's clear that much more than a house is at stake: a pause falls in the middle of the scene, the gravity of the conversation allowed to settle in and then abate slightly, the men turning with some effort to other, easier topics. In rehearsal, despite a number of different blockings and Dickerson's quiet talks with the actors about the scene, the moment wasn't coming to life. With the scene minutes away from being shot, Mills and Simon needed to find a fix.
 ''Wasn't there a sentence in there somewhere that we don't have now,'' Simon asked Mills outside, ''where he says -- and this is a terrible sentence, but -- 'I went over to the house, and I was hoping there would be a message there or something'? I feel there's an emotional bump between him talking about his father, which is real substantive stuff, to a moment of what sounds like, by comparison, almost petty practicality about, What I'm going to do with Dad's house? It goes from one to the other and there's no. . . .''
 ''There's no transition,'' Mills said, looking down at his script, shaking his head.
 ''Maybe,'' Simon riffed, ''his father wrote in spray paint: 'I'm at so-and-so's house. Call me.' Maybe there's a. . . .''
 ''And he needs to say that literally?'' Mills said.
 ''No, that would be a terrible line.'' Simon paused, regrouping. '' 'I came back when they opened up the Lower Nine, hoping to find out what's up with Dad.' I agree that exposition here is more of a problem than a solution. But is there something that basically says: 'I came home trying to answer this riddle. I came back hoping Dad might've left word.' ''
 ''Hold on,'' Mills said, writing, repeating the words softly aloud and then saying to Simon, ''The thing I'm still resisting is him literally saying something about his dad there.'' Mills wrote a little more, paused, read aloud: '' 'Came back now that they lettin' people in the Lower Nine to check. The house is messed up bad.' ''
 ''That's it, that's it,'' Simon said, enthusiastic. '''Cause this can imply the father. . . .''
 Mills nodded. ''It's better than what it is now.'' Mills headed off to give Dickerson and the actors the changes.
 I asked Simon how often they resort to 11th-hour rewrites.
 ''It's not an uncommon thing,'' he said. ''The script is just the script. I can't walk around and show you'' -- Simon held up his script -- ''this was a good show we were going to make. You should read all the scripts, because it would have been great.'' Simon added later: ''If the material itself proves to be ordinary and ineffectual at conveying what we want to convey, I don't care how you shoot it. I don't want to watch it, and I don't want to be a part of it. Either we have something to say or we don't.''
 THE STORY LINES IN ''Treme'' begin three months after Katrina, and they follow a diverse group of characters as they rebuild their lives in a city torn apart, a city in which tens of thousands of houses are abandoned, in which only 50 percent of the population remains, in which neighborhoods are still without power. The main characters in ''Treme'' aren't the overburdened cops, spiraling addicts, ruthless dealers, struggling dockworkers, corrupt politicians or compromised journalists of ''The Wire.'' In their place, for the most part, are musicians, as the show's title sneakily suggests: ''Treme'' (pronounced trih-MAY) is the New Orleans neighborhood where jazz was born. And even though it adjoins the French Quarter, few tourists visit Treme, where generations of the city's musicians have lived.
 As much as crime of every kind was central to ''The Wire,'' music is the focus of ''Treme.'' New Orleans-born and Juilliard-trained Wendell Pierce (William ''Bunk'' Moreland in ''The Wire'') plays a trombone player looking for any gig he can get; Steve Zahn plays a feckless singer-songwriter with an allergy to paying work. As in ''The Wire,'' many nonactors, in this case professional musicians, have been cast in ''Treme'' in leading roles: the violinist Lucia Micarelli plays a street musician; a charismatic local trumpeter, Kermit Ruffins, plays himself; and dozens of other musicians -- from Dr. John to Elvis Costello -- appear in smaller parts. The cast is different from ''The Wire,'' however, because a number of more famous actors are part of ''Treme.'' John Goodman plays an English professor-novelist enraged by federal and municipal post-Katrina intransigence; the Academy Award-nominee Melissa Leo is a civil rights attorney with a soft spot for starving artists; and Clarke Peters, the distinguished stage and screen actor memorable in ''The Wire'' as the miniature-furniture-making detective Lester Freamon, plays an independent contractor and a Mardi Gras Indian chief.
 Given the role in which Simon himself has lately been cast by critics and viewers, expectations for ''Treme'' couldn't be higher. By the time ''The Wire'' reached the end of its run, commentators went from posing the coy question, ''Is 'The Wire' the best show on television?'' to making the bold statement, '' 'The Wire' is the best show on television''-- boldness that soon seemed spineless once seemingly everyone defaulted to calling it simply, ''The best show in television history.'' In the two years since ''The Wire'' concluded, a pitched battle of ongoing praise has upped the comparative ante. If likening Simon repeatedly to Dickens and Dreiser, Balzac and Tolstoy and Shakespeare hasn't proved adequately exalting, Bill Moyers lately freshened things up by calling Simon ''our Edward Gibbon,'' while the literary critic Walter Benn Michaels went so far as to suggest that the beauty and difficulty of watching ''The Wire'' in English -- the multifarious 21st-century English of Baltimore detectives and drug dealers -- compares with that of reading Dante in 14th-century Italian. It should go without saying that Duke; the University of California, Berkeley; and, next term, Harvard, are offering courses on the series, seminars focused not merely on the sophistication of its storytelling but also on its sociological and political perspicacity.
 NONE OF THIS external praise, however suggestive of the merits of ''The Wire'' it surely is, would have been possible were it not for the unusual internal support the show received from HBO. Its ratings were always in the modest-to-poor range, low enough that it would have barely broken the Top 200 on broadcast television and by all conceivable measures would have been canceled before its first season was finished, but at the center of the show's fervent core audience were many of HBO's top people. Chris Albrecht, the longtime chairman of HBO who stepped down in 2007, and Carolyn Strauss, president of HBO Entertainment at the time who now runs her own production company, greenlighted ''The Wire.'' (Simon calls them ''my patrons at the network.'') Although HBO functions under a subscription model and is less ratings-sensitive than networks dependent on advertisers, HBO does depend on revenue from foreign sales to 150 countries. As one HBO executive told me, ''Shows that feature African-Americans don't sell foreign.'' After Simon's second season of ''The Wire,'' which shifted the show's focus from the drug trade to the Baltimore docks, the cast grew whiter because there are more white dockworkers in Baltimore than white drug dealers. Modestly but not negligibly, ratings for that season rose. Albrecht hoped that the show might be catching on. Simon disabused Albrecht of the idea: the third season of the show, he promised, would shift back to the streets to close out the story line of a drug crew featured in the first season. Simon says Albrecht just laughed, telling Simon: ''You know, every now and then you could at least secretly admit to yourself that it's TV. I know we say: 'It's not TV. It's HBO.' But sometimes, it's got to be TV.''
 Even so, Simon's strategy for keeping his show going wasn't to make such admissions. The show's endurance ultimately had a very uncomplicated bottom line: Albrecht and Strauss wanted to see the end of the story Simon was telling, in large measure because, according to Albrecht, he was uncommonly persuasive. ''He writes amazing letters when he's trying to get you to come around to his point of view,'' Albrecht told me. ''Sometimes very angry, sometimes very cajoling, always brilliantly written and conceived.'' When a big one arrived, Albrecht and Strauss knew to brace themselves. ''I remember one time when Carolyn came downstairs with one of David's letters in hand. She asked, 'Did you open it yet?' '' Albrecht said, laughing. ''I said, 'Nope.' '' By the time Albrecht and Strauss left HBO, Simon had been given a chance to complete ''The Wire.'' Under the pair's tenure but owing to Simon's industry, the culture at HBO had come to see itself in Simon, this when ''The Sopranos'' was pulling in about five times as many viewers.
 Over the years, in scores of interviews, Simon has consistently made the point that ''The Wire'' was a show with an editorial agenda, a polemic about ''the America that got left behind.'' As such, a potential viewer could be forgiven for leaping to some reflexive conclusions about why Simon might have chosen New Orleans as the setting for ''Treme.'' Like Baltimore, New Orleans is an urban center with enormous economic disparity, violent crime, municipal corruption, infrastructural decay and racial polarization. Combine those increasingly routine urban shortfalls with the aftermath of a hurricane that revealed every kind of engineering failure, and the city would seem to give Simon an even more haunted urban theater where he can play out the theme upon which he has regularly soapboxed: ''the decline of the American empire.''
 '' 'Treme' is not 'The Wire,' '' the show's co-creator, Eric Overmyer, who joined ''The Wire'' in Season 4, told me last December. ''Those who are expecting 'The Wire' or wanting 'The Wire' may be frustrated.'' It's a disclaimer repeated nearly verbatim by so many members of the ''Treme'' production staff that it could sound like a talking point -- until you actually watch the show. Whereas through its five seasons ''The Wire'' built a vivid portrait of urban America as seen through the prism of its institutions and professions -- the police department, the drug trade, the dockworkers, the local government, the schools, the press -- ''Treme,'' though no less focused on the workings and failings of 21st-century American urban existence, tells its story not through a city's institutions but through its individuals. It isn't that ''The Wire'' lacked for distinctive characters: Omar, the homicidal ethicist; Bubbles, the embattled addict; D'Angelo Barksdale, the doomed-by-decency street dealer -- there were scores of them. But because so many of the show's story lines dramatized the futility of any of these characters' attempts to break through social and economic ceilings, the image of contemporary urban America that the show offered was one in which character wasn't fate so much as a fait accompli: in the land of the free market, Simon was arguing, free will wasn't going to get you very far. In ''Treme,'' Simon seems to be arguing for the very opposite idea: the triumph of the individual will despite all impediments, a show about people, artists for the most part, whose daily lives depend upon the free exercise of their wills to create -- out of nothing, out of moments -- something beautiful.
 SIMON'S DESIRE TO do a show in New Orleans predates ''The Wire.'' In the mid-'90s, he began writing regularly on NBC's ''Homicide,'' Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana's long-running adaptation of Simon's own nonfiction account of the year he spent embedded in a Baltimore homicide-detectives unit, Simon met Overmyer, a more senior writer-producer with the show. Overmyer owned a second home in New Orleans, as he does to this day, and very soon he and Simon, who had been taking regular trips to New Orleans for some time, found they were talking more about their record collections and experiences in New Orleans than about ''Homicide.'' It wasn't long before they were thinking out loud about how great it would be to shoot a show down there. The problem was that they didn't know what show. ''We couldn't figure out how to pitch it,'' Simon told me last fall. ''Both of us imagined the pitch meeting, and we imagined trying to explain New Orleans and being unable to. If I could explain it to you sitting here now, I wouldn't have to do the show. That's the problem: you literally have to drag whatever executive you've got to New Orleans, throw him into a second line''-- local parades led by brass bands are followed by a ''second line'' of dancers who join in spontaneously --''get him drunk, take him here, take him there. It would have to be a lost week: you're not in America anymore -- you're in New Orleans! We couldn't imagine being able to do that. In fact, we imagined being escorted off the lot. We laughed about it. We said, 'Pipe dream.' ''
 Years passed, and Simon went on to ''The Wire.'' During preparation for Season 4, Katrina happened. Simon told me: ''Eric was in Baltimore. We were in the writing stage before filming. And I remember in the office looking at the satellite photos on the Internet of his house. And him going: 'I think I'm O.K.; I think I'm dry.' '' A few weeks later, Simon was reading the industry trades and saw that three or four New Orleans shows had suddenly appeared in development. There was ''K-Ville,'' which had a brief run in 2007; a project Spike Lee was developing with NBC that didn't come to fruition; a few more. Simon knew they had to act quickly: ''I said to Eric, 'We've got to go out right now.' So we flew out to L.A., and Carolyn Strauss bought the idea of us writing something, 'cause there's not that much money in the script, not a huge investment. And I think on some level she was being polite. You know, ' ''The Wire'' is good, ''The Corner'' has been good; I can't say no to you.' But I don't think she got it. I think if you talk to her, she'd be like, 'They didn't do a good job explaining it.' I remember this exchange, which is us trying to explain the Mardi Gras Indians, and somewhere in the middle of the pitch she goes, 'When you say ''Indians,'' do you mean woo-woo-woo?' And we're like, 'Yes . . . and no,' '' Simon laughed. '' 'Not Native American but, yeah, woo-woo-woo-woo.' ''
 ''David and Eric were valiant in their attempt to explain their show to me,'' Strauss, now an independent executive producer on ''Treme,'' told me in an e-mail message. ''But I couldn't seem to get it at all. Because I have complete creative trust in David, I told them to write it.'' Simon and Overmyer began discussing possible ideas the following summer, but it wasn't until the next year that writing started. ''David did most of the heavy lifting initially,'' Overmyer says. Simon sent him a draft of a pilot that had a provisional set of characters and was about 80 percent of a whole but missing scenes. ''He did this on 'The Wire,' too,'' Overmyer says. ''He said, 'I can't do the domestic scenes; you do the domestic scenes.' I always thought, He's giving me the girlie scenes,'' Overmyer says, laughing. ''On 'The Wire,' he'd say to me, 'You write the scene when McNulty has dinner with his ex-wife.' Always the girlie scenes.'' Once Overmyer filled in the missing moments, the two began bouncing versions back and forth, revising repeatedly, until, organically, the balance of their contributions to the whole achieved parity. ''David and I have a good dialectic,'' Overmyer says. ''He's a journalist, and I'm a playwright by trade, so I think he tends to wanting to make larger statements about the city than I do, and I tend to resist that a little.''
 By spring 2008, two and a half years after the pilot was ordered, they agreed on a draft that they would take to HBO, beginning what tends to be a perilous stage in the development of a series, when the executives charged with paying for production have their say. ''On one script,'' Overmyer says of an experience developing a show with a different network, ''I counted it up: I actually got 72 separate sets of notes -- from the production company, the studio, the network -- many of them contradictory.'' The most memorable note Overmyer ever received was from an executive very high up at a network. ''She said, 'They're being so unpleasant with each other.' And I said: 'Well, that's drama. That's conflict.' And she actually said, 'Could we have the drama . . . without the conflict?' ''
 Simon remembers many network notes when writing for ''Homicide.'' ''The notes felt like they were not serving the best possible story,'' Simon explained. ''Jimmy Yoshimura -- Eric worked as supervising producer with him, and I was a junior producer under them -- Yosh used to do this notes meeting, call me in and say, 'Come on, let's do the antler dance.' And I said, 'What's the antler dance?' And I swear to God, he would put his phone on the floor, on speakerphone, so you'd hear the voice of the network exec. And with his voice, Jim would approximate a reasonable, 'Well, that's a very good note, but if we do that. . . .' But his body language would begin with his hands up above his head as if he were wearing antlers, like some sort of drum circle, and he would dance around the phone, gesturing obscenely to it, do a little more dancing, but all the while he would be saying, 'Oh, no, that's a really good note, we'll have to consider that. Let me talk to Tom [Fontana], because I think we're going to do something in another episode.' Meanwhile, he'd pull down his zipper and stick his thumb through it, and if the guy kept persisting on a note and he couldn't talk him out of it, Yosh would get down on the floor, close to the speakerphone and. . . .''
 Yoshimura claims that there are limits to Simon's recall. ''No, no, no, that was David!'' Simon offered the following rebuttal via e-mail: ''I will own the origin of this particular gesture if that is Jim's memory, but in the event that he is trying now these many years later to whitewash his authorship of the sacred ritual of the network-note antler dance, I can only quote 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' and John Wayne's remark to Jimmy Stewart: 'Think back, pilgrim.' ''
 AT THE CORPORATE headquarters of HBO in Manhattan, on an October morning last year, I met two of the executives who greenlighted production of ''Treme'': Michael Lombardo, president of programming, and Richard Plepler, a co-president of the network to whom Lombardo reports.
 ''In David's case,'' Lombardo said, ''he and Eric wrote a script, a very detailed synopsis of where they were taking the show. But it wasn't only a treatise: he made you read it while listening to a soundtrack. And David would ask you: 'Did you listen to the music while you were reading this? Because if you didn't, before we start. . . ?' And you'd go, 'Uhhhh. . . .' ''
 ''The way David presented it,'' Plepler explained further, ''was with a musical accompaniment and detailed instructions of what to listen to while you were reading it. It's an unusual request of an auteur to an executive.''
 So, Simon had notes for them. Any from them to him?
 ''I think we tend to be a fairly hands-off company creatively,'' Lombardo said.
 ''Once we get the shared vision understood, that's the case,'' Plepler said. ''David has a vision, and once we understand it, you embrace that vision. We're not there to suggest that a character act in a different way or that we wish it had a different ending.''
 So, no notes?
 Plepler paused. ''If Mike or Sue Naegle'' -- president in charge of HBO series and specials -- ''had a note for somebody who was trying to get a pilot sold, the natural response of that person would be: 'You know, that's a good note. Let me take that back. That's a good insight. Thank you for that.' ''
 Lombardo added, ''People want pilots made!''
 Plepler continued: ''And they're saying to themselves, 'All right, they clearly want a little more of this and a little less of that, and I'll give it to them.' David is not playing that game.''
 ''He wrote me an e-mail years ago,'' Lombardo remembered, ''in which he accused me of something, I didn't know what it meant. I had to go to the dictionary. He accused me of flummery.''
 ''I don't know that word!'' Plepler said.
 ''I clearly did not. . . .''
 ''What is flummery?'' Plepler asked him. Lombardo did an I-have-no-idea shake of the head. Plepler looked at me. ''Do you know what 'flummery' is?''
 Empty speech, I said.
 ''Huh,'' Plepler said. ''Very good.''
 What flummery, I asked Lombardo, had he been guilty of?
 ''It was part of an unhappy e-mail to me but, you know what, I don't even remember. Here's the thing: Before David knows you. . . . ''
 ''That's right,'' Plepler said.
 ''. . . he assumes that you're not going to understand what he has to say.''
 SIMON WORKS ON every script by every writer of every show he produces. On ''Treme,'' he and Overmyer share the process equally, sending scripts back and forth, revising and polishing and revising again (Mills, too, is rewriting scripts by other staff writers). This process is common to episodic television, time constraints making it such that no single writer could generate a season. What is less common is how little credit Simon takes for the rewriting he does.
 ''He would take a script into his room when the deadline was that night,'' Pelecanos told me, ''and he'd go in there and lock the door, and he'd redo the whole script.'' The novelist Richard Price, who also wrote for ''The Wire,'' told me there's nothing capricious about such thorough revision: ''You really need a single sensibility at the top, a writer-producer who's a ruthless rewriter. It's like an assembly line; Episode 3 has perfectly got to follow from Episode 2 and also perfectly set up Episode 4.'' Typically, however, when show-runners polish scripts, they add their names as co-writers, an act which, according to the Writers Guild of America, cuts the original writer's script fee -- around $32,700 for an hour of episodic premium cable -- in half, the other half going to the show-runner who typically has a seven-figure deal. Very literally, Simon doesn't take credit. ''It's almost like David feels guilty that he's so successful,'' Price told me. ''He's more than decent. He's like an old Democrat, an old lefty.'' Pelecanos added: ''I've seen shows that are on right now where the show-runner has their name on every script. And if any of those episodes are up for an Emmy Award, the show runner's gonna get an Emmy Award. When I was nominated for an Emmy'' -- one of only two Emmy nominations that ''The Wire'' received during its five-season run -- ''had I won, I would have gone up there and accepted that award; but David also wrote part of that script.''
 One September morning, the writers convened around a table in the ''Treme'' production offices in the Lower Garden District to make some decisions about one of their key characters. Simon and Overmyer sat paterfamilially at either end of the table. To Simon's immediate left was Chris Yakaitis, a young Baltimorean who worked on ''The Wire'' as a researcher and is now ''Treme's'' script coordinator -- a sort of editor and proofreader. Nina K. Noble sat at Simon's right hand where, figuratively, she has been sitting for more than a decade: Noble has produced all four of Simon's HBO series. (''My credibility is predicated on working with Nina,'' Simon says. ''Nina makes us come in on budget all the time. Ask HBO how many shows they have that come in on budget.'') Stationed at the table's flanks were the members of the writing staff: Mills, Pelecanos and two New Orleans-based writers as variedly accomplished in their fields as they are new to writing television: Lolis Eric Elie, whose family has lived for generations in New Orleans, is a former columnist for The Times-Picayune, author of ''Smokestack Lightning,'' a book on the culture of barbecue, and maker of ''Faubourg Treme,'' a documentary on the neighborhood where he lives; and a New Orleans transplant and longtime resident, Tom Piazza, a writer of nine books, including the post-Katrina nonfiction call-to-arms ''Why New Orleans Matters'' and the Katrina novel ''City of Refuge.'' With ''The Wire,'' Simon had two decades as a reporter and resident to draw upon, but both he and Overmyer, despite many years of experience with New Orleans, knew they couldn't begin to approximate the intimacy of locals in a city where, as Simon has put it, ''even the nuances have nuances.''
 Also jammed into the cramped, amenity-free conference room that day were two Peabody Award-winning documentarians, Andrew Kolker and Louis Alvarez, who were making slow circles around the table, gathering footage for possible inclusion in ''Getting Back to Abnormal,'' a documentary they're making with Peter Odabashian and Paul Stekler about life in post-Katrina New Orleans, to air later this year on PBS. In the hours of conversation that Kolker and Alvarez shot, Simon can be seen leading a discussion about the back story of a character whom they expected to introduce in the second episode but were now writing into the pilot. The 80-minute cut of the pilot, established four months earlier, would have some scenes reshot and others added when shooting for the series began in November.
 As Alvarez's boom mike bobbed over the table and Kolker padded around filming, the group discussed a character named Creighton Bernette, the novelist and professor to be played by John Goodman but who, at the time of this writers' meeting, had not been cast. Creighton was as yet a creature who existed only in the realm of ideas.
 ''I'd love to talk that particular story line through,'' Mills said. Previously, Simon and Overmyer decided that Creighton would be teaching at Tulane. Mills asked Piazza when he imagined Creighton, who they decided wouldn't be a native New Orleanean, came to the city and why.
 ''Probably in his late 20s,'' Piazza said. ''He may have just gotten the teaching gig.'' Piazza paused. ''There's a dimension of some departments, where at some places, they wish it was Harvard, so he may have ended up there and gotten tenure, and -- especially if he was from the Northeast, let's say, he may have had some kind of. . . .''
 ''Oh, I got a. . . . This is interesting, keep going.''
 ''. . . idea of being a real academic star and ends up a biggish fish in what he considers to be a smallish academic pond and found himself in a certain life.''
 ''What if,'' Simon said, ''he had a decent showing on a first novel. And the first novel didn't have anything to do with New Orleans. It was written before he came here or when he was coming here and was writing off of life experiences that were more universal than New Orleans.''
 ''And might have gotten the gig off it,'' Overmyer added.
 ''Then he comes here. And the second book is New Orleans-based, well received, but doesn't do as well in the world in the way that. . . .'' Simon interrupted himself: ''There's two things about New Orleans that are sort of counter to each other: it does create, at points, art that becomes universal, that actually leaves New Orleans. But then there's something else: you can get lost in the ornate esoterica of this very unusual place and you can -- and maybe we're doing it here'' -- everyone laughed -- ''and maybe we'll be commenting more on this after the debacle of this season.'' Simon laughed. ''What if it's the novel of the transplant who gets everything right and yet. . . .''
 The riffs continued, the conversation touching on the curious psychology of writers, the nature of moral and dramatic character, the matter of manhood and marriage, of what it means to try to make art and what it means to encounter disaster and the chance to survive it and what such a survival might cost.
 ''THIS GUY HAS the whole history of New Orleans music in his head,'' Simon told me between takes at a recording studio called the Living Room. The guy in question was Dr. John, the legendary New Orleans musician and bandleader. Dr. John, who also goes by Mac Rebennack, was sitting at a grand piano in gray ponytail and dark shades, surrounded by musicians, including his touring band -- horns, bass, drums and guitar -- each playing little snippets of this and that while the ''Treme'' crew prepared to shoot a brief conversation between Dr. John and the band and then a live performance of the standard ''My Indian Red,'' a song of quasi-liturgical significance in the rich traditions of the Mardi Gras Indians. The scene was meant to take place in New York, a ''rehearsal'' for a Jazz at Lincoln Center Katrina benefit concert. Dr. John ran through his lines. One exchange stood out.
 ''Hey, Mac, you gonna call the Indians like you do on the album?'' said a horn player, Ken Williams.
 ''Well, it might cause some serious confusementalism amongst the Lincoln Center set,'' Dr. John replied.
 ''Confusementalism,'' it turned out, was Dr. John's coinage. ''We were trying to write in Dr. John's unique voice, which is something of a fool's errand,'' Simon said. ''I wrote the word 'confusement' in the script. Mac looked at the script and said, 'Y'all are trying to do Dr. John.' And then he said, 'I can do it your way; it is television so it can't be accurate'-- he said 'ac-rit.' And I said, 'What the hell.' '' Simon laughed. '' 'Let it be accurate this one time.' ''
 The crew made quick work of shooting Dr. John's dialogue with the band, as if urgently trying to get to the real matter at hand: performance. Six takes of ''My Indian Red'' followed in short succession. Before Ernest Dickerson had even shouted, ''Cut!'' on one take, one of the crew got carried away and couldn't keep from clapping, a big film-set no-no. The offender? Simon, who was Christmas-morning giddy.
 ''If we can't sell this,'' he said, ''we can't sell nothin'.''
 IT WAS 5:30 P.M., and the sun had just set, and a grave blue twilight was settling in the streets that surround the loading dock of the ''Treme'' production offices. Clarke Peters was trying to get something right.
 ''I want to figure out how to make all of these feathers shake,'' he said.
 Standing in the center of a large concrete void, bathed in fluorescent light, Peters, white-gloved hands balled into fists, held them before him as if bracing against what force you could not have said. You could see his fists shaking, though, which in turn were shaking his arms, but you could not see his arms or his chest or his legs. All of them, the whole of him with the exception of his white fists and the red toes of a pair of otherwise unseen boots, were obscured by an astonishing collision of feathers, a huge suit of canary yellow feathers, accented in red feathers and red patches inset with glittering silver and gold beads, arms hung with plumes, the rear tailed with a great puff of orange and crimson from which a few dark peacock feathers trailed. From the center of it all, Peters's dark brown face minutely peered.
 ''So,'' Peters said, ''that doesn't work.'' Peters did a shake move that was indeed not working so well. ''But this. . . .'' and then he did another that did.
 That accomplished, Peters began to sing. His voice was deep, full of music, the singing a kind of chanting that never ceased to be song:
 BARkin' out thunnnnnDER!
 ROARrin' out lightNING!
 KICKin' over tombSTONES!
 WAKIN' up the DEAD!
 If you've seen ''The Corner,'' in which Peters -- who was once a touring singer and has played Sky Masterson in ''Guys and Dolls'' -- was the ailing, soft-spoken corner drug addict Fat Curt, you are already aware that Peters is a man with a gift for conveying a kind of dignity that can't be feigned. That dignity is the ideal at the heart of the thing that Peters is not so much performing as channeling in this concrete basin: the Mardi Gras Indian.
 In contemporary New Orleans life, Mardi Gras Indians appear a few times a year, most notably at Mardi Gras in an elaborate feathered suit that, typically, they have spent the year designing and sewing, different every year, although no one seems to know exactly why. Some say that when the French controlled the slave trade and yellow fever and famine struck their settlements, the slaves fled inland and were given refuge by Native Americans. In that story, as a function of their gratitude, the slaves paid homage through song, dance and dress, the native and the West African traditions conjoining, a marriage that would help give birth to the music of New Orleans.
 Peters's Big Chief is beautiful in every earthly way: lovely and completely unnecessary and for its lack of necessity somehow all the more essential. Shortly after Peters finished confirming that his feathers quivered to his satisfaction, Donald Harrison Jr. swooped into the fluorescent space and greeted Peters warmly. The son of the late, great Big Chief Donald Harrison Sr., a legendary Mardi Gras chief, Harrison Jr. has carried on the tradition and become a chief himself. Peters and the production are consulting him to ensure that their portrayal of a chief is true to the truth of the thing -- whatever word you can abide that means some equivalent of ''mystical.'' That otherworldliness was apparent as Peters -- who by that time was shedding the 58 pounds of feathers in big pieces (headdress, arm-plumes, the great orange and crimsoned rear end) -- began dancing and singing antiphonally with Harrison, who had donned the great feathered rear and himself begun to dance and spin and chant with Peters, Peters's voice low and sweet, Harrison's higher and milder, the two singing at each other as blue twilight became black night.
 ''THERE'S A THING about being capable of a great moment,'' Simon told me on a break from shooting. ''This city is capable of moments unlike any moments you'll ever experience in life. To see an Indian come down the street in full regalia on St. Joseph's Night on an unlit street of messed-up shotgun houses and one burned-out car, and he's the most beautiful thing on the planet, and everything around him is falling down. It's a glorious instant of human endeavor. It's duende from the Spanish, chills on the back of your neck, and then the next minute it's gone. Lots of American places used to make things. Detroit used to make cars. Baltimore used to make steel and ships. New Orleans still makes something. It makes moments. I don't mean that to sound flippant, and I don't mean it to sound more or less than what it is, but they're artists with a moment, they can take a moment and make it into something so transcendent that you're not quite sure that it happened or that you were a part of it.''
 It is odd to watch transcendence happen. Late in a long week of shooting, on a Friday in December, production was at an upscale house. A small scene. A character was listening to George Bush's post-Katrina ''Jackson Square'' speech: ''The passionate soul of a great city will return,'' etc. The scene amounts to a long, slow, tight close-up on the character's face as he registers, with a mix of fury and enormous sadness, the insufficiency of what is being said. You could see his face on monitors in the next room, a large kitchen with nice woodwork and an island. Off to one side was the live feed from the camera in the small, adjoining room. Ernest Dickerson sat in his director's chair and watched takes on the screen, calling, ''Cut!'' asking for another, calling, ''Action!'' again and again, 60 seconds of Bush's speech echoing in the large house, playing over and again: ''To every person who has served and sacrificed in this emergency, I offer the gratitude of our country. And tonight I also offer this pledge of the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives.''
 I can't say how many takes it took, but at a certain point during one of them, I looked away from the monitors and around the kitchen. It was full of people, its perimeter rung with standing bodies. Steve Zahn and Melissa Leo, David Simon and his assistant, the owner of the house and his pregnant fiancee, the first assistant director and the script supervisor, two stand-ins, a grip. Bush spoke, his voice loud, sure, echoing through the house. I looked at the faces around the kitchen and, to a one, all were staring down at the floor, all perfectly silent, perfectly still, utterly alone. Had anyone entered the kitchen at that moment, someone who hadn't known what was happening, the only conclusion anyone could have drawn was that something tremendous had just been lost.
 Dickerson shouted, ''Cut!''
 Everyone looked up. And then went back to work.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 21, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Page 26 this weekend about the filming of the HBO drama ''Treme'' reverses the roles of Andrew Kolker and Louis Alvarez, who are making a documentary titled ''Getting Back to Abnormal,'' about life in post-Katrina New Orleans. Mr. Kolker is the cameraman and Mr. Alvarez handles the sound recording. The article also refers incorrectly to the creation of an unrelated documentary, ''Faubourg Treme.'' Dawn Logsdon is the director and an editor; Lolis Eric Elie is not the lone ''maker'' of the documentary. (He is Ms. Logsdon's co-director as well as the writer and a producer.)

HEADLINE: Obesity and Sugary Drinks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Obesity-Hunger Paradox'' (news article, March 14) bears out my experience over nearly 30 years as a physician in the South Bronx and medical director at two borough hospitals. The paradox that obesity and food insecurity are both highest in that borough is borne out in all the best academic studies. 
 There is a unifying factor: the Bronx has the city's highest rate of sugary beverage consumption. Amid a ''food desert'' and during a recession, one entirely unessential food type thrives -- sugary beverages. The causes are inescapable.
 Sugar-sweetened beverages are underpriced and oversized. They are universally available and relentlessly marketed, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. The 1-cent-per-ounce tax on sugary beverages supported by Gov. David A. Paterson, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and virtually every public health and health care professional organization in the state will begin to correct this market failure.
 As we contemplate draconian budget cuts and/or borrowing against our children's earnings, the one good thing we could do in this miserable budget year would be to adopt the tax, to cut our state's deficit and guarantee that future generations of taxpayers are healthy and productive, with health care costs that will not bankrupt them or their employers.
 Richard F. Daines New York State Health Commissioner Albany, March 14, 2010
 To the Editor:
 New Yorkers may be surprised to learn about a seemingly contradictory correlation between obesity and poverty among Bronx children. This is not an isolated phenomenon; it is driving the childhood obesity epidemic, the epicenter of which is rural America.
 Poor rural families are often forced to choose sugary drinks and chips because they're cheaper and full-service supermarkets are scarce. As a result, half of children in these families are overweight or obese, compared with one in three children nationwide.
 Reversing this epidemic from the Bronx to Biloxi means innovative projects that bring fruits and grains to impoverished areas and enhanced government nutrition programs. Ultimately, though, it comes down to what kids put on their forks. Healthy eating habits and fitness must become elemental to a child's education and upbringing.

HEADLINE: Driven Young Man With a Basketball Mission

BYLINE: By DANIEL LIBIT

 BODY:
De La Salle and Foreman High Schools battled for the 4A state basketball sectional semifinals March 10 in a packed Maywood gym, but in many ways, the most interesting action was unfolding in the north bleachers. There, two rows up from the floor, Daniel Poneman held court in his usual fashion. 
 Every few moments, Mr. Poneman stood up to greet someone he knew, and by the end of the evening, it seemed as if he had exchanged handshakes and hugs with half of those in attendance. The gym was one giant flowchart before him. Even as Mr. Poneman tracked the action, a recruiter from Purdue, a local basketball legend, and a former Foreman coach who has since moved to Niles North High School all passed -- very noticed -- before Mr. Poneman's well-trained eyes. 
''I really wouldn't call him a scout,'' said Nate Pomeday, an assistant coach at Oregon State. ''I would call him more of a professional networker.''
 Mr. Poneman, 18, and now, not quite a year after graduation from Evanston Township High School, puts none of this to waste. For four years now, he has used his preternatural ability to collect information and rub elbows to create a Web site and network relied upon by college coaches as an essential tool for recruiting Illinois players. And now, not quite a year after his high school graduation, he is weeks away from inaugurating a national Web site focused on appraising high school athletes, primarily for the benefit of college coaches.
 Mr. Poneman works nearly without pause -- skipping sleep two nights a week, he said, and living in a spartan bachelor pad in Lincoln Park. Yet none of it, so far, has made him much money. His Web site takes in some advertising from Google but is barely profitable. Even a showcase tournament he plans to host late this month will net only about $8,000. ''My only expense is living,'' Mr. Poneman said. ''I don't buy any luxuries, and I sacrifice everything else.''
 Still, Mr. Poneman is building something he hopes will be more valuable over time: A network of people that, in Mr. Poneman's view, have economic value over time.
 ''My goal is not to make as much money as possible now but to build as much capital as possible,'' he said. ''Eventually, I will be able to transfer that capital.''
 For now, that capital takes the form of his Facebook page, where he has 4,300 friends, and his uploads to YouTube, where his player interviews and scouting videos have drawn 500,000 page views in just seven months. Mr. Poneman has 2,000 contacts stuffed into his cellphone directory. 
 He hopes to begin cashing in on the networking efforts in three weeks, when he inaugurates the new Web site, tentatively titled swagair.com. Though he keeps his revenue model and most other details private, Mr. Poneman said he had enlisted seven writers from around the country to contribute and was gearing the site to have a national focus like Scout.com and Rivals.com. 
 ''The strategy all happened itself,'' he said. ''I didn't come up with it. Only after it was in motion could I see what it was that I was doing.'' 
 When Mr. Poneman set off on this path four years ago, he was a novelty: a white, suburban, Jewish kid with braces making his mark in the Chicago prep basketball scene. Videos of postgame player interviews on the Web site he created, Illinoishsbasketball.com, won a strong following of a few thousand daily readers, among them players and coaches in Chicago, and college recruiters around the country. He has built from there.
 Along the way, he has not lost sight of what originally attracted him to his work: His ability to provide exposure and opportunity for lesser-known players in Illinois and, eventually, perhaps other states. 
 ''All the same stuff gets written over and over,'' said Mr. Poneman, who is from Evanston, ''so the same kids get overexposed. But there are so many kids who need the help because fans don't want to read them.'' 
 The challenge now, he said, is to prove he made the right decision when he decided to forgo college.
 ''I would not skip college just so I could become a basketball scout and make money,'' he said. ''I would only make that choice if there was a larger impact I could make.''
 At the heart of his efforts, Mr. Poneman said, is a desire to help as many local athletes as he can to parlay their talents into college scholarships. 
 His March 28 tournament is designed to showcase lesser-known players to coaches from mid- and lower-level college programs. He expects more than 100 athletes to participate at the one-day event in Deerfield.
 ''His whole outlook, his vision, is different than a lot of everybody else's,'' said Sundance Wicks, an assistant coach at Northern Illinois University. ''He is not just about the kids who are going big time. He is going to help a kid who might not have a chance or a look, and he is giving to them an outlet, a chance to be seen.''

HEADLINE: Taiwan's Steaming Pools of Paradise

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS. 
ANDREW JACOBS is a correspondent in the Beijing bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
THERE is nothing quite as bracing as the smell of rotten eggs in the morning.
The odor, which courses through the lobby and rooms of some of the finest hotels on Taiwan's northern end, is a telltale indication that you've arrived in hot spring country -- a lush and mountainous region that forms the island's volcanic belly.
Its therapeutic allure dates back a century, when Japanese soldiers wounded in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 took solace in the sulfurous waters that burble forth, above the tectonic collision of the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates. These days, workaday refugees from the mercantile bustle of Taipei, the island's capital, flock here to soak away ailments real and imagined.
The Taiwanese swear by its healing powers. ''If you have athlete's foot, you will be cured. If you have aches and pains, they will disappear,'' said Lin Tai Shan, a tea shop owner, as he slipped into a steaming eddy at Bayen, one of 400 hot springs scattered across Taiwan. ''If you spend time in these waters, you will not need psychotherapy.'' 
While hot springs are found throughout Taiwan, the quickest way to sample the waters is at Beitou, a mere half-hour subway ride from central Taipei, which was built by the Japanese during the 50 years they colonized Taiwan. Poised on the outer edge of the capital's sprawl and hugging the foot of Yangmingshan National Park, Beitou provides a lively base to explore both the urban and rural permutations of the hot spring culture.
A dozen hotels line Guangming Road, a serpentine byway that carries travelers from the hum of downtown Beitou to the cicada-filled buzz of the forested hills. The Broadway Hotel is typical, a bland high-rise offering simple rooms in two styles: Japanese (tatami mat sleeping) or with conventional raised beds.
Most rooms feature oversize tubs with faucets that spew out the stinky, sulfurous elixir that draws throngs of Taiwanese in the chilly winter months. Nicer hotels also have sex-segregated communal baths where day-trippers and the more gregarious can mingle in large pools. Nudity is the norm.
But Beitou's main event is the municipal bath, an outdoor collection of cascading basins, lined with dark mountain schist, that form the civic heart of town. Open until 10 p.m. and with a democratic entry fee of 40 Taiwan dollars, or $1.23 at 32 Taiwan dollars to the U.S. dollar, the scene is multigenerational, and fully clothed, with families hopping among pools that range from skin-scalding to teeth-chattering.
The atmosphere is festive, with plump teenagers doing sit-ups on the raised stone sitting areas while the elderly, immersed up to their earlobes, gossip over plastic canisters of cool tea. Rule No. 9 on the wall -- ''It is inadvisable to spend more than 15 minutes in the hot spring'' -- seems to be universally ignored. ''The Japanese gave us this,'' said one well-wrinkled matron, referring to the highly social culture of public bathing. ''They also built railroads, and schools and roads.''
As an expatriate living in China, where the Japanese invasion and occupation are recalled with unrestrained venom, I found it jarring to hear such positive sentiments about Japan's colonization of Taiwan. One hotel manager offered another view, recalling how Japan turned Beitou into something of a comfort town for its soldiers. Taiwanese women, he said with some embarrassment, provided the comfort. ''It took a long time for people to forget Beitou's dark reputation,'' he said.
When one's skin becomes sufficiently pruned, there is always a visit to the Beitou Hot Spring Museum, occupying a lodge built during the Japanese era, or to Hell Valley, a geothermal gulch with hissing vents and scalding ponds that still evokes comparisons to the afterlife.
Next to Beitou's honky-tonk, the wilds of Yangmingshan are positively bucolic. It became a national park in 1985, after centuries of drawing miners who sought the sulfur deposits for gun-powder. The main draws nowadays are bird-watching, hiking through bamboo groves and, of course, an embarrassment of hot springs.
The waters at the public Lengshuikeng, a mandatory stop on the park's hot-bath circuit, may translate as a ''cold water pit,'' but it is still plenty hot at 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Its ferrous, reddish-brown waters are a refreshing alternative to the sulfur baths that quickly tarnish silver jewelry.
If you have any interest in the tortured politics of Taiwan, it's worth checking out the nearby Yangming Shuwu, an army-green villa where President Chiang and his wife, Soong-Mei-ling, better known as Madame Chiang Kai-shek, sought refuge from the stifling summers of the Taipei basin. Now a museum, it is a spartan place, full of black-and-white photos of the president and relics of his 25-year reign. There is something melancholy about the place -- the Forbidden City it's not -- and despite the magnificent views, one can almost imagine the generalissimo's frustrated pacing as he came to realize he would never retake the mainland.
In between baths, take a hike through Yangmingshan's many trails, the top draw being Qixing shan, the tallest peak in Taiwan's north and a haunting landscape of steaming fumaroles, wind-gnarled cedars and oceans of swaying silver grass. It is also a popular spot for mainland tourists.
Since a 2008 accord between the two governments, 3,000 visitors from China have been allowed onto the island each day for one-week tours. The influx has been a boon for Taiwan's recessionary economy, as well as for the hot springs, which have seen their popularity rise.
Locals don't sneer at the mainland money, but they often gripe about a lack of politesse among the Chinese. On a recent visit, a busload of tourists from Sichuan Province arrived at Xiaoyoukeng, a steaming basin just below the peak. The Chinese were effusive about Taiwan. ''We are brothers,'' said a man stamping out his cigarette before climbing back on the bus. ''One day we will be a single nation again. In the end, business will bring us together.''
After a thigh-straining, two-hour hike through rhododendron forests and volcanic rocks, it was time for Bayen, a venerable hot spring considered to be almost mystical. It is a 20-minute drive from Qixing shan, on a serpentine road that hugs a forested hillside and provides a distant view of the sea.
To get there, head down the driveway that leads to a new high-end lodge and look for the dirt trail with the No Trespassing sign. Locals say the police rarely intervene, and besides, the reward is worth the trouble: a hidden glen where a rivulet of boiling water meets the cold cascade of a mountain stream.
For years, a society of Bayen devotees have come to this spot to escape the commercial baths, with their entry fees and concrete basins. They planted flowering clematis, built deep soaking pools with native rocks and even erected changing rooms out of wooden poles and swatches of colorful fabric. It feels like a meticulous community garden, with volunteers even draining the pools weekly. ''Smoke your cigarettes at the tail of the wind,'' read one hand-painted sign. ''Wash your hair at the tail of the river,'' advised another.
After the succession of pipe-fed basins, there is something remarkable about the pools at Bayen, where the source emerges straight from the earth, and the pools, some exhilarating, some near scalding, are surrounded by an amphitheater of green. With much of my clothing hanging from a branch, I eased into a swirling, steaming pond. After the initial sting, the heat proved to be an elixir, vanquishing aches from the hike and subsuming any lingering anxieties brought on by my life in Beijing. The overall effect was intoxicating.
There were a half-dozen people already soaking. Everyone wore a knowing smile that said: Yes, you've discovered paradise.
Liao Yan Chen, 68, a retired electric company worker, first came to this spot as a 7-year-old, and he still makes the hourlong drive from Taipei at least once a week. He said the waters keep him healthy, sane and connected to nature. ''I sleep so much better after I bathe here,'' he said. ''I think the world would be a better place if everyone spent more time soaking in the hot springs.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 19, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on March 21 about Taiwan's hot springs referred incorrectly to air service between Taipei and New York. There are indeed direct flights between the two cities; it is not the case that flights require a connection. (Flights on China Airlines and Eva Air from New York to Taipei require a fuel stop; their flights from Taipei to New York are nonstop.) A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail received Sept. 3.

HEADLINE: Circus Acts Can Make Almost Anyone a Celebrity

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
James Warren is a columnist for the Chicago News Cooperative.
 To understand our era, you could go to Cook County Foreclosure or Eviction Court and inspect the damage of the greed, deceit and self-delusion found in the subprime mortgage debacle and related economic ills.
Or you could just turn on NBC's ''Celebrity Apprentice'' Sunday and watch Rod R. Blagojevich and Donald J. Trump. 
 The indicted former governor may symbolize supposedly nefarious ''pay to play'' politics. And Mr. Trump, our own P. T. Barnum, may personify the chutzpah that was a part of our economic calamity. But their real value may be as a window on our time's conflated notions of achievement and celebrity.
 ''Basically, you don't have to be famous to be famous,'' said Maureen Orth, special correspondent for Vanity Fair and author of ''The Importance of Being Famous: Behind the Scenes of the Celebrity-Industrial Complex.'' ''However you get in front of a camera, that's enough. There's no link to talent.''
 So it is with ''Celebrity Apprentice,'' a show in which grade-B artists mix with a former male pro wrestler, a current female pro wrestler, past Olympians, an Australian chef, a lingerie model, our former governor and a few truly ancillary characters in a competition in which Mr. Trump eliminates one contestant each week.
 Last week Blago mostly served as a waiter as two teams -- one male, one female -- tried to generate the most restaurant revenue. He nearly got the boot after blabbing too long to customers and letting go cold a burger that was meant for Joan Rivers, 76, whose face, sadly, appears as taut as steel beams on the John Hancock Center.
 And yet not all Chicagoans who watch and gain insight into our celebrity-industrial complex will do so just to ridicule Blago. Some current and former Chicago business associates of Mr. Trump can focus on him and feel dyspeptic over his striking Trump International Hotel & Tower.
 According to people who were involved in the development, in filling the tower Mr. Trump reneged on traditional ''family and friends'' deals with individuals and firms, including prominent outside architects and lawyers. Typically, one puts down a deposit on a unit less than that required by normal buyers, and also gets a better purchase price. Such early sales help a developer procure financing for a project. In the Trump Tower case, insiders also had the chance to flip units before the complex opened.
 With real estate booming in 2007, Mr. Trump decided he could make more in the open market and killed the deals. He was sued by both an Evanston architect and a former Chicago Sun-Times publisher -- who later pleaded guilty to stealing money from the paper's corporate parent. Settlements were fashioned. But most of the aggrieved didn't want a public feud with a famous foe, so they cut modest deals and privately simmered.
 After the economy plummeted, Mr. Trump exhibited similar gall in suing a consortium led by Deutsche Bank as he sought to force it to extend the maturity date of a key construction loan. He cited what is known as a force majeure clause, allowing an extension related to an extraordinary event -- and claimed that the global financial crisis was such an event. It was poppycock, but a private truce was apparently reached.
 Among many who dealt with Mr. Trump here, he is hated. That partly explains the fitting nature of a Blago-Trump association. Neither concedes error or defeat. It's deny, deny, deny. You won't get a Tiger Woods made-for-cable mea culpa out of them.
 And each loves attention, even to his hair, which, like the TV host Glenn Beck, is now beyond parody.
 ''Celebrity was once a byproduct of achievement, like starring in a film, hitting a home run or walking on the moon,'' said Alan Zweibel, an original ''Saturday Night Live'' writer who recently won a lifetime achievement award from the Writers Guild of America. ''Now all you have to do is have sex with someone who's starred in a film, hit a home run or walked on the Moon.''
 And we judge the contestants. Perhaps we long to be one of them, but, most of all, we laugh at them.
 ''It's like the fall of Rome,'' Ms. Orth said. ''An overindulged, sloppy, lazy society can turn it on and say, 'Hey, I'm not as bad as that!' ''
 So let's place tapes in a time capsule and explain to future generations how the popularity of ''reality TV'' created an assembly line to feed a low-cost programming beast. As for criteria to participate, it didn't matter whether you represented positive fame or unadulterated infamy; just that you were once in the news.

 At a moment when Congress is engaged in a crucial debate about overhauling the health care system, the talk from Washington is all about parliamentary rules. At the end of the day, it is fair to wonder whether Americans even care about these exhausting debates, much less follow them. PAGE 1

HEADLINE: Hoping to Attract Google? Go Jump in the Lake

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
The mayor of Duluth, Minn., threw himself into the ice-ringed waters of Lake Superior. The mayor of Sarasota, Fla., immersed himself in a tank filled with bonnethead sharks, simply to one-up him. The mayor of Wilmington, N.C., said that he would even jump out of an airplane -- with a parachute, of course. 
 They are vying not so much for voters' attention as Google's attention. Google has said it plans to build -- at no charge -- an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities. 
 And that offer has become catnip for city leaders, civic boosters and economic development types across the nation. America lags most other industrialized countries in high-speed Internet access. Even though the Obama administration last week unveiled a plan that would move the country forward, it will probably be snared in Congressional infighting for some time. 
 Meantime, Google's offer of a network with speeds of one gigabit per second, or 100 times faster than many of today's high-speed connections, could be a great selling point for a recession-plagued town. With hundreds of cities expected to apply before the deadline on Friday, city officials are using stunts in the hope their bids will stand out. And for those who put together a winning proposal, success may well be a swift path to re-election. 
 So maybe it is not so surprising that Bill Bunten, the mayor of Topeka, Kan., issued a proclamation renaming his city Google for the month of March. 
 In response, referencing fiber-optic cable, Duluth videotaped a mock press conference in which it said that every male born in the town would be named Google Fiber. The city enlisted Minnesota's junior senator, the longtime comedian Al Franken, to make a humorous video supporting the bid. 
 Not to be outdone, a dairy in Madison, Wis., aided that city's efforts by creating a ''Google Fiber'' ice cream flavor -- vanilla ice cream with granola and M&Ms to match Google's multicolored logo.
 In Palo Alto, Calif., city employees danced outside the city hall to the tune of the disco-era hit ''Y.M.C.A.,'' unfurling a banner reading, ''Palo Alto for Google Fiber.''
 And Nevada City, a small California town in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, threw a party and parade on March 14. The event opened with an odd sight: a group of decidedly counterculture-looking men banging on African drums in an attempt to ingratiate themselves -- or at least their city -- with a prominent name in corporate America. 
 ''We had half an hour of drumming to call in the tribe,'' said John Paul, the co-owner of a small Internet service provider in Nevada City, who helped organize the city's bid. After trying and failing in its effort to receive federal stimulus funds to spruce up its broadband infrastructure, Nevada City sees the Google offer as a second chance, Mr. Paul said. 
 So far, no mayors have risked life or limb in their stunts. ''They look pretty fierce but they are somewhat docile,'' Sarasota Mayor Richard Clapp said of the bonnethead sharks, which eat crustaceans and small fish, not politicians.
 Existing broadband providers, who face the costly task of delivering Internet access to millions of homes, not just a few thousand, have called the Google effort a publicity stunt that will do little to advance the nation's broadband agenda. They are skeptical that the good will is going to last. 
 ''Google will rue the day that it can't meet the unrealistic expectations that it has set,'' said Scott Cleland, the chairman of NetCompetition.org, an organization that represents many telecommunications companies and their industry associations. ''The interesting thing will be to see how cities react when they are jilted at the altar.''

HEADLINE: Facing a Financial Pinch, And Moving Back Home

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Heather Candella is 26. She was finally getting ready to move out of her parents' home in Rockland County last year when she was laid off from her digital media job in Manhattan. Saddled with student loans, she took a clerical job, and for the time being, resigned herself to remaining in the nest.
 ''Living at home absolutely crimps my social life,'' she said. ''You're still living under your parents' rules. I refer to it as being stuck in an extended adolescence, one that never seems to end.'' 
 Nazreen S. Bacchus is 27. She commutes to the City University Graduate Center in Manhattan, where she is a doctoral student in sociology. She never left her family's home in Valley Stream, N.Y., and does not intend to for now.
 Carlos Cruz is 38. He works full time at a law firm and part time as a scuba instructor on the weekends. He lives with his parents and grandmother in a four-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights, for reasons of family and finances. 
 A census analysis by The New York Times confirms earlier surveys, including one last fall by the Pew Research Center, suggesting that parents need not be so concerned about becoming empty nesters when their children become adults. 
 Since 2000, more people in the 25-to-39 age group have been living in their parents' homes. By 2008, before the full effect of the recession was being felt, their ranks had increased by double-digit percentages since the decade began: by 32 percent nationwide, and by nearly 40 percent in Manhattan.
 In 1980, 11 percent of 25-to-34-year-olds were living in multi-generational households. By 2008, 20 percent were. 
 These sons and daughters of baby boomers living with their parents again have been labeled boomerangers.
 The biggest increases were registered in these categories: nonwhite, foreign-born young men who had never been married, and college graduates. 
 ''As the great recession has deepened and the job market has become tighter and tighter for young people, most especially those from minority backgrounds, more and more return or never leave the parental nest,'' said Prof. Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College of the City University of New York. ''If such a trend continues or deepens, the economic crisis may be creating a true 'Failure to Launch' generation.''
 Last year, 37 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds were unemployed or no longer looking for work. Ten percent of young adults, ages 18 to 34, said in the Pew survey they had moved back with their parents because of the recession. Two in 10 are full-time students, a quarter are unemployed, and about a third said they had lived on their own before returning home.
 In part as a result, the portion of 18-to-29-year-olds who live alone declined to 7.3 percent in 2009 from 7.9 percent in 2007, according to the Current Population Survey. A decline that large was recorded only twice before, during or after recessions in the early 1980s and 1990s.
 If the numbers turn out to constitute a trend, it could signal other social implications: modestly reviving the multi-generational family and further delaying marriage and childbearing.
 According to the census, 56 percent of men age 18 to 24 and 48 percent of women in the same age group live under the same roof as their parents.
 Ashley Jain, 27, who works for a film advertising firm in the city, moved in with her parents in Guilford, Conn., after living in New York City for several years. 
 ''I moved back home in September mainly to start creating that 'nest egg,' '' she said. ''Living in New York as a young 20-something isn't very conducive to saving money, and especially after the recession hit, it made me all the more determined to save away a serious amount of money.''
 Ms. Bacchus, the City University graduate student, said living in her parents' house had not affected her social life. ''I live in the basement of the house, and my parents converted it into an apartment with a separate entrance,'' she said. 
 ''My parents lived with my grandmother briefly in Guyana before they migrated to England and then America,'' she added. ''Their experience living under the same roof with my father's family enabled them to understand the significance of granting me personal space within their household.''
 Katherine Brezler, 27, returned to her parents' co-op apartment in White Plains because she could not afford her own place while she was student teaching and studying for her master's. Now that she has a full-time job, she is looking for a place.
 ''We love our parents, but 'need our space' is the common consensus amongst my peers,'' she said. 
 Micah Thau, 25, moved back with his parents in Mountainside, N.J., in June after losing his job as an engineer in Cleveland. 
 ''It definitely has been somewhat of an awkward situation in terms of my social life,'' he said. ''Even though we are in a recession, it is hard to openly tell friends that I am living at home after living in Cleveland for seven years and having lost two jobs in the past year or so.''
 Mr. Cruz, the scuba instructor, said his family's rent-stabilized apartment certainly was a factor in his decision to stay home, but so was his grandmother's age, 90.
 ''Part of me stays because of the financial benefits -- I could never find an apartment like this one for even double the current rent -- and part of it is that, while this might sound pessimistic, the truth is my grandmother is not going to live forever so I want to spend as much time with her as possible so no regrets later on,'' he said. 
 Mr. Cruz also saw the bright side in living with relatives instead of friends. ''It's kind of like having roommates,'' he said, ''except they won't disappear without paying their share of the bills.''

HEADLINE: Take $787 Billion. Now Show Where It's Going.

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
THE Metro-North Railroad in the early '80s published a pocket schedule of the arrival and departure times between New Haven and New York. In his book ''Envisioning Information,'' the information-design theorist Edward Tufte devotes an uncluttered half-page to a hard look at that little piece of paper.
 Among other things, he criticizes the font used for ''New York'' and ''New Haven'' as ''weak in distinguishing between two directions''; he notes that the information flows over three columns, requiring the reader's eye to move up and down; he counts 41 inches of lines that ''segregate what should be together''; and, finally, he questions the use of the letter E to mean ''express,'' since it could mean ''economy,'' too.
 He didn't discuss whether the schedule caused paper cuts, but little else escaped his scrutiny. 
 It was just announced that Mr. Tufte (pronounced tuff-TEE) would be going to Washington. Though often cast as a free-floating information guru, Mr. Tufte has a highly specific mission: on March 5, he was appointed by President Obama to a panel to advise the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which monitors the way the $787 billion in the stimulus package is being spent.
 It's hard to know under these circumstances exactly whom should be offered ''good luck'' wishes.
 ''I'm not naive about it, but I'm enthusiastic and hopeful,'' Mr. Tufte said in a telephone interview. ''The only way to find out if the cynical view of Washington is right is by doing it.''
 Rather than define himself on the conservative-liberal political continuum, Mr. Tufte, a professor emeritus of political science, statistics and computer science at Yale, said that he longed for cause-and-effect reasoning to take hold in Washington.
 ''Political practice today too often skips right by evidence,'' he said by e-mail. ''When I listen to True Believers (left or right) talk about the problems that governments are seeking to solve, I keep muttering to myself, 'How boring, it's more complicated than that.' And those who best know that it's more complicated than that are public servants.''
 The board has two missions: to root out waste, fraud and abuse in spending and to inform the American public how the stimulus money is being spent. The group is better suited to the task of eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, said Earl Devaney, the head of the board, who is a veteran inspector general of the Interior Department and whose 12 colleagues on the board are current inspectors general. The advisory panel, and particularly Mr. Tufte, will mainly contribute on issues of transparency, he said.
 ''It had been a nontransparent ride for me -- being in Washington for 37 years,'' Mr. Devaney said. ''It is not only a new word, but a new way of doing business. Every dollar of the $787 billion theoretically can be tracked. This helps the American people follow the money from cradle to grave.'' 
 The Web site recovery.gov is the primary way the board will conduct business transparently, Mr. Devaney said, and Mr. Tufte was acting as an informal adviser even before his appointment. 
 ''I remember the first meeting. We brought in designs for the Web site. He called it 'intellectually impoverished,' '' Mr. Devaney said. ''It was a classic Ed Tufte phrase -- jaws dropped. I agreed with him but hadn't said anything. I suspect he still has reservations about some of the Web sites.''
 In an e-mail message, Mr. Tufte recalled the meeting and said that generally his advice had been to add more information to the site so that a visitor could see things in context. ''It shouldn't look like a government Web site, and it shouldn't look like a corporate Web site,'' he said. ''This is a reporting thing -- about factual, credible reporting.''
 For example, he said, it would be better to allow a user to enter a ZIP code, as the site now allows, to look at projects that have received money, as opposed to using the cruder statewide or Congressional district boundaries.
 ''It's gone from a C+ to a B+,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''And B+ is a pretty good grade for government Web sites.''
 Officials and the public have often put their hopes in some acute, technocratic outsider to cut through the Washington fog. A favorite example is when the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman offered an impromptu demonstration of the flaws in the O-ring that led to the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. It was a staid meeting of the commission reviewing the crash, and with a clamp, he dipped part of an O-ring in a glass of ice water to show how it lost its resilience in the cold. 
 Of course, insight rarely comes that easily. Mr. Tufte devotes a section of one of his books to explaining how clearer graphics could have persuaded NASA officials to postpone the takeoff because of cold weather. One of his conclusions is that presentations before the explosion, and even after, were too simplified. For simplicity, information was left out about the many missions during warmer weather that were uneventful. But the absence of that information meant that it was easy to overlook the larger pattern, that cold weather was dangerous to the O-ring. 
 In an interview, Mr. Tufte emphasized the need to enlist ''the clarity of intense information.''
 That's the thing about transparency: you know it when you don't see it. It some cases, it can mean more information. But other times, the reader can be overwhelmed by too much irrelevant information or, in one of Mr. Tufte's favorite terms, ''chartjunk.''
 To that end, among the most transparent things that the site recovery.gov can do is offer its information in a way that allows unaffiliated sites to place the material in context.
 Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at George Mason University, has been monitoring the stimulus at his site, stimuluswatch.org. 
 ''What we want is the raw data. We don't need a beautiful site,'' Mr. Brito said.
 In fact, he says that recovery.gov is too flashy and too crowded, and uses maps too much instead of simple tables. ''Tufte can do a lot of good here,'' he said. ''There is a lot of low-hanging fruit.''
 Ever the statistician, Mr. Tufte, whose first official meeting in the capital will be in mid-April, quantified his optimism: ''Chances are 7 in 10 that I can significantly improve the presentation on accountability and transparency of stimulus money. Three in 10 that there would be a broader change in transparency in Washington.''

HEADLINE: Despite Much Rezoning, Scant Change in Residential Capacity

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
Five years ago, community groups in South Park Slope, Brooklyn, demanded protection from the new apartment buildings that seemed to be sprouting everywhere, pushing above the neighborhood's low-rise canopy. 
 Among other things, the city's rezoning plan for the neighborhood chopped several stories off a proposed 11-story apartment building across the street from Augie Tjahaya's 2-story home. ''It was going to be a monster,'' said Mr. Tjahaya, a photographer, praising the city's intervention.
 In an era of unprecedented rezoning across New York City, a new report found that the vast majority of the changes preserved neighborhoods the way they were, protecting them from denser or out-of-scale development. The report, prepared by N.Y.U.'s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy and scheduled to be released Monday, covers the Bloomberg administration's aggressive rezoning efforts from 2003 to 2007, a period in which 18 percent of the city's lots were rezoned. 
 The report considered 76 rezoning measures and is said to be the first statistical analysis of the city's current strategy. It said that on 86 percent of the lots that were rezoned, building capacity was reduced or limited, or limits were placed on the kind of structure that could be built. 
 On the remaining 14 percent of rezoned lots, rules were eased to allow for greater density. Despite the thrust of the rezoning of most of the lots, the cumulative effect of the changes was to add 1.7 percent to residential capacity. 
 Vicki Been, the principal author of the report, said some of the findings had come as a surprise, especially given that officials made much of the fact that they were preparing the city to absorb one million new residents by 2030. 
 ''There are an awful lot of downzonings and contextual-only zonings that may limit the city's ability to do that,'' said Professor Been, who is faculty director of the Furman center.
 The report suggests that the rezoning actions have created the capacity for as many as 80,000 new housing units, or as many as 200,000 more people, but city officials said they were on track to meet the population projections and were not relying on rezoning alone to provide new places for people to live.
 Amanda M. Burden, the city's planning director since 2002, said the city's approach to zoning was based on a ''finely grained'' process of listening to the needs of separate communities and neighborhoods. ''We respond to communities where the threat is the greatest to the neighborhood fabric,'' she said. ''We upzone where it's sustainable, and where reinvestment is needed.'' 
 Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University who has been an informal adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said that for decades, the city had been zoned for too many people, and that it was overdue for the kind of adjustment pursued by the Bloomberg administration. Ms. Burden ''has done more to reshape the city than anything Robert Moses ever did,'' he said. 
 Whether or not that is true, the Furman Center report starts to paint a picture of significant change, finding that city planners were, in many cases, successful in their goal of creating housing within half a mile of existing transportation hubs. In other places, though, zoning regulations that restricted new building have taken ''capacity away from communities well served by transit,'' the report says.
 Most of the new residential capacity was created in Queens, followed by Manhattan and then Brooklyn. In the Bronx, rezoning measures that affected more than 18 percent of the borough added virtually no residential capacity, the report found.
 The report also looked at the intersections of planning decisions with race and income, though it drew no conclusion about motives. Rezoning mostly concerned with neighborhood preservation was more likely to occur in census tracts with higher white populations and higher incomes, the report found, while lots where restrictions were loosened to allow for more density tended to be in census tracts with more black or Hispanic residents than the city median. 
 Asked about this, Ms. Burden said the city's zoning policies were ''color blind.'' Other planning experts noted that the racial and class dynamics could be interpreted in different ways.
 They could reflect efforts by minority residents in neglected areas to reach out to the city's planners, searching for ways to bring more people to their streets. In the rezoning proposals for Harlem and Jamaica, Queens -- which both involved plans for significant new housing and office space -- many local groups called for the rezoning changes, prevailing over local opposition. 
 But some see the rezoning as tending to lock in the homogeneity of certain neighborhoods. Ronald Shiffman, a former planning commissioner, said: ''Whether intentional or through a lack of sensitivity to the concept of equitable development, downzoning in predominantly higher-income and white communities leads to restricted housing options for people of color and low- and moderate-income residents.'' 
 Brad Lander, a city councilman from Brooklyn, said the city needed to ensure that ''communities are receiving their fair share of growth, across boundaries of race and class and borough.'' 
 Mr. Lander, a former head of the Pratt Center for Community Development, said the report showed that the city's approach was often reasonable. Even the protective rezoning of side streets in neighborhoods like Park Slope incorporated ''smart growth'' principles by encouraging development on wider avenues. 
 But Mr. Lander said the city planners had shied away from a more honest conversation with the city as a whole, one that would start to distribute the burden of development more widely. 
 ''If we don't do that,'' he said, ''communities with more political power will be able to achieve their goals more effectively.''

Still, the rezoning increased capacity by an estimated 200,000 people. Much of the increase was within walking distance of transit, a goal the administration had set. The city wants to accommodate another million residents by 2030.

HEADLINE: House Passes Bill Affecting Student Loans

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Along with the major health care legislation, the House on Sunday approved a major revamping of federal student loan programs that eliminates fees paid to private banks to act as intermediaries. 
 Instead, the government will expand a direct lending program, a step that the Congressional Budget Office said would save taxpayers $61 billion over 10 years, and use the money to increase Pell grants for students. 
 The student loan bill is a centerpiece of President Obama's education agenda, and it was included in the budget reconciliation measure that also made final revisions to the Senate-passed health care bill. 
 The bill sets automatic annual increases in the maximum Pell grant, scheduled to rise to $5,975 by 2017 from $5,350 this year. The new Pell initiative also includes $13.5 billion to cover a shortfall caused by a steep rise in the number of Americans enrolling in college and seeking financial aid during the recession. 
 In last year's budget resolution, Congressional Democrats put forward a plan to complete major education and health care legislation through a reconciliation bill. 
 The budget reconciliation rules set goals for reducing future federal deficits, and the loan bill helps to meet those goals by redirecting $10 billion in savings from subsidies to private banks toward deficit reduction. 
 The student loan bill will spend an additional $36 billion on Pell grants over 10 years. 
 Private banks lobbied against the student loan changes, which eliminate a long-flowing source of revenue for them. 
 Some Democrats, including Representative George Miller of California, the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, said the student loan measure represented a landmark shift in education policy that was getting overshadowed by the larger health care fight. 
 In a floor speech, Mr. Miller called the budget reconciliation measure ''truly historic legislation that addresses two of America's greatest troubles: the crushing costs and high obstacles of obtaining both quality health care and a college education.''

HEADLINE: Finding in Foreclosure A Beginning, Not an End

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Jane Petion lived in her home for 15 years and saw its value rise slowly, rise rapidly and, when the housing bubble burst, plunge at a sickening pace that left her owing $400,000 on a house worth closer to $250,000. Last June, her lender foreclosed on the property. The family received notices of eviction and appeared in housing court.
 Then they discovered a surprising paradox within the nation's housing crisis: Their power to negotiate began after foreclosure, rather than ending there. 
 In December Ms. Petion signed a new mortgage on her house for $250,000, with monthly payments of less than half the previous level. She and her husband now have a mortgage they can afford in a neighborhood that benefits from the stability they provide. A nonprofit lender made the deal possible by buying the house from her original mortgage company and selling it to her for 25 percent more than its purchase price -- a gain to hedge against future defaults. 
 ''It was exactly what we needed to get back on our feet,'' said Ms. Petion, who works for a state agency. ''We have income. But another bank, it would have been easy to look at our foreclosure and say, 'I'm sorry, we have nothing for you now.' '' 
 This counterintuitive solution -- intervening after foreclosure rather than before -- is the brainchild of Boston Community Capital, a nonprofit community development financial institution, and a housing advocacy group called City Life/Vida Urbana, working with law students and professors at Harvard Law School. 
 Though the program, which started last fall, is small so far, there is no reason it cannot be replicated around the country, especially in areas that have had huge spikes in housing prices, said Patricia Hanratty of Boston Community Capital. ''If what you've got is a real estate market that went nuts and a mortgage market that went nuts, what you've got is an opportunity.''
 Two years into the nation's housing meltdown, and after hundreds of billions of dollars of federal rescue programs, government officials and housing advocates denounce the unwillingness of lenders to adjust the balances on homes that are worth less than the mortgage owed on them.
 Research suggests that such disparity, rather than exotic interest rates, is the main driver of foreclosures, in tandem with a job loss or another financial setback. The financial industry lobbied aggressively to defeat legislation that would empower bankruptcy judges to adjust mortgage balances to properties' market value. 
 That reluctance, however, eases after foreclosure, when lenders find themselves holding properties they need to unload, Ms. Hanratty said. 
 ''We found, frankly, the industry wasn't ready to do much pre-foreclosure,'' she said. ''But once it was either on the cusp of foreclosure or had been taken into the bank portfolio, banks really do not want to hold on to these properties because they don't know how to manage them, don't know what to do with them.''
 Working with borrowed money, Boston Community Capital buys homes after foreclosure and sells or rents them to their previous owners, providing new mortgages and counseling to the owners, who typically have ruined credit. During the process the families remain in their homes. Since late fall it has completed or nearly completed deals on 50 homes, with an additional 20 in progress, Ms. Hanratty said. The organization is now trying to raise $50 million to expand the program. 
 Steve Meacham, an organizer at City Life/Vida Urbana, is one reason banks may be willing to sell their foreclosed properties to Boston Community Capital. When families receive eviction notices, his group holds demonstrations or blockades outside the properties, calling on lenders to sell at market value. It also connects the residents with the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, whose students work to pressure lenders to sell rather than evict by prolonging eviction and ''driving up litigation costs,'' said Dave Grossman, the clinic's director.
 ''So they're being defended legally, and we're ramping up the pressure publicity-wise,'' Mr. Meacham said. ''And B.C.C. came in; they had a part that buys properties and a part that writes mortgages. It wouldn't work without all three.'' 
 A focus of the program has been the working-class neighborhood of Dorchester, where home prices dropped 40 percent between 2005 and 2007, compared with a 20 percent drop statewide, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Foreclosures and delinquencies there are more than twice the state average, the bank found. 
 In such neighborhoods, lenders and residents are hurt by evictions, which often leave vacant properties that invite crime and drive down values of neighboring houses, Ms. Hanratty said. ''So it's in the lenders' interest to get fair market value as quickly as possible, and in the interest of the community to have as little displacement as possible.'' 
 The program is not a solution for all lenders or distressed homeowners. After months of post-foreclosure negotiations with her bank, Ursula Humes, a transit police detective, is waiting for her final 48-hour eviction notice. Her belongings are in boxes.
 Mrs. Humes owed $440,000 on her home; her lender offered to sell it to Boston Community Capital for $260,000. But after assessing Mrs. Hume's finances, the nonprofit asked for a lower selling price, and the lender refused. 
 On a recent evening, Mr. Grossman of the Harvard law clinic counseled Mrs. Humes on her options. ''This is a case that doesn't have a happy ending,'' Mr. Grossman said. 
 Mrs. Humes said, ''I depleted my retirement account and everything I owned, but I'm still going to lose it.'' 
 Many commercial lenders, similarly, would shy away from such a program because it involves writing mortgages for borrowers who have already defaulted once -- a high risk for a small reward. 
 For other homeowners, though, the program is a rescue at the last possible second. Roberto Velasquez, a building contractor, lost his home to foreclosure last November, owing the lender $550,000. After extensive wrangling, during which his family stayed in the house, he bought it again in March for $280,000, a price he can afford. 
 On the night after he closed, he joined other members of City Life/Vida Urbana at a foreclosed four-unit building in Dorchester from which most of the tenants had been evicted. A group of artists projected videos on sheets in the windows, showing silhouettes of families re-enacting their last 72 hours before eviction. Garbage filled one of the units. Mr. Velasquez said it hurt to stand amid such loss, but he was jubilant at his own perseverance. 
 ''We've been fighting for so long,'' he said, ''and we win, because we're still in the house.''

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Gives Debt Warning For the Wealthiest Nations

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and SEWELL CHAN; Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing and Sewell Chan from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The global economic crisis has left ''deep scars'' in the fiscal balances of the world's advanced economies, which should begin to rein in spending next year as the recovery continues, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund said on Sunday in Beijing.
 In a speech at the China Development Forum in Beijing, the I.M.F. official, John P. Lipsky, who is the first deputy managing director, offered a grim prognosis for the world's wealthiest countries, which are at a level of indebtedness not recorded since the aftermath of World War II. 
 For the United States, ''a higher public savings rate will be required to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability,'' Mr. Lipsky said.
 The American Chamber of Commerce in China released a separate study Monday morning in Beijing showing that American companies increasingly felt unwelcome in China as a result of policies aimed at increasing government procurement from domestic companies instead of foreign ones.
 The United States and other industrialized countries, as well as some developing countries, have been putting pressure on the I.M.F. to criticize China for its large-scale intervention in currency markets to hold down the value of the renminbi against the dollar. But Mr. Lipsky refrained from chastising China in his speech, which Chinese officials would have found particularly offensive if he had done so in Beijing.
 The I.M.F.'s staff concluded in a report last summer that the renminbi was ''substantially undervalued, '' and that this was contributing to China's large trade surpluses in recent years. China has blocked the release of that report, a prerogative of the I.M.F.'s member countries, although most allow the release of the I.M.F. staff's reports on their economies.
 The Chinese commerce minister, Chen Deming, said Sunday at the same conference that China might run a trade deficit in March, after years of surpluses, said Xinhua, the official news agency.
 A trade deficit for the current month would be a public relations bonanza for Chinese officials in pushing back against United States pressures for revaluation of the renminbi. 
 China typically announces its monthly trade during the ninth to 12th day of the next month. If it follows that schedule next month, the trade surplus will be released shortly before the April 15 deadline mandated by the United States Congress to declare whether any foreign country, including China, manipulates the value of its currency.
 Western economists have predicted that most, if not all, of China's trade surplus will evaporate in March, but they have described this as a fluke of the calendar. Virtually all Chinese export factories closed for the last two weeks of February in observance of the Lunar New Year, which was unusually late this year. Many struggled to reopen at full capacity because migrant workers were slow to return after the holidays.
 The flow of goods to export ports slowed in March as a result, even as imports continued.
 Mr. Chen also said China would not sit back if the United States declared China a currency manipulator and imposed sanctions, Xinhua reported.
 The Commerce Ministry tends to represent the views of exporters. Like the Commerce Department in the United States, the ministry does not have the authority to engage in international currency negotiations. But unlike commerce officials in the United States, who have a strict policy of not commenting on currency issues, commerce officials in China have been outspoken to the domestic Chinese media in recent months in condemning any appreciation of the currency.
 This has limited the room to maneuver for officials at the central bank and other agencies in charge of currency issues.
 Mr. Lipsky said the average ratio of debt to gross domestic product in advanced economies was expected this year to reach the level that prevailed in 1950. Even assuming that fiscal stimulus programs are withdrawn in the next few years, that ratio is projected to rise to 110 percent by the end of 2014, from 75 percent at the end of 2007.
 The ratio is expected to be close to or to exceed 100 percent for five members of the Group of 7 countries -- Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the United States -- by 2014. Canada and Germany are the other G-7 members.
 ''Addressing this fiscal challenge is a key near-term priority, as concerns about fiscal sustainability could undermine confidence in the economic recovery,'' Mr. Lipsky said. Maintaining public debt at postcrisis levels could reduce potential growth in advanced economies as much as half a percentage point annually, compared with projections before the crisis, he said.
 To reduce debt ratios to the precrisis average of 60 percent by 2030, he said, would require an eight percentage point swing -- to a surplus of about 4 percent of G.D.P. in 2020 from a structural deficit of about 4 percent of G.D.P. in 2010.
 The I.M.F. estimates that the discretionary stimulus spending accounts for just 1.5 percent of G.D.P. Mr. Lipsky said that even if that spending were cut, advanced economies would have to take other steps, like changing pensions and health care programs, cutting spending elsewhere and increasing tax revenues.
 While it makes sense for the world's largest economies to continue stimulus spending through the end of this year, ''fiscal consolidation should begin in 2011, if the recovery occurs at the projected pace,'' Mr. Lipsky said.
 Mr. Lipsky also said a ''global rebalancing of savings patterns'' would be needed to sustain the recovery.
 The United States and the European Union have become increasingly concerned about China's accumulation of an estimated $2.5 trillion in foreign reserves, the result of a large current account surplus with the rest of the world, as well as actions to hold down the value of China's currency.
 Many economists say China will eventually need to develop its domestic markets and wean its economy away from a dependence on exports.
 Mr. Lipsky said China was taking appropriate steps to shift public spending away from physical infrastructure and toward improvements in education, health and social security programs ''that will increase productivity and also directly support consumption by lessening the perceived need for precautionary savings.''
 A sustained increase in China of 1 percent of G.D.P. on health, education and pensions could result in a permanent increase in household consumption of more than 1 percent of G.D.P., Mr. Lipsky said. China should also consider raising household income by shifting the tax burden away from earnings and toward property and capital gains, he said.
 Fiscal policy is expected to be a top item on the agenda when leaders of the Group of 20 nations gather for a summit meeting in Toronto in June.

HEADLINE: Spilling Beyond a Festival's Main Courses

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
They came to play: in clubs, churches, parking garages, conference rooms, clothing stores, backyards and streets, from early in the morning to early the next morning. If anything could dispel the notion that musicians are slackers, it's the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference, four days of nearly nonstop music by performers known and unknown, many of them playing two or three times a day in hopes of ... well, another gig. 
 The 24th annual SXSW filled every available space in downtown Austin with musicians clamoring for attention. Where that attention might lead -- a live booking, a recording, a license for a song, an advertising tie-in -- is less certain than ever in a music business that's struggling to sell recordings. 
 But the corporate sponsors that swarm SXSW know that music draws a crowd, one that's treated as a market for just about anything except, paradoxically, recorded music. With daytime events that may now outnumber the official SXSW showcases (in more than 80 locations), a lot of live music is also free here. The conference spilled through the streets in a frenetic mixture of partying and deal making, sustained by musicians' determination to be heard, regardless of the state of the music business. 
 South by Southwest started in 1987 as a showcase for Texas music and mushroomed with performers from other regional and independent scenes and, soon, from major labels. With those labels now imploding, multimillion-selling musicians are also grappling for attention. This year's SXSW included shows by Muse, Smokey Robinson, Jakob Dylan and two bands making a new start, Stone Temple Pilots and Hole. Two-thirds of the Dixie Chicks, the sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, introduced their new group, Court Yard Hounds, with multiple shows. 
 Hole's return -- more than a decade after its last live shows, with an entirely new lineup behind Courtney Love -- was a glimpse of old-school rock stardom. In professionally noisy grunge rockers and newer power ballads, Ms. Love growled, rasped and howled; between them she trash-talked and played diva, confident that the audience was fascinated by her.
 SXSW was and still is a place where undergrounds clamor for larger audiences. But this year the music they were making didn't sound so underground. It wasn't so long ago that indie-rock -- which dominates SXSW, despite representation of Americana, hip-hop, metal, free improvisation and more -- prided itself on being slightly elusive, deep enough to reward a second and third listen and a look at lyrics. This year catchiness was king, with few misgivings about being too accessible. Bands weren't counting on a second glance. 
 Rockers kept things simple in bands like Best Coast, led by the songwriter Bethany Cosentino, which harked back to 1960s girl groups and Joan Jett, and Free Energy, which recycles Top 40 rock from the early 1970s. Warpaint, a four-woman band from Los Angeles, had more complex and intriguing music -- songs that evolved from hypnotically intertwining guitar patterns to muscular funk -- surrounding lyrics about lovers' quarrels. 
 Marina and the Diamonds -- the stage name of Marina Diamandis, a Greek-Welsh songwriter -- performed smart, concise songs about growing up and romance, in keyboard-driven tunes that mingled Abba and operetta.
 Some of the most packed shows were by leaders of a much-blogged microtrend variously known as glo-fi and chillwave: Neon Indian, Washed Out, Small Black, Memory Tapes, Toro y Moi. They're solo acts or minimal bands, often with a laptop at their core, and they trade on memories of electropop from the 1980s, with bouncing, blipping dance-music hooks (and often weaker lead voices). It's recession-era music: low-budget and danceable.
 No one can take in more than a small fraction of the more than 2,000 bands on the schedule, and the move toward pop immediacy that I heard could be a sampling error. But it may also signal an adaptation, instinctive or strategic, to an increasingly impatient audience -- one with gigabytes of music in a pocket, and countless other choices a click away online -- and to a music market where recordings have diminished importance. 
 A song licensed for a soundtrack or a commercial, one way musicians still get paid for recordings, needs to register clearly and directly; the same goes for music heard live, as musicians' careers tilt toward performing rather than sales of recordings. Lingering over music, both in the recording process and as a listener, may turn out to have been a luxury from the album era, now disappearing. And while pop simplicity can be a fine corrective to self-indulgence, it can also grow shallow. 
 Still, one of the best events at the festival was one of the most basic: a showcase of New Orleans bounce, the raunchy, local hip-hop style that developed in the 1990s but is only now escaping its hometown. The beat is fast, syncopated and relentless, and bounce fans know exactly what it's for: shaking rumps at high speed. Katey Red, a tall transsexual in a black sequined dress and high heels, rattled off rhymes about sex and prostitution. No subtlety was necessary.
 And of course, at South by Southwest, there's a counter-example to everything. The Morning Benders, from Berkeley, Calif., drew on easygoing folk-rock and folk-pop as their songs began, sounding smiley and catchy, but then bathed them in guitar noise. Plants and Animals, a band from Montreal, had gnarled, multipart songs that started out tumultuous and built from there, tossing aside simplicity in favor of intensity. 
 There was also electronic music that went beyond loops and blips. Jj, from Gothenburg, Sweden, arrived as a lone woman seated onstage with her hands in her lap, singing spooky, rhapsodic ballads backed by twinkling electronica. Son Lux, using a laptop, had staticky, ominous sounds as well as danceable ones, to match bleak lyrics.
 SXSW included some superb quiet zones too. Hauschka, a composer from Dusseldorf, Germany, played Minimalist pieces for string quartet and piano, pensive meditations with a performance-art twist. He was using a prepared piano with paper, tape, beads and other items on the strings, and at one point he dumped in Ping-Pong balls that popped out as he hammered chords. Villagers, a solo songwriter from Ireland, surrounded disillusioned romanticism with billowing acoustic drones.
 Frightened Rabbit, a Scottish band that brought a saving modesty to the surging anthems of Britpop, may have summed up the hope that brought many musicians to SXSW: enough attention to keep making music. ''Oh the loneliness and the scream,'' Scott Hutchison sang, ''to prove to everyone that I exist.''

HEADLINE: Reining In Greed at Goldman

BYLINE: By HUGO DIXON and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs doesn't normally get too much wrong. But the investment bank made a mistake by setting aside 49 percent of revenue in the first half of 2009 for pay for its employees. Goldman is the leader of the Wall Street pack, and it has an opportunity to set an example in the current quarter.
 Last year, the high compensation accrued across the banking industry -- at a time when most people were suffering from a recession partly created by bankers' excesses -- provoked an angry response. A special industry tax was imposed in Britain, and various levies were proposed in the United States. Ultimately, most banks reined in pay. In Goldman's case, the actual payout for 2009 as a whole was only 36 percent of revenue. 
 Whether Goldman is destined to repeat its error will become clearer next month when the firm publishes its first-quarter results. If it again accrues compensation at roughly half of revenue, rivals may feel they have to provide high payouts, too. That would probably lead to another outcry and more harsh measures from politicians and regulators.
 One principle long associated with Goldman is to be long-term greedy. By that yardstick, it would be wise to show short-term restraint. A reasonable position might be to accrue first-quarter compensation at the rate it actually paid in 2009, namely 36 percent. Last year, the average Goldman employee got about $500,000, That's still high from a Main Street perspective, but it's relatively low by historical standards.
 To mollify employees and encourage rivals to follow suit, Goldman could note that financial companies had benefited from bailouts and that the economy was still fragile. It could even protect itself against the risk that staff might be poached by the likes of Bank of America and Citigroup by saying its accrual level assumed that other banks would also hold back. It could explicitly reserve the right to set aside more in subsequent quarters if others on Wall Street didn't follow suit.
 Such an approach could win Goldman some badly needed friends. It would also mean that its efforts to influence the debate about the industry's future wouldn't immediately be discounted as self-serving lobbying.
 Palm Investor Suffers
 Elevation Partners has poured money into a few concentrated bets but is struggling to find what it's looking for: profits. The private equity investment firm -- where Bono of the rock band U2 is a co-founder -- is now seeing its biggest gamble, the turnaround of the handset maker Palm, starting to fall apart.
 Palm's stock plunged nearly 30 percent on Friday after the company announced its quarterly results. The main bombshell was that while Palm shipped 960,000 phones in the quarter ended Feb. 28, it actually sold only about 40 percent as many.
 Elevation's fate rides largely on Palm, in which it has sunk $460 million. The investment firm has managed to double its $300 million investment in the video game maker BioWare/Pandemic. But its other holdings have given few signs they can outweigh any failure to deliver on Palm.
 The firm bought 40 percent of Forbes's publishing business from the Forbes family in 2006, paying around $275 million, according to news reports at the time. Since then, valuations of media rivals have crumbled. If the sale of BusinessWeek in October for $9 million is any indication, Elevation's stake is hurting. And a $100 million investment in Move, an online realty services company, doesn't look spectacular, either.
 So the prospects for the Palm investment are crucial. Happily for Elevation, the combination of preferred stock, common stock and warrants it bought has protected it somewhat. That means its holding is about breaking even so far. But if Palm's phones don't sell better in the next few quarters, the company could quickly burn through cash and Elevation's investment could head south.
 Palm thinks adding a new cellphone operator partner -- perhaps AT&T -- could help, as might ironing out problems with Verizon, an existing partner. And its impressive smartphone operating system could yet attract new customers.
 There are other options, too. Palm could license its software, or even sell itself to a rival with more resources.
 But smartphone competition is harsh and intensifying. Apple, Research In Motion, Nokia, Google and Microsoft are all backing different operating systems. There's still a tomorrow for Palm, but time is running short.

HEADLINE: Stewart L. Udall, Conservationist in Kennedy and Johnson Cabinets, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER and CORNELIA DEAN; Sarah Wheaton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stewart L. Udall, an ardent conservationist and a son of the West, who as interior secretary in the 1960s presided over vast increases in national park holdings and the public domain, died Saturday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. The last surviving member of the original Kennedy cabinet, he was 90.
 Mr. Udall had been in failing health after a fall last week, according to a son, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico. 
 Though he was a liberal Democrat from the increasingly conservative and Republican West, Stewart Udall said in a 2003 public television interview that he found in Washington ''a big tent on the environment.'' 
 The result was the addition of vast tracts to the nation's land holdings and -- through his strong ties with lawmakers, conservationists, writers and others -- work that led to landmark statutes on air, water and land conservation.
 President Obama said in a statement Saturday night that Mr. Udall ''left an indelible mark on this nation and inspired countless Americans who will continue his fight for clean air, clean water and to maintain our many natural treasures.'' 
 Few corners of the nation escaped Mr. Udall's touch. As interior secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, he presided over the acquisition of 3.85 million acres of new holdings, including 4 national parks -- Canyonlands in Utah, Redwood in California, North Cascades in Washington State and Guadalupe Mountains in Texas -- 6 national monuments, 9 national recreation areas, 20 historic sites, 50 wildlife refuges and 8 national seashores. He also had an interest in preserving historic sites, and helped saved Carnegie Hall from destruction.
 ''Republicans and Democrats, we all worked together,'' Mr. Udall said in a television interview with Bill Moyers. But by the time of that interview, Mr. Udall added that Washington had been overtaken by money and that people seeking public office fought for contributions from business interests that viewed environmental protection as a detriment to profit at best.
 In his years in Washington, he won high regard from many quarters for his efforts to preserve the American landscape and to educate his fellow Americans on the value of natural beauty, points he made in his 1963 book ''The Quiet Crisis.'' The book, whose aim, he wrote at the time, was to ''outline the land and people story of our continent,'' sold widely.
 It was Mr. Udall who suggested that John. F. Kennedy invite Robert Frost to recite a poem at Mr. Kennedy's inauguration. Mr. Udall accompanied Mr. Frost to the Soviet Union in 1962, a trip meant to foster better ties with Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev.
 Mr. Udall also held evenings at the Interior Department with the poet Carl Sandburg and the actor Hal Holbrook. In addition, he invited the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Wallace Stegner to be the department's writer in residence. It was Mr. Stegner's presence that prompted Mr. Udall to write ''The Quiet Crisis.''
 Mr. Udall was also an early supporter of Rachel Carson, the biologist whose book ''Silent Spring'' brought attention to the environmental hazards of pesticide use.
 Mr. Udall stepped onto the national stage in 1954, when he was elected to Congress from Arizona. In the hotly fought Democratic presidential primary of 1960, he urged his fellow Arizona Democrats to support Kennedy. When Kennedy won the White House, he nominated Mr. Udall as interior secretary 
 After Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Mr. Udall was kept on by Lyndon B. Johnson. 
 ''I think probably part of that was Lady Bird,'' Mr. Udall said, referring to Mr. Johnson's wife, with whom he collaborated on beautifying the nation's capital and similar projects. ''She treasured me, and we were wonderful friends,'' he added. 
 Roger G. Kennedy, who was director of the National Park Service in the 1990s, said Mr. Udall ''escaped the notion that all public land was essentially a cropping opportunity -- the idea that if you cannot raise timber on it or take a deer off it, it wasn't valuable.'' On the other hand, Mr. Kennedy said, Mr. Udall understood that public lands like parks enhanced the economic value of privately held land nearby.
 This lesson was sometimes communicated with difficulty. For example, in the 1960s, when the Kennedy administration, with Mr. Udall in the lead, began efforts to establish the nation's first national seashores, people in regions including Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, and Point Reyes in California objected that taking coastal land out of private hands would ruinously inhibit economic development.
 Instead, the parks have been beacons for lucrative tourism.
 On this and other fronts Mr. Udall pushed with a formidable combination of political acumen and political allies -- including his younger brother Morris K. Udall, who succeeded him in Congress and in 1976 ran for president in a campaign that his older brother managed. Many of the significant environmental and land-protection statutes that became law in the 1970s and '80s, including the Endangered Species Act, bore their stamp and influence.
 ''That was a wonderful time, and it carried through into the Nixon administration, into the Ford administration, into the Carter administration,'' Stewart Udall said. ''It lasted for 20 years. I don't remember a big fight between the Republicans and Democrats in the Nixon administration or President Gerald Ford and so on. There was a consensus that the country needed more conservation projects of the kind that we were proposing.'' 
 Stewart Lee Udall was born on Jan. 31, 1920, in St. Johns, Ariz., a small community in Apache County in the northeast, into a family with strong ties to the Mormon Church. His mother, Louise Lee Udall, was a granddaughter of John Doyle Lee, who was executed in 1877 for his involvement in the Mountain Meadows Massacre in Utah, in which a wagon train of California-bound migrants were killed in 1857.
 Mr. Udall served as a Mormon missionary in Pennsylvania and New York. During World War II, he was a gunner in the 15th Army Air Forces, serving in Europe. 
 He received bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Arizona. After graduating from law school in 1948, he started his own law practice in Tucson, where he and Morris later became partners.
 After leaving Washington, he taught at Yale, practiced law and wrote several books, including ''The Myths of August,'' an account of the effects of uranium mining and nuclear weapons work in the Western desert.
 That grew out of his representation of thousands of uranium miners, nuclear weapons industry workers and citizens exposed to radiation from atomic weapons manufacturing and testing in the West. 
 Though he won the first case in 1984 in Federal District Court, an appeals court overturned the ruling and the United States Supreme Court declined in 1988 to hear arguments. Mr. Udall then turned to Congress, working with lawmakers of both parties, particularly Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who died in August. 
 In 1990, President George Bush signed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. The law, administered by the Justice Department, provided up to $100,000 for those sickened by radiation exposure, and issued a formal apology for harm done to those who were ''subjected to increased risk of injury and disease to serve the national security interests of the United States.''
 Throughout his life he relished physical challenges. He was an all-conference guard on the University of Arizona basketball team and he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, in East Africa, and Mount Fuji, in Japan, while heading American delegations to both regions. When he was 84, at the end of his last rafting trip on the Colorado River, Mr. Udall hiked up the steep Bright Angel Trail from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the south rim, a 10-hour walk that he celebrated at the end with a martini.
 Mr. Udall's wife, the former Irmalee Webb, died in 2001. Besides his son Tom, he is survived by his other sons, Scott, Denis and Jay, and his daughters, Lynn and Lori, as well as eight grandchildren.
 At his death, Mr. Udall was a senior member of one of the nation's last and largest political dynasties -- in the West it was often said there were ''oodles of Udalls'' in politics. His grandfather David King Udall served in the Arizona Territorial legislature; his father, Levi Udall, was for decades an elected judge in the Arizona Superior Court and later a justice and chief justice of the Arizona Supreme Court; Morris Udall was followed to Washington by his son Mark Udall, elected in 2008 as a senator from Colorado, the same year that Tom Udall was elected.
 But Tom Udall said that in recent years his father had become greatly concerned over the state of politics in the country, worrying ''we were losing the bipartisanship in the environmental area.'' 
 He added that Mr. Udall had recently written a letter to his grandchildren, urging them to focus on ''trying to transform our society to a clean energy and clean job society.''

HEADLINE: Should Reagan Take Grant's Place on the $50 Bill?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I was pleased to see Sean Wilentz stick up for keeping Ulysses S. Grant on the $50 bill (''Who's Buried in the History Books?,'' Op-Ed, March 14). 
 Professor Wilentz is right: Removing Grant would be a disgraceful bit of ''historical amnesia.'' Grant was an unceasing warrior whose strategic genius at Vicksburg in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi, split the Confederacy like a fire log and set the table for victory and reunion. At Appomattox in 1865, Grant's chivalry toward Robert E. Lee and his gracious and matter-of-fact surrender terms allowed the war to end with dignity on both sides.
 I write this aware of Grant's failings. He was a weak Reconstructionist and showed a grievous anti-Semitism, embodied in General Order No. 11, expelling Jews from Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi (which Lincoln promptly revoked).
 Grant's service to America in the Civil War alone is enough to keep him on the currency. In fact, we owe it to him to hold our nation together now during schismatic social and economic times.
 Tom Mashberg Newton, Mass., March 14, 2010
 To the Editor:
 On Nov. 10, 1862, from his headquarters at La Grange, Tenn., Gen. Ulysses S. Grant issued an order ''to all conductors on the road that no Jews are to be permitted to travel on the railroad southward.'' Jews, Grant wrote, were ''an intolerable nuisance.''
 The next month, Grant issued the notorious General Order No. 11 for his military district: ''The Jews, as a class violating every regulation of trade established by the Treasury Department ..., are hereby expelled.''
 Six years later, as a candidate for president -- even then there was a Jewish vote -- Grant wrote: ''I have no prejudice against any sect or race. ... Order No. 11 does not sustain this statement, I admit, but then I do not sustain that order.''
 I'd suggest henceforth we put Grant's bearded visage on all three-dollar bills.
 Roger Kahn Stone Ridge, N.Y., March 14, 2010
 The writer is the author of ''The Passionate People: What It Means to Be a Jew in America.''
 To the Editor:
 Sean Wilentz writes that Ronald Reagan deserves having the capital's airport named after him as well as a major building, but calls Reagan's Southern strategy and his reactionary policies on civil rights ''appalling.''
 People who were victimized by Reagan's domestic policies might be forgiven for wondering just how much public homage he is due.
 John F. Manley Westport, Conn., March 14, 2010
 The writer is professor emeritus of political science at Stanford University.

HEADLINE: In Era of Dwindling Sales, a Megadeal for Jackson's Estate

BYLINE: By JOSEPH PLAMBECK

 BODY:
Could Michael Jackson break the music industry's megadeal jinx?
 Throughout the 1990s, as CDs flew off the shelves, record labels routinely signed big artists to multimillion-dollar recording contracts. Some of it was vanity: labels paid a premium to keep a big-name artist rather than risk a few wisecracks in the press for letting a star go to a rival.
 And despite the precipitous drop in album sales in the last decade -- about 50 percent fewer albums were sold in 2009 than in 2000 -- major deals continued apace, often with bad endings. Mariah Carey's five-record, $80 million deal with EMI in 2001 lasted one record before the label paid the singer $28 million to get out of the contract.
 ''If you went back 10 or 20 years ago, you could afford to do a deal that was a little outrageous,'' said Russ H. Crupnick, a senior entertainment analyst at the NPD Group, a market research firm. A label's midlevel acts could sell enough albums to cushion the financial blow. But as the number of platinum-selling albums has dwindled, from 179 in 2000 to 45 in 2009, the labels have little padding left. 
 ''These days, it's hard,'' Mr. Crupnick said. ''You can't afford to be as generous as you might have just to have a name on the roster.''
 Nevertheless, early last week Sony's Columbia Epic Label Group, which worked with Michael Jackson for more than 30 years, announced a deal with the pop star's estate worth up to $250 million, perhaps the largest in history. 
 Under the deal, Sony will release 10 projects -- probably a combination of albums, DVDs, live theater or even a video game -- by 2017. The new contract also extends Sony's rights to Mr. Jackson's previous recordings.
 For the Jackson estate, the deal will help alleviate a large debt load, at least $300 million when he died, built over time by the artist's unfettered spending. But for Sony, the deal appears on its face to be a big bet in a slumping music industry, particularly since the agreement gives the company the rights to his recordings, but not a cut from merchandise or publishing, and only limited rights to his likeness.
 ''Obviously the deal has a super headline number. What I thought I would see after that is likeness rights,'' said one consultant to the music labels, who requested anonymity to protect his relationships in the industry. ''I was surprised when I read that it is only about records and licensing.''
 Despite the limited rights and the spotty record track record for the largest record deals, Sony is confident it will come out ahead with its Jackson contract. The company points to Mr. Jackson's global commercial success, which is shared by only a handful of legacy acts, including Elvis Presley. The movie ''Michael Jackson's This Is It'' has grossed more than $260 million globally, almost 75 percent of which came from outside the United States, according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks movie sales. In addition, more than half of the 31 million Jackson albums the company says have been sold since his death in June are from outside the United States. 
 And if the deal is a boon for Sony, it would be another sign that superstars -- both dead and alive -- still rule the industry, perhaps more than ever, despite proclamations that the Internet may help level the playing field. 
 Last year, Michael Jackson sold 8.3 million albums in the United States, nearly double the albums sold by the second artist in line, Taylor Swift, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The Beatles ranked third. And last week, a new album of previously unreleased tracks from Jimi Hendrix, who died in 1970, was the fourth-best selling album.
 According to research conducted by Will Page, the chief economist at PRS for Music, a nonprofit royalty collection group in Britain that represents artists and music publishers, the gap between the hits and the niche is wider on online music sites than at traditional retailers. 
 In his look at We7, a music streaming music service in Britain, 5 percent of the millions of available tracks accounted for 90 percent of the streamed songs. In traditional stores, he said, 20 percent of the available inventory accounted for 80 percent of the sales.
 What that means, Mr. Page said, is ''the value placed on a proven catalog of an artist like Michael Jackson goes up, as it can stand above the increasing amount of noise in the market.''
 Several executives at other major labels scoffed when asked about the deal, saying their companies had learned the lessons of the past. And if that recent past is much of a guide, an executive's job can be at stake if results are not quickly realized after a big deal. In 2006, Andrew Lack was ousted as chief executive of Sony BMG (now Sony Music), in part for pushing through a recording deal with Bruce Springsteen that cost more than $100 million. 
 In 2007 and 2008, Live Nation signed a handful of artists to so-called 360 deals, in which the company takes a portion of the revenue from album sales, concerts and merchandise. Madonna and Jay-Z, for example, each signed 10-year, nine-figure deals with Live Nation. 
 It was not long, though, before the company backed away from signing new artists. Along the way, the company's chairman and its biggest proponent of speeding up the signing of artists, Michael Cohl, left in 2008.
 David C. Joyce, an analyst at Miller Tabak, said that he expects that the Madonna and Jay-Z deals ''will turn out to be low double-digit margin returns over their 10-year lives.'' But investors were wary of the deals at the time -- Live Nation stock dropped sharply after the signings but has moved upward in the last year as the company stopped adding new artists and merged with Ticketmaster.
 Mr. Crupnick said that Sony's Jackson deal could be even more successful. ''I think in this particular case, the deal makes quite a lot of sense, both for Sony and for the estate,'' he said. ''There are incredibly few artists these days who can continue to create revenue streams the way Michael Jackson can.''
 The amount of new material Sony will have to work with is unclear, since the estate is still making its way through the large trove of unused material kept by Mr. Jackson. Sony says there are at least 60 unreleased songs, some of which will be used for an album that the company plans to release in November. 
 A DVD compilation of his music videos is also in the works, and a Cirque du Soleil show using Mr. Jackson's music, similar to the ''Love'' show in Las Vegas that uses Beatles music, has been reported as a possibility. 
 ''Few brands can be continuously reinvented and re-established and reach broad demographic groups,'' said Charlie Walk, a former president of Epic Records, a Sony label. ''Michael Jackson can do just that.''

HEADLINE: Legal and Political Fights Are Looming for Democrats

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The battle over health care is poised to move swiftly from Congress back to the country as Democrats, Republicans and a battery of interest groups race to define the legislation and dig in for long-term political and legal fights.
 President Obama plans to open a new campaign this week to persuade skeptical Americans that the bill holds immediate benefits for them and addresses the nation's shaky fiscal condition. Republicans said they would seek to repeal the measure, challenge its constitutionality and coordinate efforts in statehouses to block its implementation.
 The politics of health care are fragile -- and far from certain -- in the eight-month midterm campaign that will determine which party will control Congress next year. But both sides steeled for a fight to extend well beyond November, involving state legislative battles, court challenges and, ultimately, the next presidential race. 
 Even before the final vote, Republicans began relentlessly assailing lawmakers who supported the legislation, suggesting Democrats are spendthrift and proponents of big government. Democrats said they would seek to capitalize on the momentum from their success and strive to move beyond the political arguments in hopes of demystifying the complicated legislation. 
 ''We ought to focus on not the political stakes, but the stakes for the country,'' David Plouffe, an adviser to Mr. Obama, said on ABC's ''This Week.'' ''We're going to go out there and not just talk about what we're for, but what the Republicans are voting against.''
 The next chapter in the health care fight will play out not only in the midterm elections, but also in the courts. Attorneys general in three states -- Virginia, Florida and South Carolina -- have indicated they will file legal challenges to the measure, on the grounds that it violates the Constitution by requiring individuals to purchase insurance.
 In an interview Sunday, the Virginia attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, said he intended to base his challenge on two grounds: that the federal bill conflicts with a newly passed state law that says no Virginian may be compelled to buy insurance and that Congress does not have authority to impose the mandate under its powers to regulate interstate commerce, as Democrats contend.
 ''This is such an incredible federal overreach,'' Mr. Cuccinelli said, but added that he did not plan to ask the courts for an order that would prevent the bill from going into effect because the individual mandate does not take effect until 2013. ''On our basis for a constitutional challenge, there's no rush,'' he said.
 The White House and Democrats were preparing to counter the legal arguments and coordinate a state-by-state response to any prospective challenges. For his part, aides said, Mr. Obama will lead the effort to define the bill, but also will shift his focus to the economy and jobs. A campaign, featuring Mr. Obama and examples of people who benefited from health care, will take place in the coming months.
 Democrats were also beginning to form a permanent campaign, of sorts, to follow the bill through its various stages. Party strategists studied the public's reaction to Medicare -- it was not immediately positive -- and were trying to create a friendlier climate for Mr. Obama when he faces voters again. 
 A fresh multimillion-dollar wave of television and radio advertisements was to begin Tuesday morning, with groups on both sides of the contentious health care issue trying to influence the lasting impressions about the long legislative debate.
 The president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donahue, pledged to keep opposing the health care measure ''through all available avenues -- regulatory, legislative, legal and political.'' And organizations supporting the legislation, including AARP and labor unions, intend to defend the bill and run commercials to thank lawmakers for their votes and to extol what they see as benefits.
 The coalition, known as Unity 10, has worked closely with the White House for the last year. The goal over the short and long term, organizers said, was to protect politics from health care and protect health care from politics.
 When vulnerable Democrats who supported the legislation return to their home districts later this week, they will be met with billboards at airports and rallies. They have been advised not to say they voted for the bill out of courage, aides said, because that suggests it was politically risky, and possibly, a wrong decision. To explain the bill, lawmakers have been given a district-by-district analysis filled with facts and tidbits. Take Representative John Boccieri, the Ohio Democrat who drew praise from Mr. Obama in a weekend visit to the Capitol for supporting the bill ''in as tough a district as there is.'' 
 The analysis of Mr. Boccieri's district, typically carried by Republicans, says the bill would give tax credits to up to 167,000 families; improve Medicare for 111,000 beneficiaries; extend coverage to 38,500 residents; guarantee that 9,800 residents with pre-existing conditions can obtain coverage; allow 49,000 young adults to remain on their parents' plans; and so on.
 ''This is not a bad debate to have,'' said Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union. ''If the debate is about big government, it will not be the right debate to have. It's about your life, your doctor, your hospital.''
 Senator John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said passage of the health care bill would be ''a bonanza'' for Republicans in states like Arkansas, Nevada and particularly Indiana, where Representative Brad Ellsworth, a Democrat, is running for the Senate and voted for the bill.
 ''It seems like it's a kamikaze mission on his part,'' Mr. Cornyn said in an interview on Sunday. 
 Democrats argue that the bill has deep political benefits, particularly because some of its popular provisions -- allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health plans until they turn 26, for instance -- will kick in this year, while the unpopular provisions, like the mandate to buy insurance, will not take effect until much later.
 Mr. Cornyn said Republicans would spotlight other provisions, like changes in private Medicare Advantage plans, which will also kick in quickly and are worrisome to older people. 
 Republicans also expect to take advantage of the fact that while the health bill may ultimately help contain rising premiums, it is unlikely to actually bring the cost of health insurance down, and certainly not in the short term.
 ''The question you're going to see Republicans asking in November is, 'Have your health insurance costs gone down?' '' Mr. Cornyn said. ''And I think the answer to that is going to be no.''

PERSON: Charlie Gillett 

HEADLINE: Charlie Gillett, 68, Disc Jockey and Historian

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Charlie Gillett, who turned his youthful zeal for rock 'n' roll into an influential career by writing one of the first serious rock histories and, as a disc jockey in London, helping to discover talents like Dire Straits and introduce the new genre of world music, died on Wednesday in London. He was 68.
 The British Broadcasting Corporation said he had suffered from an autoimmune disease and died of a heart attack. 
 As a broadcaster, journalist, author and musicologist, Mr. Gillett (pronounced GILL-et, with a hard G) strove to bring deeper, broader dimensions to people's appreciation of popular music. His book ''The Sound of the City: The Rise of Rock and Roll'' (1970) described how rock evolved from more or less authentic regional styles recorded by independent companies to a vast, homogenized business ruled by major labels.
 When the book was published in the United States by Outerbridge & Dienstfrey, Time magazine called it the ''best history of rock yet published.'' It remains in print (it is currently available from Da Capo Press) and has sold more than 250,000 copies.
 In the 1970s, Mr. Gillett was the first disc jockey to play music by Graham Parker, Elvis Costello and Dire Straits. By the time he had finished playing Dire Straits's unreleased ''Sultans of Swing'' for the first time in July 1977, record executives called to express interest. Two months later, the band signed with Phonogram Records and went on to global success.
 On Thursday, The Associated Press quoted Mr. Costello as saying that Mr. Gillett in 1976 played unreleased tracks of a record Mr. Costello had produced at home, leading to a contract with Stiff Records the next year.
 ''I will always be grateful for those few curious minutes when I sat with my head cocked like Nipper the Dog at the improbable sound of my own voice coming out of a radio speaker,'' he said.
 Arguably, though, Mr. Gillett's great achievement was shepherding the eclectic potpourri of musical strands emerging from Africa to Latin America to Eastern Europe to East Asia. He was one of a group of 15 or 20 record executives, journalists and others who met in a London pub in 1987 for the purpose of naming a musical form whose adherents range from a Belgian brass band in Brazil to a Toronto-based former child soldier from Somalia turned rapper. Record stores were clueless about how to identify this stunningly murky genre.
 The term ''world music'' bested competing phrases like ''world beat'' and ''international pop.'' An important point, Mr. Gillett suggested, was that world music is urban, not rural -- even though it might rise from rural traditions, as did American rock.
 Mr. Gillett began playing world music on the radio in the 1980s and went on to become a force in its spread through his role as host of a BBC world music show and the annual release of a two-CD collection of world music songs.
 Al Angelero, a disc jockey who has played world music for Radio Soleil d'Haiti in New York and other American stations for 25 years, said that Mr. Gillett's presentations had fueled the genre's rise in prominence.
 ''He had a mind that put it all together,'' Mr. Angelero said in an interview on Friday. ''He was not compartmentalized. You never knew what was coming next.''
 Mr. Gillett's other musical activities included managing Ian Dury, the English singer, lyricist and bandleader, and starting a record company, Oval Music, whose first recording was ''Another Saturday Night'' (1990), a collection of songs by Louisiana artists that was credited with bringing Cajun music to England. His book ''Making Tracks: Atlantic Records and the Growth of a Multi-Billion-Dollar Industry'' was published in 1974. 
 Charles Thomas Gillett was born in Morecambe, a town within the city of Lancaster, England, on Feb. 20, 1942, and graduated from the University of Cambridge with a degree in economics. For his thesis at Teachers College of Columbia University, he wrote about the history of rock music. It became his first book.
 In an interview with the world music magazine fRoots in 2004, he said he chose the topic ''as a way of rationalizing to myself that I hadn't misspent my entire youth listening to records to no purpose.''
 Mr. Gillett then taught social studies and filmmaking at an adult-education college in London. After ''The Sound of the City'' was published, he was hired to appear on a music panel show on television. He began his career as a disc jockey in 1972 as host of the show ''Honky Tonk'' on Radio London. He later worked for Capital Radio and had various radio shows on the BBC.
 Mr. Gillett is survived by his wife, the former Buffy Chessum; his daughters, Suzy and Jody; his son, Ivan; and two grandchildren.
 His enthusiasm for music did not affect his critical judgment. Though he always said one of the thrills of his life was seeing Buddy Holly perform in 1958, he wrote in ''The Sound of the City'' that Holly stopped being a true rock 'n' roll artist before he died the next year. He had turned, Mr. Gillett said, into a sentimental pop singer. 
 This article is reprinted from Sunday's late editions. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 31, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on March 22 and in some copies on March 21 about the disc jockey and music historian Charlie Gillett referred incorrectly to his birthplace, Morecambe, England. At the time he was born, in 1942, Morecambe was a separate town, not ''a town within the city of Lancaster.'' (Lancaster's boundaries were expanded in 1974 to include Morecambe, although both still tend to be thought of as separate urban centers.) The obituary also misstated the year that ''Another Saturday Night,'' a compilation of songs by Louisiana performers on Mr. Gillett's Oval Music label, was released. It was 1973 -- not 1990, which was the year it was reissued on CD.

HEADLINE: Rain Throws Curveball At Yankees' Schedule

BYLINE: By PAT BORZI

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Minutes after the Yankees canceled their exhibition game with the Detroit Tigers on Sunday because of heavy rain and a gloomy forecast, the pitching coach Dave Eiland moved through the clubhouse checking in with several pitchers. He spoke with A. J. Burnett, the scheduled starter, as well as Andy Pettitte, who was scheduled for a minor league game Monday. Then he found Joba Chamberlain and Mariano Rivera.
 All the conversations were brief and unspecific, leading to puzzled looks. ''They told us we'd get a phone call,'' Pettitte said. 
 Burnett said, ''So I guess I'll talk to you guys after we get a phone call.'' 
 Both knew more than Hughes. ''That's why I'm waiting around,'' said Hughes, who pulled up a chair at his locker.
 The rain turned the Yankees' carefully scripted pitching plans into ''a mess, kind of,'' Manager Joe Girardi said. To preserve Tuesday's day off and keep everyone on schedule, Girardi said the Yankees needed to find innings Monday for six pitchers -- Burnett, Chamberlain, Rivera, Phil Hughes, Chan Ho Park and Damaso Marte. 
 ''Oh, and Andy's throwing tomorrow,'' Girardi said, meaning Pettitte. ''I forgot about him. So seven.''
 Even with Pettitte accounted for, the Yankees would have to play 14 or 15 innings against the Philadelphia Phillies in Clearwater on Monday to get everybody proper work. Chamberlain and Hughes especially need to face live hitters in their competition for the fifth starter's job. So club officials started calling around, hoping to arrange a B game Monday morning with a team at Steinbrenner Field. 
 ''We're trying to work some things out,'' Girardi said. ''We've got to keep them on line.''
 As a gag, Girardi counted the reporters in his office as if determining if he had bodies for a lineup. ''Any left-handers?'' he said. 
 The Yankees had plenty of company; this was one of six games scratched or delayed in western and central Florida. ''In the big scope of things, three months, you're not going to say the rain affected you,'' Girardi said. ''But now it's a little bit of a pain in the rear.''
 In the end, the Yankees solved the problem without outside help. They scheduled an intrasquad game for Monday morning here with Pettitte, Rivera and Marte pitching for one team and Chamberlain, Park and Dave Robertson for the other. Burnett and Hughes will face the Phillies, with Burnett starting.
 Girardi was not available to explain why he chose Hughes for the exhibition game, although it may be that Chamberlain just faced the Phillies.
 Hughes (a 2.08 spring earned run average in eight and two-thirds innings) has been better this spring than Chamberlain (16.20 E.R.A. in six and two-thirds innings), but both pitched well in their most recent outings. Last Wednesday, Chamberlain held a Phillies lineup of mostly minor leaguers to one run and two hits over four economical innings, finishing with 17 pitches in the bullpen to reach his 65-pitch limit. The day before, Hughes threw four scoreless innings against the Houston Astros. 
 Girardi said Saturday that more recent appearances carried greater weight in his evaluations of fifth-starter candidates, so Hughes and Chamberlain may be on even footing heading into Monday and ahead of everybody else. Sergio Mitre struck out seven in five innings Friday night against Tampa Bay to stay in the picture, but Chad Gaudin and Alfredo Aceves fell off with poor performances Friday and Saturday, respectively. 
 Before settling the Monday plans, Girardi said the fifth-starter decision had proved to be the most time-consuming of camp. He hopes to resolve it this week.
 ''Probably because the amount of people, trying to figure out how to get them innings, it does take up a little more of our time,'' he said. ''If we weren't doing that, we'd be doing something else.''
 INSIDE PITCH
 The Yankees reassigned the catching prospects JESUS MONTERO and AUSTIN ROMINE to the minor league complex, along with outfielders COLIN CURTIS and REID GORECKI. Manager JOE GIRARDI, a former catcher, especially liked what he saw from Montero. ''He's made strides in his catching,'' Girardi said. ''He can really hit. He's a young man, like Romine, who needs to go play, mature, learn the finer points of catching and the pitcher-catcher relationship, those type of things. I was impressed with both of their work, their willingness to learn, their ability to take what you give them and try to apply it.'' ... JOHNNY DAMON made the trip for what would have been his first Steinbrenner Field appearance as a visitor since signing with the Tigers as a free agent. He will have one more chance Sunday.

HEADLINE: Taking Stock Of the Impact On the Wallet

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
American consumers, who spent a year watching Congress scratch and claw over sweeping health care legislation, can now try to figure out what the overhaul would mean for them.
 The uninsured are clearly the biggest beneficiaries of the legislation, which would extend the health care safety net for the lowest-income Americans. 
 The legislation is meant to provide coverage for as many as 32 million people who have been shut out of the market -- whether because insurers deem them too sick or because they cannot afford ever-rising insurance premiums. 
 For people already covered by a large employer -- most Americans, in other words -- the effect would not be as significant. And yet, just about everyone might benefit from tighter insurance regulations. 
 ''We think it's a big step forward,'' said Bill Vaughan, a policy analyst at Consumers Union. ''It's going to provide a peace of mind that many Americans who really want or need health insurance will always be able to get a quality product at a reasonable price regardless of their health or financial situation.''
 There would be costs to consumers, too. Affluent families would be required to pay additional taxes. Most Americans would be required to have health insurance and face federal penalties if they do not buy it. And it is still unclear what effect, if any, the legislation would have on rising out-of-pocket medical costs and premiums. 
 But there is no question that the legislation should benefit consumers in various ways. Beginning in 2014, for example, many employers -- those with 50 or more workers -- could face federal fines for not providing insurance coverage. Several of the other changes would take effect much sooner. 
 Six months after the legislation is enacted, many plans would be prohibited from placing lifetime limits on medical coverage, and they could not cancel the policies of people who fall ill. Children with pre-existing conditions could not be denied coverage. 
 And dependent children up to age 26 would be eligible for coverage under their parents' plans -- instead of the current state-by-state rules that often cut off coverage for children at 18 or 19.
 And within three months of the law's taking effect, people who have been locked out of the insurance market because of a pre-existing condition would be eligible for subsidized coverage through a new high-risk insurance program. 
 That special coverage would continue until the legislation's engine kicks into a higher gear in 2014, when coverage would be extended to a wider part of the population through Medicaid and new state-run insurance exchanges. 
 Those exchanges, or marketplaces, are meant to provide much more competitive, consumer-friendly online shopping centers of private insurance for people who are not able to obtain coverage through an employer. 
 In 2014, people with pre-existing conditions could no longer be denied insurance, all lifetime and annual limits on coverage would be eliminated and new policies would be required to meet higher benefit standards.
 Even sooner, in 2013, affluent families with annual income above $250,000 would be required to pay an additional 3.8 percent tax on their investment income, while contributing more to the Medicare program from their payroll taxes. And eventually, the most expensive insurance policies would be subject to a new tax.
 Here is a look at some of the main ways the health care overhaul might affect household budgets. 
 The Uninsured
 Although most Americans who do not obtain health insurance would face a federal penalty starting in 2014, many experts question how strict the enforcement of that penalty would actually be. 
 The first year, consumers who did not have insurance would owe $95, or 1 percent of income, whichever is greater. But the penalty would subsequently rise, reaching $695, or 2 percent of income. 
 Families who fall below the income-tax filing thresholds would not owe anything. Nor would people who cannot find a policy that costs less than 8 percent of their income, said Sara R. Collins, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, an independent nonprofit research group. 
 EXPANDED MEDICAID More lower-income individuals under the age of 65 would be covered by Medicaid, the federal health insurance plan for the poor. Under the new rules, households with income up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $29,327 for a family of four, would be eligible.
 EXCHANGES AND SUBSIDIES Most other uninsured people would be required to buy insurance through one of the new state-run insurance exchanges. People with incomes of more than 133 percent of the poverty level but less than 400 percent (that's $29,327 to $88,200 for a family of four) would be eligible for premium subsidies through the exchanges. 
 Premiums would also be capped at a percentage of income, ranging from 3 percent of income to as much as 9.5 percent.
 EMPLOYMENT FLEXIBILITY The exchanges would also help people who lose their jobs, quit or decide to start their own businesses.
 ''If you lose your employer-related insurance, you will be able to move seamlessly into the exchange,'' said Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. 
 Moreover, people of any age who cannot find a plan that costs less than 8 percent of their income would be allowed to buy a catastrophic policy otherwise intended for people under age 30. 
 Those With Insurance 
 EMPLOYER COVERAGE People who receive coverage through large employers would be unlikely to see any drastic changes, nor should premiums or coverage be affected. But almost everyone would benefit from new regulations, like the ban on pre-existing conditions that would apply to all policies come 2014.
 There might even be cases where people would be eligible to buy insurance through an exchange instead of through their employer, Professor Jost said: those who must pay more than 9.5 percent of their income for premiums, or those whose plans do not cover more than 60 percent of the cost their benefits. 
 CHANGES IN MEDICARE One of the biggest changes involves the Medicare prescription drug program. Its unpopular ''doughnut hole'' -- a big, expensive gap in coverage that affects millions -- would be eliminated by 2020. Starting immediately, consumers who hit the gap would receive a $250 rebate. In 2011, they would receive a 50 percent discount on brand name drugs. 
 HIGH-COST INSURANCE Starting in 2018, employers that offer workers pricier plans -- or those with total premiums of $10,200 or more for singles and $27,500 for families -- would be subject to a 40 percent tax on the excess premium, said C. Clinton Stretch, managing principal of tax policy at Deloitte. Retirees and workers in high-risk professions like firefighting would have higher thresholds ($11,850 for singles, or $30,950 for families), pegged to inflation.
 Although the taxes would be levied on the insurer, experts expect the assessment to be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher premiums or reduced benefits.

HEADLINE: Digitally, Location Is Where It's At

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com http://twitter/carr2n

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
 Last Monday night in Austin, about 200 people were milling around the bar at the Driskill Hotel, an unofficial headquarters for the name-badge-infested horde attending the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference. And just after midnight, about 70 people in different parts of the gorgeous relic of a bar stood up and began moving quickly toward the exit. 
 Where were we all going? To the CollegeHumor party around the corner. How did we know it was time to go there? Because our smartphones told us so. 
 At large events, people have always moved in groups to the next big thing. But at the interactive portion of the conference, the ubiquity of so-called ubiquitous presence -- location-based services like Foursquare and Gowalla -- meant the hive suddenly knew what it was collectively doing. (Although some truisms still attain: The party was nothing special once we got there.)
 It was striking to see the digital location effect in the wild, with people reacting to an unseen dog whistle and moving en masse, on command. Location-based services work like this: People sign in at their location and a list of nearby bars and restaurants (or in the instance of the conference, parties and panels) appears, along with a list of people you know who are there. 
 This year, Foursquare had an application that ranked locations by number of check-ins, so social heat was defined as lists were populated. The nerdy digital merit badges handed out for checking in at various locations included a few customized ones for Austin, among them a Porky badge for checking in on at least two barbecue places. The most ubiquitous presence has bragging rights over a particular spot, becoming the ''mayor,'' which sometimes includes a free meal or drink. (The New York Times provided content to Foursquare in a partnership for the Winter Games.)
 At the Driskill and many other places during the conference, people moved out because others began signaling their arrival somewhere else by ''checking in'' -- sending a notice of their arrival to Foursquare. (It wasn't just parties, either. The hive knew that the Twitter keynote panel bombed because all kinds of people who were there began checking in elsewhere.)
 If that sounds like old news -- Foursquare made its debut here in 2009 -- consider that much larger companies are just now bolting location awareness onto their existing applications. Twitter, with 50 million messages a day, introduced a location-awareness function during the conference, while Facebook, with more than 400 million users worldwide, will soon flip the switch for the 100 million or so users who update on smartphones. 
 Yelp, a popular listing of user-generated reviews, has added a check-in feature, and Google just added a widget to its Latitude application that lets you see the location of nearby pals who have enabled the service. Similarly, Apple has applied for patents for iGroup, which will give its iPhone users real-time information on who is nearby. 
 To someone not in their 20s whose location generally isn't that interesting to others -- that would be me -- the idea of handing over your privacy with both hands to strap on a digital ankle bracelet sounds profoundly unattractive. (I was probably the mayor of taking a disco nap before heading out for another long evening at South by Southwest so I wouldn't keel over.) But to a younger cohort that lives on the grid, the location of people you know and care about is vital information, the coin of the realm.
 ''For many, the benefits of augmented reality outweigh issues of privacy,'' said Beka Economopoulos of Fission Strategy, a Web development and social media consulting firm for nonprofits. And it often leads to a digitally enabled ''lemming effect,'' she added. 
 Location awareness would only seem to be of use in dense urban areas -- in many small towns and suburbs, everyone already knows where everyone else is. But what if location became not just a physical place, but a digital one? The possibilities for old and new media could be significant. 
 ''The check-in is bigger than location,'' said Yancey Strickler of Kickstarter, a Web site that helps with fund-raising for media products. ''Think of media: Checking into watching 'Lost,' being declared the mayor of 'The Brothers Karamazov' or earning a badge for braving free jazz.''
 What if a highly influential person suddenly became the mayor of your obscure little webcast, new book or you saw that your friends were checking in on a critically acclaimed but struggling new network show? Cue the lemmings and viral things might happen. For the time being, Foursquare and others limit check-ins to physical locations, but that could change.
 ''It doesn't just have to be about where to get a good cup of coffee,'' said Dennis Crowley, a co-founder of Foursquare. ''It could be about a certain type of movie and then perhaps you'd get an offer of another movie in that category. Right now, we are focused on place because we have a small team, but eventually, we could support check-ins to anything. It's really about experiences people have had.'' (We talked over lunch at Stubb's, a legendary Austin barbecue spot, and yes, he got the Porky badge.)
 Logic suggests that the advertising possibilities enabled by knowing where someone is or what they have been watching at a given moment are profound. If the first movers gain users and the big boys come off the sidelines, what looks like a fetish object could end up being one more important tool in navigating physical and digital space. 
 Location was the talk of Austin, the maypole we all literally pivoted around, and the bounce seemed back, at least in social media. There were dueling parties between Foursquare and Gowalla, an Austin-based service, on Monday night: Foursquare had both Ashton Kutcher and a bubble machine at the Cedar Street Courtyard, while just around the corner at the Belmont, Gowalla had a tie-in to Lance Armstrong's LiveStrong foundation and a D.J. set by Diplo. Life on and off the grid was full of free booze and ambient awareness, with social maps on iPhones lighting the way.
 As I left Austin, it was nice to find out on Foursquare that others had stopped at the Salt Lick barbecue restaurant at the Austin airport on their way out of town and bought a brisket sandwich. But then again, the aroma as I walked by probably told me what I needed to know, no P.D.A. or check-ins required.

HEADLINE: School Cuts in New Jersey

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''New Jersey Schools Brace for Next Cuts Under Christie'' (news article, March 15): 
 There is a simple step that school boards could take to help address the fiscal pressures facing elementary and secondary education in New Jersey. That would be -- with the consent of employee bargaining units -- to reopen existing contracts.
 I am a member of a school board in central New Jersey, but I comment on this matter as a private citizen, as I have no authority to speak on behalf of my board.
 The contracts, especially those negotiated before 2009, include many provisions that could be modified to make more money available to school systems for other expenses that they face, particularly those involving services to students. I am not talking about reducing expenditures or cutting taxes, but merely resetting priorities, as befits the economic times. Such measures, among others, could help avert layoffs.
 This happens all the time in the private sector. There is no reason that the government sector, too, should not be subject to the same arrangements. Human beings negotiate and sign contracts. They can also choose to reopen them.

HEADLINE: For Historic Stakes, a Big Obama Gamble on a Partisan Victory

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House's passage of health care legislation late Sunday night assures that whatever the ultimate cost, President Obama will go down in history as one of the handful of presidents who found a way to reshape the nation's social welfare system. 
 After the bitterest of debates, Mr. Obama proved that he was willing to fight for something that moved him to his core. Skeptics had begun to wonder. But he showed that when he was finally committed to throwing all his political capital onto the table, he could win, if by the narrowest of margins. 
 Whether it was a historic achievement or political suicide for his party -- perhaps both -- he succeeded where President Bill Clinton failed in trying to remake American health care. President George W. Bush also failed to enact a landmark change in a domestic program, his second-term effort to create private accounts in the Social Security system. 
 At the core of Mr. Obama's strategy stands a bet that the Republicans, in trying to portray the bill as veering toward socialism, overplayed their hand. Fueled by the antigovernment anger of the Tea Party movement, Republicans have staked much on the idea that they can protect the country by acting as what the Democrats gleefully call the ''Party of No.'' 
 Now, armed with a specific piece of legislation that offers concrete benefits to millions of people -- and that promises to guarantee insurance for many who found it unaffordable or unattainable -- the White House and Democrats believe they may have gained the upper hand. 
 ''This only worked well for the Republican Party if it failed to pass,'' David Axelrod, one of the president's closest political advisers, said at the White House as he watched the vote count for the final bill reach 219 in favor. ''They wanted to run against a caricature of it rather than the real bill. Now let them tell a child with a pre-existing condition, 'We don't think you should be covered.' '' 
 But there is no doubt that in the course of this debate, Mr. Obama has lost something -- and lost it for good. Gone is the promise on which he rode to victory less than a year and a half ago -- the promise of a ''postpartisan'' Washington in which rationality and calm discourse replaced partisan bickering. 
 Never in modern memory has a major piece of legislation passed without a single Republican vote. Even President Lyndon B. Johnson got just shy of half of Republicans in the House to vote for Medicare in 1965, a piece of legislation that was denounced with many of the same words used to oppose this one. That may be the true measure of how much has changed in Washington in the ensuing 45 years, and how Mr. Obama's own strategy is changing with the discovery that the approach to governing he had in mind simply will not work.
 ''Let's face it, he's failed in the effort to be the nonpolarizing president, the one who can use rationality and calm debate to bridge our traditional divides,'' said Peter Beinart, a liberal essayist who is publishing a history of hubris in politics. ''It turns out he's our third highly polarizing president in a row. But for his liberal base, it confirms that they were right to believe in the guy -- and they had their doubts.''
 For that lesson in governing, Mr. Obama paid a heavy price. He nearly lost the health care debate, and pulled out victory only after deferring nearly every other priority and stumping with a passion he had not shown since his campaign. His winning argument, in the end, was that while the political result could run against him -- and other Democrats -- remaking health care was a keystone of his ''Change You Can Believe In'' credo. 
 Mr. Obama acknowledged the political uncertainties ahead even as, in typically understated tones, he marked the moment shortly before midnight at the White House. 
 ''There will be predictions of what it means for Democrats and Republicans and for my administration,'' he said. But he insisted that after the scorecards were filled out, the system that emerged from a year of debate would prove ''a victory for common sense.''
 ''This isn't radical reform,'' he insisted, ''but it is major reform.''
 Republicans entered this fight convinced, at least for public consumption, that they know how it will play out: with an end to Mr. Obama's mandate and a bigger-than-normal loss for the incumbent party in the midterms. 
 In the soaring deficits that began in the Bush era and accelerated in the heat of the financial crisis, and in the argument that Mr. Obama was taking over wide swaths of the economy, an increasingly conservative Republican Party believes the health care overhaul encapsulates the argument that the president is about big government intruding into the lives of citizens.
 ''In the short term Obama will get a boost, because the narrative is that he came back from the dead and got done what no president has managed to do in 70 years,'' said Peter Wehner, who was a political adviser to President Bush. ''But once people discover that their Medicare taxes are going up, that there are deeper cuts in Medicare Advantage, that there are court challenges to many provisions, and that the process of getting it passed created a portrait of corruption, it won't sit well.'' 
 Perhaps so, but Mr. Obama's counterargument is that three-quarters of a century of American history is largely on his side. In 1966, celebrating the creation of the first Medicare rolls that covered 20 million Americans, President Johnson recalled the complaints three decades earlier that Social Security ''would destroy this country,'' and noted ''there is not one out of 100 who would think of repealing it.'' (He may have been right at the time, but since then many have come to believe that the system must change or go broke, the battle Mr. Bush fought and lost in 2005.) 
 Today, many would tinker with Medicare; many of the arguments over the last three months have been how to reshape it, but no one on Capitol Hill has dared suggest eliminating it. 
 Mr. Obama's gamble is that what worked for Johnson and President Franklin D. Roosevelt will ultimately work for him. Once Americans discover that they can no longer be rejected for insurance for pre-existing conditions, he is betting, or that they can keep their children on their own insurance plans longer, the more they will come to appreciate the effect of the changes on their day-to-day lives. 
 He is trying to sell the government's oversight role over doctors and insurance companies the way he is trying to sell financial regulation: as a leveling of the playing field, in favor of consumers. But as the fight over health care shows, the political atmosphere of 2010 resembles neither 1965 nor 1933.
 The more the country debated this change to the social contract, the more divided it became. The more Mr. Obama talked, the more his Republican opponents decided that their best strategy was to dig in and defend the status quo. If deficits soar, if the Congressional Budget Office's estimates prove fanciful, they will be able to argue that Mr. Obama expanded government at a time the country simply could not afford yet another entitlement.
 But it will take years to know whether the Republicans' worst predictions, or Mr. Obama's vision of affordable near-universal care, will resemble reality. In the meantime, Mr. Obama can lay credible claim, for the first time in his presidency, that he proved willing to risk all to turn his convictions into legislation.

HEADLINE: Mixing In Some Carbon

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
MOSS LANDING, Calif. -- It seems like alchemy: a Silicon Valley start-up says it has found a way to capture the carbon dioxide emissions from coal and gas power plants and lock them into cement. 
 If it works on a mass scale, the company, Calera, could turn that carbon into gold. 
 Cement production is a large source of carbon emissions in the United States, and coal-fired electricity plants are the biggest source. As nations around the world press companies to curb their greenhouse-gas emissions, a technology that makes it profitable to do so could be very popular. Indeed, Calera's marketing materials may be one of the rare places where glowing quotes from a coal company and the Sierra Club appear together. 
 ''With this technology, coal can be cleaner than solar and wind, because they can only be carbon-neutral,'' said Vinod Khosla, the Silicon Valley billionaire. His venture capital firm, Khosla Ventures, has invested about $50 million in Calera. On Monday, Calera is set to announce that Peabody Energy, the world's biggest coal company, has invested $15 million.
 Although Calera has a pilot project up and running, it is still not clear that the process can be used on a large scale or that anyone will buy the cement it makes.
 Some climate scientists and cement experts are dubious that Calera can produce large quantities of cement that is durable and benign for the environment. 
 ''People have been looking for ways to do this for 15 years,'' said Ken Caldeira, an expert on the carbon cycle who is a senior scientist with the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford. ''The idea that they're going to come up with something that's both economic and scalable? I'm highly skeptical.'' 
 Major carbon emitters and green technology companies have been trying to figure out ways to capture and store carbon, such as injecting it into the ground, in case Congress begins to regulate carbon emissions. 
 Calera says that by turning carbon into a building material, it will make carbon reduction economically attractive even in places where there are no government subsidies or carbon taxes. ''In this case, it's actually a profit center,'' said Brent Constantz, Calera's founder and chief executive. 
 Mr. Constantz, who is a consulting professor at the Stanford School of Earth Sciences, has spent his career studying and creating different kinds of cement. As a graduate student, he studied how corals in the Caribbean use carbon dioxide to make their skeletons. He started two companies, Norian and Skeletal Kinetics, that make a calcium phosphate cement that surgeons use to repair broken bones. 
 In 2007, he and Mr. Khosla hatched plans for Calera. Today, Mr. Khosla is effectively part of the management team, involving himself in details and speaking with Calera executives daily. 
 While the company declines to share precise details of its process, it does say it combines carbon dioxide with seawater or groundwater brine, which contain calcium, magnesium and oxygen. It is left with calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate, which are used in making cement and aggregate. It plans to sell it to concrete companies for use in pavement. 
 To make its cement more acceptable to manufacturers of traditional Portland cement, it is also making concrete blends of 20 percent Calera cement and 80 percent Portland cement, the calcium silicate binder used in concrete for buildings, highways and bridges. 
 In Moss Landing, on the shore of Monterey Bay, a huge natural gas power plant owned by Dynegy spews dirty gray smoke, called flue gas. It is full of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. 
 Today, big, rusty pipes snake from the power plant to Calera's demonstration cement plant. Calera pumps the flue gas into a big blue container, in which sea water from the nearby ocean is sprayed through the gas, producing a milky white liquid. 
 The liquid is then pumped into a giant strainer, which separates the solids from the water and spits out a white substance that looks like toothpaste. In a spray dryer, hot air -- the waste heat from the flue gas -- transforms the paste into little particles of cement and aggregate. Calera plans to desalinate the leftover water and sell it. 
 Calera's cement plant is capturing 86 percent of the carbon dioxide in the flue gas from the Dynegy plant, according to a study by R.W. Beck, a consulting firm hired by Calera. 
 Much of the skepticism about the project stems from the acid created in Calera's chemical process. It has to find a way to dispose of it or neutralize it by adding alkaline materials, without creating more environmental problems or raising costs. Either would be difficult to do on a large scale, Mr. Caldeira said. 
 Mr. Khosla said that Calera has many sources of alkaline materials and many ways to dispose of acid.
 Climate scientists have raised other questions as well. ''The chemical processes are known to exist, but if what you're looking for is something that can be scaled up in order to actually mitigate CO2 emissions, it's just a big problem,'' said Ruben Juanes, assistant professor in energy studies at M.I.T.
 Growing beyond the demonstration plant will be Calera's next challenge, and it is a step that has stumped many clean technology start-ups. 
 ''People have the impression that the energy sector is like the I.T. sector and you just have to build an iPhone and suddenly it will be everywhere, which is simply not the case,'' said Joseph Romm, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and editor of Climate Progress, an influential blog. ''You have to build up so much infrastructure.'' 
 Calera, which has worked with Bechtel to design and build cement plants, plans to open its first commercial plant next year. The company is in talks with Dynegy and a utility in Pennsylvania and has received grants from the Australian government to build a cement plant next to a coal plant in the state of Victoria. 
 ''I don't think anyone's going to believe us until we're up and running,'' Mr. Constantz said.

HEADLINE: Health Care Reform, at Last

 BODY:
The process was wrenching, and tainted to the 11th hour by narrow political obstructionism, but the year-long struggle over health care reform came to an end on Sunday night with a triumph for countless Americans who have been victimized or neglected by their dysfunctional health care system. Barack Obama put his presidency on the line for an accomplishment of historic proportions. 
 The bill, which was approved by the Senate in December and by the House on Sunday, represents a national commitment to reform the worst elements of the current system. It will provide coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans, prevent the worst insurance company abuses, and begin to wrestle with relentlessly rising costs -- while slightly reducing future deficits. 
 Amendments approved by the House and awaiting approval in the Senate would provide additional coverage and make somewhat deeper reductions in the deficit.
 All of this was managed despite the fact that not a single Republican in the House or Senate was willing to vote for the bill. Efforts by the White House and Congressional Democrats to draft bipartisan legislation were met by demagoguery. That is not likely to end now. 
 Republican leaders, who see opportunities to gain seats in the elections, have made clear that they will continue to peddle fictions about a government takeover of the health care system and about costs too high to bear. Mr. Obama took too long to get into the fight, but came on strong in the end and will have to keep pushing back so all Americans understand the benefits of reform.
 Most Americans -- those who already have employer-based insurance -- will not see much change for a while and certainly not in the seven months before the elections. They will get one important benefit quickly: for an additional fee, parents will be able to keep adult dependent children on their policy through age 26. That is good news when so many young people are struggling to find jobs during the recession. 
 The biggest difference for Americans who have employer-based insurance is the security of knowing that, starting in 2014, if they lose their job and have to buy their own policy, they cannot be denied coverage or charged high rates because of pre-existing conditions. Before then, the chronically ill could gain temporary coverage from enhanced high-risk pools and chronically ill children are guaranteed coverage.
 The focus of the reform is on improving the dysfunctional and hugely expensive insurance markets for individuals and small businesses, and on expanding Medicaid coverage for the poor. The big expansion of coverage will start in 2014, but some reforms start quickly, like tax credits to help small businesses provide coverage. 
 Over time the reforms could bring about sweeping changes in the way medical care is delivered and paid for. They could ultimately rival Social Security and Medicare in historic importance.
 NEAR-UNIVERSAL COVERAGE The United States is the only advanced industrial nation that does not provide or guarantee health care coverage for virtually all of its citizens. It is a moral obligation to end this indefensible neglect of hard-working Americans. The bill does not quite reach full universality, but by 2019, fully 94 to 95 percent of American citizens and legal residents below Medicare age will have coverage. The bill achieves that by requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, providing subsidies to help the middle classes buy policies on new competitive exchanges, and expanding Medicaid coverage of the poor to include childless adults and others not currently eligible. 
 INSURANCE REFORMS The legislation would rein in many of the insurance industry's worst practices. Insurers would no longer be able to reject applicants with ''pre-existing conditions'' or charge them exorbitant rates. They could not rescind policies on specious grounds after people become sick (that becomes effective immediately) or cap the amount they are willing to pay toward a beneficiary's illnesses in any given year or over a lifetime. 
 The most important reform -- forcing insurers to accept all applicants regardless of their health status -- cannot be achieved unless nearly all Americans are required to have coverage, so the costs can be spread among the healthy and the sick.
 A START AT COST CONTROL The legislation won't quickly bend the cost curve for medical care or insurance premiums -- no one has yet found a surefire way to do that -- but the reform will make an important start. Some experts believe it will lay the structural framework to mount the most serious effort ever made to control medical inflation. It will create competitive insurance exchanges that should help lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by offering an array of private policies and rates comparable to large group coverage.
 The legislation will impose an excise tax in 2018 designed to drive employers and their workers away from the highest-cost insurance policies, which typically provide generous benefits at little out-of-pocket cost to the workers. Health economists consider the excise tax a very strong cost-control measure, because if workers have to pay more of the cost themselves, they and their doctors are apt to think more carefully about whether a test or procedure is really needed. The impact of the excise tax gets increasingly strong as the years pass.
 The legislation creates an array of pilot programs within Medicare, to test other innovative cost-reduction strategies. They include encouraging new medical groups to better coordinate care of the chronically ill, and paying doctors and medical institutions based on the quality, not quantity, of services they deliver. The reform measure will establish an independent board to push approaches that work into widespread use in Medicare and ultimately, by force of example, the private sector.
 With so many mechanisms available to hold down medical costs, it's hard to believe that they won't bear fruit, if not in the next several years then in the decade thereafter. 
 Just as Social Security grew from a modest start in 1935 to become a bedrock of the nation's retirement system, this is a start on health care reform, not the end. A lot will depend on whether future presidents and Congresses stick to the savings and deficit targets set in this legislation; on how aggressively states administer the new exchanges; on how health care professionals and institutions respond to the challenge of changing their ways; and on how the public responds to the mandate that everyone obtain insurance or pay a penalty. 
 Our hope and belief is that this reform will in the end accomplish its great objectives. Right now, the good news for all Americans is that despite all the politics and the obstructionism, the process has finally begun.

HEADLINE: Stifling the Economy, One Argument at a Time

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. LIGHTHIZER. 
Robert E. Lighthizer, a lawyer, was a deputy trade representative in the Reagan administration.

 BODY:
FRUSTRATED with years of delay and stonewalling, 130 members of Congress last week urged the Obama administration to punish China for manipulating the value of its currency to the detriment of American exports. But this issue does not stand alone; it is part of the larger, murkier world of international trade policy, centered on the Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations. These talks, which began in 2001, long ago became a quagmire. It's time to admit the global economy has passed them by and pull the plug on them. 
 The trade talks, which never had more than modest support from American businesses, were intended not just to lower barriers to trade, but particularly to ''ensure that developing countries, and especially the least-developed among them, secure a share in the growth of world trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development.'' Given that Western countries had enjoyed significant economic growth in the 1980s and 1990s, helping poorer states seemed like a noble goal. 
 There was never much reason to believe that the Doha round would really help United States workers and businesses. American farmers in particular dislike the negotiators' focus on reducing or eliminating their government subsidies -- given the limited gains they would see in real foreign-market access.
 Global trade officials claimed that Doha could be used to further open developing markets like China and India to American manufacturers, but -- as the National Association of Manufacturers has pointed out for years -- such countries have refused to put on the table any significant market-opening offers. Finally, efforts to use the Doha round to improve export opportunities for American service providers have also gone nowhere.
 As trade ministers have chattered on for nearly a decade, the world has changed. The notion that we should adjust global trading rules to help the rest of the world compete with the West has become outdated. 
 Since 2001, the West has suffered its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In the United States, we have seen our financial services sector -- which accounted for 40 percent of American corporate profits in 2007 -- implode. Since the start of these talks, we have run up a cumulative trade deficit with China of more than $1.5 trillion, and have lost some four million manufacturing jobs. 
 Meanwhile, the World Bank projects that developing countries will enjoy 5.2 percent growth in 2010 and 5.8 percent growth in 2011 -- while ''high income'' countries will experience growth rates of only 1.8 percent in 2010 and 2.3 percent in 2011. Under these circumstances, why would we continue with the same tired agenda for trade negotiations? It is like trying to improve standard-definition TV in the world of high-def.
 Unfortunately, President Obama is reading from the same nine-year-old talking points as the trade bureaucrats. On March 11, in comments echoing part of his State of the Union address, he re-committed his administration to working ''towards an ambitious and balanced Doha agreement.'' That is a mistake. The president should push for a new United States trade agenda suitable for a world in which the Western countries are losing ground while ''developing'' countries like China, Brazil and India are surging.
 Any serious multilateral trade talks should address four main topics:
 THE UNITED STATES-CHINA TRADE BALANCE Our trade deficit with China grew from $103 billion in 2002 (the first full year after China joined the W.T.O.) to $268 billion in 2008 -- an increase of 160 percent in only seven years. Although the recession has forced American consumers to reduce their purchases of Chinese imports, our 2009 trade deficit with China was still almost $227 billion. This imbalance has become a symbol of American decline and poisoned many Americans' view of free trade. By some estimates, China's aggressive exports and reluctance on imports could lower global world production by 1.4 percent and cost Americans 1.4 million jobs.
 CURRENCY MANIPULATION China has stockpiled some $2.4 trillion in foreign currency reserves in its determination to keep the yuan from rising -- as market forces would normally require -- and maintain its trade advantage. No wonder almost a third of the House demanded last week that the Obama administration take some action. Many experts believe that the artificially low interest rates caused by Chinese currency manipulation contributed directly to the real estate bubbles in the West that exploded with such disastrous results.
 UNFAIR TAX RULES The United States relies primarily on income taxes to pay for government services, while most of our trading partners depend on value-added taxes on purchases. Under current W.T.O. rules, countries with value-added taxes are allowed to give tax rebates to their companies on exported goods, and to impose those taxes on imports. Companies in nations with income taxes, however, are not allowed similar treatment. Thus an American product shipped to France is effectively taxed twice, while a French product can be sent here effectively tax-free. The consequences are serious: a 2004 analysis concluded that this practice cost American exporters more than $100 billion per year. 
 REGULATORY DISPARITIES Foreign companies often benefit from relatively weak labor and environmental rules that enable them to operate with significantly lower costs than their United States competitors. This leaves American manufacturers with three options: lose market share, cut profit margins or move abroad. Indeed, one of the main concerns about proposed climate change legislation is that such laws would result in significant carbon ''leakage,'' as carbon-emitting manufacturers flee to countries with lower standards. If we want an efficient global market, we should be more serious about making sure companies in all nations play by the same rules. 
 Ending the Doha round will not be easy. Many trade bureaucrats, both here and abroad, will cling to the mantra that doing so would hurt free trade. But Americans would be receptive to an argument focused on their concerns: in a 2008 Rasmussen poll, 73 percent of respondents said that a free-trade agreement had had a negative effect on their families, while only 14 percent said they had benefited from such an agreement. And while other countries would undoubtedly resist changing a global trading system that puts Americans at a severe disadvantage, we have enormous leverage, in the form of the world's largest market. We should use that leverage. 
 Finally, what do we have to lose? The Doha talks are never going to significantly help Americans anyway. One benefit of the recession and the pause in the Doha talks is that President Obama has a rare opportunity to re-focus our trade agenda. He should take it.

HEADLINE: Officer Shot in a South Bronx Apartment

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA; Colin Moynihan and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A police officer was hit at least three times in a shootout on Monday while responding to a 911 call at a housing project in the South Bronx, but was apparently saved by his bullet-resistant vest, law enforcement officials said. 
 The gunman was later found dead with a bullet wound to his temple in the bedroom where the shootout took place, though it was unclear whether the police had shot him or he had shot himself, officials said. 
 The officer, Robert Salerno, 25, was in serious but stable condition at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center on Monday night. He was expected to survive, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference at the hospital. 
 Officer Salerno was shot once in the chest and twice in the lower abdomen and may have been struck a fourth time in his utility belt, officials said. His vest blocked the shot to the chest.
 ''The vest probably saved his life,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said at the news conference. 
 The man who shot the officer, Santiago Urena, 57, died of a gunshot wound, Mr. Kelly said. Officers fired 21 rounds at Mr. Urena after he opened fire at them from a bedroom in a second-floor apartment at 3073 Park Avenue in the Morrisania Air Rights houses, the authorities said. 
 Mr. Kelly said the location of the fatal wound indicated that it might have been self-inflicted, but the police are waiting for a medical examiner's report to determine who fired the fatal shot and whether Mr. Urena had received any other wounds. 
 At the news conference, which Gov. David A. Paterson attended, the commissioner held up Officer Salerno's vest with a bullet hole clearly visible below the right breast. The other shots struck just below the vest, he said. 
 Mr. Kelly said Mr. Urena was unemployed, lived in the apartment with his elderly mother and had no known criminal record. A .38-caliber revolver with four of its five chambers empty was lodged under his body, which was found face down on the bedroom floor, officials said.
 The police arrived just after noon on Monday after receiving a 911 call from a home health aide who was taking care of Mr. Urena's 91-year-old mother, officials said. Two police cars from the 44th Precinct met the woman in front of the building. A police official said Mr. Urena apparently became annoyed because the health aide was talking on the phone to her husband in the Dominican Republic. In a mix of Spanish and broken English, she told them that Mr. Urena had threatened her with a gun, according to a neighbor who said he translated the worker's complaints.
 ''She said the guy was disrespecting her, trying to rap to her,'' said the neighbor, Jimmy Molina, using a term for making sexual advances. ''She was telling him that he knows she's married and she has a husband in Santo Domingo.'' 
 Mr. Molina said the woman then told the police that Mr. Urena struck her, knocked her to the ground and pulled out a gun, saying, ''I'll kill you, I'll kill you.'' 
 Mr. Kelly said the suspect's older brother, Demetrio Urena, led Officer Salerno and three other officers up to the apartment and told them that Santiago Urena was in a bedroom. The officers ordered him out, but he refused, and when the officers opened the door, Mr. Urena opened fire, Mr. Kelly said. 
 Officer Salerno, the first through the door, was hit three or four times. He returned fire, emptying his magazine of 16 bullets. The other officers got off a total of five shots as they dragged him out of the building, where he was taken away by ambulance. 
 A Police Department Emergency Services Unit arrived at the apartment a short time later and found Mr. Urena lying dead on the bedroom floor, Mr. Kelly said. 
 Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said Mr. Urena's mother, Ana Urena, was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and was not wounded. 
 Mr. Kelly said Officer Salerno joined the force in January 2007 and had been with the 44th Precinct since that June. He was the first officer shot in the line of duty this year. Officials called his actions courageous. ''This was clearly a very dangerous situation,'' Mayor Bloomberg said.

HEADLINE: A Player Back at the Casino: He's Undercover but at Home

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
Sitting one afternoon recently in the lobby of Caesars casino here, where the floor is paved with stone to resemble the streets of ancient Rome, Josh Axelrad was trying to resemble someone idle, unemployed and not too bright. He was wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a Ford racing cap at an off-kilter angle. He was not advertising that, stuffed in wads in his pockets and stacked in a money belt around his waist, he was packing $20,000 that friends had staked him to play cards with.
 Mr. Axelrad, who is 35 and has a philosophy degree from Columbia, is -- or used to be -- a professional card counter and blackjack player. In his memoir, ''Repeat Until Rich: A Professional Card Counter's Chronicle of the Blackjack Wars,'' which came out last week from the Penguin Press, he describes how for five years he was part of a gambling team he calls Mossad. 
 Card counting recognizes that in blackjack, face cards and 10's are more valuable to the player, while lower cards are better for the dealer. In Mr. Axelrad's system cards are assigned a value of -1, 0, or +1, and the counter keeps a running tally of every hand he sees, waiting for a time when the deck (or, in most casinos, a shoe containing several decks) is literally stacked in his favor.
 Modeled on the legendary M.I.T. Blackjack Team of the late 1970s, Mossad would hit the road for a couple of weeks at a time, invading casinos with squads of players, who had carefully defined roles. There were spotters, who would sit patiently at a blackjack table, keeping track of the cards until the odds tilted in favor of the bettor; controllers, who had mastered odds and strategy; and B.P.'s (big players), who would move in and start placing large bets. 
 Mr. Axelrad estimates in the book that in a five-year career he won $700,000 for his team. He then went broke playing online poker, to which he became helplessly addicted, and while struggling to write his book he gave up gambling for years. Until this trip he hadn't been in Atlantic City since 2004. His book is dark, funny, at times painfully honest, and strips much of the mythology from counting, which turns out to be less difficult than most people imagine and also a lot less glamorous.
 ''It's very odd,'' he said, laughing nervously, as he tried to explain why his bankrollers had entrusted their money to someone who was a self-confessed gambling addict. ''But I think my teammates understand it. It's sort of heartwarming. They know my entire story, and they understand how it's possible for the same person to be in a degenerate, addicted pathology, and also be entrusted with their money.'' 
 Card counting is not illegal, he says in his book, and to a certain extent casinos tacitly encourage it if it makes bettors flock to the blackjack tables thinking they can beat the system. What the casinos don't like is counters who are good enough to win, and in many states such players, if they can be identified, are evicted. Pit bosses keep files and photographs of repeat offenders. 
 Counters, for their part, resort to ruses and disguises and misdirection. Mr. Axelrad, who is small and intense, used to pretend to be drunk or on drugs. He wore a wig on occasion. ''The key is to insert some new problem into the mind of the pit,'' he said, ''so they're worried about something else than why is this person betting this way.''
 The great enemy of counters is what they call heat, or scrutiny, and Mr. Axelrad said he wasn't sure what kind of heat to expect at Caesars. It was possible his name was still on file somewhere. He had also heard rumors about new photo-recognition software. On the other hand, in New Jersey a casino can't throw you out just for counting; the dealer can only try to make it harder for you. 
 ''I'm not concerned,'' he said. ''We'll see what happens.'' But then he shifted in his chair, and added: ''I'm a little frantic right now -- being here, the book coming out. I actually aspire to live more calmly.'' He had just inherited a house in Kansas, he said, and could imagine living there quietly and trying to write another book.
 As it happened, Mr. Axelrad caught heat at Caesars not for counting but for having a photograph for this article taken in front of a blackjack table. So he moved next door to the Trump Plaza, where he said he had once won $50,000 in what he called a very ''egregious'' way. 
 ''I acted like someone who was mentally dysfunctional,'' he said. ''I was drooling and acting crazy. It was way over the top, and I got away with it for five days.'' He smiled and added, ''Trump has a fond place in my heart.''
 At Trump Plaza he stood behind a blackjack table for several minutes, back-counting -- or keeping track of the cards without getting into the game -- and then nonchalantly sat down and began playing. After just a few hands he was betting the table maximum: $500. To someone observing carefully, his behavior -- the long period of watching, his practiced hand gestures when signaling that he was sticking or asking for another card, the quick acceleration to high stakes -- might have announced ''Counter!'' except that almost as quickly as he began winning, he started losing.
 Face cards and 10's were turning up just as reliably as he predicted, only they were winding up in the hand of the dealer, who made blackjack after blackjack. Within 20 minutes or so Mr. Axelrad had dropped $4,000, and he got up and wandered away. ''That's just normal statistical fluctuation,'' he said, but added, ''As someone said poignantly once, losing is the best cover.''
 By that evening, Mr. Axelrad wrote later in an e-mail message, he had made back the loss and then some. The dealers at Trump Plaza began half-shoeing him -- that is, dealing out only a half-shoe of cards before reshuffling, a tactic designed to thwart counting -- so he moved on to a couple of other casinos and ended the day with a profit of $4,639, he said. But for a couple of hours that afternoon he toggled between tables, betting $25 at a time and dribbling away another $500 or so while waiting for a count to turn in his favor. Playing blackjack seemed a lonely and dreary way to make a living.
 On the other hand, Mr. Axelrad said he was feeling no heat at all. ''I love this place!'' he exclaimed. ''They think I'm a goober. Or maybe they know I'm counting, but just think I'm no good at it. I'm really enjoying the tranquillity.''

HEADLINE: Health Measure's Opponents Plan Legal Challenges

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Officials in a dozen states who oppose the health care bill say they hope to block it in court by arguing that requiring people to buy health insurance is an unprecedented intrusion by the federal government into people's lives -- the equivalent of going a step beyond simply regulating automobiles to requiring people to buy a car.
 They add that the bill would rewrite the relationship between federal and state government, and they plan to make their argument in court as soon as the legislation becomes law. 
 ''We plan to file the moment Obama signs the bill,'' Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, wrote on his Facebook page.
 But constitutional scholars suggest that such cases would likely amount to no more than a speed bump for health care legislation. 
 The reason, they say, is that Congress has framed the mandate as a tax, which it has well-established powers to create. And Congress's sweeping authority to regulate the nation's economy, they add, has been clear since the 1930s.
 ''The attack on this bill,'' said Jack M. Balkin, a professor of constitutional law at Yale University, ''is not merely an attack on the substance of this particular measure. It's also a challenge to understandings that come with the New Deal.''
 Florida's attorney general, Bill McCollum, is leading the effort to block the new bill, saying that it ''violates the U.S. Constitution and infringes on each state's sovereignty.'' 
 Mr. McCollum pledged to fight alongside attorneys general from Alabama, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington. Louisiana announced it would join the suit as well, and Virginia, which has passed a law barring government mandates to buy health insurance, has said it will also file suit. 
 Their arguments in court are likely to focus on the scope of the mandate and the intrusion of the federal government into state affairs, said David B. Rivkin Jr., a lawyer advising Florida who served in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan and the first President George Bush. 
 ''This really goes to the heart of the constitutional architecture that the framers have devised'' between the government and its citizens, Mr. Rivkin said. He also said that it would represent ''a qualitatively unprecedented expansion of federal authority at the expense of the states.'' 
 Whatever people feel about the worthiness of the bill's goals, ''the Constitution does matter,'' he added.
 Prof. Randy E. Barnett, who teaches constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center and has been critical of the bill, said a constitutional challenge to the individual requirement to purchase insurance is a ''a serious argument that might have success.'' 
 Still, Professor Barnett was careful not to predict that the opponents of the bill would block the legislation completely. He said that even if a court were to strike down the requirement to buy insurance, such a ruling would still be likely to leave other elements of the law in place.
 Professor Balkin of Yale said the mandate did not run afoul of the Constitution because Congress had carefully structured it as a tax -- and taxes are fully within its power. 
 ''People have to pay taxes all the time,'' he said. ''This is not new.''
 Courts generally defer to Congress's taxation decisions and definitions so long as they constitute a ''genuine revenue-raising device,'' Professor Balkin said, and so the health insurance mandate is likely to pass muster. 
 The broad extent of the government's power to regulate interstate commerce has been recognized since the Roosevelt administration. 
 In fact, courts have backed Congress's ability to regulate under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, even when the issues might not seem, at first blush, to even involve interstate commerce at all. 
 That is why Roscoe Filburn, a small farmer in Ohio, had to destroy wheat that exceeded production quotas in a 1942 case, even though he was growing the wheat for his own use and had no intention to sell it. 
 And in 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could prohibit medical marijuana, despite some state laws that allow it. The people who had filed suit argued that they had not bought the marijuana, but the Supreme Court said the Commerce Clause still applied. 
 ''In both cases, the Supreme Court said the cumulative effect of your attempt not to participate in the market has an effect on markets -- and we can regulate it,'' Professor Balkin said.
 Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional scholar and dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law, said the argument that people should have the right not to buy health care was ''rhetorically appealing'' because of its paean to personal freedom. But ''individual freedom not to purchase health care, I think, has no basis in Constitutional law.'' 
 In fact, Professor Chemerinsky added, ''there is no case law, post 1937, that would support an individual's right not to buy health care if the government wants to mandate it.''
 Congress has often taken actions that impinge on personal freedom for a national purpose, he noted, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which required hotels and restaurants to serve minorities. 
 ''If the court stays true to its Commerce Clause jurisprudence of the last 15 years,'' Professor Chemerinsky said, ''I think this will be upheld.''
