HEADLINE: Who Needs a Will? Just About Everyone

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Mark C. Kruse, a 34-year-old vice president of Mercantile Mortgage Bankers in Rye, N.Y., and his 32-year-old wife, Lynn, had no wills. But with two children and a third on the way, they decided it was time to put their wishes in writing and are consulting an estate lawyer.
"I've got my insurance policies in place, my net worth is starting to grow and this is the next step," he said. "I'd feel more comfortable in case anything happens to me and it makes my wife more comfortable." 
 Like Mr. Kruse, millions of Americans do not have wills. In fact, estimates are that over 60 percent of American adults die without a will. Yet experts say that almost everyone -- rich or poor, young or old, working spouse or nonworking spouse -- should have an unambiguous will.
And with a slew of changes in the estate tax laws pending, more people are talking about wills these days. That's because both the Clinton Administration and Congress are considering ways to change the $600,000 amount exempt from Federal estate tax -- with some proposals to lower that amount and others to increase it.
"Dying intestate -- without a will -- is a fate worse than death," said Conrad Teitell, an estate lawyer in White Plains. "If you have property, you need a will if you want to distribute it according to your own wishes."
The role of a last will and testament is to transfer ownership of assets from a testator -- the person who writes the will -- to beneficiaries. Although each state has different laws governing various aspects of a will, the basic reason for spending the time and money to draw it up is the same everywhere: only with a will can you decide, sometimes within limits, who gets your assets.
While a formal will may frequently contain elements that are not found in any other -- "no will has a brother," estate lawyers say -- it can be as simple or as detailed as you want it to be. It should, however, indicate who is to get what legacies, state how remaining assets will be disposed of and establish the process for carrying out your instructions by naming an executor and a guardian for minor children. Of course, you should appoint someone who has already agreed to serve in those roles.
"If you die without a will, an administrator will be appointed by the court," said Ralph M. Engel, a partner in the New York law firm of Rosen & Reade. "You don't get to pick him. And generally that person will have to post a bond."
Frequently a trust, known as a testamentary trust, is included in a will. The commission schedule for trustees named in a will is set by law, ranging from 1.05 percent a year on the first $400,000 to three-tenths of 1 percent a year on amounts over $1 million.
Along with a general reluctance of people to write wills are a number of common misconceptions about them. For example, not everything owned by an individual can be bequeathed to someone else through a will.
"You may have assets in joint name or with designated beneficiaries that are not governed by a will," said John M. McFaul, a lawyer in Mineola, L.I. "That includes jointly owned bank accounts, life insurance policies and retirement plan accounts."
Another widely held misconception, according to Jerome M. Leitner, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, is that you can disinherit a spouse in a will. "But most states provide minimum shares of the estate for surviving spouses, usually one-third or one-half," he said.
Any amount that you leave to a spouse is exempt from Federal estate tax under the so-called marital deduction, but when the surviving spouse dies, estates become subject to this tax beginning at $600,000.
The estate tax rate currently starts at 37 percent and goes up to 50 percent, although the Clinton tax plan calls for increasing the top rate to 55 percent. Many states also impose their own death taxes on estates.
Furthermore, some people do not think about the age of the person named as executor in relation to their own age. "There's no point in an 80-year-old man being an executor for a 30-year-old person," said Maurice S. Spanbock, a partner of Carro, Spanbock, Kaster & Cuiffo, a New York law firm.
Mr. Kruse, the mortgage banker, was made aware of some of these misconceptions when he and his wife met with Mr. McFaul this week. For example, while each spouse named the other as executor, they both appointed his brother as alternative executor in their wills.
"I'm relieved that this is all set," Mr. Krause said. "And I'll be even more relieved on Thursday when we sign the wills."
Standard will forms and computer software for writing a will can be bought inexpensively in a store and completed without using a lawyer. Yet a lawyer's fee is often recouped in the form of advice dispensed or taxes later saved. Fees vary widely from less than $100 for a simple will prepared by a lawyer in a rural area to as much as $10,000 or more for a complex document in a big city.
Once a will has been written, it should be executed by the creator by signing the document in the presence of either two or three witnesses who have no interest in the will. In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, only two witnesses are required.
A will can be changed or revoked at any time. It ought to be reviewed, though, at least every three to five years, when you move to another state or whenever there are major changes in family or overall economic conditions. If appropriate -- and you are legally competent -- you can then write a new will or a codicil modifying your existing will.
It is not a good idea to keep a will in your safe deposit box because the box may be sealed at your death and require court approval to be opened. Leave it in your lawyer's custody and keep a copy at home.

HEADLINE: A 19th Century Balkan Solution

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
None of the attempts to stop the outrage in the former Yugoslavia have even begun to answer the question, then what? There is no real incentive to end the fighting. Threats have been viewed as empty, while the demands to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia would guarantee escalation and probably the spread of war.
There are no defensive weapons in this war. They are all used to seize territory and wreak vengeance. If a truce were reached in Bosnia, massacres would almost surely begin in Kosovo, just as violence erupted in Bosnia as soon as Croatia achieved a tentative calm. 
 The menace of war spreading through the Balkans, perhaps further, continues to mount. The idea that it can somehow be contained while traditional enemies fight to exhaustion is an illusion and a cop-out.
All the proposals to separate combatants, from the Vance-Owen plan to drastic and inhumane suggestions for a huge exchange of populations, would only advance Balkanization, the region's historic handicap. The need is to induce de-Balkanization.
This requires a broad regional context. The one thing everybody in the area agrees upon is the desire to emerge from the backwardness, isolation and underdevelopment that have been their traditional lot and to move toward the European mainstream. Now they are attempting it as rivals, shoving to the head of the line.
All Balkan economies are being hurt by the war. None will attract investment and flourish until there is confidence in security and stability. This can only be achieved by a comprehensive approach, and the initiative must come from outside.
Therefore, it is urgent and propitious to call a grand 19th century style conference, like the 1878 Congress of Berlin, which headed off a Great Power war over the region, to establish a Balkan security regime. The convoking powers must be the U.S., Russia and Europe. Countries to be invited would include the states of former Yugoslavia, Albania, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and probably Hungary. They should be offered either one big security treaty guaranteeing borders and protection of minorities or a web of bilateral defense treaties, in either case to be guaranteed by the sponsoring powers.
Each of these countries has its own ambitions and fears. Disputes are so tightly interwoven that it is futile to try to separate them and deal with each one piecemeal, one step at a time, as current efforts seek to do. A regional system can offer peace and security for all as the reward for concessions and renouncing old aspirations.
There also needs to be an economic development plan, not necessarily detailed but credible as a long-term follow-through to be undertaken in several stages. It must focus on regional development of use to all, not country-by-country projects. This means primarily transportation, communications, energy, a base for tourism.
Past proposals for a Balkan confederation failed, foundering on shifting local alliances and conflicting interests of outside powers. Now, for the first time, the outside powers are not enemies and share a common interest: peace and security in the region.
Russian participation is essential. It would help support Boris Yeltsin's pro-Western policy and reform program and deprive his opponents of the Serbian pretext to mobilize ardent nationalists and nostalgic militarists.
This is not a proposal for a confederation: feelings run too high for that. As the European Community's experience has shown, cooperation doesn't diminish national responsibility and ethnic identity. It makes existing borders acceptable because they lose importance. Little steps have failed, and the prospects are for ever more murderous failures. It is time to think big and boldly -- and it is possible.

HEADLINE: Primer on Health-Care Idea: 'Managed Competition' Plan

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Just another proposal little more than a year ago, the "managed competition" strategy for revamping health care has since been endorsed by many health experts as an ingenious American-style answer to runaway costs.
More important, the approach, which seeks to prune waste with a combination of market forces and Government oversight, has been embraced by President Clinton as he develops proposals for national reform. 
 But now critics are emerging from left, right and center to question everything from the morality to the practicality of the approach. Defenders think they have solid answers. Still, the attacks presage a stormy reception for Mr. Clinton's plan, which is to be unveiled this spring.
 
2 Views of Concept
 If it works the way proponents say, the strategy could make Americans happier, healthier and richer.
"Everyone would have health insurance and you could move from place to place without worrying," said Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, a doctor and health economist who is a chief designer of managed competition. "There would be higher quality care and it would be cheaper."
But critics call this a pipe dream. Managed competition would rob patients of choice and doctors of autonomy, worsen inequality and fail to curb costs to boot, said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, a leader of a group of 5,500 liberal doctors who want a Canadian-style system in which Government pays for all health care. "It's basically an effort to preserve a role for the private insurance companies," she charged.
 
Questions on Cost-Cutting
 Conservatives praise the emphasis on market forces, but lament the infringements on patient choice and the new regulatory bodies that the approach requires. They also question whether it can reduce costs.
"If they end up with an even bigger bureaucracy than today, then the very reasons why they proposed competition will be lost," said Robert E. Moffit, a health expert at the Heritage Foundation, a research organization in Washington. Dr. Moffit and other free-market advocates propose using tax credits or other measures to help individuals buy their own health insurance, without all the intermediaries and regulators called for in managed competition.
The debate is clouded by the daunting complexity of the issues and public unfamiliarity with important concepts -- not least the phrase "managed competition" itself, which the President's advisers now shun.
However the nation proceeds, transforming an overbuilt health system into a sleek machine will involve painful change. What some call waste, whether excess hospital beds, unnecessary operations or redundant insurance brokers, others consider their livelihood.
"We have an extremely wasteful and inefficient system that has been bathed in cost-increasing incentives for over 50 years," said Alain C. Enthoven, a Stanford University business professor and a main theorist of managed competition, in a recent talk. "We badly need a radically more efficient system. That will mean closing hospitals and putting surgeons out of work."
 
The Strategy Of Competition
 Under managed competition, most people in a region, including those now buying insurance on their own, those employed by smaller companies and the uninsured, would be clustered in large, state-organized purchasing groups, or "health alliances" as the President's advisers now call them. These pools, and large employers that made their own arrangements, would bargain with health plans for good prices on a standard set of benefits. Group members would then be offered a choice of several plans.
Tax incentives would encourage people to choose lower-priced plans, but they could pay extra for plans offering extra coverage or more freedom to choose nonplan doctors, for example.
For their part, doctors, hospitals and insurers would join together to offer such plans, most of them similar to health maintenance organizations in which all care, from vaccinations to cardiac surgery, is given for a preset annual fee. These plans would compete for patients, forcing them to continually search for ways to trim waste.
Government agencies would supervise the process, protecting the quality of care and helping the poor join in. Everyone would have access to at least the same basic insurance whether young or old, healthy or sick.
In essence, managed competition seeks to transform the way most Americans buy health insurance, making them more conscious of the price of their coverage, and to change the way care is delivered, making doctors more aware of the costs and benefits of medical decisions.
Even many experts who favor the approach are worried about how aspects may work in practice: Would price competition force plans to scrimp on care? Would the savings be as large as the nation needs?
Advisers to the President have said he will create his own blend of measures. He appears committed to the basic approach of managed competition but plans to add other means of controlling spending.
No one can predict exactly how interacting forces would play out. Proponents say they have built in monitoring and corrective measures to steer things in the right direction. Critics, mindful of how the health system has eluded controls so far, are skeptical.
 
Debate on Freedom To Choose Doctors
 Mindful of the sensitivity of the issue, the President's advisers are calling theirs a pro-choice plan. Many people, though, will unquestionably have less freedom to select their doctors if strong financial pressures are used to push them into health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s. Some people may feel they have been torn from a trusted doctor.
But the issue is not simple. Some 41 million people already belong to H.M.O.'s. Tens of millions more have little choice anyway because they are uninsured, have Medicaid benefits that are scorned by many doctors or live in rural areas where they have few choices. The 35 million elderly people on Medicare may not be pressured to switch, at least in the near term.
There is a chicken-and-egg aspect. If most patients join prepaid plans, most doctors will have to join them too, so many people may be able to follow their current doctor, though problems may arise when family members want doctors from different plans.
In the strategy, people would be offered a choice of several health plans, including some that allow patients to go outside the approved roster at extra cost and, perhaps for an extra premium, an old-fashioned fee-for-service plan allowing use of any doctor. The point is not to curb choice, according to Dr. Enthoven, but to make individuals bear the economic consequences of their choices.
Within an H.M.O., patients are generally free to choose a primary doctor from among many. Dr. Arnold S. Relman, the former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, who supports managed competition with reservations, said he felt the choice issue was overblown. What most people really want, he said, is the freedom to change doctors when they are not satisfied, something they could still do within limits.
"I think we have to disabuse the average American of the idea that you can't get good care unless you have a large menu of doctors out there, look at their qualifications and pick one," he said. "That's not what most people do anyway."
At a different level, some people fear restrictions on their ability to consult outside specialists when confronting serious diseases like cancer. The medical groups should be large enough to allow for second opinions, but patients may have to use their own money for treatment elsewhere. For desperate patients this may seem important -- but discouraging shopping around for hopeful diagnoses or marginal therapies is a key to cost control.
 
Will the Quality Of Care Be Hurt?
 Perhaps the most alarming charge is that medical groups, forced to cut prices in a fierce competition for patients, will shortchange patients -- pressuring doctors to avoid needed tests, for example, or to prescribe a cheaper drug when a more expensive one would help the patient more.
Proponents say they have built in safeguards so that the competition would turn on quality as much as price. They envisage fostering medical groups that would behave like the best of current H.M.O.'s around the country, which tend to leave doctors rather than insurance officials in charge of medical decisions and try to save in part by improving care.
The Government would require plans to collect new data on their medical performance and patient satisfaction. This information would help people compare quality as they shop for plans.
New research would also provide doctors with feedback on their own performance, promoting steady improvements. These measures, Dr. Ellwood said, would be a vast improvement over the present, where opinions about proper treatment vary wildly and neither patient nor doctor can easily judge the quality of care.
But critics question whether tools are available for accurately distinguishing good care from mediocre, and for, in effect, standardizing medical decisions. "If we don't have a serious attempt to develop measures of quality, we'll compete on price and drive care down," said Dr. Robert Brook of the Rand Corporation, a California research institute.
Some like Dr. Relman think nonprofit medical groups would be more likely to protect quality than the investor-owned groups they fear will prevail. But others, including Dr. Ellwood, say they find no evidence that this is necessarily so.
Dr. Ellwood also stresses that H.M.O.'s promoting prudent medicine can avoid the overuse of tests and surgery, which not only drives up costs but can do more harm than good. "Most consumers think more is better in medical care, but it isn't." he said. "You hear about Cadillac medical care. I think that's crazy. The best medical care in the U.S. right now is costing less."
 
Will the Savings Be Large Enough?

In fee-for-service medicine, with insurers simply paying what they are billed, doctors and hospitals have incentives to perform more rather than fewer services. But with preset budgets, providers instead have incentives to save -- hopefully, to concentrate resources where they can do the most good. In managed competition, conservative medical practice would also be encouraged by new national guidelines on uses of medical technology.
Dr. Ellwood said he believed that within four or five years, the strategy would bring health costs in line with the general inflation rate, ending the surge that has created the current crisis. Dr. Enthoven asserts that total health spending, now at 14 percent of the gross domestic product, might even be driven back to 9 percent or 10 percent of the economy.
But many experts, pointing to the march of technology, the inertia in medical habits and the limited success of managed care in holding down costs so far, fear the savings would not be as steep and fast as the country needs.
"They are asking the nation to take a high-stakes gamble," said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution who favors placing limits on spending in the system as a whole. Mr. Clinton apparently agrees, and his advisers are considering ways to impose caps on health spending.
Advocates of a Canadian-style system say managed competition and its continuing role for private insurance companies would only add to paperwork, wasting large sums that could be devoted to care. A Government takeover would save large administrative sums, they say, and could be combined with spending ceilings.
Dr. Enthoven has been reluctant to endorse budget caps and opposes price controls. He argues that arbitrary ceilings or price controls may fail to wring out the worst inefficiencies, something the market can best achieve. Given political realities, he argues, governmental controls are more apt to freeze existing arrangements in place.
From the other side, conservatives like Dr. Moffit charge that the Government boards and mandates called for in managed competition would lead to overregulation, stifling innovation and needed restructuring of the health economy, and would invite costly political meddling with the free market.
But defenders say the new institutions are needed to help individuals accurately compare health plans, avoid the costs of administering multitudes of conflicting plans and approaches, and promote quality and fairness.
 
Quest to Achieve Equality of Care
 Dr. Woolhandler predicted that affluent people would pay extra for plans offering better coverage and freedom to choose the best doctors, while others would be left in cut-rate H.M.O.'s. "You'll see a rigid class stratification in health care," she said.
Some critics also fear that as large companies make their own deals with medical groups, the regional purchasing pools through which others obtain coverage might become second-class.
Several measures in the strategy are aimed at preventing serious inequities, mainly by promoting a high level of care for those who accept the lower-cost plans. Proponents of managed competition say the basic benefits required of all plans should be generous, offering insurance that most people would find ample. Government monitoring should uncover substandard medicine, forcing plans to improve or lose patients. And approved plans would be required to accept all applicants without screening.
Already, Dr. Ellwood said as an example, a growing share of patients at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., are in prepaid plans like those called for in managed competition. Under the new system, these would presumably become available to anyone in the region. "If you can buy better care than that, go ahead," he said.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. and Washington Divided On Aid for the Developing World

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
As a meeting of the International Monetary Fund's main policy-making committee ended, the head of the fund remained in disagreement with the United States and Germany today over a proposal to increase aid for the third world and former Soviet-bloc nations.
Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, has proposed that the fund be allowed to use its special powers to create $50 billion in new money to help end a global economic slump. But he said opposition from several major countries prevented approval at this week's meeting, which brought together finance ministers and central bankers representing the fund's 176 member nations. 
 The money Mr. Camdessus has proposed would be in the form of credits, called special drawing rights, that the member nations would receive from the fund. The nations could then use these credits to purchase goods from other countries.
The Clinton Administration, which has been promoting its own economic stimulus package, found itself in the awkward position of opposing Mr. Camdessus's plan. American officials say the monetary fund already has all the money it needs -- at least for now -- to help the former Communist nations and the third world.
Mr. Camdessus argues that it is time to use the fund's extraordinary powers to create this money, often called "paper gold," because global growth is weak and many poor nations desperately need more currency reserves.
Helmut Schlesinger, the president of Germany's central bank, also opposes issuing this new money, saying it could spur inflation. Mr. Camdessus dismissed this worry because inflationary pressures are low in most of the world.
At the meeting, many of the finance ministers urged other countries to do more to spur global growth. Norman Lamont, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said Germany should move faster to cut interest rates.
He said the most important contribution to growth "would come from an early and successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round," of talks aimed at liberalizing world trade rules sponsored by the 112-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr. Lamont suggested that the monetary fund consider selling some of its gold reserves to help finance increased lending to the world's poorest nations.
Officials from many developing nations countries voiced dismay with the slow rate of growth in the industrial world. "The bad news is that the prospects for economic growth remain anemic," said Manmohan Singh, India's Finance Minister. "There is clearly an urgent need to adopt a concerted global strategy to accelerate the pace of economic growth."

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton's Bipartisan Pitch for Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton tried today to signal a new bipartisan approach to health-care reform, conducting a remarkable private briefing of Senate Democrats and Republicans on the Administration's emerging plan. But the initial lines of partisan division were immediately apparent.
After the two-and-a-half-hour meeting with about about 52 Senators evenly divided between the parties, Republicans paid careful tribute to Mrs. Clinton's courtesy and her willingness to reach out as chairwoman of the Administration's task force on health care. But several Republicans said they had qualms about some of the basics favored by the Administration's health-care planners, including national limits on medical spending and a mandate that employers provide or arrange for health insurance for their employees. 
 "It's a program that has a lot of merit to it," said Senator John Chaffee of Rhode Island, a centrist Republican and one of his party's experts on health. "But there are some quite fundamental differences between that program and what the Republican senators would be for."
Senator Phil Gramm, a conservative Republican of Texas, asserted that the Administration was clearly moving toward wage and price controls in the health-care field. "I hope we can deal with it on a bipartisan basis, but my bottom line is, I want programs that have some chance of working," said Mr. Gramm, a former professor of economics. "We have experience with wage and price controls that go back 5,000 years, and never, ever, have they been used anywhere that has worked."
Still, Senator Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat, told reporters after the briefing today that price controls should be "less of a sticking point, because one of the things that's being very seriously considered by the White House is that cost controls be done on a voluntary basis."
Doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies would be given the opportunity to restrain their own costs, Mr. Rockefeller said, but there would be back-up legislation to impose regulations if the voluntary controls failed.
Participants in the meeting said later that many Republicans were concerned about the heavy regulatory role envisioned by the plan. Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by Ira C. Magaziner and Judith Feder, the two top staff advisers to the task force, sketched out the Administration's proposals for a system built around health insurance purchasing cooperatives. Under the plan, the cooperatives would pool the bargaining power of businesses and individuals to negotiate for health care. Mr. Gramm, signaling the political fight to come as the plan moves from policy debate to Congress, said after the meeting that a health insurance purchasing cooperative "was like a five-legged animal; it may work, but we don't see any of them in nature."
Participants said Mrs. Clinton indicated the task force was looking at a range of options on how to pay for the plan, which would be aimed at insuring that all Americans have access to a basic health package.
 
Opposition to Tax
 But Senator Rockefeller said Mrs. Clinton indicated that a value added tax, a kind of national sales tax that is favored by some Administration officials, was "substantially down the list." Others suggested she was even more negative on it. The idea was floated by several Administration officials earlier this month and prompted much criticism.
Also discussed at the session was the idea, now being reviewed by the Administration, to require employers to contribute a certain percentage of their payrolls to cover the cost of health benefits for their employees, participants said.
The session was also symbolic -- an attempt by the White House to create a public image of bipartisanship after watching its plan to stimulate the economy collapse in bitter partisan maneuvering in the Senate this month. Mrs. Clinton, after the session, briefly took questions with Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, on one side, and Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, on the other.
Mrs. Clinton declared, "health care is an issue that goes beyond politics." Mr. Dole said, "The American people want us to work together."
But the Republican leader outlined a view of the consultative process that was perhaps more expansive than the White House envisioned. "We've been working on a plan, the White House has been working on a plan," Mr. Dole said. "I don't believe anybody has the votes right now, whether its Democrats or Republicans." He added that any final health legislation "ought to be totally bipartisan, not trying to pick off three or four Republicans or whatever."
Mrs. Clinton said today that the health-care task force was on schedule "to coming forward in May, and we intend to do so." For all the talk of Congressional consultation, Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly reiterated her intent to stick to a May deadline for unveiling the plan, despite the pleas from top Democrats in the House to hold off a few weeks, so that it would not collide with an important vote on the President's economic package.

HEADLINE: Most Wanted Man: the County Judge

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EBENSBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
Judge Joseph F. O'Kicki, once the most feared man in this western Pennsylvania town, has become its most wanted fugitive, last seen having his Visa card repossessed by a bank in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia.
The judge fled to Slovenia last month from Ebensburg, where he had been a Judge on the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County for 17 years before his conviction in 1989 on charges of demanding bribes and concessions from banks, lawyers and businesses, as well as sexually harassing his two secretaries. 
 The jury found that Judge O'Kicki had held a campaign fund-raiser to pay off personal debts, demanded what he called loans and commissions from lawyers who appeared in his court as well as payments from employees for promotions. He ordered court officers to chop his firewood, trim his lawns and chauffeur him around.
Two of his secretaries testified that several times the judge had called one or the other into his chambers when he was nude or wearing only yellow bikini underwear. When she refused his sexual advances, one secretary said, he began treating her badly.
 
Demands Put in Writing
 The prosecutor said the judge had become so arrogant that he even put illegal demands in writing. "I think the most bizarre thing he did was to write, on court stationery, to a bank demanding that his auto loan be forgiven or else he would deny them access to the court," said Lawrence N. Claus, the state's chief Deputy Attorney General. The bank reduced the interest rate on the loan and made other concessions.
Some people here celebrate the judge's downfall as poetic justice, while others poke fun at the jurist on the run. At his tavern near the courthouse, Bernie Tirabassi has a lively trade in "Where's the Judge" T-Shirts. Another bar, Dempsey's Irish Pub, offers "Slovenian Buffet" happy hours.
But experts on rural justice say this is neither a laughing matter nor an isolated case of a corrupt judge in the Allegheny Mountains. Of the nation's 55,000 county judges, there are probably hundreds of corrupt ones like Mr. O'Kicki and thousands of others who flagrantly abuse their power, said Maurice D. Geiger, a co-founder of the Rural Justice Center, a public interest group in Montpelier, Vt.
In many small counties he has studied, he said, few lawyers or residents dare complain to the authorities about a judge, appeal a judge's decisions or challenge his re-election. If they do, they risk alienating the judge who might one day rule on their divorces, custody cases or contract disputes.
 
Judicial Review Criticized
 "Judicial review mechanisms are a joke in most states, and that is why you get a guy like O'Kicki in a rural county court," Mr. Geiger said. In Ebensburg, where Judge O'Kicki solicited bribes from lawyers for many years, only one lawyer says he complained to the state Judicial Inquiry and Review Board. The board would not confirm or deny receiving a complaint, but it did not take any public action until after Judge O'Kicki's conviction, when it had the judge suspended.
Judge O'Kicki apparently fled the country to avoid a court hearing on March 8 to determine where he would serve his prison sentence of two to five years and how he would finish paying $249,000 in fines and restitution. The court had already seized $156,000 from him. Judge O'Kicki also faces a second criminal trial that deals with his private investments. The 16 charges range from forging documents to operating a beer distributorship illegally.
Judge O'Kicki was born in nearby Franklin to a very poor family of immigrants from Slovenia. His mother cleaned houses and his father was a stonemason. After his father died and his mother became too ill to work, Joseph became the family's sole wage earner, mining coal after school.
He won a full scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh and, after graduation, served two years in the Navy and enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh Law School. His first marriage, which produced seven daughters, ended in divorce in 1986. He married again and had two sons, and his second wife recently filed for divorce.
In his first foray into politics, in 1970, Mr. O'Kicki narrowly lost an election for the United States House of Representatives. The next year, he won his first 10-year term on the county court here, and in 1981 he was re-elected to a second term. Bar associations gave him high ratings, and he was repeatedly considered for vacancies on the Federal bench in Pennsylvania. Even after his conviction on corruption charges and his suspension from the bench with pay, he ran for re-election in 1991 and lost in a landslide. The judge has always maintained his innocence. "My trial is a classic example of abuse of police power and prosecutorial power," he said after his conviction. "I see conspiracies everywhere." He also said he might be killed in prison by some of the criminals he had sent there. "I have a general fear of going to jail," he said.
Many people here say that before his downfall, the judge treated Ebensburg as his realm, ruling it from the castle-like 111-year-old Cambria County Courthouse, the only architectural remnant of the era when Ebensburg was a resort for such wealthy families as the Vanderbilts and the Carnegies, and the place where Mary Todd Lincoln went to recuperate after her husband's assassination.
The style of the courthouse suited Judge O'Kicki. In June 1988, while a grand jury was investigating 76 charges against him, he had a lavish ceremony to commemorate his swearing in as presiding judge. He wore purple robes and when he entered the magnificent domed courtroom, about 10 trumpeters, standing among the pink marble pillars, played a fanfare.
"It was more like a coronation than a swearing in," said June Fether, a copy editor at the Mountaineer-Herald, a 140-year-old weekly newspaper. In the last month there have been several sightings of Judge O'Kicki in Slovenia, an island of calm amid the blood bath taking place elsewhere in the former Yugoloslavia. Slovenia might not be the place of choice for many fugitives, but Judge O'Kicki apparently went there because his Slovenian ancestry gave him the right to citizenship and a passport. What's more, his two small sons and his second wife, Sylvia Onusic, are in Slovenia.
Ms. Onusic, who recently filed for divorce and changed her last name from O'Kicki to Onusic, is studying the Slovenian health-care system on a Fulbright grant. But Pennsylvania authorities this month charged Ms. Onusic with perjury in connection with her name change as well as six counts of fraud and deception involving the deed to the house she shared with the judge. She did not return telephone calls placed to her in Slovenia.
 
No Treaty With Slovenia
 Authorities are trying to bring the judge home to prison, but the United States does not yet have an extradition treaty with the newly independent Slovenia.
On April 16, Mr. O'Kicki telephoned a television station in Johnstown, Pa., and said he would stay in exile until a higher court agreed to hear his case.
"I will remain in exile until such time as somebody that has the legal authority such as the Supreme Court with its plenary powers, the Senate Judiciary Committee, or some Federal court decides to hear the merits of my case," Mr. O'Kicki said during a taped interview with a local television station, WWCP.
His avenue of appeal seems unlikely, however, since the state Supreme Court has already rejected his earlier request for an appeal.
Mr. O'Kicki refused to say where he was calling from, but made the call after a request for an interview was faxed to his wife in Ljubljana.

HEADLINE: U.S. Escalates War of Words on Japan Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, accused the Japanese Government today of discriminating against American construction companies and supercomputer manufacturers. He threatened trade sanctions if negotiations did not produce changes.
The statements were the latest and clearest sign of the Clinton Administration's strategy to reduce the nation's huge trade deficit with Japan by challenging the status quo on specific trade disputes. 
 The Administration plans to seek negotiations with Japan on the construction issue, but Mr. Kantor would not describe the American strategy for such talks.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, however, told reporters at a breakfast today that in dealing with Japan on many trade issues, "I think only pressure is going to produce results, and only things that are measurable and monitorable are going to produce results."
 Japanese officials have criticized the Clinton Administration's emphasis on setting specific trade targets, contending that this amounts to managed trade. But Mr. Kantor said today that clear gains are needed from trade negotiations to prevent the American people from losing their faith in the international free trade system.
Seiichiro Noboru, the top economics official at the Japanese Embassy here, was particularly critical of Mr. Kantor's decision todayto start the clock on a law that would allow the Administration to impose sanctions unilaterally in 60 days.
"It is highly regrettable that the United States Government made such a decision, because we are not in any way treating American construction companies in a discriminatory manner," Mr. Noboru said. "We will never accept negotiations under duress."
Mr. Noboru said that American construction companies won $330 million worth of Government contracts in Japan last year, while Japanese companies won $325 million worth of American public works contracts.
 
Different Construction Figures
 But figures from the Commerce Department told a different story. They showed that American companies won $189 million of the $700 billion Japanese market for public- and private-sector construction last year, while Japanese companies won $1.5 billion of the $425 billion American market.
The Commerce Department has no figures on the Japanese share of the American public works market because cities and states have not provided the necessary figures. The department has traditionally played a larger role in negotiations with Japan than in talks with other countries.
Mr. Kantor did not commit himself today to imposing trade sanctions on the 61st day if no results were obtained in construction negotiations. But he said that he would use the "trade tools" given to him by law, which would allow him to impose sanctions.
Today's move was especially striking because Mr. Kantor made it on his own initiative. The Bush Administration usually waited until a domestic industry had been lobbying for months before it began threatening sanctions.
 
A Surprise to Builders
 And Mr. Kantor's announcement today caught the American construction industry off guard. Its trade group, Associated Builders and Contractors, and the industry's largest companies all declined to comment.
Mr. Kantor also said today that the Federal Government would begin monitoring Japanese Government bidding procedures for supercomputers in the coming months. If the procedures are not satisfactory, then the United States will begin a formal legal action under an American trade law that allows the United States to impose unilateral trade sanctions if American concerns are not addressed, Mr. Kantor said.
Mr. Noboru said that Japan had complied with a three-year-old agreement on opening its Government market for supercomputers and said that the United States Government had not bought any Japanese supercomputers, while the Japanese Government bought several American supercomputers in recent years.
Mr. Kantor said American companies produced a much more competitive product. The United States holds 84 percent of the European market for supercomputers, where American and Japanese companies compete on a roughly equal footing, he said.
In a separate move, Mr. Kantor said that the Administration had also put Brazil, India and Thailand at the top of its list of countries with which it wants to negotiate agreements providing for greater protection of American copyrights, patents and trademarks.

HEADLINE: 20-Point Rally Fizzles, But Dow Ends Up 2.43

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market rose modestly in fitful trading yesterday, as surging interest rates lured some money away from stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up only 2.43 points, to 3,427.55. An early rally that had sent the Dow 20 points higher lost most of its momentum in the last two hours of trading. Still, other leading stock market indexes rose yesterday. 
 For the week, the Dow was up 13.78 points.
In the bond market yields rose and prices plunged in thin trading. Some traders were concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the size of the 30-year Treasury auction later this month, as well as the uncertain economic outlook. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.92 percent, from 6.88 percent.
 
Gold Stocks Mixed
 The gold stocks did not benefit from the interest-rate jitters, however, as they sometimes do. Gold fell in price for much of the day, losing as much as $4.40 in selling from Australia and the Middle East, but recovered from almost all of its losses. Gold for June delivery closed only 20 cents lower, at $357.20 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Gold stocks were mixed. Newmont Mining, which sold a large block of Newmont stock to the financier George Soros, was the exception, closing up 7/8, to 48 3/4. But Newmont was one of three gold mining companies -- the others were Echo Bay Mines and Homestake Mining -- whose stock assessments were lowered to "underperform" from "hold" by a Kidder Peabody mining analyst.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.98 point, to 243.46. Volume on the Big Board was again moderate at 247.5 million shares, compared with Thursday's 249.8 million shares. Winning stocks on the Big Board outnumbered losers by 1,210 to 670.
The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.30 point, to 440.19, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.97 points, to 661.42. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.21 points, to 420.96
The Dow was lifted yesterday by Allied Signal, which rose 1 3/4, to 65 1/4. Allied, a diversified manufacturer for the automotive and aerospace industries, said earlier in the week that it expected earning to increase.
But the Dow tended to be dragged down by Texaco, Sears and General Electric, each of which dropped 1 point.
The S.& P. 500 was lifted by a wide variety of stocks, led by Johnson & Johnson, which reported stronger first-quarter earnings Thursday. It rose 1 1/4, to 43 5/8. The leading S.& P. 500 groups were diversified health-care companies, including Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories; insurance companies, like American International Group and Aetna; and household products, like Procter & Gamble and Clorox. But no particular group provided strong support for the S.& P. 500.
Once again, Telefonos de Mexico topped the most-active list on the Big Board at 4.46 million shares, compared with Thursday's 10.3 million-share volume. Its American depository receipts have been buffeted by poor first-quarter results and concerns over passage of the North American Free trade Agreement, but they had been lifted by a stock buyback program announced Thursday. Telmex closed down 1/8, to 47 7/8.
At a 3.1 million-share volume, Philip Morris was the second most active stock following the announcement Thursday that the company was willing to cut prices further for its Marlboro cigarettes, if necessary. Philip Morris closed down 1/4, to 47. The Limited Inc., the specialty retailer, was the third most active stock on the Big Board at 3.07 million shares on no discernible news. It closed down 3/4, to 22 1/8.
In Tokyo, stocks moved sharply higher yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues surged 464.61 points, or 2.27 percent, to 20,919.18.

HEADLINE: March Consumer Spending And Factory Orders Fell

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Consumer spending fell in March for the first time in seven months and orders to factories slumped, too, the Government said today. Personal income rose, but mostly because of huge farm-subsidy payments.
"We are basically just mired in a slow-growth economy," said Lawrence Chimerine, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
 Personal-consumption spending declined two-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.23 trillion, the Commerce Department said. Incomes rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to an annualized $5.26 trillion, but that increase was bolstered by the largest monthly farm subsidy payment in nearly six years.
The department said new orders to factories dropped 1.5 percent, the worst decline since August.
 
Fewer Takers for Big Items
 Orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items like cars and computers -- dropped 3.4 percent, the largest decline since December 1991. Orders for nondurable goods like food and clothing were up seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Much of the decline came in aircraft orders, but even excluding transportation, factory orders edged down one-tenth of 1 percent.
Today's reports underscored earlier statistics showing that economic growth has slowed drastically this year after reaching a five-year high during the last three months of 1992.
On Thursday, the Government reported that the gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services produced in the United States -- grew at an unexpectedly slow annual rate of 1.8 percent in the first quarter, down sharply from 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992.
 
Economist Is Puzzled
 David Berson, an economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association, explained, "We couldn't keep up the pace of growth we saw in the fourth quarter, not with the relatively weak job and income growth we are getting."
The largest component of incomes --wages and salaries -- increased a scant one-tenth of 1 percent after falling two-tenths of a point a month earlier.
The Clinton Administration has used the gloomy numbers to argue for its economic-stimulus package. Republicans contend that the fear of new taxes is discouraging consumers and business.
Many economists focused on income growth. "When we say we can't figure out why people are so pessimistic, well this is why," said Evelina M. Tainer of Prime Economic Consulting in Chicago. "Wages and salaries just aren't growing."
Still, the rise in March overall income -- including such things as waiters' tips and managers' bonuses -- was the largest since a 1 percent advance in December. It followed increases of one-tenth of a percent in February and five-tenths of a percent in January.
Two conflicting special factors influenced the personal-income statistics: a $3.3 billion farm-subsidy payment, the largest since October 1987, and the cost of damage to uninsured housing caused by severe Eastern storms. Excluding special factors, incomes rose two-tenths of 1 percent in March and four-tenths of 1 percent in February.
 
More Paid Out to Jobless
 Government transfer payments, including unemployment benefits, rose in March. Interest income was down.
Real disposable income -- income adjusted for inflation after taxes -- rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March after a two-tenths of 1 percent decline the month before.
Consumer spending fell four-tenths of a point for durable goods and 1.1 percent for nondurable goods. It rose two-tenths of a percent for services.
The combination of rising income and falling spending produced a big increase in the American savings rate -- to 5.4 percent of income, the best in 10 months, from 4.5 percent in both January and February.

For Lucky Students, It's All Work, Work, Work

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
After American high school teachers die and go to heaven, they may find themselves in one of China's best schools teaching shiny-eyed dynamos like Ellen Y. Zhu.
Classroom violence? That's what happens to frogs in biology class. 
 Student discipline? A problem, yes, particularly on Saturday evenings, when children are inclined to take a few hours off to watch television.
Teen-age sex? Not much happens.
"Romance is not banned, but the school does not encourage us to fall in love so early," Miss Zhu, 18, said with a primness to drive a stake through the hearts of her male classmates. "We should concentrate our energies on school work."
 
English in Second Grade
 Miss Zhu, by the way, was speaking in fluent English, without a single "you know" thrown in, the kind of language that would bring a fond gleam to the eye of an English teacher in an American high school. Here in Shanghai, students begin studying English in the second grade.
China's economic liberalization is well known in the West. But if China manages to shrug off centuries of poverty and emerge as a major international power, another factor will be the top-notch education that some lucky students are getting.
In the cities, elementary school children take tests to determine which school they get into. The best institutions have computer rooms, language labs and fine laboratories, all overrun with the kind of youngsters who do terrible things to grade curves.
Take Jessica J. Cao, who like Miss Zhu is a student at the Shanghai Foreign Languages School, where most students adopt English names as part of their effort to understand Western culture. The faculty includes three foreign English teachers, who stay for a year at a time, and this fall the school will send its second student to Harvard College in three years.
 
Classes, Classes, Classes
 Miss Cao wakes up at 6:15 each morning and reads from an English novel after breakfast. Classes begin at 8 and continue, with a lunch break, until 4:30. Then there is a two-hour break for dinner and homework, then classes from 6:30 to 9.
Miss Cao then has 30 minutes to prepare for bed in the student dormitory, where girls are housed up to 12 to a room, before lights go out at 9:30. To dispel any suggestion that she and her classmates are automatons, she emphasizes that the students do not go out with the lights.
"We talk among ourselves, about everything," Miss Cao said. "Sometimes we listen to a radio and dance in the darkness."
School lasts half a day on Saturday, and Miss Cao then goes home to spend the rest of the weekend with her family.
 
Even TV Is Good for Them
 "On Saturday night I make up for all the time in school and watch television," Miss Cao said. "There's always an English-language movie on, and I like to watch that."
Top students in major cities give up their Saturday afternoons and Sundays to attend "Olympic Schools" for special instruction in mathematics, physics, chemistry and other subjects.
Zhu Yanhong, a 17-year-old chemistry ace, is one of the compulsive overachievers. She lives at home but is now preparing for a science contest, which means that she leaves for school at 6:20 A.M. and returns 12 hours later -- just in time for an hour of homework. On top of the homework, Miss Zhu puts in a couple of hours of academic work that the teacher has not even assigned.
"My father and mother always tell me that I must study hard, so most of my time is occupied by my homework," Miss Zhu said, acknowledging that she does also sneak a bit of time to enjoy English pop music.
Miss Zhu is a student at the Shanghai No. 3 Girls School, one of the few single-sex high schools. The school is so competitive that only one-sixth of the applicants can be enrolled.
One reason many students are so driven may be that increasingly they are only children, "little emperors," the fruits of China's strict family-planning policies. Two parents and four grandparents push each child to perform well.
"They figure they're the center of their family," Luo Peiming, the Foreign Language School principal, said of the only children. "The parents bring them food and help them do everything. The parents act as maids to their kids. They even wash their children's hair."
Parents buy pianos for their little emperors, arrange English tutors, even try to bribe the best kindergartens to admit their children so they can get into a fine university a dozen years later.
 
Meanwhile, Out in the Villages
 While it is clear that China's high schools produce some first-rate graduates, the system also raises fundamental questions of fairness. Instead of trying to equalize educational opportunities, as one might expect a Communist Party to do, China is creating an ever larger chasm between the educational haves and have-nots.
Most schools are still shabby buildings in the villages, where peasant children sit jammed on rickety chairs and shriek out their lessons in unison. Public education is not free in China, even in elementary schools, and in rural areas many pupils -- particularly girls -- drop out in elementary school because their parents cannot afford the $10 or $20 annual tuition.
Nationally, only 13 percent of children even enter high school. In 1992 the drop-out rate in junior high schools actually rose, by 6 percent.
The state offers a subsidy of about $200 a year per pupil to the best high schools in Shanghai, but many village schools get nothing. While China is producing a crop of brilliant scientists at its best schools, it is also producing another generation of semi-illiterates from its rural schools.
Is this fair? The Shanghai students squirm a bit, but say it is.
"If we gave the same amount of money to the rural provinces, we could support a lot more students," conceded Shirley Q. C. Zhao, an 18-year-old at the girls school. "But their facilities and teachers aren't very good, so it's not much use to try and teach them so much. It's better to train us."

Israel Boycott Violation Is Top Issue for Baxter

BYLINE: By RICHARD RINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 30

 BODY:
The main topic of today's annual meeting of Baxter International Inc. was not sales and profits but the fallout from the company's admission that it had violated a Federal law against cooperating with the Arab economic boycott of Israel.
The chairman and chief executive of the medical products supplier, Vernon R. Loucks Jr., has come under pressure to resign since the guilty plea earlier this month. Even student groups at Yale University, where Mr. Loucks is a trustee, have called for him to step down. But he received a strong vote of confidence from shareholders and a large customer today. Still, at least one big customer has threatened to cut off its orders. 
 Most shareholders cheered and applauded Mr. Loucks several times during the meeting here in the auditorium of the Art Institute of Chicago. The most demonstrative applause came after Mr. Loucks rejected one shareholder's demand that he resign over the boycott incident, which he acknowledged had "placed a mark on our company that we deeply regret."
 
Customer Reactions
 Another vote of support came from American Healthcare Systems Inc., Baxter's largest single customer. Monroe Trout, chairman and president of the hospital management company based in San Diego, told shareholders that American would continue doing business with Baxter.
"I am not going to run away from Baxter," said Mr. Trout, whose company bought $648 million in goods and services in 1992 from Baxter.
But another of Baxter's biggest customers, Premier Hospitals Alliance of Westchester, Ill., has threatened to cut off its annual purchases of $250 million. Premier, which operates 50 hospitals nationwide, of which about a third are sponsored by Jewish organizations, was to meet with Baxter's outside directors after the shareholders' meeting.
The outcome of the meeting with the Premier officials could not be determined. But Mr. Loucks told shareholders that the matter with Premier was "something we can work out."
Earlier this week, a Premier spokeswoman said the company would not demand that Mr. Loucks resign.
 
Sought Removal From List
 Mr. Loucks and Baxter have come under fire since the company pleaded guilty in early April to a single felony charge relating to the company's efforts in 1988 to be removed from the Arab blacklist of companies that do business in Israel.
While it is not illegal for companies to try to get off the blacklist, Baxter admitted overstepping the law by providing Syrian officials with information about a business it operated in Israel. G. Marshall Abbey, who led the initiative, resigned as Baxter's vice president and general counsel. Baxter and Mr. Abbey were fined $6.5 million, which the company paid.
Mr. Loucks tried to distance himself today from any illegal activities. He said he had relied on the efforts of Mr. Abbey and independent counsel to be removed from the blacklist.
"It was always my belief that we were acting within the law," Mr. Loucks said. He said he was unaware of any impropriety until a meeting later with Justice Department officials who investigated the case.
Mr. Loucks said Baxter had taken several steps to avoid a repetition of the situation. Those steps include a review by the board's public policy committee of Baxter's ethics initiatives and policies and the creation of a corporate responsibility office. That office will be responsible for, among other things, ethics training and reporting on ethics violations.
Several matters concerning Baxter's guilty plea remain unresolved. The Defense Department is reviewing whether it should continue to buy from Baxter. Also, the New York City Employees Retirement System, which owns about 947,000 Baxter shares, has asked Baxter for a report on the boycott incident.
The city agency also wants assurances that "appropriate actions" will be taken against any Baxter employee "responsible for the transaction" that led to the violation of the Federal statute.

HEADLINE: Reversing Field, Bond Prices Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Despite signs of slowing economic growth, prices of Treasury bonds fell sharply yesterday and yields jumped.
Many traders were surprised by a sharp reversal during the day in the movement of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds, which led the broader market decline. In the morning, the bond's price was up as much as 11/32 point, but it ended the day losing 19/32 of a point. Volume was light. 
 The 30-year bond yield rose to a three-week high of 6.92 percent, from 6.88 percent late Thursday.
A variety of factors have weighed on the market recently, including uncertainty about the size of the 30-year Treasury auction scheduled in May and the Clinton Adminstration's ability to cut the budget deficit.
But the size of the losses in Treasury securities left many perplexed. "I can take some guesses," said Alan Levenson, a money market economist with UBS Securities, "but from an economist's perspective, it's hard to come up with a good explanation."
If not for the recent bearish tone in the market, bonds might have been expected to rally on the negative economic news released yesterday. Weak economic growth is usually taken to mean scant prospects of inflation, and low interest rates. That, in turn, drives up bond prices, as the price of bonds and similar securities move inversely to their yields.
Traders also focused yesterday on recent data from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago, which said that its April index of manufacturing activity fell to 54.3, from 60.7 in March.
 
Weak Economic Data
 In addition, the Government said that factory orders slumped 1.5 percent in March, the largest drop in seven months. Other economic statistics also pointed to negative performance. The data seemed to reduce the chance that the Federal Reserve system would raise interest rates.
But prices drifted down anyway, amid growing market nervousness. In the afternoon, as rumors of big sell orders circulated, the 30-year bond's decline accelerated.
Of particular concern are plans by the Treasury to announce details on Wednesday of its regular quarterly refunding, a series of auctions to be held in May, that will give definite signs of how much it will pare its issuance of longer-term securities.
With interest rates higher for longer-term debt, it is generally cheaper for the Government to offer shorter-term securities. Many traders hope that the Treasury will halve its annual issuance of 30-year bonds, now about $35 billion, and eliminate the seven-year bond issue.
Yesterday, shorter-term Treasuries were 1/32 point lower and intermediate maturities fell 1/8 point to 5/16 point, Telerate reported. The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, lost 2.74 to 1,295.14.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at 2.89 percent, while the rate on the six-month bills rose to 2.97 percent, from 2.96. The rate on one-year bills rose to 3.14 percent, from 3.13 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose to 3 1/8 percent from 215/16 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds slipped 3/32 to 100 7/8 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity edged up to 5.96 percent from 5.95 percent.

HEADLINE: Panel Named To Plan Help For Airlines

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
President Clinton and Congressional leaders have spurned both consumer groups and the leading airlines in naming the 15 members of a bipartisan commission charged with recommending measures to revitalize the ailing American airline industry.
The President asked the commission Thursday night to "take a step back" from the debate over why the industry lost $10 billion in the last three years, and "examine the context in which the aviation industry operates." 
 "To the extent the commission can help us understand how we got to where we are today, and provide a vision for a competitive future, it will have rendered an invaluable service," the President said.
 
 
Authorized by Congress
 The chairman of the commission, authorized by an act of Congress signed by the President on April 7, will be Gerald L. Baliles, a former Governor of Virginia. The President described Mr. Baliles as "an old friend" who "recognized that aviation is the lifeblood of commerce in a global economy, and made it an important part of his state's competitiveness strategy."
"That is what we must do now at a national level," the President said.
The commission members are drawn from airline unions and management, as well as from finance and academia. Members include Felix G. Rohaytn, a Manhattan investment banker who played a leading role in the rescue of New York City from its fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
Unrepresented, however, were any consumer groups or any of the nation's big airlines. The commission is required to make its recommendations within 90 days.
Noting the absence of consumer groups, David Stempler, counsel for the International Airline Passenger Association, said, "The Administration and the Congress have loaded the commission with people who are part of the problem and are not likely to be part of the solution."
Mr. Stempler said that the omission of consumer advocates showed that the Administration thought that the airlines "are run for the benefit of airline employees, airports, aviation manufacturers and financial institutions," rather than for travelers.
 
 
Proposals to Be Reviewed
 The commission is expected to study proposals including loan guarantees and tax relief for airline companies and the lifting of restrictions on foreign ownership of United States airlines. Other proposals include examining the bankruptcy laws that have kept several airlines aloft, to the chagrin of more successful rivals; enhancing overseas access for United States airlines, and reducing barriers to competition, including frequent-flier programs and computer reservation systems that favor the airlines that own them.
The White House and the leaders of the Senate and the House each named five members. In addition, there are 11 ex-officio members, including Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers; five Senators, and five House members.
Following are the appointees to the commission:
 
 Appointed by the White House
Bette B. Anderson, president, Kelly, Anderson & Associates, a management consulting firm in Washington; Gerald L. Baliles, a partner in Hunton & Williams, a Richmond law firm; Sylvia A. de Leon, a partner in Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, a Washington law firm; Herbert D. Kelleher, chief executive of Southwest Airlines, Dallas; Gina F. Thomas, managing attorney for international and regulatory affairs for Federal Express, Memphis.
 
 Appointed by the Senate leadership
Charles Barclay, president of the American Association of Airport Executives, Washington; Robert F. Daniell, chief executive of United Technologies, West Hartford, Conn.; Felix G. Rohaytn, managing partner at Lazard Freres, New York; Russell W. Meyer Jr., chairman and chief executive of Cessna Aircraft, Wichita, Kan.; Abraham D. Sofaer, partner in Hughes, Hubbard & Reed, a Washington law firm.

Hopes of German Rate Cuts Raise Dollar Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Renewed hopes for significant reductions in German interest rates drove the dollar modestly higher against the German mark in erratic trading yesterday.
Gold ended slightly lower after surging more than $5 an ounce in the last two days in New York. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 20 cents an ounce to $356.50. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $355.80 an ounce, off 10 cents.
 
British Official's Remarks
 Traders largely focused on comments by Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont of Britain that the German central bank should step up its rate reductions. 
 But the dollar was mixed against other European currencies and posted only slight gains against the Japanese yen, in part because Mr. Lamont said that he was not bothered by the yen's recent rally.
Mr. Lamont also said the International Monetary Fund might consider selling modest amounts of its gold reserves, but the remarks were not specific enough to push gold futures prices off their highs for the day.
 
Bundesbank Cuts a Rate
 The dollar initially jumped in European trading after the Bundesbank, the German central bank, made an unexpectedly large cut of half a percentage point in its three-day bill rate. This led traders to speculate that the bank's policy-making council would make more significant rate cuts when it meets on Thursday.
Lower German interest rates would hurt the value of the mark by diverting money elsewhere. But the mark rebounded against the dollar after the Bundesbank issued a statement that the rate cut was not abnormal.
The dollar regained the lead in early afternoon New York trading when Mr. Lamont said in Washington that he favored more German interest cuts. He also said he expected European nations to cut rates further.
In Europe, the dollar rose to 1.5880 German marks from 1.5825 marks late Thursday. Later in New York, the dollar advanced to 1.5850 marks from 1.5790 marks Thursday.
Among other currencies, the British pound edged up to $1.5733 in late afternoon trading in New York, compared with $1.5725 on Thursday.
Also in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 111.10 yen yesterday afternoon, up slightly from 110.95 yen on Thursday.

Posner Deal Expected to Revive DWG Units

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
Arby's Inc. and the Royal Crown Cola Company, two units of the DWG Corporation that had suffered under the management of the financier Victor Posner, should start showing signs of vigor under new ownership, industry analysts and investors say.
"The recognition now that they are adequately financed makes a big difference," said Michael A. Connor, a money manager of Fahnestock & Company, whose clients own 400,000 shares of DWG. 
 Last week, the Trian Group, a New York investment firm headed by Nelson Peltz and Peter May, both 50, bought a controlling stake in DWG for $72 million from Mr. Posner and his affiliates as part of a settlement of a long-running lawsuit. Shareholders contended that Mr. Posner had enriched himself and family members at the company's expense.
As part of the deal, DWG, based in Miami Beach, Fla., refinanced $405 million in debt and received $10 million through the sale of stock to Merrill Lynch & Company and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.
As a result of lower interest costs because of the refinancing and other economies, Mr. Connor said he expected DWG to have a $50 million increase in earnings, to $2.50 a share, next year. "Some of these businesses were handicapped by a shortage of capital," he said. "These are all elements of the penalties that the Posner regime imposed on operations."
For the year ended April 30, 1992, DWG had a loss of $7.5 million on sales of $1.27 billion.
If shareholders approve, the parent company will be renamed Triarc, a combination of Trian, Arby's and Royal Crown.
On Tuesday, DWG appointed these managers for its four core companies:
*John C. Carson, 47, a former president of Cadbury Beverages, was named president and chief executive of Royal Crown Cola.
*Donald L. Pierce, 48, a former president of Pepsico Inc.'s Hot 'n Now hamburger chain, was appointed president and chief executive of Arby's.
*Ronald D. Paliughi, 49, a former senior vice president of AP Propane, was named president and chief executive of the National Propane Corporation.
*E. Douglas Kingsmore, formerly the executive vice president of DWG's textile company, the Graniteville Corporation, was named president and chief executive.
In an interview, Mr. Carson said, "I know the intention of the new company is to put more resources into the business," but he could not specify exact plans. He said Royal Crown's bottlers needed marketing and advertising support. R.C., known in the industry for introducing the first diet soda, has seen its market share slip to 2.1 percent last year from a peak of 5 percent in 1979, according to Beverage Digest.

HEADLINE: Robert H. Brimberg, Executive Of Securities Business, Dies at 64

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Robert H. Brimberg, a Wall Street executive who was known for the lunches he held so that major investors could meet each other and talk about their business, collapsed and died at a restaurant in Manhattan Thursday night. He was 64.
The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said. 
 He headed Brimberg & Company, a small securities business by Wall Street standards, but he was legendary for his lunches and his Christmas parties.
He was a big man and in "The Money Game," a 1967 best seller about Wall Street by Adam Smith, Mr. Brimberg was portrayed under the name of "Scarsdale Fats."
His personality and the stature of those attending his lunches were the main attractions for guests. His pointed questions and sometimes brusque manner cut through platitudes and kept the meetings lively and popular.
"The price of admission was that you had to have something to say," said H. Erich Heinemann, an economist. "He ran the only true salon, in the 17th-century French meaning, for the investment community."
Arther Lipper 3d, an investment banker and friend who was dining with Mr. Brimberg when he died in a Chinese restaurant in midtown, said that Mr. Brimberg "was the intellectual peer of those he dealt with, but because he did not feel the need to be intellectually competitive with them, he could get people to talk about what they were doing."
Mr. Brimberg graduated from Yale with a degree in English. He started his career on Wall Street after his father, a furrier, bought a small Wall Street firm because he thought the fur business was declining.
Soon afterward, Mr. Brimberg recognized that such institutions as pension funds, bank trust departments and mutual funds were emerging as the major forces in the stock market. Unable to offer research reports like larger firms, Mr. Brimberg began holding lunches in a spartan rented room on Broad Street.
His firm benefited from the lunches because major investors, out of gratitude for information gleaned through him, would use Brimberg & Company to handle some of their trades.
Mr. Brimberg is survived by his wife, Dorothy Anne, and three sons, Frederick of New York, Richard of Greenwich, Conn., and Christopher of North Miami, Fla., and one grandchild.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
When a Star Stumbles, Investors Are Bruised

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
HOLLYWOOD publicists were only the first, long ago, to discover the economic power of celebrity. Mutual fund groups are trying to catch up.
"You can now join the client list of Fayez Sarofim," boomed a recent advertisement for the Dreyfus Appreciation Fund. In a movie poster layout, the credit list showed that the Ford Motor, Rice University and Oregon State pension funds have been Sarofim clients for decades. 
 Most of these clients have enjoyed returns far better than the Standard & Poor's 500 benchmark. But the smaller investors attracted to his Dreyfus mutual fund have watched their advantage disintegrate. Since Mr. Sarofim took over at the end of 1990, the fund bested the S.& P. 500 by 8 percentage points in 1991, then fell 3.3 points behind last year. So far this year, it has lagged the S.& P. by almost 8 percentage points.
The fund's recent retreat illustrates the risks of betting that a star money manager will continue to shine. The picks that made Mr. Sarofim a hero through the late 1980's -- the consumer and drug stocks -- have fallen into decline.
Mr. Sarofim is by no means the only money manager seized by the marketing wizards. By night, Rockefeller Center's Rainbow Room might feature Rosemary Clooney crooning or Tommy Tune dancing; by day, several weeks ago, it was Peter Lynch lunching, with the news media reveling. Mr. Lynch no longer manages a Fidelity fund, but still looms large in its advertisements.
Mr. Sarofim's case is special, however, because lately the performance that earned such renown has withered. Mr. Sarofim, understand, is the investment world's leading consumer of brand names. Through his firm, based in Houston, he is the largest institutional investor in such stocks as Philip Morris, Pepsico and Procter & Gamble, as well as in such drug issues as Pfizer and Merck.
Such companies led the market's advance into the early 1990's. Year after year, they raised their prices faster than inflation, no matter what the economy's state.
Their retreat started last year, as investors migrated to cyclical issues. Beginning in August, drug stocks cracked under Bill Clinton's repeated attacks on medical costs.
Then came Marlboro Friday, early last month, when Philip Morris cut the price of its leading brand to meet competition from private and discount labels. The stock collapsed, with the damage soon spreading to other name-brand companies.
Just last week, it was Tambrands' turn. The company's stock, a Sarofim favorite, fell $5.50, to $45.375, last week, on word that the Tampax brand, dominant for half a century, has been losing market share.
Dreyfus says that money continues to flow into the fund Mr. Sarofim manages. But with other institutions fleeing many of his favorite stocks, the small fry might be wondering whether to swim away from his fund.
Many financial advisers counsel patience in such cases. When managers with superior long-term records begin to waver, they say, it's worth giving them a year or two to straighten out. Wall Street fashions, as changeable as Seventh Avenue's, can penalize money managers whose long-range strategies remain sound.
Investors who kept their money in funds that buy small technology stocks had to endure several dry years to enjoy the run-up that began in late 1990. Sarofim clients who left him in the early 1980's as energy stocks, then his core holdings, staggered, missed out on their comeback.
Mr. Sarofim's conservative investment style -- buy and hold, and hold, and hold -- keeps turnover and expenses low. In 1990, the Dreyfus Appreciation Fund's portfolio turned over almost twice. In 1991, the first full year under his management, turnover was a mere 13 percent.
His stability compounds his gains. Mutual fund managers who regularly sell stocks to take their gains have to pay out taxable distributions.
But what if the downfall of consumer growth stocks is no investor whim, rather a long-term recognition that cigarettes, processed cheese and tampons aren't so glamorous? Investors sometimes do wring out vast industries. As smartly as banking stocks have rebounded, analysts doubt they will return to the premium price ratios, compared with their earnings, that they enjoyed decades ago.
Many analysts say that Marlboro and other brands have lost huge chunks of their value, as shoppers switch to generics or private labels at half the price. The President himself has vilified drug companies and vowed to control their prices.
Mr. Sarofim says that consumer- goods producers still have vast growth prospects abroad. Drug makers, he says, can aid the battle against medical costs because their medicines allow patients to avoid expensive hospital stays. "To go from the most admired to the most hated is a little incongruous," Mr. Sarofim said. "The markets have discounted most of the negative news."
His fund's investments in oil stocks and such industrial issues as General Electric and Ford have buffered his recent losses. But he agrees with some institutional clients that his style might be best for those who can spread their money among a host of managers.
Jay Fewel, who oversees stock investments for Oregon's pension fund, plans to retain Mr. Sarofim as one of 16 managers. "Much as a manager will diversify among securities, we diversify among fund managers," he said. "If our entire stable of managers had his focus, there would be some concern."
As there might now be among individual investors unwilling to follow 16 mutual funds.

HEADLINE: Blacks Accuse Jews In 'Show Boat' Revival

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 28

 BODY:
"Show Boat Hurts," reads one picketer's sign. Others say: "Stop This Racist Play" and "Terrible Use of Taxpayers' Money." A statement from the Coalition to Stop Show Boat declares that "the entire play, its plot and characterizations demean black life and culture."
A score of people, mainly blacks, are on the sidewalks around a nearly completed performing arts center in the Toronto suburb of North York. The center's three theaters, one with treelike pillars merging into a gold-domed ceiling and another modeled on Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, and a 5,000-square-foot art gallery make the arts complex one of the largest in North America and the first to be built in Canada since the 1960's. 
 The $51 million North York Center for the Performing Arts is not scheduled to open until October, but it is already mired in controversy over the choice for its inaugural production, a new $8 million staging of the 1927 musical "Show Boat."
The dispute has challenged assumptions about one of the classics of the American theater and stirred tensions between this city's blacks and Jews.
A leader of the protest, Stephanie Payne, a school trustee in North York, publicly condemned "Show Boat," both the musical and the novel on which it was based, as an example of "hate literature" directed against black people. She also said Jews were responsible for most of the works that denigrate blacks.
Arnold A. Auguste, the publisher of Toronto's black newspaper, Share, lamented the Jewishness of the show's creators and its current producers. He said that of all people, Jews "must know what it is like to be reviled, denigrated and to suffer abuse."
"I feel my people's pain just as surely as you feel yours," he said in one column addressed to Jews.
But in a letter to Mr. Auguste, Gerda Frieberg, chairwoman of the Canadian Jewish Congress, angrily asked how Jewishness was relevant.
"We find it abhorrent that in the process of upholding your community's interests as you see them, you also have seen fit to besmirch, malign and wound our community."
"Show Boat," with music and lyrics by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, was written in 1927 from a book by Edna Ferber. The musical has often been revived and was made into films twice, in 1936 and in 1951. This year it was chosen for a commemorative stamp by the United States Postal Service for the esteemed place it occupies in the history of musical theater. The cast of the North York production is to include Elaine Stritch and Robert Morse. The director will be Hal Prince and the choreographer Susan Stroman. Garth H. Drabinsky, its producer, said he hoped to take it to Broadway next year.
 
What's in the Show
 The story about life on a Mississippi steamboat at the turn of the century provides a picture of the lowly status of blacks and describes some consequences of racial hatred. Mr. Hammerstein, a liberal of his day, has been described by Miles Kreuger, who wrote a history of the show, as highly sensitive to the racial issue.
The musical helped make the artistic reputation of Paul Robeson, one of its early stars, whose rendition of "Ol' Man River" is considered one of the great moments of American theater. The politically active Robeson became a highly visible critic of discrimination.
But some prominent blacks in Toronto contend that the show romanticizes a dehumanizing era in black history, reinforcing negative images and stereotypes that are used to undermine black people. And they are critical of its selection as the vehicle for the opening of a publicly supported arts center in a community where blacks are a significant and growing proportion of the population.
Some 350,000 blacks live in Canada, about half of them in Toronto, according to 1991 census figures. The Jewish population was nearly identical, numbering 370,000, and about half of them live in Toronto as well. The population of Canada is 27 million.
" 'Show Boat' is not a true reflection of black history," said Jeff Henry, a professor of drama at York University and the founder of black theaters in both Toronto and Montreal. His Fountainhead Theater here closed during the 1990 recession, but his Black Theater Workshop in Montreal is still active.
 
By Whites, for Whites
 " 'Show Boat,' " he said in an interview, was "created by white people for white people at a time when black writers like Langston Hughes of the Harlem Renaissance were trying to define black dreams, hopes and ambitions."
Among the faults he found with the musical was its portrayal of blacks as "civil and accommodating" when in fact during the 40-odd years covered by the story of "Show Boat," "there were all kinds of protests and uprisings."
Angela Lee, the general manager of the Canadian Artists' Network: Black Artists in Action, a Toronto-based advocacy group, said the musical propagated a stereotype that was damaging for young black people.
"The portrayal of blacks as shuffling, mumbling, dancing, singing caricatures enhances the picture of a people who are not only happy in their condition but obviously better off with somebody looking after them," she said, adding that "slavery, Reconstruction and the post-Reconstruction period in the Americas was not about singing, dancing and joyful celebration."
Not all prominent blacks have been critical of the show. "Why boycott it?" asked former Lieut. Gov. Lincoln Alexander of Ontario. "How can I judge something if I don't go and see it?"
The Rev. Eustace Meade of the First Baptist Church of Toronto said he would be among the first to watch the show. "I have my own dignity and 'Show Boat' or whatever cannot demean me."
 
A Benefit Suffers
 Yet the strength of the negative feelings here was expressed in the resignation of 19 of the 22 members of the United Way's Black and Caribbean Fund-Raising Committee to protest the charity's participation in a benefit performance of the musical in October.
The "skeptical atmosphere, opposing views and tense climate" related to United Way's involvement in "Show Boat" make it "impossible to proceed with the planned fund-raising activities for the charity with the black community," said Delores Lawrence, vice president of the Black Business and Professional Association and a former United Way chairwoman.
Mr. Drabinsky, the producer, said he was convinced that the protest would blow over and had no second thoughts about the choice. "We needed something to show off this space musically that had shades of major operatic demands," said Mr. Drabinsky, president of the Live Entertainment Corporation of Canada, which has a long- term exclusive management agreement covering the three York Center theaters.
"There was nothing on the horizon that was available to us, so we went back to the canon of musical art," he said.
While he respects the right to protest, Mr. Drabinsky said, "the reality is that six months from now what they will see on the stage will be a wonderful evening of theater presented with dignity, integrity and great sensitivity, and I believe that nothing on the stage will offend one person in the black community."

HEADLINE: Stronger Yen, Weaker U.S.

BYLINE: By R. Taggart Murphy; R. Taggart Murphy is writing a book about the financial relationship between America and Japan.

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Senate testimony by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Federal Reserve market intervention have ended a successful campaign to push up the value of the yen against the dollar. The Clintonites stuck close to a script written by the Nixon, Carter and Reagan Administrations, which all turned to dollar cheapening as a "remedy" for "politically intolerable" trade deficits with Japan.
The scenario: Make public comments about how desirable it would be for the yen to get stronger. Use bullying tactics to keep Japan on board and the market guessing. When the rate shoots past the desired level, intervene to signal approval. Thus, once unthinkable rates -- 265 yen to the dollar in 1973, 180 in 1978, 145 in 1985 and now 110 -- become the norm. 
 Doubtless the Administration congratulates itself on the 13 percent revaluation of the yen. It should recall what happened after earlier scripts ended: A major crisis followed each decline in the dollar. OPEC's quadrupling of oil prices in 1973 was partly a reaction to the dollar devaluation that year. After the Carter Administration "talked down the dollar," there was currency havoc and double-digit interest rates. Two years after the Plaza Accord of 1985 -- which was convened to lower the dollar and was so "successful" that U.S. currency lost almost half its value against the yen -- Japanese investors dumped dollar securities after realizing that cheapening the dollar had done nothing to reverse the U.S. trade deficit. Five days later came the 1987 market crash.
Using the yen-dollar rate to cure the trade deficit makes things worse. In the past, each time the yen got stronger, the trade surpluses retreated a bit and then came back stubbornly higher and more intractable.
Boosting the yen is supposed to make Japanese goods more expensive and lead Americans to favor cheaper domestic products while Japanese consumers rush to stock up on low-price American imports. But Japanese companies have demonstrated they will do almost anything to hang on to market share abroad, while in Japan it is the producers -- not the powerless consumers -- who matter.
How do Japan's producers react to a stronger yen? They rationalize production and squeeze costs. When this is insufficient to maintain competitiveness, they move production offshore, where the high yen makes investing cheaper. Our trade deficit with Japanese companies is half again as large as our deficit with Japan because of Japan's investments in its rapidly growing neighbors. When we push the dollar down, our trade deficit with Japan becomes a deficit with all Asia.
With a stronger yen the Japanese can build factories and buy companies in the U.S. more cheaply than Americans can invest in Japan. As Dennis Encarnation's book "Rivals Beyond Trade" shows, the explanation for the trade imbalance lies in the lopsided difference between Japanese direct investment in the U.S. and American direct investment in Japan.
A combination of inflated Japanese real estate prices and a quarter century of dollar-bashing by successive U.S. administrations has made it impossibly expensive for U.S. business to establish more than a toehold in Japan.
The latest ratcheting up the yen has brought yowls from Japanese exporters, but it is also quietly welcomed. It weeds out inefficient firms, provides an excuse for reneging on implicit lifetime employment contracts and, most importantly, together with the currently contrived Tokyo stock market rally, eliminates the danger of a wave of foreign acquisitions of strategic Japanese companies.
The Administration has yet to learn that trashing the dollar is no substitute for a coherent Japan policy and that Japanese bureaucratic skill at blocking meaningful foreign participation in its economy is the real cause of the trade and investment imbalances.

HEADLINE: 'Foreign Aid' for Los Angeles

BYLINE: By Eric Mann; Eric Mann is director of the Labor/ Community Strategy Center, a community advocacy group.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
It has been a year since the urban rebellion in Los Angeles and just two weeks since "the verdict." The headlines from Waco and Bosnia obscure an inescapable truth: our society has written off the inner cities and their escalating, increasingly racially defined poverty.
In Los Angeles, the unemployment rate for black and Latino men between the ages of 17 and 35 approaches 50 percent; for 20-year-old black women it is 70 percent. More than half a million Latino and Asian immigrants labor in a sweatshop economy for annual wages of less than $10,000. As a report issued last week by the Labor/Community Strategy Center makes clear, public health centers, 24-hour emergency room services, parks and libraries are urgently needed by inner-city residents. But these are not on the way; the Los Angeles city budget deficit is expected to be $500 million this year. 
 The rebellion in April 1992 was just that, a rebellion, not a riot. Those who urge inner-city residents to adopt more constructive approaches should concede the limits of our society's reform efforts. Among the failed options:
* Elect a black mayor. In 1973, a multiracial movement elected Tom Bradley, a moderate who promised jobs and justice. The Bradley legacy has been a revitalized downtown business district, the transformation of the mayor's office into an adjunct to the Chamber of Commerce and the polarization of wealth and poverty. At every major juncture the Bradley administration sided with privilege and against the poor.
* Allow the private sector to take over government functions. Days after the rebellion, Peter Ueberroth, the former Olympic wizard, was crowned by Mayor Bradley and Gov. Pete Wilson to lead a private sector consortium to bring jobs to the inner city. A year later, the consortium and its market strategies have generated an avalanche of corporate public relations pitches, pre-empted far more militant and community-based efforts and, after defining the employment needs of South Los Angeles at 95,000 jobs, delivered at most a few thousand.
* Elect a Democratic President. Bill Clinton made an unspoken deal with the black community and progressives of all races: Vote for me as if your life depended on it, let me court the Reagan Democrats and the suburban middle class and after the election I'll address your concerns. A few months into his term, Mr. Clinton has focused on deficit reduction instead of poverty reduction, advanced the bankrupt strategy of enterprise zones and backed down on his own "economic stimulus" package.
A real war on poverty would mean dramatic increases in Aid to Families with Dependent Children, funds for education and housing and direct transfers of income. It would include an $8-an-hour minimum wage and a prohibition of permanent replacements for strikers.
In the 1960's, the antipoverty movement momentarily captured the imagination and conscience of our society. It was subverted -- not, as revisionism has it, because you can't throw money at the problem, but because big city, usually Democratic, mayors suppressed the community action programs that were succeeding only too well at enlisting the poor.
There is a need for a national movement, multiracial and rooted in urban centers, to make the cities and social welfare programs the highest priority of the Federal budget. The proposals must be aggressive: the most radical taxation of corporate profits and individual wealth, immediate cessation of the savings-and-loan bailout and explicit rejection of deficit reduction as a Federal priority. One immediate intervention could set the tone for this strategy: deliver the $1.8 billion pledged to Boris Yeltsin to Los Angeles instead, as "foreign aid" to one of America's abandoned cities.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Hundred-Day Headache

BYLINE: By Lester Bernstein; Lester Bernstein was formerly the editor of Newsweek.

 BODY:
After an interminable drumroll, the Roosevelt curse fell on Bill Clinton this week as he marked his 100th day as President.
Prompted by Frankin D. Roosevelt's Hundred Days -- the duration of the special session of Congress he convened five days after taking office on March 4, 1933 -- generations of journalists have gauged new Presidents by their performance in the same time frame. This time around, in the way journalists have of getting ahead of themselves, the judgments poured in early -- and harshly enough for a defensive Mr. Clinton to launch his own spin campaign. 
 One hundred days is certainly a nice round number, though a wholly arbitrary one based on a situation of economic crisis unparalleled in American history. Among other things, Roosevelt took the U.S. off the gold standard, saved the banking system and won passage of 13 major pieces of legislation including bank deposit insurance, billions of dollars in relief, Wall Street reforms, creating the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Tennessee Valley Authority, refinancing of home mortgages, creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps and, of course, the return of real beer. In the process, he gave 10 major speeches, sent 15 messages to Congress and met the press twice a week.
Mr. Clinton, the first President who was not yet born before Roosevelt's lifetime, may be the first to have touted his own 100 days before they started and before they were over. Last week, at his second press conference in three months, he brought up the subject, to give perspective, he said, to his widely criticized failure to get his economic stimulus bill passed. He offered a list of achievements, headed by the successful budget resolution (which must still be spelled out in future legislation), with a heavy smattering of plans for reform that have yet to be turned into law. And by broadcast and brochure, he kept plugging his claims.
He might have done better to play it cool in the manner of his predecessor and hero, John F. Kennedy. When Kennedy was working on his Inaugural Address, he told his amanuensis, Theodore Sorensen, "I'm sick of reading how we're planning another 'Hundred Days' of miracles." And the speech indeed read: "All this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days . . . . But let us begin."
Despite Kennedy's prescient effort to disarm the curse, his news conference of May 5, 1961, produced a request for his own appraisal of his 100 days. His complete response was: "Well, I feel I can read what you gentlemen write about it, and I wouldn't attempt to contradict you." A classy reply (despite the touch of period sexism).
Even Lyndon B. Johnson, F.D.R.'s political protege, whose blizzard of laws enacted in his five years rivaled the master's, rejected the role of 100-day wonder. Knowing the ways of Congress better than anyone else, he sent each bill to the Capitol only when the timing seemed right. "It's like a bottle of Bourbon," he explained. "If you take a glass at a time, it's fine, But if you drink the whole bottle in one evening, you have troubles. I plan to take a sip at a time and enjoy myself."
Actually, Kennedy tried hard for a dazzling first 100 days, coupling his natural glamour with a blaze of dynamic activity. "He did everything but shinny up the Washington Monument," wrote James Reston. But Kennedy's 100 days also included the Bay of Pigs invasion.
President Clinton should be grateful that the shortfalls blemishing his own start do not include anything so catastrophic. And perhaps he, and we, can find comfort in the thought that Roosevelt's achievements in the 73d Congress were possible only because the nation stood at the abyss.

HEADLINE: Libraries' Funds Cut as Use Hits Record Highs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your editorial "Saving New York's Libraries" (April 13) delivered an important message: Libraries are indeed more important than potholes in the Information Age. Yet many of our nation's libraries -- school, public and college -- struggle to keep books on the shelves and their doors open due to government funding cutbacks.
Public libraries nationwide report record-high levels of use by job seekers, students, the elderly and others in need of information, education and entertainment at the same time their funds have been cut by legislators or eaten away by inflation. In Massachusetts, 20 libraries have had to close in the last six years. In Syracuse, N.Y., there is no more telephone reference service, no more bookmobile or books-by-mail programs for the elderly and physically impaired as a result of budget cuts. There are waiting lists for preschool story hour in Philadelphia. 
 In California, more than half the school libraries have closed, and students have even less access to library service as a result of public library closings due to the state's budget crisis. In Austin, Tex., school officials estimate it would cost $3.5 million to replace the outdated materials on school library shelves. The average age of library books in Louisiana schools is 25 years, according a recent study. The cuts continue despite recent findings that there is a direct correlation between good school libraries and student achievement.
In Washington, the President has proposed cutting all Federal funds for college libraries -- funds badly needed to purchase the technology that will support the national electronic information network that both he and the Vice President have endorsed. These funds, a pittance of the Federal budget, can make a significant difference to college libraries struggling to provide students and researchers with the latest advances in information technology.
The good news is that voters show their support for libraries at the polls. A recent Gallup Poll found that members of the public believe that funding for libraries should be more than double the current national average of $18 per capita, less than the cost of a hardcover book.
Starting during National Library Week (April 18-24), the American Library Association and Friends of Libraries USA began providing an opportunity for members of the public to show their support. We are inviting people of all ages to write and share how the library has made a difference in their lives. Letters and postcards can be delivered to local libraries or sent to the American Library Association, 50 East Huron Street, Chicago, Ill. 60611.
This "testimony" will be used to deliver the message to our nation's legislators: Americans value and want their libraries adequately funded.

HEADLINE: Aftertaste of Scandal in the Schools

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
On the day after the latest scandal broke over a South Bronx school board long known more for patronage than pedagogy, Eugenia Irizarry took stock of her term on the board and pronounced it a failure.
After 10 years as an active parent in Community School District 12, including four on the board, the hardest years of her life, Ms. Irizarry, decided not to run in the board election next Tuesday -- and she says she has not found another candidate worthy of her vote. 
 "I tell parents I will not support any candidates who are running, not one single one," she said. "The web just gets bigger and bigger."
In a scathing report on the affairs of the district, investigators said Ms. Irizarry had been a bystander as rival factions on the school board secretly parceled out principal's jobs, mainly to educators who promised to bring in contributions or votes -- or in one case, investigators said, pay a bribe.
Yesterday Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez began the formal process of taking over the district, where he has intervened repeatedly because of financial improprieties or personnel problems. He summoned the board to a meeting next Thursday, and school officials said he was likely to appoint a team to run the school district.
And just four days shy of an election in which three of the implicated board members -- along with two non-members also accused of improper political activity -- are seeking election, Ms. Irizarry and other parents and teachers said the affair had left them more bitter than bewildered about the entire system of community-controlled schools. They are not so much outraged, they say, as unhappily resigned.
"The parents who go to all the meetings and know the wheeling and dealing that goes on were not angry," said Maria Falcon-Cintron, the president of the parents association at Public School 102 in the district. "They were relieved it all came out."
Ms. Irizarry said it was almost impossible to bring the board to focus on educational issues in the central Bronx district, which has some of the lowest scores on math and reading tests in the city.
"It was like trying to move the Berlin Wall," she said. "Their agenda is politics."
 
Scenes on a Videotape
 The investigation by Edward F. Stancik, the special investigator for the New York City schools, led Wednesday night to the arrest of one educator, Virginia Noville, on charges that she passed thousand of dollars in bribes to a member of the school board to secure an job as principal of Public School 214.
The school board member, Edward Cain, had agreed to cooperate with authorities, after they produced evidence that he and several colleagues had pocketed the proceeds of a fund-raiser for which principals across the district were expected to purchase and sell tickets.
On a videotape, Ms. Noville is shown counting money and passing cash to Mr. Cain in front of Katz's deli on the Lower East Side. She also calls him her "godfather" in the district. Mr. Stancik's report also accused Councilwoman Lucy Cruz, a former school board member, of doling out principal jobs to supporters, and requiring school administrators to install a chandelier, plant flowers at her house, and chauffeur her around.
In his report, Mr. Stancik recommended that four members of the current school board be removed from office and the board be stripped of all hiring power. The board members he named include three who are seeking re-election on Tuesday -- Veronica James, Pablo Ortiz and Randy Glenn. The fourth named, Raul Cruz, is not running.
 
Chancellor's Acts Criticized
 Mr. Ortiz, the president of the school board, said he would meet with the Chancellor and would accuse him of engaging in "character assasination." Mr. Ortiz said that he had done nothing wrong, and that both the Chancellor and Mr. Stancik were "vicious individuals."
Another board member, Carmen J. Tarveras, said that the board would meet with the Chancellor as requested. She said that the report was "unfair" and that many principals appointed in recent years are "working hard to help our kids do their best."
But the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, said that the latest report of corruption in the district was not at all surprising.
"It has been an open secret that people have been selling principalships, and shaking down book companies," he said. "I'm really outraged. Every time a new scandal hits, they act stunned, shocked. It is like Claude Raines at the runway in 'Casablanca.' "
Mr. Ferrer called for new legislation requiring that parents make up a majority of all school boards, and if that fails to improve the system, for the community boards to be appointed rather than elected.
In District 12, Ms. Irizarry and other parents and teachers seem even more pessimistic.
"The morale is very low," said one teacher at P.S. 214 who would not give his name. "It is very hard to get a job in another district when you come from District 12."
For Ms. Irizarry, the problem is the poverty and ignorance of parents in the district, who she says are sometimes manipulated by principals who tell them that if a favored candidate is defeated, the school will lose money and programs.
"If I felt I could have made a change I would have stayed on," she said. "But I wasn't getting anywhere. I was getting really stressed out from fighting. Now we have all these religious groups supporting candidates because of the Rainbow Curriculum. Where were they when I was screaming about quality?"

District 14, which encompasses Greenpoint and Williamsburg, has been the site of a nascent Hispanic and black empowerment movement, which succeeded in electing two members in 1989. While the area has a substantial majority of Hispanic students, and a significant black minority, the board is still controlled by a coalition of Hasidic, Polish and Italian members. This year, that push for minority representation is continuing, with four challengers from the southern, Hispanic portion of the district on the ballot.

District 15 comprises such economically and ethnically diverse neighborhoods as Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Sunset Park, Gowanus and Red Hook, is known for its many nontraditional schools. But perhaps no other district -- and no other campaign -- has been so bitterly divided by the fight over the Children of the Rainbow curriculum, which the district board adopted, in compromise form, last November.

Although there are 18 candidates for the 9 seats on the board, few major educational issues have emerged in this Bedford-Stuyvesant district. Annie B. Dodds, the board president, has a strong base of support with Democratic political groups in Brooklyn. She is running with a slate that includes the other two incumbents running and several challengers. David R. Miller, who is active in the Brownsville Republican Club, is leading a slate of eight challengers.

District 17, which encompasses Crown Heights, Flatbush and Prospect Heights, has long worked to correct the overcrowding and repair problems in many of its buildings. Superintendent Bess Reynolds is retiring this year, so the board election has focused on who will choose her replacement. Sylvester Leaks, an incumbent, is leading a slate that is made up of incumbents and challengers that is supported by the United Federation of Teachers. Philip Rucker is running with a challenger slate that has received support from ACORN, a community group pressing for educational change.

In the northeastern section of Brooklyn, District 19 has long been split between predominantly white Starrett City and predominantly black and Hispanic East New York. Two slates have formed among the 13 candidates, each with strong backing from different factions of the Democratic party in Brooklyn. The board president, Corinna Grant, who is from Starrett City, leads one slate; the vice president, Gloria B. Corley, leads the other.

District 20, which comprises Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst and Borough Park, has traditionally been a considered relatively conservative; its board members often have strong backing from churches and synagogues. In forums, all the candidates have declared their opposition to the Rainbow curriculum. Although a number of slates have formed, they are divided along political, rather than educational, lines -- Republican, Democratic and Conservative.

Long known as a hot political arena, District 21 -- which encompasses Coney Island, Brighton Beach and Midwood -- is again the site of a major political battle for control of the school board. At the center of the battle is the board president, Sheldon Plotnick, who has been accused of patronage and nepotism in his leadership of the district. His incumbent slate is being challenged by his rivals in the local Democratic club, which he recently took over with the help of local teachers and principals, and a group campaigning for a board more representative of the ethnically diverse district. All of the incumbents seeking re-election are white.

District 22 is broken into three main zones: the Midwood-Flatlands area, which contains small, predominantly white schools; the Flatbush area, which has larger, black schools; and the "frozen zone" in north Flatbush, which has no schools and where 1,500 students are bused each day to schools in southern Flatbush.
The main issue dividing the candidates, however, is the Children of the Rainbow curriculum, which attracted an enormous crowd to a public hearing last winter and which the current board approved in a compromise version.

District 32 in Bushwick has long been plagued by fiscal problems and allegations of corruption. The district was investigated in 1989-91 for allegedly using the hiring of nonprofessionals as political favors. Chancellor Fernandez also sent a management team into the district in 1990 to correct budgetary irregularities.
The race for school board traditionally falls into two slates, one led by the board president, Tito Velez, and one supported by Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez. This year there are also two independent candidates, Luz Rivera and Aurea Byron, who have been supported by liberal groups like Acorn and SchoolPAC.

HEADLINE: Crime

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio

 BODY:
Nobody appreciates that wacky social institution known as the American family more than Sue Grafton. In "J" IS FOR JUDGMENT (Holt, $21.95), the 10th mystery in her witty alphabet series, the author uses a cleverly executed fraud as yet another illustration of the ingenious crimes and misdemeanors that people will commit in the cause of domestic tranquillity.
Kinsey Millhone has seen it all in this series. But the cheeky private investigator who operates out of southern California is still pretty impressed with crafty Wendell Jaffe, who may have faked his own suicide and run off to Mexico with a chippy when his fraudulent business empire collapsed. "I'm not trying to defend the man, but he's not all bad," Kinsey finds herself explaining to one of the two bratty sons Jaffe abandoned. The kid isn't any more convinced than Jaffe's financial partner, who went to prison for him, or Jaffe's brittle wife, who has to surrender the insurance money if Kinsey can prove that her husband is still alive. 
 Ms. Grafton writes a smart story and wraps it up with a wry twist; but she takes care to sweeten her tart characterizations with amused understanding and, in the case of Jaffe, even affection. That this smooth scoundrel would risk his ill-gotten freedom out of familial concern touches a soft spot with Kinsey, a confirmed "outsider, a loner," who has just discovered relatives of her own. Let's hope they're total rogues.
There's nothing subtle about the crude criminal psychology that John Camp applies to his mad-dog killers in the suspense novels that he writes under the pseudonym of John Sandford: "He'd never had a chance, not from when he was a child. They'd always picked on him, victimized him, tortured him." That just about covers his analysis in WINTER PREY (Putnam, $21.95) of the predator who has sexually corrupted several children and their parents in a rural Wisconsin town, and who then goes on a homicidal rampage to protect his identity from Lucas Davenport, the formidable protagonist in this series.
But if Mr. Sandford can't be bothered with fancy psychology, he knows all there is to know about detonating the gut-level shocks of a good thriller. There's no release from the bombardment of visceral stimulation that begins with the slaughter of an entire family by the Iceman, a stealthy killer who slips through deep woods and over frozen lakes on a snowmobile. By the time he is cornered, after a land-and-air manhunt during a raging blizzard, a good deal of blood has frozen into ice.
Davenport, a cool, cynical man of action, is entirely in his element in this harsh terrain -- so bitter that it turns animals against men, so brutal that it turns men into beasts.
"Everything that had happened was connected in a logical way." Thus does Mary Higgins Clark instruct those of us dopes and skeptics who either can't follow or won't swallow the contrivances that support the elaborate plot of her new suspense thriller, I'LL BE SEEING YOU (Simon & Schuster, $23). "The minute you understand the structure," she reassures us, "everything falls into place."
True enough. There isn't a structural hair out of place in this twisted yarn about Meghan Collins, a television reporter who catches the eye of a killer while she is on assignment at an "assisted reproduction facility" for a feature story about in vitro fertilization. It's not logic, though, but common sense that is strained when Ms. Clark gussies up her woman-in-peril formula with a convoluted subplot that awkwardly links Meghan's deceased father with the shady doings at the fertility clinic.
Despite the excess narrative weight it has to lug around, the story moves swiftly and plays cunningly on the universal fear of parental loss and abandonment. And by voicing our secret anxieties about designer genetics -- what if some dummy lab technician drops my "cryopreserved embryo"? what if some thief steals it? what if I have somebody else's baby? -- Ms. Clark raises such horrid possibilities that, like Meghan, we have no patience for some silly killer lurking in the shadows.
After lying low for these past five years, Gabe Wager, the rugged Latino cop in Rex Burns's police procedurals, is swamped with heavy work when he gets back into action in ENDANGERED SPECIES (Viking, $19). There's been a gang killing on the west side of Denver, where the Gallos and the Tapatios are feuding over drug turf. Two cops get shot at the Blue Moon Bar and Grill, where someone else was recently knifed to death. On top of that, Wager can't get rid of Stovepipe, an ex-con who wants him to cosign a mortgage loan.
Except for the occasional pit stop at the Satire Lounge for enchiladas and green chili, Wager is one of those driven cops who are all business, and the worst piece of business he's seen in a long time is the incinerated corpse found in the ruins of an arson fire. When dogged police work turns up evidence that the arsonists are "eco-warriors" with incendiary designs on an atomic weapons plant, Wager finds himself working with an F.B.I. partner in a thrilling race to stop this doomsday mission.
Although it would normally boggle the mind to imagine a city cop going from street fights to terrorist plots, nothing seems inconceivable these days. And with the unsettling facts he delivers about local nuclear installations like Rocky Flats, Mr. Burns finds plenty of scary cause for hauling his lawman out of mothballs.
Mario Balzic has got a right to sing the blues, but he's also got a job to do. Balzic, the soul and conscience of K. C. Constantine's BOTTOM LINER BLUES (Mysterious Press/Warner, $18.95) and nine earlier novels, is the police chief of Rocksburg, an economically depressed and spiritually depleted town in western Pennsylvania that is still reeling from the collapse of its coal mines and steel industries. "Most of the people where I live are just like me, too old to find another job, too young for Social Security, and we ran outta unemployment . . . years ago," rants Nick Myushkin, a barroom philosopher they call the Mad Russian. "I mean we're back in the barterin' and poachin' stage."
A man of simple beliefs and deep compassion, Balzic has always managed to throw out the lifeline that keeps his neighbors from going under. But the hopelessness gets to him this time when he answers a call from a disturbed woman with a wild, sad tale of domestic violence. He's moved by her pain but put off by her craziness, and he lets the town malcontents distract him with their own long-winded, if poignant, blues.
Mr. Constantine, who has a golden ear for dialogue, has not lost his Whitmanesque feeling for the voice of this forgotten region. ("I speak for a lotta people who don't know how to speak," Myushkin says.) Like his dispirited hero, however, the author seems to have given up on his job, which is not singing the blues but telling stories.

HEADLINE: David Geffen, Still Hungry

BYLINE: By Bernard Weinraub; Bernard Weinraub covers Hollywood for The New York Times.

 BODY:
David Geffen glances out the window of his black Lincoln Town Car, moving fitfully down Fifth Avenue toward SoHo. He's on the phone with one of his closest friends, Sandy Gallin, who manages Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton. There are messages to call Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff; Arthur Liman, the lawyer; Leo Castelli, the art dealer; Ed Lampert, one of Geffen's financial advisers, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios.
Abruptly, Geffen hangs up the phone and points to a luxury condominium building on Union Square. "That was Klein's, Klein's department store, remember?" he says. "My mother used to buy bargains there, things that were dirty. She'd say, 'Americans are so crazy, you're going to have to wash it anyway.' " He laughs. 
 His loyal driver, Phil Singer, joins in the laughter. "Mothers are always right," says Singer, who used to work as a part-time driver for Madonna. Singer's decision to quit Madonna caused the superstar to stop talking to Geffen.
"Life is too short," says Geffen, as the car threads past 14th Street. It is one of his favorite expressions. "All Phil wanted was a full-time job so he could get health insurance for his family and a bar mitzvah for his son. She didn't want to hire him full time. So I did. And what was so remarkable was how angry she became. These people think they have a kind of divine right of kings. And what gets me is I've been extraordinarily helpful to Madonna."
David Geffen has been extraordinarily helpful not only to Madonna but also to, among numerous others, Katzenberg, Lampert, Castelli, McLarty and McLarty's boss. Geffen, who is the richest man in Hollywood (and also one of the most complex), helped raise millions of dollars for President Clinton in the election, and has now set his sights on a mountain more formidable than Hollywood -- Washington, D.C.
 AT 50, WITH A $1 BILLION FORTUNE, Geffen is hardly seeking a Cabinet job; but he's looking for an apartment in Washington and probably wouldn't mind serving on a Presidential commission or two. Asked if he ever saw himself working for the Administration, Geffen says, a little surprisingly: "No one's asked me. If somebody felt there was a job I could actually do I would consider it -- not out of any ambition to be in Washington, but I do want to rise to the occasion of serving there if warranted."
Even more surprising is Geffen's friendship with McLarty, the reserved, buttoned-down Little Rock businessman whose childhood friendship with Clinton led to his appointment as chief of staff. Like a lot of people, McLarty says that he enjoys talking to the Brooklyn-born mogul on the phone.
"We established a relationship at the economic conference in Little Rock," McLarty says. "It's a very easy relationship. We call each other. David's very selective in his calls to me. He's not aggressive or inappropriately assertive."
McLarty adds: "When he calls, he wants to know how things are going, how he can be helpful, what are the problems. Mostly David and I talk about the economic and business side. He doesn't really ask for anything, and doesn't have an agenda per se. He strikes me as someone who has handled his immense success in a very exemplary manner."
The enormousness of Geffen's wealth, while calming his temper and cowing everyone in sight, has hardly quelled his demons. Like his idols, those 1930's movie moguls who were born poor, had scant formal education and were brilliant and ferocious men, Geffen has a hunger for success that seems bottomless.
On virtually every level, Geffen comparmentalizes his life. There is the Wall Street world of his friends Felix Rohatyn and Herbert Allen Jr. There is the art world of Larry Gagosian, his ambitious dealer, and Castelli, whose Old World elegance dazzles Geffen. There is the music world of Allen Grubman, his lawyer, and other New York buddies who gossip with him on Saturday mornings over bagels at Barney Greengrass on the Upper West Side. There is the gay world of Miami and Fire Island. There is the Malibu world of the movie stars and studio chiefs who come to him for guidance. And now there is the political world of Washington.
Politically, the 5-foot-7 1/2, 148-pound Geffen is carving out a a powerful role comparable to the one played for many years in Hollywood by Lew R. Wasserman, the 80-year-old chairman of MCA. Wasserman, whom Geffen greatly admires, served as an adviser to Democratic Presidents and wielded enormous clout beyond his base in the entertainment industry. He was a behind-the-scenes kingmaker whose Beverly Hills home served as a virtual station of the cross for national political candidates. Geffen is already considered the Clinton Administration's Lew Wassserman.
Beyond politics, Geffen has far outdistanced Wasserman -- and just about every other friend or mentor. With a stock portfolio estimated to be worth $800 million, he is clearly one of Wall Street's top players. In just a few years, he has also become a prolific art collector, focusing on postwar Abstract Expressionists, and his sudden appearance in a SoHo or Madison Avenue gallery on a Saturday morning, often with his friend S. I. Newhouse Jr. in tow, tends to resemble the unexpected arrival of two four-star generals in a basic-training barracks.
Even Geffen's personal life has taken on a monumental public dimension. His announcement that he was gay at an AIDS benefit last November (he had previously announced he was bisexual) suddenly turned him into a spokesman on gay issues, a result he never intended. The revelation of his homosexuality also seemed to liberate him personally, a result he did intend. "He just seems so relieved," says the designer Calvin Klein, one of Geffen's closest friends. "He felt he could be a role model. Gay men are not necessarily thought of as the shrewdest businessmen in the world. He felt he should do this publicly as well as for himself and he's really much happier."
But Ahmet Ertegun, a founder and co-chairman of Atlantic Records and a mentor of Geffen's, thinks Klein may be overstating the case. "I think David's probably as happy as he could be," Ertegun says carefully. Adds another friend, Terry Semel, the president of Warner Brothers: "Compared to the way he was 10 years ago, I would say that David now has the ability to enjoy life a little. He would say a lot. I'd say a little."
 MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO AGREE ON ONE thing about David Geffen: he is a man of contradictions. On the one hand, he appears totally unpretentious. The jeans and T-shirt that mark his sartorial style mirror a no-nonsense directness in his approach to friends. "He's voracious in his criticisms," says Jeff Katzenberg. "When he sees a movie of mine he doesn't like, he massacres me. But it comes from a place of total generosity."
Geffen can also be generous toward employees. Upon her retirement, he gave his longtime secretary 1 percent of the sale of his record company, which made her $5 million. Yet Geffen also has a take-no-enemies side. He has often been singled out for the Machiavellian role he played in the 1990 downfall of the temperamental Walter Yetnikoff, the former head of CBS Records. (Geffen calls the reports "Hollywood silliness.")
"David will do anything for you if you're his friend," says Howard Rosenman, a movie producer and, yes, a friend. "But if you're his enemy, well, you might as well kill yourself."
Although Geffen has a mind like a laser and writes nothing down as he makes call after call, deal after deal, he remains insecure about his lack of college education. As a result, he's flattered -- perhaps more than he should be -- by all the attentions lavished on him now.
If Geffen has had one conspicuous failure, it is a personal one: his inability to maintain a long-term relationship. Although Geffen is remarkably candid, he winces and struggles when talking about his current personal life. "I aspire to have a relationship with somebody," he says. "I haven't always been successful at it. But being gay is very different from being straight in the area of relationships. Of course, there are gay people who've had a long-term relationship for 50 years, but they're not the rule. And it's difficult to be in a relationship with someone as well known and wealthy as I am. There's a disparity that works in heterosexual relationships that doesn't work in homosexual relationships." His last serious relationship, he says, ended in 1989.
Paradoxically, Geffen's most intense and longest-term relationship was with a woman -- Cher. The two, lovers in the early 70's, maintain a close, if somewhat turbulent, friendship.
"We slept together and, believe me, I know the best and worst of David," Cher says. "It's impossible to get along with him -- his mind just moves so quickly. He's always brighter than everybody else. I kept saying to him, 'Sweetheart, you have a sweet side to you, a vulnerable side, but then you can be so mean and awful to people. Yeah, people are terrified of David -- his temper, his intelligence. He's not afraid of anybody."
Cher laughs. "We were like children when we met," she recalls. "I had been married at 16, and came out of the marriage at 27. I knew nothing. David had never had an affair with a woman. He literally took me in, fed me, gave me money, got me a lawyer. He was my best friend and he wanted to marry me and I just couldn't do it. But we were madly in love for about two years.
"He still calls me and says, 'Sweetheart, come over for dinner and we'll watch a movie.' So I go to his house in Malibu and we eat dinner and he tells me how uninformed and ridiculous my life is and asks me what stupid things I'm doing and do I have a boyfriend, and I say no. And then we watch a movie and he always wants to turn it off because he's bored by it, and I say no, and I make him watch it and that's how the evening goes."
ALTHOUGH Geffen frequently points out that he was a multimillionaire in the music business at 25, his enormous wealth was a result of ferocious ambition and intelligence -- as well as a little bit of luck.
In November 1990, Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company of Japan bought the entertainment conglomerate MCA for more than $6 billion. At the time Geffen owned 10 million shares of MCA stock -- a result of the sale of his company, Geffen Records, to MCA early that year. In a single stroke, Geffen realized more than $700 million from the Matsushita sale. His investments since then, coupled with his real-estate holdings, art collection and film-company profits have made him a billionaire.
While he wears jeans, sneakers and Gap T-shirts, shaves only when necessary and shows up at Christie's auctions on Park Avenue defiantly wearing a white painter's cap backward, Geffen lives an awful lot like a sultan.
For years, his main home has been an elegantly Spartan beach house behind an unadorned wall on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, with pale wood floors and a vast expanse of glass overlooking the Pacific. He also owns a seven-room apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York, designed by his favorite architects, Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel, and replete with dark green marble floors and striking paintings by David Hockney, Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning on the gray-blue walls. An incongruous exercise bike that Geffen never uses rests like a piece of sculpture in the living room, but this will soon be discarded. He just bought the upstairs apartment and is turning part of it into a gym.
Compulsively neat, Geffen sits most days in New York at his custom-made oak desk beside a window overlooking Central Park, working the phones or reading letters, memos and faxes, then tearing them to shreds. Because of his ability to retain information, his desk is paper free.
Geffen also has a home in the mostly gay community Fire Island Pines, and is shopping for beach-front property in East Hampton. But his biggest real-estate prize to date is the fabled Jack Warner estate in Beverly Hills, for which he paid $47.5 million three years ago. It's an expansive 10-acre property on which he's spending millions more, gutting and renovating. His goal is to reopen the house in December for a huge Democratic fund-raising event, whose principal guest might be the current occupant of the White House.
Yet Geffen professes dismay at the house. "A staggeringly stupid thing to buy -- do you know an Arab sheik who wants it?" asks Geffen, now sitting in his $26 million Gulfstream 4 as the plane glides over the San Gabriel wilderness after takeoff from Burbank Airport for New York. The specially designed, lushly carpeted plane is equipped with a state-of-the-art satellite communications system, hundreds of movies and enough bagels and lox to feed the entire Catskills on a Sunday morning.
Characteristically, Geffen speaks of the mansion with the same cold detachment that has marked the decisions he has made for years about investments, talent, employees and friends. "I was always fascinated by this house," he says. "Once, the gates were open and I drove in just to see it, and in four seconds there were police cars and sirens and they threw me out." After Ann Warner, Jack Warner's widow, died, Geffen called Sandy Gallin and asked him to take a ride with him to the Warner place.
"Well, we walked in and they said they got an offer from a developer to subdivide the property, and all of a sudden I got protective about it," Geffen recalls. "So I bought it, with everything in it, instantly. I just bought it with all the furniture, all the scripts, all the Oscars, everything.
"I mean, this is the home of one of the men who created the town and the industry," he says. "I had worked for Warner Brothers most of my adult life, and I was totally enthralled by the world that this guy had created. So I bought the house. And I sold Warner Brothers all the scripts, the Oscars, the mementoes for $3 million, which they're going to use for a museum. I sold some of the rest of the stuff for $7 million. And I kept millions of dollars of furniture and silver. So I was really paying about $34 million for prime Beverly Hills property."
He smiles.
But, he is asked, are all these extravagant homes really necessary?
The smile vanishes. "You say extravagant -- well I'm a very wealthy man," he says. "I've earned all this money. I've worked for it. I didn't cheat anybody. I didn't issue junk bonds and put people out of work. I earned it. And I live relatively modestly given my level of success and wealth."
ONE OF DAVID Geffen's closest friends says that Hollywood is like the Balkans. "There are duchesses and dukes and a court of sychophants," the friend says. "And David is one of the emperors. There's Mike Ovitz and there's David. Two emperors.
"And you have to pay your respects to both of them," he goes on. "And David sort of sits there in the darkness. Very quiet. You don't know what he's doing except controlling and manipulating. Sort of like the original-cast album cover of 'My Fair Lady.' That's David. But he's tired now, he's tired of the con artists and the hustlers and all these betraying human beings here. And he wants more. He wants clout on a bigger stage. And he's doing it."
It's 11:15 A.M., and Geffen is, as usual, on the phone in his Fifth Avenue apartment. He's speaking to Bob Burkett -- a former political adviser to Ted Field, the department-store heir and movie producer -- whom he hired this year to run the David Geffen Foundation. Geffen finances the foundation with the $600,000-a-year salary he earns from MCA heading his own record company, as well as earnings from being a movie producer and theatrical investor. The private foundation gives away $5 million to $8 million each year to such causes as AIDS, homelessness, abortion rights and assistance to Ethiopian and Soviet Jews settling in Israel, as well as substantial donations to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art.
Geffen's new interest in politics was sparked, he says, by the Republican National Convention last August in Houston. "Really, it scared me," he says. "They didn't care about anybody but white, Christian, heterosexual males." Before the convention ended, Geffen was on the phone to an old friend, Mickey Kantor, the Los Angeles lawyer who headed the Clinton campaign and is now United States Trade Representative. Geffen became a major contributor and fund-raiser, helping to fill Democratic Party coffers with millions. Since the election, he has been invited to a number of conferences at the White House and has spoken at least a dozen times with President Clinton.
Geffen remains an unabashed Clinton fan, brushing aside any criticism that the President appears to be backing away from his commitment to end the ban on homosexuals in the miliary. "He intends to overturn the ban," Geffen says firmly. "He's going to do it."
The phone keeps ringing.
A friend, the investment banker Herbert Allen Jr., offers a potential investment. Geffen passes it up. Then he takes a call from Ed Rosenblatt, the president of Geffen Records in Los Angeles, about record sales and airplay for some of the company's major stars -- Guns 'n' Roses, Aerosmith, Nirvana. Although he's no longer interested in bankrolling Broadway shows, Geffen has earned substantial amounts of money as a producer of or major investor in (Continued on page 45)
hits like "Dreamgirls," "Cats," "Miss Saigon" and "M. Butterfly."
He talks with Felix Rohatyn, senior partner at Lazard Freres, about the Clinton Administration's budget proposals.
Another call comes in from an agent at Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles about a deal to star Brad Pitt in the movie version of the Anne Rice novel "Interview With the Vampire." It's a project that Geffen has been consumed with producing for several years. (Despite such successes as "Beetlejuice" and "Risky Business," Geffen has not quite reached the level of success as a movie producer that he has in the music business. One notable flop with critics, the trashy "Last Boy Scout," is still an acute source of embarrassment to him.)
Another call, this time from Sandy Gallin. They are planning to see the Off-Broadway comedy "Jeffrey" by Paul Rudnick, about a gay man who decides to give up sex in the age of AIDS. Diane von Furstenberg and Fran Lebowitz are set to join them. Geffen's close circle of friends in show business include homosexuals and heterosexuals, but he speaks with rage at insinuations that there's a "gay mafia" in Hollywood.
"Let's just say that there are successful gay people who are aware of each other," he says. "And if you're in a minority group that comes with the territory. But if you talk about a gay mafia involved in some kind of nefarious activity, that's ridiculous."
Coincidentally, he tosses over several letters congratulating him on his decision to declare his sexuality last fall. "I wasn't looking to be gay," he says. "I was quite upset when I discovered that was part of my life. I wished it would go away. But you can't change who you are. And I tried to fight it in the beginning. And then I had a cancer scare in the mid-70's. And that turned out to be a mistake, and I thought, 'Life is too short.' "
A call comes in to Geffen from Larry Gagosian, a longtime friend who, like him, started in the mail room of the William Morris Agency. Gagosian, whose abrasive tactics have made him a controversial figure in the Madison Avenue art world, advises Geffen on his expanding collection of Jasper Johns, Jackson Pollock, Roy Lichtenstein, Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Frank Stella and Andy Warhol.
"I've decided this is one of the few good things to do with my money," says Geffen. "In the end, you're just a renter anyway. You only own these things for as long as you live. After that, who knows? If I live until I'm 80, I'll have 30 more years of collecting. If the collection is big enough, I'll build a museum. And if not, I'll leave it to a museum."
In the meantime, Geffen has been reading and tearing up the faxes and notes on his desk. There are several sad, hand-scrawled letters from men with AIDS -- or families of AIDS-stricken patients -- asking for money. All the letters will be answered. Every now and then, when a letter deeply touches him, or comes from someone he once knew, he writes a check for as much as $10,000.
At about 11:30, Geffen makes an impromptu decision to have lunch with Kirk Varnedoe, director of the Museum of Modern Art department of painting and sculpture. Varnedoe may or may not have a lunch date, but he eagerly agrees to see Geffen, a member of the museum's acquisitions committee. They meet at Michael's on West 55th Street, where the talk ranges from the museum's expansion plans to the dangers and high costs of shipping paintings to exhibitions.
In the limousine afterward, on the way to Calvin Klein's offices in the garment center, Geffen says: "In the field of art, to be able to have lunch with Kirk Varnedoe is thrilling. I met him at Si and Victoria Newhouse's dinner one night. Barnett Newman's widow was there. That's the part of me that's a fan. Like when I was a kid and went to the Brooklyn Paramount. Well, my interest has expanded, and it's not just rock-and-roll."
HIS BACKGROUND -- AND his upward ascent -- resemble the rise of the mythic executives he idolizes -- Louis B. Mayer and Harry Warner.
He talks a great deal about his mother, a diminutive immigrant named Batya Geffen, who called her younger son "King David" and supported the family with a corset-and-brassiere business in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. She died in 1988. Yet it was his father, Abraham, who probably had the greater impact.
"My father died in 1960," says Geffen. "He was an intellectual. . . . She made the money and he read a lot. He wasn't successful or ambitious. He spoke lots of languages. There were times that kids said to me, 'What does your father do?' and I had to make something up because I actually didn't know what he did."
At New Utrecht High School, where in his senior yearbook he predicted he would be a dentist, Geffen graduated in 1960 with a barely passing 66 average. He tried a semester at the University of Texas, and then Brooklyn College, but dropped out, hungering to earn a living in the entertainment business and to live in Los Angeles, which seemed, for him, as far away from Brooklyn as the moon.
He worked for a while as an usher at CBS and landed a job in the mail room of the William Morris Agency, a training ground for agents. Because the agency demanded college graduates, Geffen lied and said he had just completed U.C.L.A. Convinced that his employers would check, he arrived at dawn every morning to open the mail. When the letter from U.C.L.A. finally arrived, he steamed it open and inserted a forged note on university stationery that he had graduated. It was then that he began a close friendship with another agency employee, Barry Diller.
GEFFEN WAS TOLD BY older agents that the only path to success for a young man was the fledgling music business. He began hunting for talent and soon found the brooding singer and composer, Laura Nyro, who wrote a string of Top 10 hits for other artists. When her publishing company, half-owned by Geffen, was sold in 1969 to CBS, Geffen received $2 million in CBS stock. He was 25.
In 1970, the relentlessly aggressive agent-turned-manager started his own record company, which was called Asylum because, he says, "it was all craziness." Geffen's skill at tapping talent was extraordinary: Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, the Eagles. After running the company for five years, Geffen sold it to Warner Communications. In 1975, its chairman, Steven J. Ross, named Geffen vice chairman of Warner Brothers, the company's Hollywood studio. The job's corporate and bureaucratic restrictions left him stifled.
He quit in 1976, wealthy and unhappy. Later that year bladder cancer was diagnosed, and he dropped out of business altogether, spending a lot of time with the sybaritic crowd at Studio 54 as he waited to die. It was the age just before AIDS -- and Geffen partied, taught business courses at U.C.L.A. and Yale and started to buy art and real estate.
In late 1979, the cancer scare proved to be a false alarm. Geffen lined up backing for his own record label, Geffen Records, from Mo Ostin, then the chairman of Warner Brothers Records.
It is common lore in Hollywood that Geffen was constantly in search of father figures, and found one in Steve Ross. Actually, the man who proved to be his mentor was Ahmet Ertegun, head of Atlantic Records. "Ahmet took a fatherly interest in me," Geffen says. "Steve never took a fatherly interest. I was an asset of his."
IN HIS FEARS OF growing increasingly isolated, Geffen is haunted by the specter of Ross, the chairman of Time Warner who died of cancer last year. Geffen had broken furiously with Ross, his one-time boss in the late 1980's, after a sharp disagreement over the value of his music company. The breach never healed, even as Ross lay dying. And what Geffen realized was that despite Ross's public reputation for social as well as business acumen, he died a lonely man, his life clouded by a series of troubled marriages, a distant family and few real friends.
"He did not have an easy life, Steve," says Geffen, cryptically. "He didn't make it easy for other people but he sure didn't have an easy life."
Geffen is sitting in his Eames chair in his open, simple, Zen-like office atop the two-story building he used to own on Sunset Boulevard near Beverly Hills. (Geffen bought the building in 1985 for $5 million and sold it in 1991 for $13.5 million.) The office -- like all homes he owns -- is sparely furnished.
"We all die unhealed," Geffen says firmly. "We all acquire damage as infants and children and we work on removing those scars all of our lives. You won't heal everything, but what's important is the work.
"I'm a great believer in anything that makes you 1 percent better," he goes on. "So I try everything. Freudian. Jungian. Est. Life Spring. Course in Miracles. Twelve Steps. I have pain from time to time. I have joy from time to time."
Geffen is asked what more he could want, and to talk about his future. He takes a sip of herbal tea. "Do any of us really have a clue? We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. Or what word will come up in a conversation that will change our lives. You can be in the shower and scrubbing under your arm and find a lump that wasn't there yesterday. I'm doing things here and now. Life is evolving. Every day life evolves."
"Evolving" is one of Geffen's favorite words, but his close friends say his life, while more serene than before, is hardly moving toward contentment.
"Washington? This is an entirely new sphere for David," says Barry Diller, the former Fox executive who is now chairman of the home-shopping network QVC. "Think if it in geopolitical terms and David putting it in balance with the other spheres of his life."
But what does David want?
"What does David say?" Diller replies with a slight taunt.
And Gallin, clearly nervous about speaking of his close friend and offending him, says Geffen's life is a complicated one. "Is he lonely? Well, he's too busy to be lonely." And then he pauses and says, "I guess you can be a little lonely and always be busy."
AS GEFFEN WALKS INTO Calvin Klein's showroom, the designer is frantically preparing for a new fashion show of men's jeans and clothing. Klein hugs Geffen. The two are old friends but, beyond that, it was Geffen who bailed out the designer last year by buying up about $62 million in junk-bond debt of Klein's company, enabling it to avoid a principal payment.
As if that weren't enough, it was Geffen's idea to hire Marky Mark, the rapper, for only $100,000 to promote Klein's jockey briefs. The ads, and the financial results, were sensational.
Geffen's inner circle has come to rely heavily on his good advice. Jeff Katzenberg well remembers the time Geffen bluntly told him that the musical scores for Disney's animated films were lackluster and implored him to hire the team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman to compose Broadway-style scores. The results were "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin," which will probably make more money for Disney than any films in the company's history.
In the showroom, Klein and his business partner, Barry Schwartz -- the two grew up together in the Bronx -- are eager for Geffen's approval. The three men survey the jeans and jackets and shoes on the male models in the frenetic showroom.
"Is that the cool thing now, to turn up jeans at the bottom?" asks Geffen.
"It's very cool, David," says Klein.
"I'm so uncool," says Geffen.
"Look at the suits, David," says Klein.
"How much?"
"Generally $1,400 to $2,000, but now we're doing a line, less expensive, for the Bloomingdale's customer, the Macy's customer. Not the expensive stuff like Barneys and Bergdorf's."
"I like it. How much are the jeans?"
"Forty to fifty bucks in the store. Retail."
"Terrific," says Geffen. "The pockets look great."
"It's the poor look," says Klein. "It's the 90's. You don't want to look rich."
Geffen, who's wearing finely pressed Calvin Klein jeans and Reeboks, nods.
ON THE FLIGHT BACK TO LOS ANGELES Geffen eats licorice jellybeans as he watches the first cut of "M. Butterfly," the film adaptation of the hit play he produced. The film, which stars Jeremy Irons, was directed by David Cronenberg and is not set to be released until the fall. But as soon as the movie ends, Geffen grabs the phone and tries to reach Terry Semel, the president of Warner Brothers, who is in Aspen.
When he finally connects, Geffen is exuberant. "Terry, I'm over the moon. I just saw 'M. Butterfly.' I mean . . . Academy Award. It's great. And I can't believe we made it for $17 million."
The other passenger on the plane is Edward Lampert, the 30-year-old president of E.S.L. Investments and a major investment adviser to Geffen. "I view us as being sort of in the stay-rich business rather than the get-rich business," says Lampert, who is catching a lift on the plane for a date with a woman in Los Angeles.
Geffen, as is his custom, is plying his passengers with potato knishes, delicatessen and fresh fruit -- and offering Lampert romantic advice. "Send her a bowl of tulips -- that helps," he says. Geffen calls his Los Angeles office to make sure that Lampert has a Mercedes waiting for him in Malibu.
At the Burbank Airport, a Lincoln Town Car is waiting for Geffen. Reaching home as darkness falls, Geffen bounds out of the car. His Pritikin cook, Edwin Saks, announces dinner: Cornish game hen, orzo with shiitake mushrooms, spaghetti squash, roasted bell pepper sauce and nonfat banana cream pie.
The whoosh of the Pacific's waves casts a stillness over the house. David Geffen picks up the phone to ask a friend if he wants to drop in for a movie.

Madcap Millionaires

BYLINE: By Frank Rich

 BODY:
THE GREEDY 1980'S stand in such disrepute that Michael Milken, desperate for a fresh, just-folks image, poses for photographs without his wig. "Barbarians at the Gate," the book about Wall Street buccaneering, turns up on television as a scabrous farce by Larry Gelbart, the author of "M*A*S*H." The big money, big hair and big scams of the Reagan-Bush decade now loom in memory as a decadent apocalypse to rival Weimar Germany and prerevolutionary czarist Russia. Yet once again America's love affair with madcap millionaires is heating up.
Times remain hard, after all, and the egalitarian buzzword of the new Clinton age, sacrifice, as yet offers more long-term hope than short-term help. In hard times, Americans traditionally turn to the fabulously rich and famous for escapist entertainment, and this economic drought has had no shortage of moneyed clowns. 
 Think of George Steinbrenner marking his baseball comeback by posing as Napoleon on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Or of Donald Trump choosing Broadway's fabled vaudeville shrine, the Palace, to announce Marla Maples's pregnancy. Or of Rupert Murdoch celebrating his re-entry into New York City's tabloid wars by having his limousine take him slumming about town to peek at the proletarian readers nostalgic for the salad days of Son of Sam.
Madcap millionaires have in fact rolled off the assembly line at The New York Post this year. First came grinning Steven Hoffenberg, who vowed to revive the paper by printing only good news, then found himself impaled by the bad news other papers reported about his financial empire. Next was Abe Hirschfeld, a crackpot whose fortnight as Post publisher passed instantly into local legend. It took the publisher of Screw, Al Goldstein, to sum up the emotions of a grateful city when praising Hirschfeld on Don Imus's morning radio show: "I like Abe because he makes me look very sane. He's the uncle who salivates, whose teeth are encrusted with food, who, at all public affairs, embarrasses you."
That's what we like about these millionaires: For all their money, they often look more ridiculous than we do. They are men of whom it can be said: If they're so rich, why aren't they smart? Their prototypes can be found in Hollywood screwball comedies of the Depression, in which the idle rich distracted the unemployed masses from their woes by sinking to a level of foolishness beyond the idle poor's means. In a typical Preston Sturges comedy, "The Palm Beach Story," the butt of the jokes is John D. Hackensacker 3d, played by Rudy Vallee. He spends a fortune to woo Claudette Colbert, who takes the money and runs back to her strapped inventor husband, Joel McCrea.
A half-century later, little has changed. In "Indecent Proposal," our own era's idea of a screwball comedy, it is Demi Moore who must decide between the madcap billionaire played by Robert Redford and her strapped middle-class husband, architect Woody Harrelson. Redford is in the madcap mold because he offers a million dollars (plus a new wardrobe) to sleep with Moore -- Vallee offered Colbert $99,000 (plus a new wardrobe) -- and because he has made his fortune without having any discernible profession. "He's not the better man," Harrelson protests to his wandering wife. "He's just got more money." That reassuring Hollywood moral never goes out of fashion.
IT'S WHEN THE RICH DO BEHAVE AS IF THEY think themselves better than anyone else that Americans bare their populist teeth and turn on them. We love the filthy rich as long as they act like rascals, not kings, and confine their overreaching to such certified playpens as show biz, gambling resorts and tabloid journalism. The love affair ends the moment they make a greedy or mean-spirited foray into the real world, whether to grab other people's money, treat commoners like dirt or flount 90210 morality in lower zip codes. Woody Allen and Mia Farrow were belovedly flaky as long as they kept their titillating unconventional off-screen relationship on screen. But once their private lives bled beyond the fairylands of "Hannah and Her Sisters" and Elaine's into a judge's chamber, they were seen as let-'em-eat-cake aristocrats, ripe for beheading.
In the televised "Barbarians at the Gate," the difference between a madcap millionaire and a despised millionaire is clearly drawn. The madcap model is vulgar, self-made, fun-loving F. Ross Johnson, played by down-home James Garner. By contrast, the leveraged-buyout czar Henry Kravis dines on rabbit in gilded royal surroundings and condescends to the help. Lest anyone doubt that Kravis's style of millionaire is un-American, he is played by a British actor (Jonathan Pryce).
For Bill Clinton, America's adoration of good ole madcap millionaires and rage at 80's money-grubbers presents a political mine field. While the President's domestic agenda is as democratic as F. D. R.'s, his millionaire-laden Administration, typified by Robert E. Rubin (1992 Wall Street salary: $26.5 million), is hardly madcap. Zoe Baird might have survived her trial in the court of public relations if she had played her big scene like Katharine Hepburn in "Bringing Up Baby" instead of Sigourney Weaver in "Working Girl."
But the billionaire Clinton must worry about most is one outside the White House: Ross Perot, whose last television address was broadcast the same weekend as "Barbarians at the Gate." The two Rosses seemed locked in an adorability contest. "I've never been a big fan of debt," said Garner's Ross Johnson on Saturday night, anticipating the other Ross's lecture on Sunday night.
Clinton has made a strategic decision to rip off Perot's madcap mask. So while Perot tries to sell himself as a populist billionaire who drives his own car, Clinton is determined to smoke out Perot the closet megalomaniac, more J. R. than James Garner, who takes his marbles and goes home when he can't get his way. When Perot refused to support the Administration's economic plan, the President began trying to expose the petulant Perot by needling him with insults.
And why not? Given the swelling ranks of Perot's unofficial third party, United We Stand America, the fate of the Clinton Administration may well ride on whether the Texan turns out to be the madcap hero of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or just another mad barbarian at the gate.

Smilin' Thru?

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
Congress is trying to pull a fast one on tax policy. No, this is not a diatribe about VAT -- for "value added tax," wrongly called the "VAT tax" by the Redundance Kids -- but a shot across the bow of Senator Dale Bumpers and Representative Robert T. Matsui, authors of a tax bill that would enshrine in law the informal spelling of through as thru.
Comes now (a fine legal archaism) Anne Heausler of the firm of Fulbright & Jaworski, L.L.P. (short for Limited Liability Partnership, which I assume combines the protection of a corporation with the camaraderie of a partnership) with a fax of a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code. Our linguistically swinging legislators hope to provide capital gains savings for investors "who make high-risk, long-term, growth-oriented venture and seed capital investments in start-up and other small enterprises," a practice known on the Street as taking a flier on little cats and dogs. 
 Our solons want to create what they call a "pass-thru entity," which they define as "any partnership, any S corporation, any regulated investment company and any common trust fund." To drive home their enthusiasm for clipping the old-fashioned ough off through and substituting a zingy, with-it u, the would-be lawmakers add a section on a "look-thru in case of subsidiaries," which is defined incomprehensibly but I think is intended to mean "disregard," as in "That snooty White House legislative aide looked right thru me."
This practice is known as lite legislating, which occurs in Washington every nite. Simplified spelling is an enterprise that was undertaken with fervent dedication by no less a language maven than Noah Webster, and carried on with passion by George Bernard Shaw and later by Col. Robert McCormick, The Chicago Tribune's publisher, but never caught on, no matter how authoritatively or resolutely presented. Certainly usage tends to simplify spelling (alright, already), but native speakers hate to be told by philologists, advertising copywriters and other brisk neatness freaks how to fix the old lingo. We'll make it easier in our own time, the public seems to say -- just don't push us.
Merriam-Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary treats thru as an unstigmatized variant of through, but not even that publisher's anything-goes Dictionary of English Usage greenlites the spelling in noting, "Thru was on the first list of reformed spellings issued by the American Philological Association in 1876," adding, "As the organized interest in spelling reform waned, however, the use of thru in publications also shrank. . . . It remains a distant second choice in print."
The only place the hapless reform zips along at high speed is on the New York State Thruway, a thoroughfare that is not spelled throughway. The "reform" may make it into general speech one day; it's nice to see the old, unsimplified spelling hanging in there, tho.
Incidentally, many lawyers, even those who do not limit their liability, send faxes with a "confidentiality notice" boxed in funereal black. It goes: "The documents accompanying this telecopy transmission may contain confidential information belonging to the sender which [sic] is legally privileged. . . . If you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any disclosure, copying, distribution or the taking of any action in reliance on the contents of this telecopied information is strictly prohibited."
Henceforth, when I get such foolish attempts at unsolicited solicitations from solicitors on the cover sheet of a fax, I will automatically blaze back with the fol lowing: "Your attempt to burden this machine, which is my personal property, with your unwanted and demonstrably unconfidential information is summarily rejected; my fax machine is programmed to spew out telecopies of whatever it receives, whenever it gets the urge, with happy abandon to all and sundry, and if you find such dissemination objectionable, you may cease and desist from further unsought importunings and stick your information printed on my paper in your ear."
Have I gotten thru?
 
LEFT IS NOT RIGHT
 "DOES IT BOTHER YOU as much as it does me," writes Ray Bradbury (whose new book is "Switch on This Night"), "to hear former Communist groups in Russia described as right-wingers or conservatives?"
Yeah, it does; where do those old-line radicals, loony lefties and die-hard pinkos get off trying to climb into my post-modern political lifeboat?
The problem is that the left-right spectrum no longer works. The bird metaphor began in 1707 in descriptions of the right and left wings of an army; in the French National Assembly, the radicals were seated at the President's cote gauche, or left side, with the conservative nobles on the right and the moderates in front. But confusion reigns today in the republics of the former Soviet Union, because the forces of change toward conservative market economies are described as being on the left, while the old radicals -- who long for a return to the discredited statist command economies -- are said to be on the right. What a halftime this has been!
Some newscasters, sensitive to the anger of American right-wingers at being lumped in with the apparatchiks of the Evil Empire they helped defeat, prefer a spectrum different from left-right. Sam Donaldson of ABC, for example, uses a variation of hard-soft, describing the former Communist leaders as hard-liners. However, this leaves only soft-liners to denote the reformers, and nobody likes to be called a softie. (This contrast began with the Hard Shells versus Soft Shells, also known as Barnburners, fighting over slavery policy at the 1848 Democratic convention in Baltimore.)
Metaphorically, where does that leave us? It's the reformers versus the hard-liners, which is no metaphor at all. Worse, the hard-liners want to change the current Yeltsin Government, not the usual goal of a hard line, while the reformers want to keep the executive in power, not the usual goal of reform.
Somebody is going to make a big reputation, maybe even a fortune, coming up with a new metaphor to describe the clash between returners to the old way and keepers of the new way. Lites and Heavies? Ups and Downs? Suggestions will be entertained.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Act 2 Around Times Square

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
THE three buildings certainly look impressive. There's 1585 Broadway, a silvery, 1.3 million-square-foot behemoth, towering over 47th and 48th Streets.
A couple of blocks south, between 45th and 46th Streets, there's 1540 Broadway, its green tint and striking prow highlighting its million square feet of bulk. 
 Then there's the small-by-comparison 750 Seventh Avenue, a stark black 580,000-square-footer perched between 49th and 50th Streets, once envisioned as Rockefeller Center's cousin to the west.
But an imposing presence does not a successful building make. And indeed, until recently all three seemed headed for disaster. Two were barely tenanted; one, 1540, stood totally empty. Lenders were snapping at their developers' heels and all three seemed to be sinking into a paralysis that neither their foreclosing lenders nor their besieged developers could ever pull out of.
Today, the buildings' fortunes are as disparate as their appearances.
Ian Bruce Eichner's project, 1540 Broadway, is out of the fiscal woods. Last year Bertelsmann Inc., the big German entertainment company, bought it as its headquarters for $119 million, and is all but moved in. Mr. Eichner and the lenders lost nearly $200 million on the building, but at least it is off their books. As for renting the retail space or any excess office space -- well, that's now Bertelsmann's problem, not theirs. And it's usually a lot easier to rent space in a thriving, occupied building, anyway.
David Solomon's 750 Seventh Avenue is looking to be the Little Building That Could. It has only one office tenant, Mendes & Mount, a law firm that took at a rock-bottom rent about 100,000 feet of "as is" space previously occupied by the now-disbanded law firm of Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O'Donnell & Wehyer.
But at least one company, Societe Generale, has expressed an interest in buying it -- albeit at a price that few expect the banks to accept. Caroline's Comedy Club has taken a chunk of the retail space and several office rental deals are said to be in the offing.
The one big loser seems to be 1585 Broadway, also a Solomon building. Thanks to ongoing disputes over the building's semi-finished condition, its sole occupant, the Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn law firm, did not begin paying rent for its 11 floors until last November, more than two years after it moved in..
And what had seemed a done deal only a year ago -- the sale of the building to Primerica Corporation, which would have used it to house its Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company stock brokerage unit -- fell apart when Sanford I. Weill, Primerica's chairman, arranged to buyShearson Lehman Brothers and made plans to shoehorn Smith Barney into vacant Shearson space.
Attempts to find another buyer, or even major renters, have been thwarted time and again by disagreements among the Bank of Montreal, Swiss Bank Corporation and the Toronto-Dominion Bank, the banks that control the building.
Why such different fates for properties that first seemed equally destined for greatness, and then equally destined to shoot down the tubes together?
All three were conceived in the mid-80's, when New York City's economy was vibrant, when Times Square redevelopment looked like it would really happen and when the city had relaxed its West Side zoning rules to allow developers to build the type of tall structures that offer gargantuan paybacks.
And all three had developers with glittering track records.
David and Jean Solomon, a husband-and-wife team, had made a fortune renovating Manhattan lofts in the mid-70's and later, building Tower 49, an office building on 49th Street east of Fifth Avenue that they later sold for multiples of its cost.
Ian Bruce Eichner, a lawyer turned residential real estate developer, had also done well with brownstones and condominiums and cut his commercial teeth on Cityspire, the office building on 56th Street between Sixth and Seventh.
But by the time the buildings were ready for occupancy, the New York economy had faltered, the Times Square redevelopment project was on hold and what had been a seller's market in commercial real estate had turned into one where renters and buyers dictated the terms.
The buildings sank into bankruptcy, making them even less attractive to the dwindling number of space-hunters left.
"Their lenders consistently overvalued the market and they just would never reach far enough to close deals," said Franklin Speyer, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate brokerage and management company.
Indeed, the answer to the divergent fates lies less in the buildings themselves or the economy that greeted them, than in the attitudes of the owners, the degree of risk-taking their banks would allow and, in a few cases, pure luck.
 
1585 Broadway
A Home-Run Deal Proves Elusive
 WITH bankruptcy goes bureaucracy, and with bureaucracy goes stretched-out negotiations. That, more than anything else, has kept 1585 Broadway relatively empty and unsold.
"If the banks had moved quicker, the sale would have been a done deal by the time Sandy Weill made his acquisition," said one broker.
This may or may not be true. After all, Mr. Weill might have persuaded Smith Barney to use its own stalling tactics while he was negotiating the Shearson acquisition.
Nonetheless, an inability to agree on anything seems to pervade the building to this day.
"This is a good building, with great large floorplates and a lot of usable space," said Richard S. Hayden, whose architectural firm, Swanke Hayden Connell, has analyzed the building for potential buyers and renters. "The deals are falling apart because of the negotiation problems."
Mr. Solomon declined to rehash painful memories, but those close to him say his frustration has been monumental.
"He had deals with tenants up and down the board, but the banks simply wouldn't give the go-ahead," said one associate.
Mr. Eichner, for one, offers him total sympathy.
"It's like the Vietnam peace talks over there, where they can spend six months arguing about the shape of the table," the rival developer said. "I don't think anyone short of Attila the Hun could deal with that bank group."
Officially, Mr. Solomon's investment group still holds title to the building. In March, though, the bankruptcy court approved a reorganization plan that will ease the transfer of ownership to the banks. No one expects that to break any impasses, though.
Apparently, the banks are still looking for a home run -- a buyer for the entire building, or at least a tenant large enough to take many floors as well as the building's base.
"I wanted to show a 100,000-foot tenant the top floors and the banks weren't even interested in showing the space," said Franklin Speyer, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield.
David T. Lawrence, senior vice president of Hines Interests Limited Partnership, which is now representing the building, concedes that anything less than a mega-user doesn't interest him much, at least for now.
"It's just not always good strategy to lease the best space first," he said. "You don't want to lose a user who will take 350,000 feet and the base because you rented someone else the top of the building."
Potential buyers are not exactly tripping over each other.
Jarchow Investment Group of Dallas and Kuwait International Investment Corporation bid on the building a few years ago, but their joint bid was not pursued because the banks were so sure the Smith Barney deal would go through.
Mr. Lawrence said the Jarchow deal was still on the table, but "there's been a lapse in communications, and negotiations are not currently active."
The problem again is probably price. A speculative investor would face enormous workletter costs to rent the space and would probably offer no more than $130 million or so for a building that cost nearly triple that to build. There's no reason to expect the banks will take that kind of bottom-line hit.
"Banks are always terrified of selling a building cheap and two weeks later having the buyer flip it at twice the price," said Alan J. Pomerantz, head of Weil, Gotshal & Manges's real estate department. "It's always, 'Let's just wait a few more weeks and see what we can get.' "
There's been some good news, though. Proskauer, which had sued the banks and Solomon Equities, has finally settled and begun paying its rent. And, although it seems far from a satisfied tenant, it has expressed no desire to move.
"We would certainly have expected them to have finished the elevators and the building's base long before this," said Herbert T. Weinstein, a Proskauer partner, "and it really would be nice to have other tenants in the building."
Mr. Lawrence admits to frustration, but not to depression. "The activity we see at 1540 and 750 encourages us," he said. "At least it shows that the West Side is an acceptable location."
 
750 Seventh Avenue
Hurry Up and Wait: A Study in Frustration
 IT can take a lot of patience to negotiate a deal at 750 Seventh. Just ask Mr. Speyer of Cushman & Wakefield, who put Caroline's Comedy Club in the building's retail space. He thought he had negotiated a pretty solid deal with David Solomon, only to discover that Citibank and the other banks controlling the bankrupt building thought otherwise.
"The bank's desire to protect their investment added eight months to the process," he said. "When you're dealing with a bank consortium, a negotiation process can turn into a cabinet meeting."
To be fair, that frustration is not unique to 750 Seventh Avenue, or even 1585 Broadway. David Solomon (no relation to the developer), an executive vice president of the Harper-Lawrence brokerage firm, remembers the horrors he went through trying to negotiate a renewal and expansion deal for Frederick Atkins, a major tenant at 1515 Broadway, when Equitable Real Estate, then its owner, filed for bankruptcy protection for the building in 1991.
"Can you believe it took two tortuous years to negotiate expansion space?" Mr. Solomon said. "We had to go through 10 drafts of a 150-page lease. Without the bankruptcy, it would have been three drafts and 75 pages."
Still, at 750 Seventh Avenue there seems to be something else at play -- a strong belief that holding out for high rents remains the best long-run way to go. After all, an empty building -- or one with high-rent tenants -- remains easier to sell than one that is locked into tenant-friendly leases.
"Citibank has been really bullish about pricing; they simply will not treat this as a distressed product," said Mary Ann Tighe, executive managing director of Edward S. Gordon.
In fact, some brokers insist that what they call the banks' voraciousness consistently scuttles deals.
"Sometimes it seems that as soon as they smell an interested prospect, they raise their asking price," said Mitchell S. Steir, a senior managing director at Julien J. Studley, the real estate brokerage. "I've had them come back to the table for second-round negotiations with suggested terms that had gotten worse, not better."
But unlike 1585 Broadway, 750 Seventh Avenue does not represent an impregnable wall to would-be tenants. The banks have hired Newmark Real Estate as leasing agent for the building.
Newmark, in turn, has arranged to prebuild some space for quick rental to small tenants and is aggressively marketing the larger blocks to brokers.
The Newmark people are playing host for breakfasts and guide for building tours for any tenant brokers they can corral. They are offering Newmark's own tenant reps cash for leads. A fancy marketing brochure stressing the building's technological aspects and its great river views is just coming off the press.
Slowly, deals are moving. Ernst & Young is said to be ready to rent 50,000 square feet for a regional office and several brokers say they are making nibbles at other space.
Many of the deals may still get skewered, though. The banks will not let Newmark hold anything approaching a fire sale. James D. Kuhn, Newmark's president, says he is holding out for rent from the mid-$30's for large blocks in the building's middle to the $40's for the top floors.
"We've turned away tenants who won't pay what we see as market value," he said. The reason, said another broker close to the bankers, is that the hope for a buyer still remains paramount.
"Like everyone else, their main hope is for Bertelsmann II," he said.
 
 
 
1540 Broadway
Turning a Renter Into a Landlord
 FROM the first, 1540 Broadway had things going for it that neither 750 Seventh Avenue nor 1585 Broadway had. For one, it was totally empty, which meant a new owner wouldn't have to worry about an angry Proskauer or an insolvent Olwine Connelly plopped in the building's middle.
And it offered an empty block of 850,000 feet plus 150,000 feet of retail space, enough to accommodate even a large owner/user's needs.
But it also had less tangible but equally important assets: a developer who was comfortable bringing his banks to the negotiating table early, a lead bank willing to rely on outside evaluations of the market and a tenant's representative team that could persuade a recalcitrant company that it really did want to buy a building.
Indeed, if anyone had told Bertelsmann management several years ago that they would soon own Manhattan property, they would have laughed. They were a music company, they were a publishing company -- but the one business they had little desire to get into was real estate.
"We wanted to spend our capital on media properties," said Christian Alpers, a Bertelsmann senior vice president.
What they did want to do was lower their occupancy costs. Their Bantam, Doubleday, Dell subsidiary was locked into a way-over-market lease -- rent in the high $40's in a market that was commanding maybe $32 -- for 250,000 feet at 666 Fifth Avenue, which didn't expire until the year 2000. The BMG Music Group had the mirror-image situation: It was paying less than $17 a foot for a similar amount of space at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, but that lease was expiring in 1994.
"We were hired to lower Bantam's costs and find a great deal for BMG, but we were told not to even consider an equity deal," recalled Jeffrey A. Lichtenberg, executive vice president of Peter R. Friedman, which represented Bertelsmann.
Mr. Lichtenberg and his crew looked at 1221 and 1251 Avenue of the Americas, 1585 Broadway -- and yes, 1540 Broadway -- but no one came up with a deal that Bertelsmann liked. The sticking point in almost every case: Bertelsmann wanted the new landlord to take over Bantam's lease and the landlords were having none of it.
According to Mr. Lichtenberg, Mr. Eichner and his lenders showed signs that they might bend on that score. But it became a moot point: the tenants and their brokers ran the numbers, and realized that, with a credit-worthy tenant like Bertelsmann renting a huge chunk of the building, the banks could probably sell it for as much as $140 million. As a vacant building they'd be lucky to get $100 million, if they found a buyer at all.
"Why should the banks get the vigorish?" Mr. Lichtenberg asked.
Why indeed. By mid-April 1991, Bertelsmann was thinking "buy."
Still, getting Mr. Eichner, Citibank, 16 Japanese banks, a brokerage team and a huge cost-conscious company to agree on price and terms was another matter. Mr. Lichtenberg recalls that they had arrived at a deal by fall of 1991 only to have Citibank back out at the last minute. (Citibank did not return repeated phone calls.)
"Internally at Citibank, groups were fighting each other and nobody had the authority to make a deal," he said.
Actually, Newmark's Jimmy Kuhn, then an independent consultant Citibank had hired to advise it of what the market values were and to drum up alternative buyers, says he recommended that Citibank turn down that deal.
It would have allowed Bertelsmann to buy the office portion of the building only and stuck Citibank with the lease for 666 Fifth.
"That was too much of a hit to ask the bank to take," Mr. Kuhn said.
Finally, Bertelsmann paid a lowball price, but it had to buy the entire building, including retail space, a theater and a garage. And it retained the lease for 666 Fifth Avenue.
"It was a good buy, but it was a great sell," Mr. Kuhn said. Mr. Alpers's take was: "We could finance this at rates that a real estate developer could only dream about."
Mr. Eichner gets much of the credit for the deal, too. He was the liaison between the brokers, the tenants and the banks. Many say it was his idea to put the building into a prepackaged bankruptcy, which saved enormously on transfer taxes. And, he helped the brokers persuade Bertelsmann that the banks would give them a fairly low price on the building if they backed off on the lease-takeover requirement for the 666 Fifth space.
"The question wasn't R for Rent or B for Buy, but C for Cheapest way to do it," Mr. Eichner said.
Today, Bertelsmann has moved into most of the building. It still has the Broadway retail space to let out, as well as about 150,000 feet of contiguous office space left over. Bertelsmann's deal with the city requires it to prebuild about a third of that space for use as "incubators," places that companies that do not currently have offices in the city can rent cheaply on a month-to-month basis while they look for larger quarters elsewhere.
Bertelsmann has also agreed to provide a commercial concierge who will help these newcomers, particularly foreigners, open bank accountants, establish busines contacts and otherwise get a foothold in the city.
And Mr. Lichtenberg says that deals for the remaining space are in advanced negotiations. In fact, he says, one full-floor deal is ready to close.
"We could negotiate that in a couple months," he said. "After all, with Bertelsmann as the owner, we only have to get an O.K. from one party."

HEADLINE: Bank Robbers Are Turning More Violent

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
BANK robbers in New Jersey are becoming more violent, more brazen and better organized, Federal law-enforcement officials say.
And despite increasingly sophisticated security measures, the number of robberies has been growing. In 1992, officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said, there were 121 bank robberies in the state, as compared with 109 in 1991 and 94 in 1990. 
 "We're seeing the re-emergence of bank robbery gangs," said James B. Lamb, a spokesman in the Newark office of the F.B.I. One such a gang is now being sought, he said, in connection with robberies this year in Paramus, Clark, Edison and River Edge.
"And we're seeing an increase in takeovers," Mr. Lamb said, explaining that in several recent robberies gangs have completely "taken over" the bank lobby and teller area by brandishing weapons and ordering everyone in the bank onto the floor while they empty the cash drawers.
 
The Old 'Standard' Bandit
 The latest bank robberies, Mr. Lamb said, are in contrast to the "standard event" of the past when a lone bandit made a quiet demand for money, usually without actually producing a weapon. That kind of bandit took whatever money the teller provided and left the bank before anyone but the teller knew what had happened.
Garey S. Chin, who is supervisor of the violent-crimes unit of the F.B.I.'s Newark office, said that he believed that bank robberies run in cycles and that a new one has begun as a number of convicted robbers have now completed their prison terms. "A lot of them are recidivists from 10 or 12 years ago," he said.
Mr. Chin also attributed the start of the current cycle to economic conditions, and Kurt E. Schaub, spokesman for the New Jersey Bankers Association in Princeton, agreed.
"In a down economy," Mr. Schaub said, "let's just say that people are looking for alternative ways to supplement their income."
Particularly troubling for law-enforcement officials, Mr. Chin said, is the phenomenon of gang-style holdups. He said that an organized gang appears to have been responsible for a string of 10 holdups committed between October and December 1992. The F.B.I., he said, has arrested six people in connection with those robberies.
He also described the recent robberies in Paramus, Edison, Clark and River Edge as being the work of an organized gang. A March 26 holdup in Paramus, for example, is typical of such a gang-style robbery, he said.
Capt. Claude Majcher of the Paramus Police Department said that on March 26 about 10 A.M. three men armed with handguns entered the Midland Avenue branch of the Chemical Bank New Jersey. One of the men ordered customers in the lobby to get down on the floor while his accomplices vaulted over the teller counter at opposite ends.
Once behind the counter, the robbers ordered the tellers to open their cash drawers. One teller, who happened to be standing in front of another teller's cash drawer, did not have a key for the drawer and was unable to comply with the robber's demand.
"Apparently he got impatient and fired off a round at the drawer," Captain Majcher said. A fragment of the bullet ricocheted off the cash drawer and struck the teller in the face, causing a minor injury, Captain Majcher said.
 
Another Shot Fired
 The robber then fired another shot at a second cash drawer. Neither shot opened either drawer. The other robber was busy emptying drawers at the other end of the counter.
After less than one minute, Captain Majcher said, the bandit who was on the lobby side of the teller counter said, "Let's get out of here," whereupon the three men left the bank and jumped into a waiting car. The gang took about $10,000.
Seconds later, the police arrived at the scene in response to a silent alarm that had been activated by a bank employee. They got a description of the getaway car and found it, empty, about a half-mile away in a parking lot on Route 17.
Apparently, Captain Majcher said, the robbers switched from the getaway car, which had been stolen, to another vehicle and then disappeared into traffic on Route 17.
"We found the stolen car within a minute of them leaving the bank," Captain Majcher said. "That's how close we were."
A similar strategy appears to have been used by a gang that held up a bank in River Edge last month. The bank, a branch of the Midlantic National Bank, had been robbed once before, in January 1992.
 
No 'Bandit Barriers' Used
 Another common denominator in the two robberies was that neither bank was outfitted with "bandit barriers" -- bulletproof Plexiglas panels installed on top of the teller counter to make it difficult for robbers to enter the teller area.
Lieut. Ronald Starace of the River Edge Police Department said the absence of such barriers made a bank vulnerable.
"To be robbed once was a freak," Lieutenant Starace said, referring to last year's robbery of the River Edge bank. "But twice and you've got to be considering that you have to start doing something."
Midlantic National Bank officials declined to comment on the River Edge robbery or on their intentions about the installation of bandit barriers at the branch. But a representative of the banking industry offered a possible explanation for the less-than-universal use of such barriers.
"They create an atmosphere that is not particularly conducive to saying, 'This is your friendly neighborhood bank,' " said James Silkensen, executive vice president of the New Jersey Savings League.
 
Other New Security Devices
 Bandit barriers are only one of the new security devices many banks have put in place.
"With CCTV, there's obviously hidden surveillance and recording features that weren't available years ago," said Tom Friesema, sales manager for Wells Fargo Alarm Services in Lyndhurst, referring to the new generation of miniature closed-circuit television monitors.
"They monitor all the entrances and exits, the vault entrances, the teller lines and the platform area where the bank officers sit," Mr. Friesema said. "Time lapse recorders can record up to 600 hours without changing a tape."
During hours when the bank is closed, he said, more sophisticated burglar alarms are now being used.
"We're using infrared technology now instead of microwave or ultrasonic protection like 10 or 15 years ago," he said. Infrared technology, which detects movement, is far more sensitive than the older technologies.
 
Silent Alarms Installed
 In addition, he said, there are silent alarms that are directly connected to police departments. Those alarms can be activated by any teller or automatically, when the last bill is taken out of the cash drawer.
But even when such alarms are available, and no matter how sophisticated security devices become, nearly every bank robbery boils down to a confrontation between an intimidating, potentially armed robber and an unarmed, frightened bank teller.
"People tell me it's like a nightmare," Lieutenant Starace said. "I've heard people say a 30-second robbery feels like an eternity."
In many cases, he said, the teller never activates the alarm until the robber has left the bank.
"There's always the risk that the police will respond too fast," Lieutenant Starace said. "We always want to catch the guys, but if you happen to be the person inside that bank, you'd like to know that the guy is out of there before we show up."
Lieutenant Starace said the policy of his department was to abstain from using sirens when responding to a bank robbery and to avoid pulling up directly in front of the bank.
"We don't want to create a hostage situation," he said.
 
Putting Safety First
 Bank officials say each bank has its own set of procedures for dealing with robberies. One rule that appears to be universal, however, is that the safety of customers and employees is paramount.
"The tellers are told, 'Don't resist, do what they tell you, and never jeopardize anyone's life,"' said an official for a bank in northern New Jersey who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The money's insured," he said. "We don't want to see anybody get hurt."
The official said that his bank held regular security meetings with employees to go over different robbery scenarios "to keep everyone abreast of what to do in the event something does happen."
If a bank is robbed, he said, "there are always ways that we try to pass something on to them that will be traceable." One example is the "bait pack," a stack of bills with sequential serial numbers that can be traced.
The official said one way to reduce the impact of a bank robbery was to insure that the tellers kept minimal amounts of cash in their drawers.
"They're restricted to certain totals," he said. "And once they reach that limit, they've got to reduce their cash and lock it up in the vault."
And would he open the vault if ordered to do so by a robber?
"You betcha," he said. "If somebody puts a gun to your head, you're going to do whatever he wants."
 
Limits on Access to Vault
 He added that in most banks no one person can gain entry to the main vault on his own, but requires the assistance of another employee.
"You just hope they believe you when you say you can't do something," he said.
The best way to deter a bank robbery, the official said, is through increased use of bandit barriers.
"They work," the official said. "Most of the robberies that have taken place have occurred where there aren't barriers."
But experts in bank security agree that nothing can completely deter a determined bank robber.
"Trying to prevent bank robberies is a little like being the Dutch boy with his finger in the dike," said Marcus Ford, executive vice president of Profit Protection Inc., a Miami company that specializes in bank security. "You plug this hole here, and another one pops up over there."
Law-enforcement officials offer a case in point.
 
The Case of the 'Jumper Bandit'
 "We call him the 'jumper bandit,' " Mr. Chin of the F.B.I. said, referring to an athletically built man who vaults not only over the teller counters, but also over bandit barriers.
"He's good for over 16 bank robberies in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York," Mr. Chin said.
The man, he said, working alone, enters a bank with a sawed-off rifle, orders the customers to lie on the floor and tells tellers to open their cash drawers. He then vaults over the counter and the bandit barrier, stuffs cash from the drawers into a gym bag, vaults back into the lobby and heads for the door.
"He's in and out very quickly," Mr. Chin said, adding that six of the robberies were committed in New Jersey and that all of them occurred between September 1991 and July 1992. The jumper bandit is still at large.
"We haven't heard from him lately," Mr. Chin said.

Forstmann Little's Next Coup?

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
MAKING golf clubs and marketing ceramic villages are decidedly obscure slivers of the economy. But if you have not been thinking about them, maybe you should.
One person in the latter line of work picked up $25 million last year, and would put an extra $10 million in his pocket soon if all goes well with an initial public offering of Department 56. The company, which is based in Eden Prairie, Minn., sells sweet little illuminated villages that have found their way under Christmas trees and onto mantles. 
 In the golf club business, some smart investors who had put a little money into Aldila Inc. last year have the chance to nearly triple their investments by the Fourth of July.
Feeling pretty good about all those golf clubs and small villages are the principals of Forstmann Little & Company, the leveraged buyout firm run by Theodore Forstmann. Forstmann Little and its investors picked up San Diego-based Aldila last January for $83.1 million and have recently filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission to take 29 percent of the company public. If successful, the offering would bring them $27.6 million, wiping out most of the $31 million in bank debt that went into the deal.
Forstmann and his partners paid $3.99 a share for Aldila 16 months ago. They are hoping the investing public will pay $10 to $12 a share.
The case of Department 56 is even better: It had no bank debt. The filing to sell a chunk of the company comes only six months after the Forstmann investors bought it for $71 million in equity and $213 million in subordinated debt provided by the investors.
A cash cow, Department 56 was the brainstorm of Edward R. Bazinet, the chief executive, who would be $10 million richer if the deal goes as planned. Regulatory documents for the stock offering show that Mr. Bazinet picked up a $9 million bonus last year for his 1991 and 1992 contributions to the company's success. At about $4.5 million a year, that is a decent showing even by the standards of executives on Wall Street, who sock away million dollar bonuses the way some people invest in vacation clubs.
Mr. Bazinet also got a check for an extra $16 million in return for his willingness to waive an old compensation plan that allowed a group of key executives to share bonuses that amounted to 15 percent of the firm's pretax income each year.
Department 56 insiders would not comment until after the public offering. They no doubt were wary of the executive compensation cops, who often frown on such generous bonus arrangements in public companies.
Considering the fast and generous returns, it would be hard to find much wrong with the deal from the standpoint of the investors. But the swift turnaround from purchase to partial spinoff raises the question of whether the smart money knows something the rest of us do not.
Preston G. Athey, who runs the T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value Fund, said he thinks the initial public offering market feels tired. "I received nine red herrings on Monday," he said, referring to the documents that companies file to start the process of going public. "To my mind, that's an example of a somewhat overheated market."
Mr. Athey and others said the two Forstmann deals will fly anyway, partly because of the quality of the companies they are competing against in the market for initial public offerings. Many high quality companies went public during the rush in 1992 to sell new shares, Mr. Athey said. Now, profitable companies like Aldila and Department 56 may stand out among an increasingly trashy array of offerings.
Coming to market at 17 to 24 times their earnings of last year, neither company would be asking an outrageous premium at a time when investors are clamoring for shares of companies that have no earnings at all.
Norman Fosback, a newsletter editor whose publications include a new issues letter, said he was impressed that Department 56 "seems to be humming right along," despite having gone through a leveraged buyout. The balance sheet health, he said, had much to do with the favorable terms of the debt that Department 56 got from the Forstmann investors, who will let the company operate for 11 years before demanding payment of amortization. Bank financing, which traditionally had been used in leveraged buyouts, would require the repayment of the principal in the first or second year after the deal was complete.
But Mr. Fosback said that both the Forstmann purchases have the potential risks of any deal in which the price far exceeds the tangible assets of the company being bought -- something that becomes worrisome if, for some reason, the luster of the Aldila or Department 56 brand names should fade. Brand-name deflation is no small issue in the markets today, with companies like Philip Morris and Procter & Gamble getting jolts from fickle consumers. The two Forstmann companies could be immune to such a fate, but there are no guarantees, Mr. Fosback said.
There is also the potentially troublesome matter of accounts receivable at Aldila, which hit $3.27 million at the end of the first quarter -- a huge number compared with a modest $171,000 for the comparable period a year ago. A spokesman for Forstmann Little would not comment on the receivables because of the regulatory quiet period.
Robert Natale, an expert on new issues at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said investors frequently make money buying and holding quality companies that go public at the right price. But there is always the question of what management knows that investors do not. Initial public offerings occur, by definition, when things are looking unusually good for a company, he said. "It can be a fair price when they go public," he said. "But they go public when underlying fundamentals are very good, and company executives know it won't last forever."

HEADLINE: At Work;
Making a Case for Family Programs

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
It is hard-shell gospel among advocates of "family friendly" or "family supportive" corporate policies that helping employees helps the bottom line. But gospel doesn't crunch as well as numbers, and the unsentimental, lynx-eyed financial types who prowl the balance sheets of corporate America in these lean times tend to be non-believers.
Researchers are beginning to accumulate the systematic, hard evidence that advocates need to make their case. According to two studies reported last week, companies that make it easier for employees to juggle their work and family responsibilities do reap gains in greater loyalty, increased job satisfaction and lower turnover. The benefits of the policies also seem to reverberate beyond the companies' human resources departments. 
 "Lavish claims for all the wonderful things work-family programs do always made us nervous because they used an untested hypothesis," said Ellen Galinsky, co-president of the Families and Work Institute, the New York research group that did one of the studies. "We knew lots of studies that showed the cost of not providing programs. Finally we have two studies that begin to address the benefits," she told an audience of human resources executives at the Conference Board's annual family and work conference last week in New York.
The studies were in essence evaluations of work-family programs at Johnson & Johnson, the consumer and pharmaceuticals giant based in New Brunswick, N.J., and Fel-Pro Inc., a medium-size maker of automotive sealing products based in Skokie, Ill.
J.& J. and Fel-Pro both offer an extensive menu of family programs, including on-site child care as well as dependent and elder care resources and flexible schedules.
The Families and Work Institute found that four years after the Johnson & Johnson "Balancing Work and Family" program began, 38 percent of the employees who responded to the survey said they "strongly agreed" that they felt more comfortable raising personal issues at work. That was up from 18 percent in 1990, when the baseline evaluation was done. And slightly more than half the employees said they strongly agreed that supervisors -- who are critical to the success of work-family programs -- were responsive to their personal and family needs, up from 36 percent in 1990.
One important consequence of the changes since 1990, said Chris Kjeldsen, a J.& J. vice president, is that employees no longer feel they have to lie to get permission to take time off if a child is sick or for some other family emergency. "It's bringing about a positive cultural change at J.& J.," he said.
Nearly three-quarters of the employees who responded to the survey said the family policies were "very important" in deciding whether to stay at the company.
At Fel-Pro, researchers from the University of Chicago found that employees who took advantage of work-family programs were more likely to participate in total quality management and other programs companies consider critical to their competitiveness. They were also more likely to be "good corporate citizens" who pitched in to help other employees, the researchers said.
Susan Lambert, the Fel-Pro study's principal investigator, said family policies are often seen primarily as a way to attract women to a company. "They have additional benefits," she said. "They can help lay the groundwork for other major cultural changes."
Neither study found evidence to support a fear common among managers that employees will exploit and abuse company programs. At J.& J., Mr. Kjeldsen said, there was no increase in absenteeism or tardiness or decrease in productivity even though, because of the economy, people were working longer and had more responsibility.
In both studies, the employees who used and liked family programs most were the highest performers, the least inclined to leave the company and the least likely to have disciplinary problems. Since the Johnson & Johnson program began, employees seem to take their job troubles home less. Given the difficult economic times and the pressure on employees, Ms. Galinsky said, "that is an astonishing finding."
 
 
 
HIGH ANXIETY
 One of the more intriguing findings of the Families and Work Institute's study of Johnson & Johnson: Women with their children experience fewer of the day-to-day distractions of parenthood and find it easier to concentrate on work than do men. Only 13 percent of women with children in onsite day care, versus 36 percent of men, report that parental responsibilities distract them from work or impinge on their productivity.
 "The men are feeling the pressure of being the one in charge," said Ellen Galinsky, the research project's director. "Women feel it less because they've always been in charge. The research is fairly consistent, that when men take on more work-family responsibilities, they seem to feel the stress more at this stage in our history."
 Dana Friedman, who is a co-president of the institute with Ms. Galinsky, said men get less support and more aggravation for doing what is regarded as natural for women. "They even get hassles from women, who will say, " Hi, Mr. Mom,' " Ms. Friedman said. For men, "it's more novel, and more difficult. There are probably more negative career sanctions." The study found no differences in absenteeism between men with child-care responsibilities and those without. "Any negative impact is very modest," it concludes.

GRAPHIC: Graphs show percent of male and female users of onsite child care who report being distracted at work by day-to-day parental responsibilities; "Taking Advantage of 'Family Friendly' Benefits: Two Companies," shows percentage of employees who have used work-family programs at Fel-Pro Inc in past year and at ohnson & Johnson in 1992.

THE ECONOMY 

When, Exactly, Does It Become the Clinton Economy? Stay Tuned
 
One honeymoon may be just about over. So far, President Clinton has been able to point to grim economic statistics and say, "See what the Republicans did! Just let me fix it." But at some point it'll become the Clinton economy, and voters will hold his feet to the fire if things go sour. Last week's report of surprisingly slow first-quarter growth -- just a 1.8 percent annual pace -- may mark the beginning of the changeover. For while Mr. Clinton called the report further evidence that the nation badly needs a shot in the arm, Bob Dole, sniping happily from a treetop, quickly turned the report against the President. "The American people," he said, "are grading the President with their pocketbooks." One surprise was the biggest plunge in 20 years for the military -- without which the growth rate would have been 3.5 percent. The military machine is certainly shrinking, but no one expected that quick a drop.
 
To Head the S.E.C., a White Male
 
One thing Bill Clinton did not do much in his first 100 days was hire people. Tugging at one elbow, women and minorities; at the other, familiar white males. And often Mr. Clinton jogged a lot of laps before deciding. Arthur Levitt Jr., former head of the American Stock Exchange, had wide backing to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. But also in the running was Consuela Washington, a black woman who is an aide to Representative John D. Dingell. Mr. Clinton went for the white male this time -- a white male who had also helped raise millions for his campaign. The S.E.C. has had its share of conflict in recent years, and Mr. Levitt was described by one colleague as "a master of consensus."
 
Half-Speed Ahead on Fast Trains
 
The Administration announced a $1.3 billion plan to develop high-speed train service in various areas nationwide, but again the question arose: Is the campaign glass half full or half empty? The plan, which includes $300 million for work on a train that floats on magnetic cushions, is the first Federal support for high-speed projects outside the Northeast corridor. And Transportation Secretary Federico Pena saw an improvement over the Reagan-Bush era, when there was "no commitment, no leadership." But Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine of New York said, "I'm disappointed the Clinton Administration is not following through" with the broader commitment promised during the campaign.
 
Take a Letter, Mom
 
Chelsea Clinton, 13, went to school on Wednesday. She told her father she knew what he did for a living. Kathleen Wood, 9, didn't know, so she tagged along. She learned that "short duration mortgage factors were attractive." Her response: "Boring." On Take Our Daughters to Work Day, organized by the Ms. Foundation for 9- to 15-year-old girls, up to a million girls nationwide skipped school to taste the joys, and drudgery, of life in the 9-to-5 lane. In the Chicago trading pits, it was joyful indeed, as the girls did some awesome trading of pizza futures. And how much work did Mom and Dad get done? Don't ask.
 
Saving the Trees, Part 2
 
When President Clinton backed down from including in his budget proposal a plan to curtail logging on public land, he drew fire from environmentalists -- and vowed to find another way. Maybe that way has been found. Last week the Forest Service proposed changes that would end logging in more than a third of national forests, affecting more than 60 million acres in 23 states. The difference: This proposal can go into effect in spite of Congressional opposition, which is what derailed the earlier attempt.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Flying in Formation in Europe
 
Bigger is better -- or simpler is better. You now need an air traffic controller to sort out the deals and cross-ownerships: Swissair and Delta own 5 percent of each other, KLM owns 20 percent of Northwest, SAS has ties to Continental . . . the list goes on. So, after discussing closer ties, Swissair, SAS, KLM and Austrian Airlines decided to go all the way and merge into a single European giant. The economies of scale are irresistible. "Small national carriers are an anachronism," one analyst said. "Critical mass" is the key. The deal is far from done, though: Routes must be cut or combined, government approvals are needed.
 
Disney Loses a Bit in Translation
 
Euro Disney. The name seems like an oxymoron. How could something so quintessentially American possibly be exported? Not too smoothly, as it turns out. The park near Paris has had problems since it opened, and last week it predicted a big yearly loss and said it badly needed cash. Attendance isn't bad, but visitors aren't spending as freely as Euro Disney would like. One problem: The French miss their mealtime glass of wine.
 
The Queen Needs the Cash
 
British royalty owes its astonishing survival to being one of a kind, floating regally above the muck. Well, it's losing altitude. Already humbled by some divorce messiness, it has now joined those lesser nobles who must, to pay the bills, let the untitled masses scuff their carpets and ogle their treasures. Last week Queen Elizabeth, to raise cash to repair Windsor Castle, said that for $12.50, summer tourists could get a glimpse of the innards of Buckingham Palace. If that doesn't raise the $50 million or so needed, of course, there's always a home equity loan.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
G.M., Profitable and Defiant
 
General Motors may be pulling itself out of its slide, and it certainly doesn't want a massive truck recall to slow it down. Last week it reported a quarterly profit of more than $500 million, compared with a huge loss a year earlier, saying it had made real progress in a vital area -- cutting costs. A day later, the company held its ground in a battle with Washington, refusing to recall 4.7 million pickup trucks whose fuel tanks, the Government says, pose an unacceptable fire hazard. It has come down to a battle of numbers, like the speed of impact in Government tests. And now, if the Government doesn't flinch either, it may all have to be sorted out in the harsh glare of public hearings.
 
Continental: Seven Lives to Go
 
The airline heavyweights can't blame Continental anymore. As their troubles grew, American, United and Delta were quick to say that their bankrupt rivals tilted the landing field, that they had an unfair advantage in being able to reduce debt and break contracts to buy or lease planes. But last week Continental emerged from bankruptcy -- the first airline ever to do so twice -- and it's ready to play with the big kids. And it is ready: It's got $600 million tucked away for a choppy day, and it has fewer unionized workers than its rivals, giving it a big edge. To lure customers, it plans to sell itself as a carrier with something it certainly didn't have a decade ago -- good service.
 
Mr. Gerstner, Meet Your Bosses
 
One wonders if Louis Gerstner knew what he was in for. After less than a month on the job, the new head of I.B.M. was thrown to some angry sharks -- an annual shareholder meeting in Tampa, heavy with retirees. These folks had built up nice, safe, true-blue-chip nest eggs in I.B.M. stock before heading for the sunshine, and were not at all happy at the way those nest eggs had cracked. One typical comment: "I.B.M. no longer provides for your old age, but it certainly hastens its arrival." One shareholder even included the newcomer among those responsible for her woes, noting that the stock had fallen even further after Mr. Gerstner took over. For his part, Mr. Gerstner acknowledged their pain and vowed: "I mean to do something about it."
 
1-800-GET-AT&T
 
A new battle has been joined in the Great Telephone War. A.T.&T. dominates "800" numbers, controlling 75 percent of this $7 billion market. Why is this so, with MCI and others making such dents elsewhere? For one thing, you had to change numbers to switch carriers, and no business that had spent big money teaching the public its number wanted to start over. Under new F.C.C. rules, you can take your number with you. In addition, customers have 90 days to break A.T.&T. contracts without penalty. This is a huge business for A.T.&T., accounting for fully 40 percent of the 150 million calls it carries daily. But it is not expected to lose much of it to rivals just yet.
 
It Wasn't Time to Slash and Burn
 
It's becoming a familiar tale: A huge company in trouble. An old-style boss. A slash-and-burn newcomer charging in to save the day. Conflict. Well, score one for the old guard. At Kodak last week, Christopher J. Steffen, the chief financial officer intent on bolstering earnings and trimming costs, quit suddenly, saying, "The company and I disagree on the approach to solving its problems." Kay R. Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, insisted the company still had a turnaround plan, saying of Mr. Steffen, "He was part of the plan, but he was not the plan." Trouble is, Wall Street liked Mr. Steffen. Kodak stock had shot up when he joined, and it slid right back down when he left, losing $1.5 billion in value in a day. Not that Kodak plans to scrap all efforts to slim down. It rushed to assure shareholders that it would sell at least one sizable asset by September.

HEADLINE: Honda's Ugly Little Secret

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
TOM ROULETTE opened a Honda dealership in Painesville, Ohio, in 1978, offering what were becoming the hottest cars in America. But more than one Honda Motor Company executive told him, he recalls, that to get all the cars he wanted to sell he would have to "play the game."
During the next eight years, Mr. Roulette concedes, he played the game faithfully, showering Honda executives with gifts -- a car, jewelry, a stereo system, barbecue grills and thousands of dollars in cash. On some Christmases he received a list specifying what executives expected from Santa. One year, he recalls, he sent his wife to buy a watch costing more than $2,000 for the wife of a Honda executive. 
 "These guys were so cocky, they'd come in, put their feet up on my desk and tell me what I had to give them," he said.
In return, Honda increased his supply of cars. With the models selling quickly, often at prices well above their suggested retail price, Mr. Roulette grew prosperous enough to afford a second Honda dealership. "Those were great days," he recalled. "But you couldn't get cars unless you paid."
Later, Mr. Roulette and Honda grew apart -- he sued over a franchise that the company awarded to someone else -- and in his bitterness over what he thinks was extortion he agreed to disclose in interviews details about what went on before. "This has to come out," he said.
Mr. Roulette's story is not unusual. In interviews with The New York Times and in testimony in recent lawsuits, dozens of former Honda dealers and employees suggest that the company's system for distributing cars and awarding franchises has been riddled with corruption since the 1970's. Many dealers now say that to secure more cars and franchises from the company, they offered executives money, gifts or stakes in dealerships; other dealers say they were forced to pay up.
Accusations of bribery and extortion grew out of at least four lawsuits around the country filed by Honda dealers against other Honda dealers or the company itself. Testimony from one of those cases, in Concord, N.H., has been referred to the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and both are investigating for possible violations of mail- and wire-fraud laws.
 
Senior Executives Accused
 Three senior executives in Honda's United States operations, who have since left the company, have been accused in court testimony of accepting cash or a secret stake in a dealership. Six of the 10 executives who supervise Honda's regional zones in the United States have resigned in the past year. One of the six has been accused by a former Honda dealer in Virginia of secretly accepting a stake in a new dealership. A Honda spokesman, citing confidentiality in dealings with employees, declined to say why any of the executives left.
Rooting out corrupt and possibly illegal practices among its dealers and sales executives has become a paramount concern for Honda's United States management, which is based in Los Angeles. Richard Colliver, recruited from Mazda two months ago to be Honda's senior vice president of sales, said the bribery accusations are credible and "bring shame to the entire company."
After internal investigations, Mr. Colliver said, Honda has dismissed "a few" employees for violating company policy against conflicts of interest and specifically acceptance of expensive gifts. He declined to elaborate.
To be sure, Honda dealers who played it straight lost cars to those who cheated. But this is more than an intramural squabble. The scandal could be viewed as an illustration of an unintended side effect of trade protectionism. Japan's agreement to restrain car exports, resulting from pressure by Detroit's Big Three and the United Auto Workers union, was the most important factor in limiting the supply of Hondas in the United States. With demand for Hondas exceeding the supply, some dealers raised prices sharply, and began striking deals with Honda executives to secure all the cars they wanted.
Any illicit payments were financed by the people who bought the cars. Paying off executives, in effect, became part of a dealer's overhead.
Honda also suffered: "The people who really lose are the shareholders," said Lawrence J. White, professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University and former chief economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division. "Instead of Honda getting the higher wholesale price for its cars or reaping the customer goodwill for not charging a higher price, the executives and the dealers are getting what becomes in effect the higher wholesale price."
 
Unusual? No
 Such scandal is not unknown to other car makers. When models have been hot, dealers eager to get cars that will sell at a big profit have done favors for the manufacturers. "This situation has happened many times," said J. David Power, founder of J. D. Power & Associates, a marketing research firm based in Agoura Hills, Calif. For young, underpaid auto executives, "it is a very big temptation, especially when the dealers are making so much." In the early 1970's, the Toyota Motor Corporation's United States network faced a scandal similar to Honda's.
Nor is the phenomenon limited to the auto industry. While generally suppliers ply retailers with favors to persuade them to buy more, the opposite situation can occur during shortages -- whether the item is oil, steel or tickets to a show.
The scandal at Honda is in one sense a consequence of the company's very success. Honda began building cars in 1967, and when it began exporting them to the United States in 1970 it had to beg prospective dealers to sell them. But all that changed when the energy crisis in the mid-1970's put a premium on light, fuel-efficient cars from Japan.
In the 1980's, Hondas gained a reputation for reliability and stylishness. Demand became so great that buyers frequently offered to pay more than the sticker price, would wait weeks for their Honda to arrive and were willing to forgo their favorite color and choices of options.
Some dealers began to raise prices above Honda's suggested retail price, frankly disclosing "additional dealer profit" as the reason; other times they added "options" that didn't cost them much, like pinstriping and undercoating, and then charged hundreds of dollars for them. "The best deal I can remember was a $12,000 Honda Prelude that I sold for $5,000 above list price," Mr. Roulette said. "My gross profit was at least $7,000."
 
Fabulous Riches
 The most successful Honda dealers opened additional showrooms and earned millions annually. "We were coming back from Florida on the Learjet one night and I asked myself, 'What's wrong with this picture?' " said a former employee of a chain of Honda dealerships, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "I sell cars for a living. I wasn't supposed to be living like a rock star."
Honda, according to a custom developed by the Big Three, allocated cars according to how quickly dealers sold what they had. But some dealers couldn't get enough cars under that system, so they looked to Honda executives for help.
"If there was a guy who could get you a few more cars you might buy him clothes and send him a gold Rolex to curry favor," said an East Coast dealer who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Don't forget, this guy was making $50,000 a year and dealers were making $2 million or $3 million at every store."
But Hondas aren't nearly as easy to sell these days. A strong yen and strengthening competition from the Big Three have hurt the company. Honda's sales are down 20 percent from last year. The Accord, in recent years the nation's best-selling car, was passed last year by the Ford Taurus. Doing favors for Honda executives has been rendered unnecessary.
As the market has weakened, lawsuits have been filed by a growing number of disgruntled Honda dealers who claim they were hurt by favoritism toward other dealers. It is in these suits that the bribery and extortion accusations have surfaced.
Some Honda executives have been accused of accepting secret free equity stakes in new dealerships in return for permission to open them. Edward W. Mixon, a former Honda dealer in Woodbridge, Va., testified in a suit against a former partner that he promised Dennis Josleyn, the Honda zone manager in Gaithersburg, Md., 10 percent of a new dealership in Warrenton, Va., worth $90,000 by Mr. Mixon's estimate, "because he had been helpful to me in the past." The dealership was never opened.
Mr. Josleyn, who resigned from Honda a year ago, declined, through his attorney, to respond to a reporter's questions. However, he has denied in a deposition that he was promised a stake.
In another suit, William and Mary Jo Shepherd, Honda dealers in Concord, Calif., contend that a former Honda executive vice president, Cliff Schmillen, was given a 10 percent interest in a competing dealership in nearby Walnut Creek "illegally and illicitly, in order that the mix, color and style allocations to Walnut Creek Honda be increased." Asked in an interview whether he held a stake in the dealership, Mr. Schmillen, who left the company in 1990, replied, "I don't think it's proper of me to comment on that right now."
 
The Alleged Payoffs
 Then there are the accusations of payoffs. Take the case of Richard M. Nault, a former Acura dealer in Concord, N.H. In a suit against Honda, Mr. Nault said he didn't receive enough cars because Honda favored a competing Acura dealer in nearby Nashua, Thomas Bohlander. In a pretrial hearing, Mr. Bohlander acknowledged that in November 1986 he presented David L. Pedersen, a Honda assistant zone manager, a 1987 Acura Integra as a gift; he said he also paid $17,197 in tuition to Gannon College, where Mr. Pedersen's son was a student. Mr. Bohlander testified that the gifts were for friendship, not for allocation of cars.
Another witness in Mr. Nault's case, Damien C. Budnick, testified that in mid-1990 he delivered $100,000 in cash from a Honda dealer in Cocoa Beach, Fla., to Mr. Pedersen, then an assistant zone manager in Georgia. Mr. Budnick, a former district sales manager, said funneling cash to executives was common. Executives called it "passing the football."
Mr. Pedersen resigned from Honda last June. Asked whether accusations that he accepted gifts and money from dealers were true, he said "Consider the source," and did not elaborate.
Mr. Budnick also testified that dealers had funneled money to two Honda senior vice presidents who supervised the zone managers: James Cardiges, who resigned in 1992 and was Mr. Colliver's predecessor, and Jack Billmyer, who preceded Mr. Cardiges. Attempts to find Mr. Cardiges were unsuccessful and his attorney did not return a half-dozen phone calls; several messages left on the answering machine of Mr. Billmyer were not answered. Neither Mr. Cardiges nor Mr. Billmyer has testified on the accusations; but Mr. Billmyer, who took early retirement in 1988, has been quoted in the trade press as denying that he accepted payments under the table.
On Feb. 22, Steven J. McAuliffe, the Federal District Court judge presiding over Mr. Nault's lawsuit in Concord, ordered the testimony and evidence related to accusations of bribery referred to the Justice Department for investigation. Peter Papps, the United States Attorney in Concord, confirmed an investigation but would not say which executives or dealers he was looking at, or what if any charges might be filed.
Last week, the F.B.I. also said it was investigating the matter. Bribery and extortion, if proven in this case, would be a violation of Federal mail- and wire-fraud statutes. Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service might decide, as is customary, to investigate whether taxes were paid on gifts and cash payments.
If investigators look into the case of Mr. Roulette, the former Honda dealer in Ohio, they will learn that he thinks he had no choice but to bribe executives.
From the outset, Mr. Roulette said, he told Honda executives: "What does it take to get more cars? I'll do what it takes." He said one executive told him his father wanted a new Pontiac Bonneville. Mr. Roulette said he bought one for $12,000, and the executive paid him $7,000 for it. Mr. Roulette also said he paid for a watch costing more than $2,000 for the executive's wife. "After that, I became one of the guys," he said.
 
'I Had to Do It'
 Mr. Roulette, who now lives in California and owns a Chevrolet dealership in San Jose, said he isn't worried that he might have broken laws. "I'm sorry -- I had to do it," he said. "I've got a wife and kid to support."
As for his latest dealership, Chevrolets have been slow sellers, so dealers would find little reason to make questionable payments to General Motors executives to get more cars. Still, Mr. Roulette said, "they send a letter saying don't even send us candy for Christmas."
 
 
 
FOUR WHO DECIDED TO GO TO COURT

The accusations of payoffs at the Honda Motor Company stem largely from four unrelated cases involving the auto maker and Honda dealers.
Richard M. Nault, an Acura dealer in Manchester, N.H., sued Honda in state court in 1989 -- the suit was later transferred to Federal court -- accusing the company of damaging him by placing another Acura dealership too close to him and then by canceling his franchise when he moved to a different building to save money. The judge in the case referred the testimony to the United States Attorney in Concord. The suit is scheduled for trial next month.
Edward W. Mixon, a former Honda dealer in Woodbridge, Va., sued Richard C. D. Hunt III and his wife, Peggy T. Hunt, who with Mr. Mixon had agreed to open a Honda dealership in Warrenton, Va., in 1990. Mr. Mixon had Honda's permission to open the franchise; the couple had agreed to erect the building. But when the Hunts couldn't get financing, the deal fell through. Mr. Mixon sued in 1991 for breach of contract. The lawsuit was settled earlier this month, but the terms were not made public.
William and Mary Jo Shepherd, Honda dealers in Concord, Calif., sued the company in 1991, alleging breach of contract. Mr. Shepherd said he lost money when forced to sell his dealership after Honda failed to allocate enough cars to him. The Shepherd case is in litigation in United States District Court in San Francisco.
In 1988, Tom Roulette sued Honda in California, accusing the company of breaking a contract under which he was to have been awarded an Acura luxury-car franchise in San Jose. The suit went to trial last summer, and a jury awarded Mr. Roulette $5.5 million in general damages and $1.5 million in punitive damages. Honda appealed in November and the case is awaiting a hearing by the 6th Appellate District Court in San Jose. Fueled by his anger against Honda, Mr. Roulette decided to make public his accusations of bribery against former Honda executives.
 
ONE FOR HONDA'S DEFENSE

DAVID CONANT, part owner of Norm Reeves Honda Superstore in Cerritos, Calif., remembers the good old days a decade ago when Civics and Accords regularly sold for as much as $500 above the suggested retail price.
And he remembers that some dealers always seemed to get more cars than others. However, Honda managers were willing to show him computer printouts and explain how cars were allocated, he said.
Of accusations that some dealers have bribed Honda employees with gifts and cash to receive more cars and franchises, Mr. Conant, chairman of the Honda Dealers Council, said: "I don't really know whether these things are true or not. But it makes me angry and it makes me sick. With an image as golden as Honda's, we don't want to see anything happen that could hurt that image."
Last year Mr. Conant's dealership sold about 6,000 new Hondas, making it the largest Honda dealership in the nation. "We got this big by setting standards that aren't just auto-industry standards but standards of business excellence over all," he said. "That's the message the customers and employees get: you can get that way playing by the rules."
Periodically, he said, "certain models will be hot, and scarce." He said his dealership probably gets fewer cars than it is entitled to because it's so big and Honda doesn't want to appear to be favoring it. "Right now, for example, the Civic coupe is hot," he said. "I could use more."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
When the Risks of Wall Street Affect Us All

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The days of guaranteed returns have ended. And that will have major effects on millions of Americans and also on the financial system.
It was not too many years ago that the average American had no real reason to be concerned with the financial markets. Much of his or her money was in the bank, or perhaps in Treasury bills, providing a guaranteed yield with no principal risk. The pension awaited at retirement was a fixed amount each month. If the pension fund investments did not make enough money, that was a problem for the employer, not the employee. 
 But that has been changing gradually for several years. The flow of money out of banks, and into stock and bond mutual funds, has become a flood. Some funds are riskier than others, but all involve some principal risk. Similarly, the trend is for companies to drop defined-benefit pension plans in favor of defined-contribution plans, in which the employee controls how the money is invested, usually by choosing among mutual funds, and wins or loses as those investments rise or fall.
So far, none of this has created a significant problem. Those who took risks with their financial assets have been rewarded. "In the past few years we have seen the pleasant side of volatility, with just occassional interruptions to remind us that markets do not move in straight lines," the economist Henry Kaufman said last week in a speech to the Chapman University Economic Forum in Irvine, Calif.
Now, there is a campaign to persuade employees that those who do not take risks are foolish. Long-term, we are told, stocks outperform everything else. So long-term investment plans should emphasize equity investments. It is too bad that lesson was not taught in the mid-1970's or the early 1980's, when stocks were cheap by historic standards, rather than now, when they are expensive.
Nonetheless, there will come a time when volatility works the other way, when a bear market arrives in some or all financial assets. Mr. Kaufman suggested that could depress the underlying economy, as consumers cut back on spending out of concern that their wealth is evaporating. His forecast was that markets could fall rapidly as individuals panic and bail out, particularly if short-term interest rates have risen, providing a reasonable alternative investment.
That is not likely to happen soon, if only because the lesson many individuals have learned from the 1987 crash is that declining markets provide buying opportunities. But if prices were to fall, and kept falling, Mr. Kaufman asked whether investors might lose confidence in the stock market and demand the Government use "open market operations" to support share prices, as it now intervenes in the Treasury bill market to affect interest rates.
Such an idea seems farfetched, but something similar happened in Japan this year. And it serves as a reminder of just how much the world is changing, as more and more financial risk is passed on to individual Americans.

HEADLINE: OUT THERE: MINNEAPOLIS;
Survivors Get to Dance

BYLINE: By Neal Karlen

 BODY:
THE notorious Nick Beavers, clean and sober at last, was fidgeting at a rear table in his new Minnesota nightclub, nursing what would be diagnosed back home on Broadway as a serious case of flop sweats. Here in downtown Minneapolis, however, locals would simply say that the owner of the newly opened Rogue bar and restaurant was having a cow.
Nick Beavers . . . nervous? It didn't seem possible. Back in the decadent 1980's, when he helped run such hard-partying Manhattan night spots as the Surf Club and the Zulu Lounge, Mr. Beavers was famous for his air of preppy bad-boy nonchalance. But now, on the most important opening night of his life, the 28-year-old self-exiled child of Fifth Avenue was skittishly swilling Diet Cokes and chain-smoking Marlboros. 
 "I'm not afraid anymore to show that I'm scared," Mr. Beavers said as he pushed back his chair and walked the length of his 12,000-square-foot club to inspect the dance floor. What he found were a couple of not-quite-glamorous Midwestern couples swaying to the music. "Who are these people?" Mr. Beavers asked.
"Minnesotans," he was told.
"Hmm," he said, tapping his foot and checking his watch. It was 9 P.M. "It's O.K.," he mumbled, "it's still early."
Mr. Beavers retreated to his office in the club, which is situated in the bowels of Minneapolis's historic Lumber Exchange Building. "In my clubs in New York," he said, "I never used the office for anything but, how shall I say, entertainment. Here, finally, I've learned how to pay attention."
Indeed. Scattered in piles about Mr. Beavers's desk were papers bearing floor plans, economic projections and proper-looking prospectuses for would-be investors. He pulled out a manila envelope. "Here," he said, "are the old days."
Lying there like lox were news clips dating from Ronald Reagan's second term, culled from night-life columns in The New York Post, Interview, The New York Daily News and Town & Country. Most of the old stories included pictures of the dashing, club-owning Beavers brothers: Toby, Angus and Nick, the youngest. Some articles pointed out that the brothers are blueblood descendants of two fine old New York families, the Beekmans and Devereauxs. Another one mentioned how he was the first student to be thrown out twice from the St. Mark's prep school.
"In the 80's, I was going out every night, trying to be entertained by people I hardly knew," he said. "If I numbed my senses, everybody seemed fascinating. Booze gave me the illusion that my life was great."
By 1988, Mr. Beavers had burned out. After a few stops at Minnesota's famed Hazelden clinic, the cure took. Wary of New York, of his old friends and habits, he took a minimum-wage job scooping frozen yogurt at a Minneapolis shopping mall. "I know it sounds funny," he said, "but that job was the first time I ever really felt good about myself."
While at Hazelden, Mr. Beavers had run into Terry Prem, 29, an old friend from his New York days, who had come to Minnesota to kick a heroin habit. There, they came up with the plot to bring a New York-style night spot to Minneapolis. "We wanted to do what Eric Goode did at Area," he said.
For most of last year, the two plotted and built their club, at a cost of $450,000. Thirty artists, most of them local, painted pictures for the walls and built 125 pieces of furniture, as well as two bars covered with mosaics. The music would be deep house, the look very New York -- an effect heightened when Dante, the former doorman at the Manhattan club Tatou and a fellow Hazelden graduate, was hired to work out front.
"At the door," Mr. Beavers said, "we decided to take the Nell's philosophy of being much more democratic than the typical New York club. There's a deep-seated populist morality here in Minnesota that we knew we'd have to honor if we were to survive."
The proprietor locked his office door and headed back into the quickly filling club. By 11, the place was wall-to-wall with SoHo-Melrose Avenue looks, though the accompanying accents sounded like they came from Lake Wobegon. It's the Minneapolis Style, a hybrid hipness wherein scene fiends with pierced noses can be as polite as Archie comic-book characters.
By 11:30 on opening night, Rogue was filled to its 1,000-person capacity with the kind of people Nick Beavers wanted in his nightclub. Wasn't he tempted by all the alcohol? "At first I was, but you get acclimated," he said.
Besides, Rogue has a fully stocked juice and cappuccino bar meant to serve the legions of recovering addicts from both coasts who have decided to stay in Minnesota. Here, away from their old habits, they huddle with their newly sober friends in a community of expatriates that includes some of the most style-conscious types in the country.
That community came out in force for Nick Beavers's opening night. Gripping designer juice bottles, they hugged each other in the V.I.P. room and discussed how Minneapolis had become a happy Elba for the hip and dry. "I've been drunk in every club in Paris, Los Angeles, Rome and New York," said Jasper, 28, a now-sober studio musician who would not identify himself further, after he embraced Mr. Beavers. "And this is as cool as anything I've seen."
Someday, Mr. Beavers said, he'll go back to New York. He thinks and dreams about home, but for now, he's happy where he is. And he said he felt no guilt that for many, the lasting legacy of places like his old Surf Club was personal destruction.
"The drugs were everywhere, and everybody was touched," he said. "The key word of the 80's was extreme -- and I lived it. I'm glad I did it, but I'm grateful that I'm alive and still have my brains and health."
The dance floor was bopping. "Anyway," he said happily, "now I've got my club."

Pontiac's More Insurable Pony Car

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
OVER the past 40 years, I have owned a lot of automobiles. Somehow, though, there have been surprising gaps in that history.
There has been no Corvette, for example, and I would love to have a Corvette. I have never owned a Mustang, Ford's original pony car. Nor have I sallied forth to fly home in a Camaro or Firebird. 
 Those last two, F-bodies in General Motors nomenclature, were G.M.'s followup to the Mustang. The sporty Chevys and Pontiacs came out in 1967, three years after Ford scored its coup, and they have worn well, selling millions of copies with just four redesigns.
Pontiac alone has put more than two million Firebirds on America's streets, but there is a good reason why some of us have been left looking. As practical vehicles, after all, the cars are ridiculous.
They are hard to get into and to get out of. They have almost no room inside, and the back seat is useful only for small children or for torturing in-laws. Their fuel economy has been better left unspoken, and a commute in a Firebird of the past could nicely be compared to a tooth-jarring trip in a very fast stagecoach.
They have big engines and rear-wheel drive and they don't go in the snow. They are, in truth, fairly silly. But they sure are wonderful toys.
The fourth generation, new for '93 and the first redesign since 1982, is the best since the original. Power has been increased. The bodies have more solidity. Aerodynamics have improved, and the three models -- basic Firebird, Formula and Trans Am -- are exercises in sleek styling.
They will appeal to their usual audience, however, and therein lies a further problem. Except for the basic model, whose market is said to be mostly female, the Formula and Trans Am hot rods attract young single males, and soaring insurance costs have made the cars prohibitive for many would-be buyers.
As a result, Pontiac has fortified the new vehicles' structure and added safety items, along with streamlining service procedures and reducing the price to replace the parts.
Antilock brakes are now standard, and there are air bags for the driver and front passenger. Bumpers protect against 5-mile-per-hour impacts, double the Federal standard, and more integrity has been built into the doors.
Most body parts are plastic, hung on a stiff steel inner cage, and the outer panels resist dents, dings and corrosion. Those body parts that are in fact steel, like the rear quarter panels and hood, are galvanized on both sides.
"We've made the car more theft-resistant and less costly to repair," said John Middlebrook, Pontiac's general manager, "and that should take a bite out of the premiums that owners have traditionally paid."
Chuck Hurley, a vice president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an information group supported by the major insurers, agrees -- to a point. And he notes that the insurance companies will probably reduce rates, based on the air bags alone.
"Some will and some won't," he said. "Certainly, most major companies do offer discounts for cars equipped with the bags, and the discount ranges from 20 to 60 percent. There are some companies, too, that have offered discounts on cars with antilock brakes. But what I think is important is that the manufacturer is placing a high priority on reducing the premium burden on the customer."
Still, the hatchbacks are naturally popular with people who like to go fast, and with thieves, and that makes them high-risk vehicles.
To counter theft, Pontiac has added the security of a delayed electrical relay that disables the unlocking functions of the doors and rear hatch 30 seconds after a Firebird has been locked from the outside. That eliminates the possibility that the car's power locks will be activated by illegal means.
In addition, there are locking nuts for the jazzy aluminum wheels, and the doors have mechanisms that are all but impossible to open with "slim jims," thin steel shafts that are a thief's favorite tool.
The test cars, a white Firebird coupe, a metallic green Formula and a flame-red Trans Am, shared those basics, but there were big differences, too.
The base car, with a sticker that started at $13,995 and had a bottom line of $17,086, was equipped with a new 3.4-liter V6 that sent its 160-horsepower to the road through a four-speed automatic transmission and tires that were slightly smaller than those of its more robust companions.
The $21,230 Formula was essentially the cleaner basic body with all the same innards of the more outrageous $22,706 Trans Am. Both the hotter cars were driven by Pontiac's new 5.7-liter V8, and the Formula had a new six-speed stick while the Trans Am had the optional automatic.
And while the V6 puts out 20 horses more than the engine in last year's base coupe, the V8 is up by 35. That means a rating of 275 horsepower, quite enough to burn the rear wheels to the ground if you are young and macho or own stock in Goodyear.
But no matter the model, the Firebird is fun, with dash and good looks. This year's body is far more solid and there are fewer creaks and groans than in the past. On the highway, there is even a decent ride, and the cars will appeal more than ever to the singles and couples that have always been Firebird's meat.
As for me, I think I'll continue to give G.M.'s pony car a pass. Maybe an occasional turn at the wheel is enough. Maybe I'm just getting old.

HEADLINE: Declare Victory, Hand Off, Slip Out, Cross Fingers

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

 BODY:
WHEN former President Bush deployed American troops to assure the delivery of relief supplies in Somalia as his Presidency reached its end, he spoke much of moral imperatives and of taking a stand. In those days, he meant to signal Washington's unwillingness to remain idle while a handful of marauding warlords kept food from 2 million people who risked starving to death.
It was language reminiscent of Desert Storm, in which Mr. Bush vowed that United States forces would teach Saddam Hussein a thing or two about stealing the territory of a neighboring country. But last year, Iran quietly took over four islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates and deported their people, with hardly a protest from the United States. The lessons of Desert Storm appeared to have struck deeper in Washington than in the gulf. 
 Now, with the bulk of American troops home from Somalia and the Clinton Administration reluctantly weighing whether to intervene in Bosnia, it seems a fair time to tally up the lessons Washington may glean from its odyssey in the Horn of Africa. Yesterday, the United Nations began financing most of the foreign presence in Somalia, where up to 5,000 American troops will remain in an international contingent of 28,000.
"Much to everyone's dismay, Somalia may be characteristic of the kinds of situations that we face in the future," said Mary E. Morris, a policy analyst at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., who is studying the Somalia intervention for United States Army planners. "There aren't clear political goals stated up front."
From a distance, Somalia seemed an easy place to do some good. Mustering a mandate for intervention was not difficult for an outgoing President, for Somalia presented few of the pitfalls that surrounded other horrors beckoning for an American response.
The savannahs and flat deserts of southern Somalia made the region seem almost like an open palm, with none of the mountainous hiding places of the former Yugoslavia. The long coastline made access to major cities simple, and the weather, hot and dry, made military movements relatively easy.
The desertscape was matched by a relatively clear political field. Somalia's lack of a government meant an absence of credible organized opposition, either political or military -- a circumstance not echoed in nearby Sudan, where people were also starving because of a civil war. And it allowed the international community to virtually sidestep the issue of sovereignty.
Nor was the fighting among factions complicated by the musty historic and religious hatreds that could trigger ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, the specter of which looms elsewhere over the former East bloc.
Now, as an important chapter in America's intervention in Somalia ends, it can be called a success, in modest ways. Sacks of rice made it inland from the ports unassaulted. People stopped dying by the hundreds each day from famine. Gravediggers, once the busiest men in town, began looking for new jobs.
And the United States managed a relatively clean, quick intervention with a hand-over to United Nations forces, now armed with authority to enforce the terms of the Somali peace agreement. United Nations troops will have an unprecedented mandate to disarm the fighting clans, rather than living uneasily in the traditional passive role of peacekeeper or observer.
But what may have seemed a blessing before intervention proved a problem later. The lack of a central government or military meant there was no authority to shore up, making a total withdrawal of United States forces and expertise untenable for the moment. Americans will remain behind in important leadership posts and 20 to 30 will stay on to help negotiate the peace.
"We're not sure the United Nations can provide the structure that will allow Somalia to create its own political framework," said Ms. Morris. "Once we get out of there, six months down the line, are things going to be really better than they were before we went in?"
So simple from afar, Somalia demonstrates how intractable the problems that demand the rescue by foreign armies can be, and how impenetrable and unpredictable are the barriers of culture.
Once American troops answered scattered attacks by destroying a heavy weapons compound of Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, the threat became largely a matter of sniper fire and children throwing rocks. The power of the warlords waned, but organized gangs sprang up to present new dangers to relief workers.
And United States forces, which had been deployed to feed starving children, instead found themselves carrying bats and sticks to beat off youngsters who made a sport of stealing their sunglasses and field rations. In the worst instances, marines and soldiers ended up killing youngsters under dubious circumstances.
 
Corruption Prevailed Anyway
 Over 100 Somalis are thought to have been killed by foreign forces on a humanitarian mission, making some grumble that it seemed more like an occupation. Eight American soldiers and nine from other countries died.
Despite American success in getting the relief supplies to the hungry, the essential breakdown of Somali society meant that the thievery and violence weeded out in one place simply cropped up elsewhere. Corruption ran so deep that many village elders who received the relief supplies diverted them from their own people for sale in the markets. Relief agencies were no longer paying extortionate off-loading fees; instead, they paid extortion in the form of protection fees to "employees" who did little work, and who subsequently robbed many of them when they tried to fire them.
Somalia also demonstrated how difficult limiting American presence can be, even in a multinational context. While President Bush ruled out brokering a political solution to Somalia's anarchy when he announced the deployment, it was not long before United States troops and diplomats found themselves doing more than simply securing the delivery of food relief -- patrolling the streets at night, disarming some of the factions and shepherding a political reconciliation among the 15 rival factions.
Somalia may, ultimately, prove to be such an anomaly that it may have little to reveal for other engagements, like Bosnia. There, both the goals of an American-led intervention and the level of commitment appear more difficult to determine beforehand.
"The acutest suffering in Somalia has been alleviated. The Bosnian case will be much more uncertain in that respect," said Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "In many ways, horrible as it was, Somalia will prove to have been a lot simpler and less bloody than the former Yugoslavia."

HEADLINE: GETTING IN, GETTING OUT;
Any War in Bosnia Would Carry a Domestic Price

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the Clinton Administration drew up its tougher policy on Bosnia last week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said any decision to intervene militarily in the Balkans had to meet four criteria: the goals must be clear and understandable to the American people; the chances for success must be high; the American public must support the effort; and an "exit strategy" for getting out quickly must exist from the start. That is a very sensible list of criteria. The problem is that the only operation they could fit is another American invasion of Grenada. World War II would not have qualified, let alone Bosnia.
Mr. Christopher cannot be faulted for trying to bring some analytical clarity to President Clinton's first major foreign policy decision: to commit American military power to help resolve the Bosnia crisis. But Mr. Christopher is like a navigator advising his captain to follow the stars in the middle of a hurricane; it's great advice, but in the middle of a storm, you can't see Orion. And in the middle of a Balkan civil war, no checklist, no amount of advance planning, can eliminate the risks when a great power becomes embroiled in the politics of small tribes. 
 Mr. Christopher's effort, though, reflects the struggle going on now in President Clinton's head as he weighs what to do in Bosnia. Mr. Clinton is not just weighing military options -- sanctions versus bombing, lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia versus sending in ground troops. He is weighing his Presidency. He is weighing Bosnia versus his health care initiative, Bosnia versus his budget, Bosnia versus his national service plans.
These are the real tradeoffs Mr. Clinton may have to make if he intervenes in the Balkans, for it is hard to focus like a laser on the economy from inside the windowless White House situation room. And the reason Mr. Clinton has agonized over his Bosnia policy so long, the reason Mr. Christopher has come up with his star chart for a Balkan black hole, is that they are trying to figure out how to limit those tradeoffs. They are looking for that perfectly calibrated policy that will be just enough to tilt the balance of power in Bosnia toward a settlement, just enough to convince historians that when genocide stalked Europe for the second time this century they didn't avert their eyes -- but not so much as to suck them into a quagmire. Clinton aides say only by such a nuanced strategy can they hope to have Bosnia and the budget, Sarajevo and national service.
That is the underlying logic of the policy course decided at the White House yesterday. While the details were not spelled out, Mr. Christopher said the President had decided in principle to commit a limited amount of American military power to try to end the fighting in the Balkans. He said he was being sent to Europe to persuade the allies to go along with this strategy of using limited force, economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to compel the Serbs to accept a peace agreement.
This is dangerous stuff. Why? Because as a student of the Presidency Mr. Clinton surely knows that the minute the United States takes military action in Bosnia, as the world's only superpower, it will assume responsibility for the outcome there. It will become "our war," no matter how many allies join in, just as happened in both the Persian Gulf war and in Korea. And Mr. Clinton will become a war President, with all that that entails in terms of demands on his time and the need to come out a winner. In effect, Mr. Clinton is going to make himself responsible for resolving the ultimate tribal feud.
Which leads to the second thing Mr. Clinton undoubtedly realizes -- that an open-ended American involvement in the Balkans could hamper his domestic agenda with the very same ferocity that Vietnam hobbled Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. "Like Bosnia, Vietnam was a war that Johnson was wary of getting involved in at the time," said the historian Ronald Steel. "But the pundits said, 'How can we just stand by and let this happen?' And columnists like Joe Alsop questioned Johnson's manhood. And so he acted. In Vietnam we acted as the leader of the free world. In Bosnia we are told we must act as leader of the whole world."
But Johnson was also trying to transform the country with his Great Society programs, Mr. Steel said, "and then the war chewed up greater and greater resources, and then he refused to raise taxes to pay for the war because it was unpopular, so he had to reach into the domestic programs to pay for it, and deficit financing, and that led to inflation, and then the opposition to his Vietnam program from liberals was married to the conservatives in Congress who hated his domestic programs and so he was totally paralyzed. In the end, the same pundits who drove him into the war abandoned him."
Clinton aides say this analogy is very much on the President's mind. But there is also a third thing weighing on him -- that a young President cannot afford to look indecisive and unprincipled in the face of ethnic cleansing and rape -- for that too can corrode a President's effectiveness at home and abroad.
"There is a price for Clinton not acting consistent with his principles, and having acted, there is an equally weighty price for the inevitable unanticipated consequences of being consistent with his principles," said Yaron Ezrahi, a Princeton-based political theorist.
The necessity for the President to act on Bosnia now could not come at a worse time for him, right at the end of his first 100 days, when he has been widely criticized for having lost some of his single-minded focus on the nation's economy, the main reason he got elected.
What he could use now is an easy victory abroad that would quickly yield political capital at home -- capital that he could use to re-energize his domestic agenda, and leadership stature. The gulf war victory was like a booster rocket for Mr. Bush; the only problem was that he had no domestic agenda to harness it to and so it simply flamed out.
Theoretically, a successful assertion of Clinton leadership in the Balkans could help the President win approval of his health care plan at home. The problem for Mr. Clinton is that Bosnia, by its very nature, is not a military situation that will yield easy political capital, because in such an ethnic war the definition of success is much more elusive.
The American people could easily understand the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It was one nation seizing another. America came in and pushed Iraq back across the border. But Bosnia is made up of a thousand mini-border wars, between people who share the same sidewalks, the same hillsides, the same villages. What constitutes success there? Is success when everyone is returned to his or her ancestral home? Is success simply punishing the Serbs? Is success the establishment of a Jeffersonian democracy in Bosnia? When everybody has a definition of success, nobody has a definition, and that makes translating victory there into political momentum at home extremely difficult.
What Mr. Christopher was trying to do in laying down his four fixed guidelines was to chart a pathway for Mr. Clinton to be both principled and prudent. It was a commendable effort, but there is no such thing as Euclidian diplomacy for a civil war. There are no parallel lines in the Balkans; the laws of geometry do not apply. The only rules there are no rules at all and, if history is any guide, the only direction that you can be certain events there will go is in a circle.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In Peru, a 'Second Coup' Reveals the Upper Hand

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
THE episode is being called Peru's "second coup" army tanks rolling into the streets of Lima a week and a half ago in a furious reaction to attempts by the Peruvian Congress to investigate human rights abuses by the military.
It was the most graphic illustration to date of the precarious power equation that has existed in Peru since what is widely known as the first coup under President Alberto K. Fujimori: On April 5, 1992, with the military's support, he suspended constitutional rule to seize near-dictatorial authority, asserting that he needed greater powers to combat a debilitating guerrilla insurgency, rampant corruption and drug trafficking. 
 The army's latest show of force underlined, if there were any doubt, that the President's survival ultimately depends on the backing of generals. To be sure, he is still a popular leader, with 64 percent of public support -- because of his tough action rather than in spite of it. He has made major advances in dismantling the feared Shining Path guerrilla group by capturing its leader, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, and many of its leaders. And he has promoted a free-market economic policy that has investors once again looking at Peru.
But in abolishing constitutional rule last year he became a captive of the military in times of crisis. And thus Peru serves as a reminder that two defining characteristics of the struggling democracies of Latin America are the ever-present threat of military meddling and the enduring appeal of the coup to the region's generals.
Venezuela has suffered two coup attempts since the beginning of 1992. In Chile, the three-year-old civilian Government has struggled so far in vain to nudge Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator, out of his position as Commander in Chief of the army. In Uruguay, Bolivia and Paraguay, secretive groups of current and former military officers periodically warn civilian governments not to delve into past abuses.
Across Latin America, unlike in the United States, the prevailing sentiment is that the military is above the reach of the people. It is an elite society within a larger society, tightly closed to the outside world, highly regimented and far more stable than political parties and governments that come and go.
Latin militaries in the end have a messianic self-image, seeing themselves as the nation's ultimate strength and resource, not just as its protector against foreign invasion.
"In Latin America, it is similar to the Prussian military thinking, that the disappearance of the armed forces means the disappearance of the nation, and that the armed forces are the foundations of nations," said Enrique Obando, a political analyst with the Peruvian Center for International Studies. "In the United States, the military is subject to the Constitution. Here, they say that in theory, but in practice they are above the Constitution."
 
Open Defiance
 At the core of the Peruvian military's current discontent is its conviction that outside interference -- in the form of human-rights scrutiny, for example -- is undermining what it sees as its vital and overriding mission of rooting out subversion.
In the latest confrontation, the army openly defied the authority of the new Congress that Mr. Fujimori created in elections last November.
When called before the legislature, the Army Commander, Gen. Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, refused to answer questions about the disappearance of nine students and a professor last year at La Cantuta University, just outside Lima. And he accused a group of lawmakers of aiding guerrilla organizations.
"I am not going to tolerate this," he said, summing up the military's frustration.
For the next two days, on April 21 and 22, tanks appeared in parts of Lima. General Hermoza is now being called "the other president."
Mr. Fujimori seemed to be taken by surprise. Instead of displaying his usual confident, in-control demeanor, he became the cautious mediator in a national address. Many Peruvians argue that he should have promptly dismissed the officers responsible for the show of force. Others say that would have provoked his immediate overthrow.
Most agree that Mr. Fujimori is between the sword and the wall, pressured by the United States to eliminate human-rights abuses as a condition of much-needed financial aid, but facing an army that believes that such abuses are inevitable and unavoidable in its internal war against subversives.
Officers say privately that cases in which innocent victims were subject to abuse should be investigated (a commitment belied recently by an Americas Watch report concluding that rapes by counterinsurgency troops are common and officially tolerated). The officers also say it is unacceptable to question the killing of the Cantuta students, who even Western diplomats acknowledge were most likely members of the Shining Path.
"No official is going to let his career or the career of a fellow officer be ruined because they killed a terrorist," said Mr. Obando. "They consider that by killing terrorists they are completing their mission."
Another development angering the military was the release to the press of anonymous reports on the killing of Shining Path members, in which the identities of senior officials involved were revealed.
"All the families started coming to command headquarters with wives and children asking for security, fearing the Shining Path would start knocking them off," said a member of congress. The guerrillas are known to take revenge on military officers and their families.
Analysts say the army is not about to rise up and force Mr. Fujimori out of office. That would be hard, because of his high level of public support and the prospect of retaliation by both the United States and Latin American countries.
Many say that for perhaps the first time since he suspended the Constitution, President Fujimori now understands the limits on his power and will thus have to walk a tightrope over the next few weeks. To move the economy ahead, he will have to mollify the Clinton Administration on human rights. But analysts expect a policy response designed to just squeak by and not lead to the sacrifice of many senior army officers.
For in the end, he cannot afford to abandon his ultimate source of strength.

HEADLINE: Conversations/Angela Oh;
Giving Voice to the Hurt And Betrayal of Korean-Americans

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
ONE year after the rioting that devastated the Korean community here, Angela Oh, a prominent Korean-American lawyer, has decided to learn to read and write the language of her parents.
She can speak Korean, said Miss Oh, a busy, no-nonsense professional who, as president of the Korean American Bar Association of Southern California, has emerged as a spokesman for her community. Learning to read it would also allow her to read the documents of her clients. It took her a while to confess: "Really, it's on a personal level. I want to read novels. You know that? That's my goal. Yes, I want to read novels and I want to read the poetry of the people." 
 The riots that erupted on April 29, 1992, were a watershed for Korean-Americans, bringing them up short in their headlong pursuit of economic success and forcing many of them, including Miss Oh, to rethink their place astride two cultures.
More than 2,000 Korean businesses were damaged or destroyed, totaling more than $350 million in damage, and only one in four have reopened a year later. The failure of the police to protect them and of the government to help them rebuild has bred deep resentment as well as a realization that Korean-Americans must work harder to be included in the political and social process of the country.
"Already in the first days after the riots last April, many of us were saying: This is our rite of passage into American society. This is our people's tragedy," said Miss Oh, 37, in an interview in her downtown law office. "It is what internment was to the Japanese.
"It's a little scary because I don't see where this one is going to end," she added. "There is a lot of animosity toward Koreans out there right now," from the public and even from some government agencies.
The place of Koreans in American society is lonely and precarious, she said, and has served as a convenient buffer between the racism of the white majority and the anger of the black minority. Just as Korean-owned businesses, which suffered nearly half the looting and vandalism in last year's violence, became an outlet for the rage of many rioters, Korean-Americans here now view themselves as "human shields" in a complicated racial hierarchy, she said.
"We stand between the African-Americans, who are really at the bottom rung, and the white community, which is at the top rung because they are at the top of the power structure," Miss Oh said. "That's why I hate the term 'model minority.' It really makes me blanch. It translates into being a human shield."
 
Hard-Working Drones?
 Instead of confronting the profound socioeconomic problems blacks face, Miss Oh said, whites merely point to the industrious Koreans and say, "How come blacks aren't more like you guys? Why don't they help each other more? Why don't they work as hard as you do?"
In the midst of the city's ethnic and racial frictions, Korean-Americans are also glibly caricatured, and dismissed, as hard-working drones by those in power and resented by poor blacks. "We are perceived as being, as a people, greedy, selfish, insulated and unwilling to become a part of America," Miss Oh said. "That is how we are seen. It is very untrue in terms of the heart of the people."
A low point came this week in a two-hour televised town meeting that brought together representatives of many racial and ethnic groups. A Korean spokesman challenged Labor Secretary Ron Brown to find $20 million to help reopen hundreds of burned-out Korean-owned liquor stores.
The questioner drew derisive laughter when Mr. Brown responded that if the Federal Government had $20 million to spare, it certainly would not spend it to open liquor stores.
"That was a horrible moment," Miss Oh recalled. "But the problem is that there is a moral obligation that Los Angeles needs to make to the Koreans. These people lost everything. They had investments ranging from $180,000 to half a million dollars. Those losses for the most part could not be insured because they couldn't find carriers, or the carriers were bogus. How do you tell these people that lost half a million dollars that there is nothing you can do about it?"
One widely accepted lesson of the riot and its aftermath is that Korean-Americans must become more involved in politics and American society. "They need to begin to participate in other aspects of American life, other than the material," Miss Oh said. "Materialism was a very, very prominent characteristic in our community. People understand now that those things they have gathered can be taken away so easily."
Most political participation had been confined to making campaign contributions, she said. "That's not political power, as we saw," she said. "They learned that very painfully." When the crisis came, they lacked the clout to win a fair share in recovery efforts. While Koreatown has mostly rebuilt, most of the businesses located in the South Central neighborhood have not.
 
She's Not Meek
 When Miss Oh's parents immigrated to Los Angeles as college students in the 1950's, there were only a few Koreans in this country. As her mother, a schoolteacher, and father, a laboratory technician, raised their five children -- a lawyer, a doctor, a pharmacist, a dentist and an architect -- the Korean population of the country swelled to nearly 700,000. The huge increase, particularly over the past decade, included mostly the small merchants whose influx to Los Angeles has created the largest Korean enclave outside Korea.
After receiving her law degree from the University of California at Davis in 1986, Miss Oh became active in civil rights and human rights causes. Since the riots, her criminal defense practice has included a larger number of Korean-Americans, and her awareness of their special needs has grown acute.
She is now defending a married couple charged with arson in the fire that burned their store a year ago. Unable to speak English or comprehend the American legal system, Miss Oh said, they are at the mercy of forces they do not understand.
Over the past year, she has increasingly taken it upon herself to give voice to the needs of her community. Influenced by the feminist movement, she says, she has broken with a cultural tradition of meek and dutiful womanhood to become an advocate, active in political campaigns, government commissions and women's rights groups.
Along with its needs, the potential cultural contributions of the Korean-American community have been overlooked, Miss Oh said, including areas such as literature and the arts. "Along with the politics and the economics and all that," she said, "I really think that the creativity that is needed at this point in the history of this country is going to come from other sources, from the guts of the people."
Like many in her community, Miss Oh says she remains suspended between the two cultures, unsure of her identity or her role. "I see myself as a Korean-American -- not Korean, not American, but something quite different and undefined," she said. "But definitely I have in my gut a sense that I am valuable to this country."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Mightier Yen Makes Japan Very Edgy

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
RARELY has an issue as abstract as exchange rate policy gripped a country as it has Japan over the past few weeks.
When the yen soared to a postwar high against the dollar in response to Clinton's remark two weeks ago that a stronger yen would help reduce Japan's trade surplus, Government officials here were enraged, arguing that this policy would weaken their economy. But when Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen indicated on Tuesday that the yen's swift appreciation may have been excessive, the exchange rate settled down and the Japanese breathed a collective sigh. 
 It is doubtful, however, that the obsession here with currency movements is over, and American consumers may soon learn that the issue is likely to affect their wallets. The price of Japanese goods in the United States is likely to rise substantially, economists say, affecting everything from the price of a new Mazda to American computers with Japanese components. In the past, American manufacturers took such opportunities to raise their own prices, giving a fillip to inflation.
Which is the point of the policy. The Clinton Administration encouraged the stronger yen as one means of taming Japan's enormous trade surplus. A mightier yen makes Japanese goods more expensive for Americans, and American products cheaper for Japanese.
That means improvements in America's industrial competitiveness will be paid for partly by Americans. Japanese exporters will also be squeezed, which was one reason their Government criticized the American policy. A deeper reason was the Clinton Administration's failure to consult the Japanese before the President endorsed the yen's rise.
That may be the harshest lesson from the yen's 10 percent rise in value since the beginning of this year, to a current rate of about 111.50 to the dollar. Japan is the only member of the Group of Seven industrial nations with a trade surplus, which is likely to hit an unprecedented $160 billion this year. The United States and the other countries seem to think that such a scenario would place a heavy burden on the Japanese to promptly reduce this imbalance, or the solutions will be imposed on them.
The Japanese Government has responded by charging that the manipulation of currency rates is being done for political ends, but economists say the yen is likely to rise even more, possibly to 100 to the dollar, as a natural reaction to Japan's surplus.
"President Clinton is not being unfair, as the Government is saying," said Kazuaki Harada, president of the Sanwa Research Institute. "It is quite reasonable that the yen should appreciate. It is likely to get worse."

HEADLINE: American Voices: On a Role in Bosnia/A special report.;
In American Voices, a Sense of Concern Over Bosnia Role

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 28

 BODY:
When Nancy Brier talks about the shooting and killing in Bosnia, there is anger in her voice. And frustration. And confusion.
Only one thing seems clear to her. 
 "It should be stopped, but we shouldn't try to stop it on our own, not with American boys," she says. "Terrible as it is, it's basically Europe's problem because it's in Europe's backyard. Maybe we can help out a bit through the United Nations. But no more than that."
 
Wary of Involvement
 The comments of Ms. Brier, a marketing representative here for the Sprint telephone company, echoed many of those from about 100 conversations struck up during a weeklong, 1,200-mile trip half-way across the waist of the country, from Virginia's Atlantic Coast to the wheat fields of Kansas. If President Clinton commits the United States to a major military role in the Balkans, he will probably have a difficult time winning approval from people like Ms. Brier.
"Let Italy or Austria or some other neighboring country take the lead in this one," Ms. Brier said. "It's not our guilt trip."
There is much confusion among Americans about what the fighting in Bosnia is all about. There is suspicion that there are not many white hats in the feuding and that neither diplomats nor reporters have made this clear.
 
'Everybody Is a Bad Guy'
 "Who's the real enemy beyond the killing?" asked Abel Garcia, a financial management executive in Overland Park, Kan. "Who would we be fighting? I've been reading and watching for months, and I still don't know. Maybe everybody is a bad guy in this one."
There is resentment that other nations, particularly those neighboring the Balkans, are looking to the United States, thousands of miles away, for a solution.
"Asking America to clean up that mess over there is like asking Sweden and France to stop a fight over here between Illinois and Missouri," said Georgia Dunaway, a hotel receptionist in Okawville, Ill., a farm village just east of St. Louis. "It's absurd. Why are we forever being dragged into these things? Why are we forever sending our sons?"
There is worry, some of it tinged with cynicism, that the President may be making more of the American role in the crisis than is warranted, turning it into a test of his political manhood or allowing others to turn it into such a test.
"The danger is that he'll feel at some point, or that he'll be made to feel, that this is the time and place where he has to prove he's a strong leader," said Jan Buerge, owner of the World's Window gift shop in Kansas City. "He's already in trouble in the polls. Better watch out."
 
The Specter of Vietnam
 There is abiding fear that the Balkans are another Vietnam, a deep-seated angst that tends to outweigh concern that another Holocaust is in the making there.
"I know about the Holocaust and I certainly don't denigrate it as a concern," said Ernest Pepples, senior vice president and general counsel for the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation in Louisville, Ky. "But I also know about Vietnam and what a hopeless quagmire it turned out to be for us."
Above all, when it comes to Bosnia, Americans have questions.
"The question I want answered is, 'Why are there so many questions?' " said Arthur Parks, a public relations executive from Kansas City. "It seems to me that when you have a situation in which there are so few answers, you'd better slow down and give things some extra thought. If we go in, we'd all better agree on why, what's at stake, what our goals are, how we're going to achieve them and how we're going to get out. None of these questions has been answered yet."
Polls within the last 10 days have come up with contradictory results about what role Americans think the United States should play in Bosnia, depending on how the questions are asked. But every survey has uncovered deep concern about greater United States involvement.
The random conversations, in seven states and a score of cities, towns and villages, produced detailed explanations for this concern, some reasoned, some emotional, some visceral. Some were given only under persistent questioning, as if the subject was being explored thoroughly and openly only for the first time.
 
'You Just Grit Your Teeth'
 Only a handful of people called for immediate United States military action against Serbian gunners or for the strengthening of the anti-Serb forces. They argued that "ethnic cleansing" had created a moral crisis that only American leadership and armed might could end.
"Since others won't stop it, we have to step out front and do it," said Austin St. Clair of Huntington, W.Va., clutching her 2-year-old daughter, Virginia. "They're killing children over there in cold blood. This isn't something you argue about. You just grit your teeth and do it because doing something is the right and moral thing to do."
A few people said the United States should play no role at all in the crisis.
"All of this talk of genocide and another Holocaust -- that's overstatement," said Jabr Dumit, a St. Louis camera shop owner. "I know something about ethnic tension. I'm Lebanese. Both sides are 'cleansing' over there. That goes with the territory. Let 'em wear themselves out."
But while a few people wanted immediate American military involvement in the crisis or no involvement at all, most tended to take the approach proposed by Ms. Brier. In the absence of more action by European nations to end the crisis, they were willing for the United States to take part in an intensified peacekeeping effort by the United Nations, but only if the force was not made up mainly of American units. And even then their enthusiasm was muted.
"You have to wonder when something like this is in Europe's backyard and Europe doesn't bother to put an end to it," said Dr. York Silliman, a pathologist from St. Joseph, Mo. "Still, I'd go along with a mixed, balanced U.N. force if all efforts at negotiating fail. But I worry. These people have been fighting each other for so long they can't remember why they're fighting. And now we're going to break it up?"
Tom Mayberry, a hotel bellhop from Floyds Knobs, Ind., worried that if the United States becomes involved in military action in the Balkans, even as a bit player with a United Nations force, the involvement will drag on longer than most people expect.
"We should help stop the killing," he said. "It's got to be stopped. But what then? There's no way this is going to be a short-term affair. This strikes me as an open-ended commitment when it comes to peacekeeping."
As Kendall Kiely, a Louisville insurance executive, sees the situation, it is basically a leadership challenge for President Clinton, a challenge that could fatally flaw his Presidency if mishandled. He wants Mr. Clinton to put more pressure on the Europeans to take action on their own.
"He's trying to lead us when what he really needs to do is lead the Europeans, get them more involved," Mr. Kiely said. "They won't do anything more until he forces them to do something, even though it's basically their problem. They'll just sucker us in if they can. He's got to tell them to move on something this serious or our relations with Europe are going to sour. The Serbs will come around if they become convinced that he's serious and the Europeans are serious."
 
Crossroads for U.N.
 For Sue Orwick, a secretary in Louisville, the only acceptable way for the United States to play a military role in Bosnia would be as part of a United Nations force. In fact, she sees the Balkans crisis as a crossroads for the United Nations, coming as it has after the demise of Communism in Europe.
"This is as good a place as we're going to find to make U.N. peacekeeping a real force in this world," she said. "The balance of power has changed and there's now more opportunity than ever for nations to pull together, to share roles without trying to dominate each other. The U.S. can be just another of the players. You can't find a better test than Bosnia. We're talking about keeping a whole nation from being wiped out -- another Holocaust, the moral dilemma of this decade."
Is Bosnia another Holocaust in the making?
"That's overstating things," said Judge Ellis Gregory Jr. of the St. Louis County Circuit Court in Clayton, Mo. "True, there is terrible killing going on over there. But this is mostly a continuation of ethnic hatreds that have been boiling over for literally centuries and are likely to continue boiling over. The killing must be stopped. But let's not overstate the case."
To Rabbi Joshua Taub of Prairie Village, Kan., little is accomplished by trying to compare what is happening now in Bosnia and what happened during the Nazi occupation of Europe during World War II. The only real issue, in his view, is that people are dying.
"Call it what you will," he said. "But we must all speak out. It must be stopped. I would like to see the U.S. go in as part of a U.N. force. We don't rule the world. We can't act independently. But having said all that, I'm not very optimistic over the long haul. Holocaust? We had one. The world condemned it. And the killing goes on. Speak out."
Ralph Maledy, a retired florist from Columbia, Mo., argues that what is happening in Bosnia today bears little resemblance to what happened in Europe half a century ago during World War II. He is a veteran of that war.
"I was with Patton's Third Army," he said. "We liberated some of the concentration camps. This isn't on the same scale. That doesn't excuse what is happening today. The killing ought to be stopped. But facts are facts."
Should the United States stop the killing?
"Only as part of a larger force," Mr. Maledy replied. "If the European nations don't get in, we certainly shouldn't. This is no threat to us, not militarily, not economically, not strategically, not any way. I deplore it. But ultimately I can't see it as a threat to anybody but the people already fighting each other."
For Oscar Johnson, who owns a photo supply store in Clayton, Bosnia is more than a killing ground. It is a bitter reminder that man's inhumanity to man does not always move world leaders.
"If what's been going on in South Africa for all these years doesn't qualify for intervention, than what does?" asked Mr. Johnson, who is black. "I say stop the killing in Bosnia. And stop it in South Africa. And stop it in Central America. Stop it everywhere, not just where there are white faces."
Marc Boysworth, a 19-year-old freshman at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., called Bosnia "another Vietnam we don't understand." He would not object to minor American participation in United Nations intervention in the Balkans, but thinks that is not practical because the United States has historically been the leading force in military peacekeeping groups.
He also has another reason for opposing American involvement in Bosnia.
"It's my generation that will have to do the fighting," he said. "I don't want to go to war with a commanding general who ducked the draft and now wants to prove he's a tough guy."
Finally, there is Linda Ballard.
A librarian from University City, Mo., she has made a concerted effort in recent months to understand the Balkans and reach a decision about what the United States should do, but says she just cannot see an easy answer.
"Every morning I pick up the paper and I begin to read," she said. "And then I see the word 'Bosnia.' I just despair."

HEADLINE: Gangs Go Public in New Fight for Respect

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 1

 BODY:
Jimel Barnes, a legendary gang member who made his name two decades ago by punching one of the founders of the Crips gang, was picking at his hors d'oeuvres the other day in the ballroom of the Westin Hotel here.
"Crips and Bloods aren't going to go away," he said, referring to the rival street gangs that have turned South-Central Los Angeles into a battleground. "But now they've got to stand for positive things." 
 All around him, scores of tough young men wearing gang colors sipped soft drinks and exchanged calling cards at a remarkable convention that was part business meeting and part motivational seminar here in the gang capital of America.
 
Evidence of a Truce
 "The main idea is to show the world that there is a truce, to build mutual relationships with corporate America and with city officials to help us resolve the economic problems of the city," said Malik Spellman, a spokesman for Hands Across Watts, former gang members who organized the meeting.
As they age into their 20's and 30's, some gang leaders around the country have begun what they call "trucing." Tiring of the continuing killings, concerned for their own children and tempted by the celebrity of national attention, some of the leaders are leaving the streets for the talk shows to call for peace. But the poverty and anger that spawned the violence are working against them, and there are no easy solutions.
This weekend in Kansas City, Mo., in another gathering, dozens of gang members converged from several cities for a "summit" organized by Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, and their gathering included similar exhortations to end gang violence, a peace march and shopping at Country Club Plaza, an upscale mall.
The gathering attracted the Rev. Benjamin S. Chavis Jr., the newly chosen executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who said, "What we're trying to achieve, in part, is to say clearly to this nation, to this city, to our communities, 'The killing must stop.' "
 
Taking to the Talk Shows
 For the past year, since the Los Angeles rioting after the first verdict in the police-beating case gave impetus to a shaky truce among some black gangs here, many gang members have been going public. Stripping their blue or red bandannas from their faces, they have become regulars on television talk shows and have added their angry voices to the anguished self-examination of this violent and racially divided city.
A new class of professional former gang members has emerged, with violent crimes and prison records as their credentials. Their agenda of jobs and inner-city renewal is backed by a veiled threat of further violence. If you want peace in the cities, they warn, you must pay for it.
Government officials listen politely.
"Keep up the good work," said Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a Los Angeles County Supervisor who attended the meeting at the Westin Hotel. "We are so proud of you. We are going to do everything we can."
But with jobs and resources continuing to disappear, there remains little tangible that Ms. Burke or anyone else can offer.
 
Publicity vs. Violence
 For some of the new gang stars, it seems that public exposure is replacing violence as a way to satisfy a hunger for identity and purpose. Some experts on gangs, like James J. Galipeau, a Los Angeles County probation officer, say that for some of these people notoriety may be an end in itself.
"They're spending too much time being celebrities," Mr. Galipeau said. "You heard the younger kids talking about how the projects are blowing up. It's these guys' job to stay in the streets."
The new stars are men like Tony Bogard, a former member of the PJ Watts Crips who heads Hands Across Watts and who crystallized the prevailing rhetoric at the conference on Thursday when he said: "We've got to build up self-esteem. We need black people that are empowered. Each one teach one. We've got to start some kind of dialogue. We need to be a better race of black people."
Another star is Charles Rachal, an inactive member of the 5 Duce Broadway Crips who was invited to President Clinton's inauguration in January "We're not asking for nothing," Mr. Rachal said. He said being in a gang was "about respect, and all we're asking for now is respect."
Then there is Stanley Williams, revered as a co-founder of the Crips, who spoke on videotape from San Quentin prison to the hushed and darkened Westin ballroom, calling on the younger men to "reverse this madness of minority versus minority violence."
Others introduced to applause in the ballroom included the mothers of well-known gang members who are now imprisoned. One of these women was Georgiana Williams, the mother of Damian Williams, who is awaiting trial in the beating of a white truck driver at the beginning of last year's riots.
 
Getting Down to Business
 For some participants, the Westin conference offered an opportunity to establish contacts. "We can do lunch sometime," a gang leader known as Diamond told a new acquaintance as he stood outside the ballroom. "Just make the first call and we can get away from all this."
But not everybody at the meeting was buying the message of peace. Keith Peddler, a member of the Piru Nation gang who said he was now "totally into the positive," balked at calls for disarmament.
"I'm tired of black Uncle Toms telling us to lay down our guns when the police are out there killing us," he said, to enthusiastic applause. "I'm not dumb. Check this out: If you are going to go out and fight a war for the white man, you better damn sure stand up and fight for yourself."
And a 29-year-old member of the Grape Street Watts Crips who calls himself Hi-T said in an interview that he doubted the usefulness of public meetings like this one.
"We're not ready for this type of gathering," he said. "What I'm saying is that we need to take a better look at ourselves and decide what we want before we start asking people to do stuff for us or for our community."
With private financing, Hi-T has managed since the riots to open a sporting goods store in the riot-ravaged South-Central neighborhood. The store employs 12 people, and he was cheered as a hero when he took the stage at the ballroom. But he said later that few Los Angeles gang members were prepared to put in the time and work to make a business succeed.
"A lot of guys are still playing the hard-core role, you know, 'I kill you,' " Hi-T said. "We all know we can kill. I can kill, too. We have pumped babies and women. But we don't have to be talking about that any more."
He added: "I feel like this. If I had a million dollars, I'm not going to give it to gang members. You haven't proven to me that you are worth an investment."
But Hi-T joined the virtually unanimous sense both here and at the Kansas City gathering that the time had come for gang members to stop killing one another, if some alternative occupation or means of self-expression could be found.
As more gang members from the violent and heavily armed generations of the Crips and Bloods enter the age of family and fatherhood, the views of these older men have begun to be felt on inner-city streets. The wild and thoughtless killings typified by drive-by shootings have met with a new tinge of revulsion.
"People are just getting older and wiser," said Damon Hall, who at the age of 23 has been a Philadelphia gang member for a decade. "Last year I went to 12 funerals. I'm not going any more. It's time to make a change for the next generation."
 
A Limited Truce
 Truce movements have had some effect in Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis and Philadelphia as well as in Los Angeles.
But the much-publicized truce here that followed the riots seems to have taken hold only in the Watts neighborhood and in the adjacent city of Compton. In addition, there is no truce among the city's prolific and violent Hispanic gangs.
Gang killings in Los Angeles set a record last year, topping 800 for the first time, and they show no signs of abating.
This week's meetings here and in Kansas City were intended to find ways to reduce this violence, but it is generally accepted both among gang members and law-enforcement experts that only deep-running social and economic changes can have a lasting effect.
With inner-city families and school systems breaking down, with public funds for recreational programs all but gone, with entry-level jobs disappearing and with drugs still plaguing the nation, few people hold out immediate hope for the young men of the cities who are are black and poor.
"Selling dope isn't going to take you anywhere," said Gabriel Warren, a 22-year-old gang member in Kansas City.
And he is looking for something else, applying recently for more than 20 jobs, though without success.
"I've got a son to take care of," Mr. Warren said.

HEADLINE: New Balkan Talks Open At a Resort Near Athens

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VOULIAGMENI, Greece, May 1

 BODY:
A new round of peace talks on the Balkans began today at this resort south of Athens amid hopes that the Bosnian Serbs would agree to an international plan to end the yearlong civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Arriving at Athens airport today, Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said peace could come "within two weeks" if minor modifications were made to the plan. On Friday, Dr. Karadzic said he hoped to bring back a modified version of the original peace plan put forward by the United Nations and European Community that the Bosnian Serb assembly would accept when it meets in Pale, Bosnia, on Wednesday. Both the Croatian leadership in Bosnia and the Muslim-led Bosnian Government have already accepted the plan. 
 "I don't think the Vance-Owen plan will be signed in Athens but we can make a big advance so that the Serb Parliament can accept it May 5," the Serb leader said, referring to the two authors of the peace plan, Cyrus R. Vance, the United Nations mediator, and Lord Owen, the European Community negotiator.
 
Address by Lord Owen
 In an address to the opening session of the peace conference tonight, Lord Owen said: "The comprehensive peace plan that has eluded us so long is now within our grasp. We hope you all will have the courage to seize it."
After explaining a number of technical amendments to the plan, Lord Owen said he hoped that "with these clarifications it will now be possible for the Bosnian Serb delegation to agree to sign."
Only last week the same Bosnian Serb assembly decisively rejected the Vance-Owen plan, which divides Bosnia and Herzegovina along ethnic lines into 10 largely autonomous provinces with a weak central government in Sarajevo, the republic's capital. The Bosnian Serb council voted against the plan despite the recommendations by both Dr. Karadzic and Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, that they accept it.
The shift in Bosnian Serb sentiment since that vote is described by diplomats here as a result of continuing pressure from the Serbian leadership in Belgrade together with the realization that President Clinton is now seriously considering force.
Nevertheless there is real concern that Bosnia's Muslims, who agreed to the Vance-Owen plan reluctantly this year, might withdraw their assent if they feel the mediators are offering the Serbs new concessions.
 
Withdrawals Uncertain
 And even if all goes as the mediators hope, with the Bosnian Serbs signing the peace plan next week and a cease-fire coming into effect, it remains unclear whether the Bosnian nationalist forces on the ground will withdraw from large areas they have captured as the plan requires. Under the plan, the Bosnian Serbs, who now hold about 70 percent of the region's territory, would control only about 45 percent.
If the Serbs do finally accept a version of the Vance-Owen plan, the United Nations will ask the Security Council to send a new and more aggressive peacekeeping force to Bosnia numbering 60,000 to 75,000 soldiers and estimated to cost more than $1 billion a year.
The two-day round of peace talks, which is taking place in a luxury hotel at this seaside resort 12 miles south of Athens, has brought together the leaders of all the factions involved in the Balkans crisis.
Among those attending in addition to Dr. Karadzic and the two mediators are Dobrica Cosic, the President of federal Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro; Momir Bulatovic, the Montenegrin leader; Alija Izetbegovic, the President of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government in Sarajevo; Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian President, and Mr. Milosevic.
 
U.S. Envoy's Instructions
 Thorvald Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian Foreign Minister who is taking over Mr. Vance's mediating role next week, is also here, along with Vitaly I. Churkin, a Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, and Reginald Bartholomew, President Clinton's special envoy. Mr. Bartholomew's instructions, State Department officials said today, is to "make clear, particularly to the Bosnian Serbs that words alone will not deter the United States and the international community from pursuing further options."
There are signs that the Serbs are losing some advantages. In addition to mounting economic hardships, which include rampant inflation and sharply reduced industrial production, diplomats here say the growing possibility of direct Western military action raises the likelihood that Serbs could also start to lose the advantage they hold over their rivals on the ground.
The outcome of the recent Russian referendum may also have affected Serbian thinking as well as the warning from President Boris N. Yeltsin, who handily won a vote of confidence from Russian voters, that he expects the Serbs to sign the Vance-Owen plan. Many Serbs had expected Mr. Yeltsin to lose and believed a government more sympathetic to the Serbian position would come to power in Moscow.
To obtain the self-styled Serb parliament's backing for their plan, the international mediators are likely to offer Dr. Karadzic additional concessions at this weekend's talks so that he can say that he has won a better deal.
At Athens Airport today, Dr. Karadzic said that 70 to 80 percent of the plan was acceptable to him but added that he still wanted to insure physical links among three Serb-controlled provinces as well as guarantees for Serbs living in areas controlled by Croats or Muslims.

Shelling Kills 5 in Sarajevo

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, May 1 (AP) -- Mortars slammed into the center of the Bosnian capital today, killing at least 5 people and wounding 20. The Bosnian radio reported Serbian shelling in other Muslim-held towns.
United Nations officials said Canadian peacekeepers in the eastern Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica retreated under fire when they ventured out of town to try to repair the water supply. A United Nations convoy, meanwhile, tried to reach another eastern Bosnian town, Gorazde, where heavy fighting was reported.
Gorazde has held out for months against surrounding Serb forces, but no relief convoys have managed to get through in two months.
Most of the casualties in Sarajevo occurred when a shell exploded in front of the Roman Catholic cathedral. The hospital said many of the wounds were serious. A Canadian commander, Barry Frewer, a spokesman for the United Nations peacekeeping forces, said about 145 shells landed in Sarajevo from mid-afternoon Friday to early today.

HEADLINE: Too Much of a Good Thing on Long Island Sound;
Resurgence of Lobsters Lowers Prices, Brings More Fishers and Spawns Tensions

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON BAY, L.I., April 29

 BODY:
Running with the morning tide, Arthur Fodera cleared the entrance to Huntington Harbor, powered up the diesel engine in his 35-foot fishing boat and headed across the bay toward Long Island Sound to check the catch in his 700 lobster pots.
With fresh bait fish in buckets at the stern and sea gulls trailing in a cloudless blue sky above his wake, Captain Fodera flipped on his radar, depth finder and the Loran tracking system that helps him find the thousands of dollars worth of lobster fishing gear he leaves on the bottom of the Sound. 
 "There are no pots of gold in this business," said Captain Fodera, the morning sun warming his ruddy face against a chill breeze from the northeast. "It's a lot of work, but it's a good living."
Captain Fodera is one of a growing number of people sharing in a rebirth of the centuries-old lobster business on Long Island Sound. Aided by conservation efforts and a decline in its natural predators, like sand sharks, the lobster has returned to the Sound in great numbers in recent years.
 
Signs of a Turf War
 That, plus the growing demand from seafood markets and restaurants in the New York area, as well as from new markets, including Japan and, most recently, Europe, has brought with it a doubling in the number of licensed commercial lobster fishers over the last several years.
But as a promising new season begins, Captain Fodera and the 20 other lobsterman based in Huntington and neighboring Northport fear success may spoil their business. A large supply is holding prices down, squeezing already narrow profit margins, and the rush to drop more traps has recently led to gunfire at sea and the wounding of one lobsterman.
In the most recent incident, a week ago, a Glen Cove lobsterman was shot and seriously wounded by three masked gunmen as he pulled his traps from the Sound off Lattington Beach. The Nassau County police warned that it could signal the start of a lobster turf war.
"That was a crazy thing to do," Captain Fodera said. "But the Sound isn't getting any bigger and some guys are feeling the pressure. Some days it's like a parking lot out here."
 
A Fourth-Place Catch
 New York State issued 1,171 commercial lobster fishing licenses to state residents last year, up from 371 in 1981. More than 300 lobster fishers worked full time at the job for most of last year, including a stalwart 100 or more, like Mr. Fodera, who fished year round, weather permitting, state fishery officials said.
The latest data show that in 1991, a record 2.9 million pounds of lobster was pulled from the waters around Long Island, most of it from the western half of the Sound, up from 1.8 million pounds in 1989. For statistical reasons, the state divides the waters around the Sound into five areas. The second heaviest yield is from the Sound's eastern zone.
The 1991 catch was less than 10 percent of the national catch, but Long Island moved into fourth place behind Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
The New York catch produced $8.9 million, making it the state's second most valuable marine product, after hard clams.
Captain Fodera, 32, who takes to sea with his dog, Bo, a sturdy Akita, is an independent man of few words and is somewhat secretive about his business. He shied away from questions about his total catch and yearly income -- both private matters among most lobster fishers.
He said he was now receiving around $4.50 a pound, "maybe a little more" than this time last year, and down from a high of $6.50 a pound this winter. Because the Long Island winters are milder than those of New England, the fishers here can take advantage of the season's higher prices for longer.
In the summer, when the supply increases, not only from the Sound but also from New England and Nova Scotia, the wholesale price drops to around $2.50 a pound. "And things can get tight," he said.
 
Thousands in Equipment
 Since his 700 lobster pots cost him $35 each, he has more than $24,000 invested in his traps alone. His floats, lines and other gear spread around the Sound cost another $10,000, and his boat and its equipment adds another $100,000. Then there's diesel fuel and bait.
Because of the size of his investment, he asked that the colors and design that mark his buoy floats remain known only to himself, his mate, neighboring lobster fishers and state registry officials. Poachers and some competitors have been known to cut or snag lines, and use illegal, unmarked buoys, like floating plastic bottles, to avoid state regulation.
"I don't want to lose any of my gear to poachers," he said, securing a pot line to a hydraulic lift that pulled seven plastic-coated wire traps up from the deep. Some were empty, some had lobsters that were too small to keep, and two had four lobsters whose carapace, which runs from the eyes over the main shell, measured three and a quarter inches, the Federal and state minimum.
After their claws were banded shut, the lobsters were tossed into a "wet well" with fresh pumped sea water, where they were kept until they were unloaded at dockside in Huntington Harbor.
"I started when I was 10 years old, digging clams on the beach with my brother," he said. "He's still a clammer, but five years ago I had a chance to buy this boat and go into lobstering." The boat, "Danny's Song," is named for Captain Fodera's 2-year-old son, Daniel.
 
More FishersLobsterman Than Space
 Captain Fodera credits lobster-fishing rules adopted in 1978, including a requirement that all females bearing eggs be returned to the sea, with helping to replenish the lobster stock in Long Island Sound.
He said he would now welcome a limit on the number of licenses the state grants for lobster fishing, as well as a limit on the catch. Both requirements are under consideration by Federal and state officials. Some lobster fishers now operate three or more boats, placing increased pressure on those with only one boat, leading, they say, to turf disputes.
"These disputes all come down to just one issue, too many people and not enough space," said James F. King, 50, president of the Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association, who runs his boat out of Mattituck .
He said there had been a number of other ugly incidents in recent months on the Sound, including a shooting off Norwalk, Conn., in early March in which one lobsterman shot at another, also in a quarrel over turf.
"But that was a shot across the bow and no one got hurt, not a blast amid ship like the last one," Mr. King said.
 
'A Unique Animal'
 Mr. King said he had been "chasing lobsters around for 30 years" and that the Sound "is the busiest it's ever been."
As for the lobsters he's been chasing, he said: "I have yet to figure them out. But I've come to respect them as a unique animal."
He said tests had shown that lobster traps themselves attract lobsters to an area. "The young can slip into the pots, steal the bait and slip out escape hatches," he said. "They find it a rich hunting ground. In their own way, they've adapted."
He said the lobster's natural enemies -- sand sharks, dog fish, black fish and other bottom-feeding fish -- have been overfished in recent years and are fewer in number.
Commercial lobster fishers who are New York State residents can buy a state license for $50 a year. Out-of-state commercial fishers -- only 38 in 1991 -- pay $150, said Philip Briggs, a marine biologist and statistician with the State Department of Environmental structure. Connecticut charges the same fees.
Mr. Briggs said the number of lobsters in the Sound began to return to fished-out areas in the early 80's, after conservation efforts and new fishing rules. He said there were no restrictions on setting traps, except they are banned from the narrow shipping lanes where they might be a hazard to navigation.
 
Gunshots on the Waves
 Mr. Briggs said the industry has "a few bad guys, but mostly good guys."
"They have a great respect for one another, and news travels fast when one of them gets hurt," he said.
The victim in the April 24 shooting was Able Miguel, 43, who operates a 47-foot fishing boat out of Glen Cove. He was shot four times in the chest, groin and buttocks with at least one 9- millimeter handgun. Despite his wounds, he managed to use his boat radio to call for help. His attackers were tracked down by police helicopter and marine units and arrested on a beach nearby.
A grand jury heard testimony on Wednesday against the three suspects. Loreto Rufa, 38, unemployed and from the Bronx; Louis Filardi, 29, a potato chip salesman from Yonkers, and John Reina, 41, a carpenter from Chestnut Ridge, N.Y., appeared at separate hearings on Wednesday and were released on $100,000 bail each. None of them are licensed commercial lobstermen; all three were charged with attempted murder.
Mr. Miguel, a native of Portugal and a lobsterman on Long Island Sound for 20 years, was in satisfactory condition today at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. He told the police he believed the attack was the result of a dispute with another lobsterman who operates three boats out of City Island.
Mr. Miguel told the police that he sold the man a boat about a month ago. Since then, he told the police, the City Island man has accused Mr. Miguel of cutting some of his lobster trap lines and threatened reprisals. Mr. Miguel told the police he believed it was all part of a ruse to bully him off his favorite fishing grounds.
The police said they had questioned the City Island man, whom they declined to identify, and that the investigation was continuing.

HEADLINE: Nations Join On Economy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
For the last few years, the economic game plan of the major industrial nations has seemed to be every man for himself, an unhappy formula that helped push the world economy into its stubborn slump. In recent weeks, however, the major countries have sharply changed tack.
Embracing stimulus plans, cutting interest rates and budget deficits, the countries have been taking steps that benefit other nations as well as themselves. Indeed, if there was a theme at this week's meeting of the Group of Seven's finance ministers, it was that economic cooperation has come back from the dead. 
 The meeting, in Washington, seemed to be more of a lovefest than a slugfest, and the ministers came out talking nonstop about synergy: how Germany's interest rate cuts, Japan's stimulus package and Washington's plan to cut its budget deficit would feed upon each other and build the foundation for a long-lasting economy recovery.
It is far from clear how much these steps may help in pulling the world out of its slump, but this meeting -- and the one three weeks ago in Tokyo offering Russia $28 billion in aid -- were the first in years in which the leading industrial nations worked hand in hand.
 
 
Turnabout From '92
 All this is a sea change from last year's Group of Seven meetings, when Germany ignored its neighbors and kept its interest rates high. Japan did not do nearly as much as other countries wanted to stimulate its economy. By all accounts, those meetings sounded like families squabbling over who should do unpleasant chores first. The Germans and Japanese would rebuff American pleas to promote growth until the Americans cut their budget deficit, while the United States insisted that the others needed to do more first.
The way some economists see it, the Group of Seven -- the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- bogged down in recession, saw the folly of their ways and began listening to the pleas of economic partners.
It would be wrong, however, to say all these countries have acted selflessly. Certainly, Germany's independent central bank did not cut interest rates solely because France and the United States pushed it to; the Bundesbank, too, no doubt wants to reverse Germany's deep recession. But, many economists say, the pleas for the Bundesbank to cooperate -- to boost growth in Europe, for instance -- led it to cut rates deeper and sooner.
 
 
Larger Package From Japan
 Entreaties to cooperate were also not needed for Japan to put together this year's stimulus package. Economists and government officials, however, agree that the package would have been considerably smaller than $116 billion if Japan had not yielded to outside pressure to cooperate.
"The stimulus package is bigger as a result of foreign pressure," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
Tokyo's stimulus package could turn Japan's economy around by the end of next year, economists say. Germany's rate cuts should eventually give a powerful boost to Europe's economy. As for the efforts by the United States, Britain and France to chop their budget deficits, these should help hold down inflation and interest rates, preventing their recoveries from petering out soon.
 
 
Clinton Plan to Cut Deficit
 Clinton Administration officials suggested that the single move that opened the door to the recent flood of cooperation more than any other was the President's plan to cut the Federal budget deficit. Mr. Clinton's moves gave Washington the credibility to press other industrial nations to cooperate.
"Fortunately, we were able to bring to the table something that the Group of Seven countries had been admonishing us about for some time, and that was getting our own house in order," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said. "So we have been in a position to help restore some leadership."
The contrast with last spring's Group of Seven meeting is stark: then, American officials suggested that Bonn cut its inflation-causing budget deficit to give Germany's central bank some leeway to cut its interest rates. The Germans reacted with outrage, asking how Washington, with its $300 billion deficit, could ask another country to cut its deficit.
 
 
A New Willingness
 The attitude last year was, after you Alphonse, after you Gaston, with no one wanting to take the first cooperative step. Now many nations seem willing to go the extra mile when other countries press them.
In the view of several Group of Seven officials, Japan might have offered Russia nothing this year -- instead of the $1.8 billion it promised -- if the Group of Seven had not forged a highly visible, everyone-pitch-in effort to help Russia. The pressure to cooperate helped persuade Tokyo to promise aid despite its anger at Moscow for seizing four northern islands at the end of World War II.
Despite the new wave of cooperation, Group of Seven tensions have not suddenly vanished like Cinderella's coach. The biggest remaining source of friction is Japan's trade surplus of more than $100 billion with the rest of the world. If the cooperation breaks down, it could well be over trade imbalances and trade barriers.

HEADLINE: Israeli Concessions Said to Revive Peace Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
A series of Israeli concessions has stirred optimism among Palestinian delegates after the first week of resuscitated Middle East peace talks.
Among the concessions, which the Israelis prefer to call confidence-building measures, were decisions to allow a leading Palestinian from East Jerusalem to join the Palestinian delegation and to let a group of Palestinians banned from the occupied territories come home. 
 Together they cleared the way for the parties to put aside important but somewhat peripheral issues and move on to the crucial question of the status of the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
"I'm not saying we are there yet," said Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation. "I'm saying, finally the peace process is showing indications that it can move ahead, it can produce, it can be a vehicle for change."
Ms. Ashrawi said she believed the Israeli gestures could move the talks to a "qualitatively different phase. Some doors are being opened and we are doing our best to help and respond positively."
The Israelis are negotiating simultaneously with the Palestinians, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. In a sense, their concessions this week have allowed the Palestinian talks to catch up with the other three. In the other negotiations, the parties are discussing the primary issues, without the distractions caused by the deportations and other issues that have stalled the Palestinian talks.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians may have cleared away much of the chaff that has prevented progress, they are just now getting to the essence of the most difficult issues. So far in the quid pro quo that is a part of negotiations, the concessions have come from Israel. Next week, Israeli and American officials say, it is time for a significant gesture by the Palestinians.
"We hope next week they will seriously engage on the issue of interim self-government arrangements and how they can plan on structures of self-government," said a senior State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The quo really is the substantive engagement we hope will happen."
The talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians are aimed at producing an agreement on self-rule for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza for a five-year interim period. No later than the third year, the two sides would begin talks on the final status of the occupied territories.
"What we want to do is to send a message things are happening," Israel's chief negotiator, Elyakim Rubinstein, said on Friday, referring to the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
On Wednesday, the Israelis agreed to allow the return of 30 Palestinian exiles who were deported from the territories between 1967 and 1987. The first 15, all members of Palestinian factions loyal to Yasir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization, came home to a heroes' welcome in Jericho on Friday.
The Israelis no doubt hope that the Palestinian people will note the contrast between the triumphant homecoming of the 15 deportees and the forlorn impotence of 396 exiled supporters of Hamas, the militant Islamic fundamentalist group, languishing in southern Lebanon.
The Israelis have also offered to allow 5,000 Palestinian expatriates with families in the occupied territories to remain permanently at the end of their traditional summer visits. And Ms. Ashrawi said Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Government was considering giving housing permits to Palestinians whose homes were slated for demolition for economic or security reasons.
Driving the Israeli-Palestinian talks is a fear that further delay will strengthen Hamas, which opposes negotiations with Israel. The growing influence of Hamas is causing the Israelis to move to buck up Palestinian leadership in the territories. In a break with the past, the Rabin Government does not care if that leadership is tied to the P.L.O., so long as it is not linked to Hamas. "What we are saying is that we want to speak to whoever lives in the territories, regardless of who he supports or what he's a member of," said a senior Israeli official on Friday.

HEADLINE: As U.N. Prepares for Somalia Command, Rebuilding Is Most Urgent Task

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, May 1

 BODY:
Late into the night, the open-air cinema in central Mogadishu blares Bruce Lee movies and American rap and rock tunes, the towering screen dancing shadows off the walls of buildings. During the day, in the overwhelming heat and humidity, the streets drone with the sounds of generators that supply electricity to one-room shops offering T-shirts, imitation Reeboks and even photocopying services.
Commercial ships dock at the port; one last month was laden with a shipment of thousands of plastic toy guns. There are still no telephones, but on certain blocks, standpipes provide running water. There is even a fledgling police force. 
 All this is not to say that petty theft, occasional looting, gunfights and random shootings are not frequent in Mogadishu, the nation's capital, where there is still no government or banking system. Yet five months after American troops landed to insure the delivery of food and medicine to a starving population, life is taking on a semblance of normality.
In a city where thousands of American troops were once based, it has become rare to see a desert camouflage uniform on the streets or the once-ubiquitous military utility vehicles called humvees. In a brief ceremony next week, the United States military command will officially hand over control of the relief operations in Somalia to the United Nations.
Aside from the handshakes and the raising of a new flag over the command headquarters, it will be little more than a symbolic goodbye. Except for about 4,000 troops who will stay behind in Somalia, the Americans have already departed and have been replaced by soldiers from about 20 countries. The overall American presence reached a high of nearly 26,000. The remaining American troops force will include a quick-reaction force of 1,300 and about 2,700 logistical personnel.
 
New Ground for the U.N.
 Yet in other ways it is far from a token handover. As the political and military commands change hands, shifting much more responsibility onto the shoulders of the United Nations, the mission here in Somalia is expected to expand to encompass the entire country and even move beyond relief assistance into reconstruction. Its success will be a test case for future United Nations missions elsewhere.
Among relief workers, Somalis and United Nations officials there is a feeling of uncertainty, and concern that if this operation does not succeed, then Somalia has no other options.
"There is a good basis to start working from," said a Western official in Mogadishu. "But it has got to continue. There can't be a pause or a dip. There is no time to lose. To make that transition, the U.N. has to move forward on a cease-fire and disarmament. They have to get the banking system and the police back together. What worries me is that they don't have a coherent plan."
There is also concern that the Somali factions whose warring pushed the country into anarchy and prompted the American intervention will try to test the resolve of the new United Nations force in the next several weeks. But United Nations military commanders insist the groundwork for a transition has been well established and that any disruption will be dealt with firmly.
"It's a bit like Belfast," said Geoff Loane, relief coordinator for the International Committee of the Red Cross, referring to the capital of Northern Ireland, where British Army troops have confronted the I.R.A. for the past 24 years. "It's almost an antiterrorist presence, a show of force with the ability to pull the trigger if necessary."
 
U.S. Mission Accomplished
 The American mission, narrowly defined as providing a secure environment for the delivery of relief supplies as well as disarming the warring factions, has been accomplished, said Gen. Robert Johnston, the Marine commander in charge of the American-led task force in Somalia.
About 22,000 members of a United Nations force that is expected to reach 28,000 is already on the ground. Two of the major players in the United Nations operation in Somalia are high-ranking American military officers. Adm. Jonathan Howe, retired, is the United Nations special envoy and Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Montgomery of the Army is deputy commander of the military branch of the United Nations force and has tactical control of the quick-reaction force.
Both General Montgomery and the United Nations commanding officer, Lieut. Gen. Cevik Bir of Turkey, say their first priority will be consolidating control over the territory already under United Nations control and that disarmament of the warring factions will be pursued.
Only then, and after the political branch of the United Nations operation has paved the way, will they move into the northern part of Somalia. "Our mission is a unique mission," General Bir said. "It is the first time in the history of the U.N." But although the military side has a blueprint for its operations, the political side is more tentative. One of its biggest handicaps will be money.
While the military side of the United Nations operation will cost about $1.5 billion for one year, donor nations have promised so far only about $150 million for relief aid, of which only an estimated $14 million has been delivered.
 
Warlords' Competing Claims
 Since the reconciliation conference in March, at which the warring Somali factions agreed to form an interim governmental council, little progress has been made toward that end except for some international campaigning by a couple of the Somali warlords. Mohamed Farah Aidid, the warlord who controlled most of Mogadishu, has been traveling in search of international support and recognition, Western officials say. A rival, Mohammed Ali Mahdi, a hotel-owner and self-proclaimed President, is in Italy for health reasons but made a radio broadcast recently reaffirming his claim to be President of Somalia.
Last month, American troops gradually pulled out of three towns they once controlled, handing over Bardera to the Botswanans and Merca and Mogadishu to the Pakistanis, all part of the United Nations force.
The force on the ground is now an international patchwork. The countries with the largest contingents are Pakistan, with about 4,760; the United States, with 4,000; Italy, with 2,558; Morocco, with 1,295, and France, with 1,100. And while the military presence in Mogadishu was once overwhelmingly American, it has become more mixed than ever. The Egyptians guard one end of the airport, the Pakistanis the other. The Turks and Australians share guard duty at the United States Embassy compound. The Nigerians patrol in miniature white armored cars with bold "U.N." letters painted on the sides. The Zimbabweans drive huge boxlike trucks with slits on the sides and no markings, and the Pakistanis have camouflage Ford pickups with "Pakistan" scrawled with chalk on the doors. Communication among the soldiers is limited to pidgin English.
 
Starvation No Longer the Issue
 The Somalia that the United Nations force inherits is no longer a country ravaged by war and famine: food is reaching every town. But there are still isolated pockets of malnutrition, relief officials say, and looting of food on the roads between towns is still common. The relief agencies' convoys still move with military escorts, and there are still firefights and occasional grenade attacks on compounds in places like the southern port city of Kismayu.
But as emergency aid moves into the rehabilitation phase, there is also a change of emphasis in relief work and the feeling that the situation is no longer crucial enough to warrant putting lives at risk.
Care International pulled out of Bardera in March because of threats and demands for pay raises from its Somali truckers. The Red Cross, the relief agency that has been in Somalia the longest, is paring down its branches because it says there is no longer need for extensive emergency intervention. It has closed down operations in Bardera and Baidoa, and by June will have closed down its 1,000 feeding kitchens.
"My own view is that we've changed the goal posts," said Mr. Loane, the Red Cross coordinator. "The levels of danger we were ready to accept in 1992 were much higher. Everyone has modified their expectations of security. And now the risk to expatriates is felt to be higher than in 1992 even though it was much more dangerous then."
 
A Need for Jobs
 Perhaps the biggest challenge will be the rebuilding of the country's infrastructure and the creation of jobs. Unemployment is pervasive. Every day in Mogadishu, hundreds of men stake out relief and U.N. agencies in the often-futile hope of finding work.
The first step has been the creation of a police force of 4,600 men, 3,000 of whom are based in Mogadishu; 20 percent of them are armed. The United Nations has invested $4.8 million in the first six months of this project and hopes to more than double the number, to about 10,000 police, by next year. The goal is to eclipse the power of the warlords.
There are now two magistrates in Mogadishu and three in Baidoa, and a prison in the capital with 43 inmates. The present judiciary system is based on a 1962 law drawn from the Italian penal code. But the structure is still fragile, Somalis and Westerners agree.
Last month, the police became the first civil servants in Somalia to be paid in more than two years. But their salaries bring to the forefront another problem. Their pay, about $90 a month, is many times higher than similar salaries in other developing countries, and United Nations officials worry they may be creating a civil administrative structure that the Somalia Government will not be able to support once the United Nations leaves.
For the moment, justice appears to be swift. The day after being arrested in Baidoa a few weeks ago, a well-known looter and murderer was sentenced to 20 years in prison. But when his lawyer and the prosecutor both appealed the next day -- one for clemency and the other for a tougher sentence -- the magistrate condemned the man to death. He was executed within the hour.

HEADLINE: Political Scandals in Japan Find a Role for Mah-Jongg

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 1

 BODY:
Japan's running political scandals have tainted the governing party and brought down a onetime kingmaker on an array of charges of financial misdeeds. Now the affair has implicated one of the nation's dearest institutions: mah-jongg.
Developed in China, mah-jongg is an ancient, four-handed game played a bit like gin rummy, but using ivory or plastic tiles. Young men generally learn it at school, developing a lifelong passion for the gambling and bonhomie essential to the game. It is a rite of passage not just into adulthood but into the back rooms of the political world. 
 As described by several Government officials, games of mah-jongg can involve little more than an evening of entertainment for a group of men; women rarely play here. But, like poker in the United States, the game can also provide a test of bravado and a forum where important deals are cut.
 
Cheating the Tax Collector
 Mah-jongg is also notorious as a means the powerful employ in a little-seen, yet robust national industry here -- tax evasion. Until he was dethroned by the scandals of last year, Shin Kanemaru was Japan's most powerful politician. He had a personal mah-jongg parlor near his office, and he played high-stakes games there late into the smoke-filled evenings with other top politicians.
Now those games have created a sensation, angering those who would rather keep prying eyes away from the strategically important game.
"This industry has largely been a supporter of the L.D.P., but I have lost any desire to support them any more," said Hiroshi Aoki, head of an association of mah-jongg parlor owners, referring to the governing Liberal Democratic Party's leadership. "This is a total disaster for us, what those Diet members have done. Mr. Kanemaru was not playing mah-jongg, he was just using the game to exchange money."
 
Limits of Civic Virtue
 Odd as this deep concern with mah-jongg may seem, it underscores what many financial experts, businessmen and Government officials admit is a serious and surprisingly common, if rarely acknowledged, problem in Japan. This may be a country where even on the most deserted street pedestrians refuse to cross against a red light, but taxes and financial dealings appear to be another matter.
In the fiscal year that ended last June, the Government caught corporations evading the equivalent of $5.5 billion in taxes and individuals evading $2.5 billion more. Experts concede that that is probably a fraction of the amount actually dodged every year. In addition, corporations are permitted simply to declare some of their expenditures as "unaccounted for." It is widely believed that much of this money finds its way into the hands of politicians. This sum came to more than $500 million in the last fiscal year.
"Tax avoidance practices are rampant here, even with some new rules they imposed," said Yukio Tomioka, a professor at Chuo University and a former Government tax official. "It is highly regrettable, but using mah-jongg as a game to make secret payments is a very old method in Japan. In business and politics this is widely practiced. It is deep in the culture."
 
Money Leaves Few Footprints
 Gaping loopholes in the laws and the fact that this is largely a cash economy make tax evasion, and money laundering, simpler in Japan than nearly any other industrial country. This remains true despite a recent tightening of various rules, experts say.
Mah-jongg has its own special niche in this well-oiled system. Gambling on mah-jongg is frequently used to pass along large illicit payments, with the players skillfully winning or losing large sums as the occasion demands. A senior corporate executive said some hosts would even hire professionals to insure that by the end of the evening the appropriate sums had crossed the table. It is illegal to gamble on mah-jongg, but the law is rarely enforced.
Mr. Kanemaru's reported links to mah-jongg were so explosive that just about every member of the Cabinet has been grilled by reporters on whether they played with him. (Although Mr. Kanemaru is out of jail on bail, he is under indictment on tax evasion charges.) Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa felt compelled to insist that he had not played in 20 years.
 
Living High on Illicit Cash
 Adding to the public's outrage at the idea of politicians trifling away millions of dollars of illicit contributions over a mah-jongg table is the fact that Mr. Kanemaru appears to have diverted huge amounts of political contributions for his personal use.
Mr. Kanemaru was said to have obtained millions of dollars in illicit payments every year from construction companies that he helped by shepherding Government work their way.
Mr. Kanemaru was arrested earlier this year on tax evasion charges after he was found with tens of millions of dollars of special long-term bank debentures, or bonds, secreted in his offices, and more than 220 pounds of gold.
Mr. Kanemaru was the most prolific money-raiser in the governing party, and his immense influence rested in part on his ability to dole out cash to other politicians, Liberal Democrats and opposition members. The cash was a bond that smoothed the way for legislation and patronage.
That is where his personal mah-jongg parlor is said to have come into play. Asked once how this money was transferred, one of Japan's most senior politicians, replied, "Oh, Kanemaru loses to them in mah-jongg or poker or something like that."

High-stakes mah-jongg games have attracted many of the country's top politicians. (Kaku Kurita for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Israel Builds Ties to Ex-Soviet Muslim Lands

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 1

 BODY:
While it remains in a technical state of war with most of its Islamic neighbors, Israel has moved resolutely beyond its region to establish diplomatic and trade relations with the largely Muslim republics of the former Soviet Union.
The Jewish state's ties to the Islamic world have always been thin at best, aside from a few conspicuous exceptions like Egypt and Turkey, but it has met little resistance in the Central Asian republics since the breakup of
the Soviet empire two years ago. 
 To the contrary, Israeli diplomats and business executives say they are being avidly courted, in large part because they have the know-how to help those emerging states transform outdated farming techniques and communications systems. Israelis tell of projects that have multiplied tomato yields six-fold in Kazakhstan and increased cotton output by 30 percent in Uzbekistan while reducing water consumption by two-thirds.
Endless Middle East conflicts seem distant to Muslims in those countries, and minor compared with their own troubles, the Israelis say. And although Iran has sought to expand its influence, Israelis report that it has not been aggressively anti-Israel in its approach.
"These countries are aiming to establish relations with the West, and know that economic progress depends on following the secular Turkish model and not that of Iran," a senior official here said. "Israel, too, is a model on which they would like to pattern themselves."
The Israelis recognize that the secularly oriented governments they are embracing could be replaced one day by more assertively Islamic ones. But they call it a risk worth taking, both for the potential trade benefits and the political mileage inherent in dealing on a friendly basis with Muslims.
In the last two years, Israel has established official relations with five of six largely Muslim republics: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan; only Turkmenistan has held back. Leaders of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have visited Israel, as have a string of lower-ranking delegations from the other countries, including trade missions and officials looking for training in irrigation techniques and livestock husbandry and food storage.
 
United States Participates
 "They realize that we have a relative advantage in these fields of agriculture and irrigation," said Ehud Gol, director of the Foreign Ministry's Division for International Cooperation. He added that many aid programs were run jointly with the United States, the Americans usually putting up the money and the Israelis the expertise.
Perhaps inevitably, Israeli interest in the Asian republics also has a Jewish dimension.
Officials estimate that 200,000 Jews live in the region, most in deeply rooted communities that have experienced little virulent anti-Semitism. But there is concern here that Jews could get caught up in a backlash of anti-Russian nationalism. As a result, Israeli officials want to keep the exits clear, and they have set up regular flights to and from important regional capitals like Baku, in Azerbaijan, and Tashkent, in Uzbekistan.
But for now, those flights are used mainly by Israeli executives, who have developed a lucrative trade in irrigation piping, plastics, pesticides, telecommunications and some consumer products. Leading the pack are the heads of two large Israeli business groups, Shoul Eisenberg and Yosef Maiman, whose rivalry is particularly intense in Kazakhstan -- a huge, oil-rich trading lodestone, even if now it pays mostly by barter and not cash.
Compared with Western European nations, tiny Israel is in a junior league, Mr. Maiman acknowledged, but he said that it holds its own. "These countries are rather pragmatic," he said. "I think they feel they can get a lot of support from Israel, and they're going after it."
On that score, Mr. Eisenberg agreed. "We very seldom talk politics," he said. "Business is business."

HEADLINE: State Health Bill Interests Clinton

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 1

 BODY:
On Wednesday, a few days after this state passed a universal health-care bill similiar to the plan favored by the Clinton Administration, the President called Gov. Mike Lowry of Washington to the White House for advice on how he won approval for the plan.
All the elements that are shaping the President's health-care plan, to be released later this month, were in place here: an army of lobbyists that warned of dire consequences, radio talk-show hosts who orchestrated a flood of negative phone calls and a minority party that refused to budge. 
 Last Friday, after the lobbyists had been locked out of the State Legislature in Olympia, the Clinton model won, carrying a handful of Republican votes in the solidly Democratic Legislature.
When the Governor signs the bill, probably within 10 days, Washington will have one of the most aggressive health-care experiments in the nation, a program that would extend medical benefits to all 5.1 million residents of the state and try to control costs through a cap on insurance premiums.
The plan would require all employers to pay at least half the cost of health insurance premiums for their employees. By promoting a managed competition system, in which people and businesses would buy health care from a network of doctors and hospitals, the bill is closer than the reform efforts of any other state to the plan mentioned most frequently by the Clinton Administration.
 
A Leap Into the Unknown
 "This is monumental, historic legislation that the Clinton Administration can go to school on," Governor Lowry said in an interview. But the state plan would also be a leap into the unknown, a move that many business leaders said could have disastrous economic consequences.
In talks with Governor Lowry, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, who heads the national task force on health care, were particularly interested in the political strategy used in the state, the Governor said. But some of the lessons learned in this Washington may have already been lost on the other Washington.
While the Clinton task force had antagonized the medical establishment early on, Washington began by enlisting the support of the leading doctor group in the state, which became a crucial ally. In addition, the task force has been criticized for keeping many of its meetings private. In this state, the promoters of health care reform went out of their way to involve the public.
"We tried to avoid the traditional Democratic approach that would have doomed this thing from the start," said State Senator Phil Talmadge, who steered the bill through the Legislature. "We weren't going to create some huge new government bureaucracy, so we took that away from the critics. Also, we had some pretty good data that showed that the state would save a significant amount of money in the long haul by adopting health reform now."
 
A Debate Over Savings
 With the cost of health care rising 15 percent a year in the state, Washington was faced with a situation of endless tax increases to balance its budget. The new plan was sold as a way to prevent future tax hikes. But critics said Washington may have committed itself to a new multibillion-dollar burden.
"It's not going to bring down costs," Dr. Michael Schlitt, a Seattle neurosurgeon, said of managed competition. "By having a centralized entity making your medical decision, it's only going to raise costs."
Washington is one of six states that have passed universal health-care bills. Florida recently signed a similar bill into law, after legislators fought off an intense lobbying effort. In Washington, most of the major lobbies, from business to labor to unions representing state workers, opposed the reform.
"I think the interest groups underestimated the incredibly strong desire for change and reform coming from the people," Mr. Talmage said.
Critics conceded that, because the opponents lacked a clear alternative, they were outmaneuvered. "I don't think anybody likes the status quo," said Rick Rubin, a health policy expert who worked with business groups to oppose the plan. "The business community is very interested in health-care reform that controls costs. But they are suspicious of this approach. You can't name an industry where price controls have been effective."
 
Some Benefits for Business
 While the plan would place most of the burden on the backs of businesses, it does have some benefits: the cap on insurance premiums, financial assistance for struggling companies, and the ability to buy insurance through a purchasing cooperative.
Without an overhaul of the system, the supporters of the bill said, per capita spending on health care would rise to $7,000 by the end of the decade from $2,737 today. The Boeing Company, the biggest employer in the state, would spend nearly $19,000 a year in health costs on each employee if the present trends continued for seven years, according to state projections.
The plan would phase in over six years the rules that would require employers to offer health insurance. Even self-employed people would be required to buy health care.
It also would set up four purchasing cooperatives, which would pool the resources of thousands of people to buy services from certified health plans. By forcing doctors and specialists to join these plans, costs would be held down, the promoters of the bill said.

HEADLINE: Nannygate for the Poor;
The Underground Economy in Day Care for Children

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
For years, Gladys Cordero was pointed out by strangers as "the lady in the green house." She cared for as many as 16 children at once in her modest home on Staten Island -- illegally. Neighbors knew her. Cabdrivers directed customers to her. Even the public elementary school across the street sent parents her way.
A loyal clientele trailed the 60-year-old woman three years ago, when she moved to a new neighborhood 40 blocks away. Mrs. Cordero charges $20 a day for babies in diapers and $15 for older children. But the real currency is trust, she said, in a widespread commerce that has served struggling, low-income parents for decades in New York City. 
 Officials say there is no way of knowing how many people like Mrs. Cordero provide illegal day care. She cares for three preschoolers and an 11-month-old grandson in her home in South Beach, S.I. But with more women working and more mothers providing the sole support for their family, child-care advocates suggest there could be at least 25,000 day-care providers operating without licenses or official oversight in the city's working poor neighborhoods.
One city official called the largely invisible world of these day care operations the "poor person's nannygate" -- the flip side of the highly publicized troubles of Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, President Clinton's first two choices for Attorney General. Both were forced to withdraw their names after questions were raised about their hiring of illegal aliens as nannies.
 
Nowhere Else to Turn
 Nationwide, there are from 550,000 to 1.1 million unlicensed family day-care homes, according to a 1991 study commissioned by the Federal Government. The study also showed that households with incomes under $15,000 spend an average of 23 percent on child care, while families with incomes over $40,000 spend an average of 6 percent.
In New York City, day care subsidized by the city serves only 13 percent of the parents who are eligible. A vast majority are left to find day care on their own. Many low-income parents, who typically can afford to pay only $50 to $75 a week, ultimately turn to neighbors or relatives or even strangers whose names are posted on telephone poles or community bulletin boards.
City officials fear that such arrangements might expose children to unnecessary hazards. Providers might be caring for a dangerously high number of children, not meeting fire and safety codes or, in rare cases, might have a history of abuse or neglect.
In February, two children died in a house fire in Queens at an unregistered day-care operation run by an 82-year-old woman. But officials stressed that the Queens fire was unusual, the first such fire since two children entrusted to an illegal day-care provider in Brooklyn died seven years ago.
 
'Not Day-Care Cops'
 For every child under the age of 3 in regulated care in New York City, 15 children of that age are entrusted to illegal providers, estimates Child Care Inc., the largest nonprofit resource and day-care referral agency in the city.
"People are desperate for care, and they want to believe their baby sitters are adequate to the job because it's hard to face the possibility that it might not be true," said Caroline Zinsser, an expert on informal and unregulated day care in New York. "Unlicensed care is not necessarily bad, but when you get into dealing with strangers, a license is a help in assuring quality."
State law requires certification for any person who cares for more than two children not related to the provider. The day-care providers must pass physical exams, be checked for child abuse and neglect and subject their places of business to random inspections. The requirements become more stringent the more children a provider cares for.
The city's Department of Health is reponsible for the inspections and enforcement. But city officials, as well as child-care advocates, concede there is not an aggressive effort to root out illegal operations because of inadequate staffing and recent budget cuts.
"We're in the business of facilitating day care," said Steven Matthews, a spokesman for the city's Department of Health. "We're not day-care cops. If we become aware of a center, we will move to bring it into compliance."
 
'The Best I Could Do'
 Among the reasons that many providers do not comply with regulations are a desire to avoid taxes, a disdain for government intrusion and a fear that they may lose welfare benefits because of the income. Some are intimidated by the red tape, while others, like Mrs. Cordero, simply see no need for it. "I never thought of it," she said. "The time flies."
Yolanda Cutler, a single mother in Jamaica, Queens, saw the merits of having a licensed provider. But when she could not find one for less than $100 a week for her 3-year-old daughter, she took a chance on a stranger whose phone number was tacked to a supermarket bulletin board for $75 a week.
The provider cares for four young children as well as five of her own in a tiny apartment in Queens. In the last six months, Ms. Cutler said she has been unhappy that her daughter, Mischalett, is allowed to watch television all day. She is unnerved by the cats that race about the provider's home, the litter box by the front door and the perilously steep stairway.
But the 21-year-old Ms. Cutler, who studies social work at York College by day and rings a cash register at a Burger King at night, says her options are limited. She earns $6,000 a year and lives with her mother.
"It's not up to my standards, but right now it's the best thing I could do," Ms. Cutler said.
 
On the Waiting List
 Vivian Jones, a single mother, feels the same way. Every day, her two children, still in diapers, are dropped off at the apartment of an illegal day-care provider, known as "Auntie" by neighbors along Amsterdam Avenue in Washington Heights.
Ms. Jones, a secretary who makes less than $20,000 a year, worries about the arrangement. But she said she received little help from the government when she sought day care.
In January, Ms. Jones applied for day care that would have cost her only $35 a week with the Agency for Child Development, the city agency that administers subsidized day care. But the 25-year-old mother said she was told that there was nothing available on the West Side of Manhattan for children the age of hers, 10-month-old Shafonda and 22-month-old Rondell. Ms. Jones's name was added to a waiting list.
Ms. Jones said she could not afford to wait. She recently found an illegal day-care provider through a network of relatives and friends. She pays $100 a week for her children to spend 10 hours a day with the provider.
"She's a known person," Ms. Jones said. "She has raised a lot of children in the neighborhood for over 12 years."
 
'It Doesn't Even Stink'
 The day-care provider, like many others, declined to be interviewed. Ms. Jones said her children's provider, who cares for three babies and two school-age children, chooses not to become regulated because, she says, "It's too much hassle."
On her first visit, she was heartened that the provider was open and friendly. There was a smoke detector. The provider's fifth-floor apartment in a tenement building was spacious, clean and free of graffiti. "It doesn't even stink when you go in," Ms. Jones said.
Ms. Jones, who considered quitting her job to care for her children, would have been given a higher priority for subsidized care if she had been on welfare, an abuse and neglect victim or a teen-age parent, said city officials and child-care advocates. But she describes herself as an independent woman and is loath to join the welfare rolls.
"I'm focusing on working instead of depending on the system," she said in frustration. "It's hard for somebody who's motivated to work to find proper care for their children."
Ms. Jones said she would have preferred to have her children in regulated day care, but she made her decision out of necessity.
"I can't take my kids to work and I don't want to quit my job," she said. "You have to use what you can use and keep going. You are always going to worry because you don't really know what people are going to do behind closed doors. You ask God to bless the children and protect them and watch over them."
 
Licensing Process Changed
 Last year, the state changed its licensing process to encourage illegal day-care providers to comply with regulations. Providers no longer must be inspected by officials before getting a license; they must simply fill out a long application form to become automatically certified.
But advocates say the daunting, English-only form and a fear of an Internal Revenue Service crackdown has only discouraged potential providers and driven even more underground.
City officials concede there have been problems. But Mr. Matthews, of the health department, said the application forms have been shortened. If the process were simplified more, he said, "you would run the risk of 'What value is the regulation?' "
"The whole idea," he said, "is to have certain requirements and standards."
The penalty for operating without registering can run as high as $500 a day and the closing of the illegal sites. Since the February fire in Queens, city officials said they received a flurry of calls from parents inquiring whether their day care was legal. But in the last eight months, no fines have been levied for operating without proper registration, said James McCormack, a deputy director at the city's Department of Health.
Patricia Lee, who provides day care for three children on Coney Island, said the fire in the home in Queens had only a fleeting impact on the parents who live in the high-rise projects in her neighborhood.
"That was something tragic," she said. "But when people are looking for a baby sitter, they don't mention the Queens apartment. They're not that meticulous about apartments or smoke alarms. They want to know if they feel comfortable knowing you won't hurt their children. We don't have too much choice out here."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Where's Judge Landis When You Need Him?

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
Because the baseball owners are dragging their spikes, I've decided to begin my own search for a new commissioner. Not that a new commissioner will necessarily solve all of the national pastime's problems, but the grass roots do need hope. Who really believes that baseball is in economic pain and that either the owners or the players are potential victims? Isn't the crisis about the public's attitude? Will baseball survive as a "national pastime," a game that reveals the soul of a country, or as just another circus?
I began my search with Richard Ravitch, real estate developer, former New York mayoral candidate and currently major league baseball's chief labor executive, and Jim Bouton, the former Yankee 20-game winner, sports newscaster and author of the best book on baseball ever, "Ball Four". 
 Ravitch and I met for lunch at Il Menestrello, a pricey Italian restaurant in midtown Manhattan where he is apparently well known. I asked him whether he was prepared to take the commissioner's job if offered. He said he was not a candidate. We got down to business.
Ravitch is proposing a two-step program to bring the game into the 21st century as a rival to basketball, football and Japan. Step one would be an owners' common market in which revenue would be shared. Step two would be a limit on players' salaries, a cap for each club. The effect, he says, would be a settling of the current disorder in baseball with owners threatening to move or go under and players hopping from team to team, further cranking the national insecurity. There would be an equality of talent, which would lead to more exciting games and pennant races, he maintained, and an end to the hostility between player and owner.
Ravitch favors expansion to more American cities as well as exporting the game overseas, and an industry-wide effort to promote individual players on a national basis. He would explore earlier starting times to engage kids, and more rather than fewer games. He would like to know why there are not more black and Hispanic fans.
Ravitch has a bemused and superior attitude; as a longtime fan (he said he saw Jackie Robinson's first game at Ebbets Field) and a liberal public policy activist, he has the background to charm or alienate players, owners and journalists equally, which is a plus. He smokes and was chairman of the Bowery Savings Bank when Joe DiMaggio was its pitchman, which could be used against him.
Jim Bouton and I met for lunch at Bogota, an inexpensive Italian restaurant in downtown Teaneck, N.J., where he is apparently well known. He said he was prepared to take the commissioner's job if it is offered. "It would be fun," he said, "and would give baseball some credibility." We got down to business.
Bouton's three-point plan involves radical changes by ownership. He said: "First of all, owners would have to stop trashing the players. In what other business does management tell customers that the product is not worth the money it costs? And secondly, all owners would have to agree to stay put, there could be no movement of clubs, no threatening to leave."
His third point mandates long-term contracts to create player and fan loyalty. He suggests that with intelligent scouting, an owner could offer several youngsters a season a guaranteed million dollars over 10 years. There would be bonuses, some of them multimillion dollar bonuses, for making the major league roster, for winning a batting title, for a certain earned-run average, etc. Even if only a few kids pan out, the team would be better off than under the present system of club-hopping free agents.
"Most important," said Bouton, "the owners have to start selling the game as an exciting entertainment filled with interesting personalities. Right now, they're selling the game as if it's about winning, which it can't be. If every team won its fair share of World Series championships, that would only be about four per century. Fans have been falsely led to believe that they deserve more victories than that.
"Baseball should be about the pleasure of the process, not just the end result."
As commissioner, Bouton would try to defuse the various hostilities in the game, particularly owners versus players and players versus sportswriters.
"I'd hold an orientation for new players on how to deal with the press," said Bouton. "I'd say, 'This is the only business where you get free advertising every single day. So be nice to the free advertising guys. Talk to them, it doesn't even have to make sense what you say. Just never spit on them. And once in a while, give one an old glove. You'll own the writer for life.' "
Bouton, who at 54 can stand on his head, is an inspiring motivational speaker, and is married to a psychologist, which is a plus. He still pitches, mostly knuckleballs, in a competitive hardball league and is writing, with Eliot Asinof, what looks so far to be a smart and funny inside baseball novel, which could be used against him.
The search has only just begun. I am taking all suggestions seriously.

HEADLINE: Mr. McCall for State Comptroller

 BODY:
The New York Legislature elects a new State Comptroller this week to succeed the Republican, Edward Regan, who has resigned after 13 years. A Democrat will win because a majority of the legislators are Democrats, and the outcome will almost certainly hang on the endorsement of the Assembly's powerful Speaker, Saul Weprin.
On the merits, the vote should go to Carl McCall, president of New York City's Board of Education. He has performed sensibly and responsibly in that difficult role, and that performance argues for the challenge of higher office.
Gov. Mario Cuomo's backing for Mr. McCall raises the issue of independence. A Democratic comptroller must be just as independent from Democratic governors and legislators as Mr. Regan was in auditing state accounts and investing pension funds. Again, Mr. McCall's experience as a banker and elected official recommends him as someone who can watch the money while avoiding needless political bickering and personal conflicts. 
 Both Mr. McCall and his chief opponent, Carol Bellamy, wisely advocate an investment committee to share in decisions. Both also agree that there is room to invest in ways that aid economic development or support worthy social objectives.
It can be argued that Ms. Bellamy's career has given her strong credentials for Comptroller. She has been an investment banker since leaving office as president of New York's City Council in 1985, and we trust she would perform ably as Comptroller.
But Ms. Bellamy cast a shadow over her candidacy for the same office in 1990 by accepting $38,000 from Carl Icahn, the aggressive investor who had locked horns with Mr. Regan. She concedes it was a mistake because it created the impression of dependence on a rich contributor. It still remains a troubling blemish on her record.
The new Comptroller's term will expire next year. If Mr. McCall were to win re-election then, he would be the first black candidate elected statewide. The prospect of a more diverse Democratic ticket is another reason to choose him now.
On balance, the nod goes to Mr. McCall as an interim choice in a job that voters will need to give close attention in 1994.

HEADLINE: 'This Incredible Gift You Give'

 BODY:
"I remember the first time I stuck my toes in the bottom of a pond. I said, 'What is under there?' I was used to concrete pools. I heard little country bugs instead of being rocked to sleep by city noises. Most of all, I experienced another side of life. This is an incredible gift you give."
That's how John Wright, a native New Yorker who now works with homeless youths in the Times Square area, recalls his two weeks as a Fresh Air Fund child years ago. Mr. Wright is not alone in his memories. Since 1877, more than 1.6 million inner-city youngsters have enjoyed summer vacations in the country provided by the Fresh Air Fund. 
 The program opens its annual fund drive today. This year, the fund hopes to provide vacations for more than 10,000 children. About 7,200 will stay with volunteer host families from Virginia to Maine. Another 2,500 will hike and fish and learn to swim in Fresh Air Fund camps in Fishkill, N.Y.
Some youngsters will see for the first time that milk comes from cows, not cartons, that there are green stretches where the air is clean and the nights calm. Yet this "incredible gift" is not cost-free. The recession has taken a toll among other summer camps; the fund survives thanks to the energy of its volunteers and the willingness of donors to help kids break free of the city in summer.
A child's two-week vacation with a family costs $297, which covers transportation, insurance and administrative costs. Sending a needy child to camp costs $816. Last year the fund received 48,576 gifts totaling $3,632,324. The goal this year is to raise $3,698,000 by September.
"My mother wanted me to see the world," said Vanessa, 7, after her Fresh Air experience last year. Those who wish to open the world for other inner-city kids may address tax-deductible contributions -- as well as inquiries about becoming a host family -- to: The Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.

HEADLINE: Free Trade's Huge Costs

BYLINE: By Edmund G. Brown Jr.; Edmund G. Brown Jr., Governor of California from 1975 to 1983, was a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination last year.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Unfortunately, White House budget director Leon Panetta's pronouncement that the North American Free Trade Agreement is dead is untrue. The powerful free-trade ideologues and business interests which helped President Bush design and draft the agreement in virtual secrecy are very much in the driver's seat.
Washington insiders, including President Clinton, talk as if free trade is a magic bullet that automatically raises wages and generates jobs. Yet, since 1973, American trade with other countries has doubled while the average weekly paycheck has fallen by 18 percent, adjusted for inflation. The economy got bigger -- our national income per capita grew 28 percent -- but the benefits were channeled to those with the highest incomes. 
 Under the banner of free trade, American employers continue the hemorrhaging of U.S. jobs to (supposedly) efficient foreign production sites. For example, Smith Corona, the last American typewriter company, is discharging 875 of 1,300 employees and moving production to Mexico. The reason given is typical: equally skilled Mexican workers will do the same work for a lot less pay.
This shows the painful reality behind President Clinton's boast that the pact will create high paying jobs. The truth is, it will only create a race to the bottom in wage levels and environmental standards. This is inevitable if we rashly link ourselves to Mexico, where wages are one-tenth our own, environmental laws are unenforced, unions are captive to the state and the political system is rife with corruption and electoral fraud.
One would think that such a radical trade alliance with Mexico would inspire foreboding and widespread debate. Instead, Congress allowed the pact to be negotiated in secret and written in language so abstruse that debate about its provisions falls prey to arcane economic assumptions. Non-economists who refuse to think in terms of the econometric models marshaled in the pact's defense are chastised as neanderthals and narrow special-interests out to protect obsolete jobs at the expense of progress.
Compounding all this is the grossly undemocratic fast-track process for Congressional consideration of the pact. It perverts constitutional procedure by abrogating Congress's power to amend -- only a yes or no vote is allowed -- and it also imposes strict time limits on debate. As a consequence, the active participation of those who represent labor, environmental, consumer and human rights concerns is drastically limited.
Politically connected industries, however, are spared the rigors of unconstrained free trade: they are given special treatment. The trade agreement includes a "yarn forward clause" that protects American textile manufacturers by favoring yarn spun in North America, where U.S. companies are the low-cost producer. This exception to free-trade doctrine, one of several dozen in the pact, shows that trade restrictions are widely used, with the only question being: Whose financial interests are to be protected and for what reason?
The short answer is that global companies and their shareholders are protected because of their enormous political power. Those on both sides of the border without powerful lobbyists or financial clout are left to fend for themselves. The pact lifts protection on Mexican corn and other foods. As a result, economists at the University of California at Los Angeles estimate that 800,000 Mexican farming families will be driven off their communal lands because of low-cost U.S. competition. Approximately 700,000 additional illegal immigrants will then cross into the U.S. in search of work. The outcome will be suffering and depressed wages on both sides of the border as the number of desperate workers rapidly increases.
Another danger of the pact was exposed in legal challenges brought under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, on which the pact is based. Both trade agreements allow unelected officials to resolve conflicts by declaring national and local environmental and safety standards to be "non-tariff barriers" to trade and thus subject to financial penalties.
In August 1991, a three-person secret GATT dispute panel in Geneva ruled that the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 was an illegal trade barrier because it restricts the importing of tuna caught with nets that kill dolphins. The case was brought by Mexico. And in March 1992, a GATT panel ruled, after a complaint by Canada, that tax breaks in many U.S. states for small breweries were inconsistent with the global agreement and are subject to international sanctions.
In these decisions, the panel was saying that GATT overrode our Federal and state laws. Under this kind of reasoning, neither Congress nor our states could put in place environmental regulations like mandatory refillable bottles or restrictions on the export of raw logs.
Instead of democratic decisions made at the state and local level, under GATT and the North American trade pact we would all be subjected to a supergovernment of unelected trade bureaucrats.
These experts would bring to their jobs the narrow frame of reference of economic utility and not the dynamics and diversity of democratic participation. The side agreements that President Clinton is negotiating on labor and the environment change nothing: they are mere fig leaves to mollify critics.
Instead of going along on the fast track, Congress should reject Nafta as undemocratic and inconsistent with our growing understanding that political and economic power has become too centralized. What is needed instead is a trading relationship among Canada, Mexico and the U.S. that emphasizes social justice, enriching local communities and respect for the environment. This will only be possible only after the reigning fallacies behind free trade are thoroughly debated and refuted.

HEADLINE: Republicans Too Have Campaign Reform Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A more apt title for your April 25 editorial "Bob Dole Versus Political Reform" would have been "The New York Times Versus the Truth."
Nowhere in the editorial do you mention that Senate Republicans have introduced their own comprehensive campaign finance reform proposal -- one that bans political action committees, restricts both party and nonparty "soft money," prohibits the practice of bundling campaign contributions and improves political competition by allowing the political parties to give early "seed money" to viable challengers. Our proposal accomplishes all of these reform goals without asking the taxpayers to contribute a single dime. 
 You are dead wrong when you suggest that Americans are willing to support public financing of Congressional campaigns. Just look at the Presidential tax check-off system, where the participation rate has fallen to an all-time low of 17.7 percent. Quite simply, the American people want to cut Federal spending, not increase spending with an entitlement program for politicians.
Will President Clinton be making a big mistake if he insists on public financing? You bet. Unfortunately, the President has chosen not to consult with Congressional Republicans as the Administration puts the finishing touches on its own campaign finance proposal, a legislative strategy of exclusion that no doubt helped sink the so-called stimulus package.
Republicans have always been willing to sit down and negotiate a package of reform proposals on which there is broad agreement. Recognizing the need for bipartisanship, I recently told the Senate Rules Committee: "If Congress is to restore its credibility with the American people, then passing comprehensive campaign finance reform must be a top priority this year. And to ensure that the credibility of reform is in no way diminished, its crafting must be done on a bipartisan basis. The American people don't want a political document. They want a document they can trust -- one that enjoys broad bipartisan, and nonpartisan, support."
Perhaps you were referring to this statement when you denounced my "rhetoric" as amounting to "shilling for a corrupt status quo."
I would have welcomed the opportunity to clarify my position if you had bothered to contact my office before printing the editorial, which regrettably resorted to personal attacks among its barrage of falsehoods and guesswork. Apparently, when there is an honest disagreement, you would prefer name-calling to civility.
Finally, it appears The Times does not always practice what it preaches. A young aide in my office recently ran for Congress from New York's Seventh Congressional District, covering portions of both Queens and the Bronx. Although the race occurred right in your own backyard, you did not give his candidacy a single word of coverage, nor did you allow him to come before the editorial board for a candidate interview. The editorial board gave him the stiff-arm treatment, claiming that his candidacy was "not viable," even though he received 44 percent of the vote on Election Day, a higher percentage than Bill Clinton received nationwide.
You know as well as anyone that free press coverage is the lifeblood of underfinanced challengers and invaluable to leveling the political playing field. Now, when I read your editorials pontificating about the need to make politics more competitive, one word immediately comes to mind: hypocrisy. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to set the record straight.

HEADLINE: On Sunday For Giuliani, A Liberal Use Of Party Label

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
CANDIDATES for mayor of New York City met yesterday with state Liberal Party leaders at the Hotel Inter-Continental in mid-Manhattan, vying for the party endorsement in the fall election. Though results will not be known for a few weeks, the favorite appears to be a Republican, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former Federal prosecutor who was endorsed by the Liberals in the 1989 race and is the least liberal of the major candidates.
 Awarding him the Liberal endorsement would invite ridicule if it happened anywhere else. But New Yorkers are quite sophisticated and do not expect politics to make sense. 
Pity the poor out-of-town liberals. They get confused. In the early 1980's, as the Associate Attorney General in the Reagan Justice Department, Mr. Giuliani fought fiercely to keep Haitians locked in immigration camps, while people from other countries were released into the community. Ira Kurzban, a Miami liberal who is counsel for the Haitian Refugee Center, battled Mr. Giuliani, eventually winning the Haitians' freedom. "Rudolph Giuliani liberal?" says Mr. Kurzban. "About as liberal as Pat Buchanan."
 Richard D. Emery, a former New York Civil Liberties Union lawyer, fought Mr. Giuliani over defendants' rights in criminal cases. During the Reagan years, Mr. Giuliani spearheaded a national shift toward expanded prosecutorial powers. "I'm not an enemy of Rudy's anymore," says Mr. Emery, who now admires some of his policies. "But liberal? I wouldn't call him liberal. He sort of believes in the very opposite."
 Indeed, Mr. Giuliani is working to win the Conservative Party endorsement, too. "I don't understand how one person can be both," says Mike Long, Conservative Party leader.
 As United States Attorney, when Mr. Giuliani was criticized as being a publicity seeker -- having Wall Street executives arrested and handcuffed in their offices -- he often responded by bashing liberals. "If I don't tip in favor of law enforcement, who will?" he once said. "The civil libertarians won't. The defense lawyers won't. The liberal editorial writers won't."
 "I don't think even Rudy would say he's liberal," Mr. Emery says.
 Asked whether Mr. Giuliani considers himself liberal, Richard Bryers, his spokesman, says: "I don't think he'd pin himself down that way. He talks about no party having a franchise on good ideas."
 It's easy to understand why Mr. Giuliani wants the Liberals. In liberal New York City it can only help a Republican on the ballot.
 But why would Liberals want a conservative? Cynics suggest that the party that once supported John V. Lindsay and Mario M. Cuomo for mayor is now most interested in backing a winner who can deliver jobs and political influence beyond its size (26,500 city voters). During Mr. Giuliani's 1989 race, the Liberal Party leader, Raymond B. Harding, was a prominent though unpaid Giuliani adviser; Mr. Harding's son was on the Giuliani campaign payroll. Says Mr. Emery, "The Liberal Party doesn't stand for liberalism, it stands for opportunism."
 The Liberal Party leader isn't bothered by Mr. Giuliani's views. Mr. Giuliani supports the death penalty; the party is against it. ("Tell me what that has to do with being mayor," says Mr. Harding.) Mr. Giuliani opposed an all-civilian police review board. ("That issue's all over with," said Mr. Harding.) Mr. Giuliani endorsed Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Conservative Party candidate, for Senate over Robert Abrams, whom the Liberal Party endorsed. ("Understandable," said Mr. Harding. "They're both Republicans.") The Liberals supported President Clinton's jobs bill; Mr. Giuliani opposed it.
 Mr. Harding says the Liberals will endorse whoever can best provide clean government and stimulate the economy. Ideology doesn't matter for a mayor, he says: "People don't care if their garbage is picked up liberally or conservatively."
 "Put aside ideological differences," Mr. Giuliani's spokesman says. He wants be a fusion candidate, reaching out to all. On the one hand Mr. Guiliani pledges to cut city taxes; on the other he wants city teachers paid as much as suburban teachers and drug treatment on demand. Where will the money come from? By cutting administrative waste and salaries, Mr. Giuliani says, he can pay for teacher raises.
 United Federation of Teachers leaders support many of Mr. Giuliani's ideas, but say cutting administration won't make up the 23 percent difference between city and suburban salaries. "If you don't raise taxes," says a union spokeswoman, Susan Amlung, "you'd have to shift spending priorities." If the teachers get more pie, someone goes home with a sliver, and that is when ideology matters.
 So it is worth keeping in mind this new fact of life of city politics: A Republican-Liberal is not always a liberal Republican.

SWIMMING IN THE VOLCANO
By Bob Shacochis.
519 pp. New York:
Charles Scribner's Sons.
$22. 
 WHAT'S a short-story writer like Bob Shacochis ("Easy in the Islands," "The Next New World") to do when he attempts his first novel? Should he write from his strength -- his ability to tell a story deftly, using no more words than necessary? Or should he flex his biceps, snap off all restraints and write long? The temptation for the expert in brevity must be strong: if you're going to write a novel, why not try for the big view, take time, as Mr. Shacochis suggests, to smell "the thick cloying stink of jasmine and gardenias" and build an entire world while you're at it?
In "Swimming in the Volcano," his wall-size portrait of a Caribbean island something like Grenada, Mr. Shacochis tries both approaches. He begins with a fine symbolical short story, pauses, resumes with a funny short story, then about a third of the way along stops completely to write a dour novella involving entirely new characters. Meanwhile, scores of island people, from conspiring politicians to barbers on the beach, sprawl across the pages like oleander and hibiscus. Lacking a compelling narrative, or even compelling characters, the novel shouldn't work at all, but to a large degree it does -- at least for a reader blessed with time and tolerance. I'll explain why in a moment, but first a word about the plot.
The island is St. Catherine, newly independent from Britain; the year, 1977. The Prime Minister, a saintly man, is besieged by rebellious elements within his Government who think him morally naive. There have been disturbances in the north; here and there, soldiers stop cars. These tremors have little effect on the American expatriates who might have continued securely on the island had not an American woman, whose true moral naivete is equivalent to a detonator's blast, arrived to visit her former lover and set all at risk.
Mitchell Wilson, the ex-lover, is a young economist who came to St. Catherine to work for its Minister of Agriculture. He had an idea that he might discover "the secret to accomplishing something good and just on this earth, like rescuing a child-nation that had fallen, and was floundering, in a pigpen of greed." He never will; his Minister leads the conspiracy and, besides, in tumultuous times Americans look like C.I.A. provocateurs and are treated accordingly. Mitchell doesn't want to see Johnnie, as the young woman from his past is called. She's been away five years, been married to a drug dealer who's been indicted for murder. Now Johnnie squeezes past Customs with a stash of cocaine in her diaphragm case. She wants Mitchell and, as Mitchell dithers over what to do about her, the police pick up her trail.
In the novella that Mr. Shacochis has laid into his narrative, we learn the life history of the damaged young man who will become the sociopathic police officer assigned to Johnnie's case. For more than 60 pages the main story is suspended as this subplot develops -- a digression like those in Hugo's novel "Les Miserables." An impatient reader may scratch and curse, but in fact Mr. Shacochis is pursuing his real design. Neither the plot nor the characters are his principal concern; what he's interested in is the life of the island itself.
The author has lived in the Caribbean and has written about it in his short stories. He knows everything there is to know about islands like St. Catherine, and in the way of an encyclopedist he means to tell us everything. Quite literally, he takes us from the depths of the waters by its coral reefs to the clouds squatting at the top of its volcano. In a prefatory note reminiscent of Mark Twain's in "Huckleberry Finn," Mr. Shacochis claims to have invented a "trilevel" West Indian dialect. When he gives us an afternoon rain squall and tells us how the air feels just afterward, even a tourist will recognize that he's got that rain, that air, just right. An English interloper -- Graham Greene, say, or Somerset Maugham -- would have left the local politics offstage, but Mr. Shacochis convinces us, seemingly without effort, that the fears and ambitions of his Government men are specific to this place and to this time.
One of the characters in the novel, a hotelkeeper, appeared earlier as the protagonist in the author's wry short story "Easy in the Islands." But the way the man is played in that story is markedly different from the way he's played here -- and the difference suggests the development in Mr. Shacochis's perspective. In the story, the hotelkeeper is part of an Evelyn Waugh comedy, a sympathetic outsider baffled by an incompetent and laughable island bureaucracy. In the novel, the ho-ho element has vanished. Early on, the Prime Minister sets the tone for the book: "We are not clowns, our country is not a comedy."
Nor is this impressive and overlong novel a comedy, a novel in which the writer of short stories never quite lets go. Each of its many scenes is expertly wrought, and the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.

HEADLINE: Is It 60's Politics Or Gang Warfare?

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
A YEAR ago last month, 50 Latin Kings armed with guns, bats and knives stormed a housing project in Meriden intent on bringing a renegade faction into line. Three defiant members of the organization were injured in the attack, which sent bystanders fleeing. The incident drew more attention to the Latin Kings, an organization of Hispanic and Italian men and women founded four years ago within the state's prison system. Over the last two years authorities have linked the band to scores of assaults and at least six homicides. As reports of the group's activities surfaced in the news media, Beatrice Codianni of New Haven, a longtime supporter of grass roots politics, took note. What she read and heard, she said, mirrored the days when she worked with the Black Panthers in the late 1960's and witnessed the Federal Bureau of Investigation discredit the organization by circulating distorted information to the public.
The same pattern was occurring with the Latin Kings, which was a relatively young organization in Connecticut having what Ms. Codianni called positive goals. Though she recognized that the group had a violent element, she said she had also seen how it had changed the lives of people like her 21-year-old son Andrew, by steering him away from drugs and giving him a strict moral code to live by. In May of last year Ms. Codianni began corresponding with Pedro Millan, one of the founders of the Latin Kings who is currently awaiting trial in a state prison on conspiracy charges stemming from the Meriden shootout. She suggested to him that the Latin Kings begin a public campaign to change their image, and that they begin by offering AIDS education along with literacy and high school classes to its members. Ms. Codianni soon after joined the organization and now serves on the board of directors, making her one of the Latin Kings highest ranking members. 
 Since then she has organized high school classes leading to a General Equivalency Diploma in New Haven and workshops to teach members how to settle disputes nonviolently. She plans to expand those efforts throughout the state. Late in March a state task force made up of Federal, state and local law enforcement officials raided Ms. Codianni's apartment in New Haven. Apart from membership lists and letters that she had received from Latin Kings' members serving prison terms, Ms. Codianni said law enforcers had confiscated her 15-year-old son's baseball card collection, smashed her videotape recorder and broke small ceramic figures. Ms. Codianni has not been charged with violating any laws.
"This is like being part of the witch hunt," she said the night of the police raid. "I know that there's been violence in this organization but we're trying to move away from that."
But law enforcement officials around the state tell a different story. They said that recent crimes linked to the group indicated that its tactics were just as brutal as ever. Authorities suspect that the shooting deaths of three young men in East Rock Park in New Haven last October were ordered by Latin Kings. And evidence shows that members have traveled to different cities in Connecticut and Springfield, Mass., to take part in "beat downs," shootings or stabbings. The organization continues to be fueled primarily through drug trafficking, the authorities said.
 
State Monitoring Gangs
 Lieut. Dan Stebbins, who directs a state office in charge of monitoring gang activities, said that in the past couple of months Latin Kings have sought to harm at least four police officers assigned to curtail gang activity. He added that recent seizures of weapons from the homes of Latin Kings in New Haven and Bridgeport have included Uzis and AK-47's.
"These are not the tools to promote a good image," he said, adding that the organization "is growing at a faster rate than we can respond to it."
The Latin Kings began as a fraternal organization in Chicago in the 1940's. It surfaced in Connecticut in 1989 after two inmates at the Somers Correctional Institution, Nelson Millet and Mr. Millan, started a state chapter. Authorities estimate that membership may be anywhere from 2,000 to 8,000.
 
Philosopher Among Officers
 At least six chapters of the Latin Kings have surfaced in the state's larger cities. Each holds regular meetings and elects officers including a president, vice president, philosopher and regional commander.
To join the organization people must be of Hispanic or Italian descent. Bylaws and philosophy are contained in a thick charter written by Mr. Millet and Mr. Millan. Members are prohibited from using drugs, committing thefts, assaulting other members and discussing the organization with nonmembers.
Ms. Codianni, who refers to the organization as "the family," said that its purpose, to advance the struggle of Latin people, had been shrouded in myth largely perpetrated by the news media and the police. Although members include lawyers, accountants and other professionals, most Latin Kings and Queens, she said, come from bleak backgrounds and are struggling to overcome economic and educational disadvantages.
Whenever a drug-related shooting occurs in Connecticut, she said, the Latin Kings are often the first suspects, though there may be no evidence to make such claims. Contrary to police reports, which say that members are beaten if they try to leave the organization, she said, "We've had several brothers turn in their colors with no harm done."
The group's image has also been mired by people with violent intentions who falsely claim to be Latin Kings or Queens, she said. But when she has called reporters to dispel the myths and to tell them how the organization has changed direction, she said, they have ignored her.
"The media doesn't want to hear about anything positive," she said. "They just want me to tell them where all the dead bodies are."
Ms. Codianni, who is 45 years old, grew up in East Haven. Throughout most of her life she has participated in politics. During the 1960's and early 1970's she worked in a health clinic run by the Black Panther Party and participated in the draft resistance movement and the women's movement. Ms. Codianni, who received three years' probation for a drug conviction in 1986, said she had no other police record. Those who have known Ms. Codianni for several years and are not affiliated with the Latin Kings described her as a nonviolent person with strong political convictions, who does not smoke, drink alcohol or use drugs.
Ms. Codianni said she was supported by welfare and did not receive a salary from the organization. For the last five years she has worked as a volunteer for AIDS Project New Haven and for Free Forever Prison, an advocacy group for Connecticut inmates.
As a feminist, she said, the Latin Kings and Queens appealed to her. "I like the idea that there were a lot of strong independent women in the organization," she said. "There are women chapter presidents and regional commanders. You're appointed for your qualities."
 
Political Awakenings in Prison
 She described Nelson Millet, the president who is serving a 45-year Federal prison term in California for robbery, as "thoughtful and articulate and concerned about moving forward." She said Mr. Millet and Mr. Millan had both undergone a political awakening in prison similar to that of Malcolm X. She said she communicated with Mr. Millet by phone several times a week. Mr. Millet declined to be interviewed for this article.
In response to the organization's involvement in drug trafficking, Ms. Codianni said she could not comment, adding, "I know that the only thing drugs will bring us is jail or death."
Members of the Latin Kings in other cities around the state often seek her advice and counsel. Heriberto Cruz, the treasurer of the Hartford chapter of the Latin Kings, said that they were following Ms. Codianni's lead by trying to encourage younger members to stay in school and off the streets.
On April 24, the state's gang task force raided an apartment where Mr. Cruz was staying and seized a loaded 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun, five bags of marijuana and documents. At the time of the siege, Sgt. Christopher Lyons, a member of the task force, said that the documents were evidence that the Latin Kings were a dangerous criminal organization and that some of the records described the band's war with Los Solidos, a prominent gang in Hartford.
 
Cleaning a Street Together
 Mr. Cruz said in a recent telephone interview that he bought the gun on the street for protection. He added that the misunderstanding between his organization on Los Solidos had been resolved. Last Sunday, the day following the police raid, Ms. Codianni and Mr. Cruz and other Latin Kings said they met members from Los Solidos on Park Street in Hartford, where both groups spent the day together cleaning the street.
"The media and the police are always saying we're into buying and selling weapons, which is a bunch of crock," Mr. Cruz said. "If we're such a big criminal organization, how come no one has a car or any money?"
At Junta for Progressive Action, a social service agency for Hispanic people in New Haven, about 20 Latin Kings and Queens from the Fair Haven area recently attended a G.E.D. class on the parts of speech. The participants ranged in age from 16 to 35, and many wore black and yellow beads and greeted one another with a special gesture and the phrase "amor de rey," love from the king.
 
Opening Doors
 The director of the agency, Frank Taylor, said that when Ms. Codianni first approached him about holding the classes, he welcomed the idea, yet people in the community thought he was crazy for opening his doors to the Latin Kings. "But I say, let's show those who think we are crazy what we can do to help these people in need," he said. "Because if we don't, we have only ourselves to blame."
Abie Quinones, a guidance counselor for the city's adult education programs and coordinator of the G.E.D. classes for the Latin Kings, pointed to the 40 percent high school dropout rate for Hispanic people in New Haven. "These are people who are screaming 'We need your help,' " she said. "They are not in the situation because they are bad people but because they have been given few opportunities."
Most of the people attending the session had served one or more prison terms. Many had grown up in poor households headed by their mothers. Few had known their fathers. Selling drugs was one of the few ways they knew of to earn money, some of them said. One 32-year-old man said he had recently filled out 25 applications for work in fast-food restaurants and has not heard back from any of them. Others told similar stories. They said they joined "the family" because it gave structure to their lives and moral grounding. But being a Latin King also subjected them to job discrimination and made them an easy target for police.
"I'll tell you right now that the biggest gang in town are the police," said Frankie Soto, 19 years old. He said the police often harassed him verbally and sometimes physically for walking down the street. The young man stood on crutches because he said he had been shot in the foot by someone who "hated the Latin Kings." He added, "There are a lot of people out there who'd like to kill us."
Mr. Soto said he was going to try to sit down with the man who shot him, to settle the matter peacefully. "We don't want violence," he said. "We want jobs and education and a nice home with a family."
Junito Fret, 16 years old, wore a cast on his arm because he said he had been shot in a drive-by shooting. Raised in public housing projects in Stamford and New Haven, he said his father had disappeared before he was born, which made him angry. When he was 11 he said he had grown tired of watching his mother struggle to provide for him and his four sisters and began dealing drugs. He was later arrested and sent to the Long Lane reformatory in Middletown. At 14, he was shot outside of Roberto Clemente Middle School. Since then he has been shot three more times, he said.
 
Famous for Being Alive
 "They call me Mr. Lucky because I've been shot at 15 times," he said. "I'm famous because I'm still alive."
He called Mr. Millet and Mr. Millan his heroes and said he faithfully read the Latin Kings' charter. "I was on my way to becoming a gangster," he said. "But the family gave me a lot of rules to help me live my life by."
Still, he said, he often thought about committing suicide. "There are times when I cried to my mom, 'Please, get us out of New Haven.' That's my dream, to get out of this violent hell."
Nicholas Pastore, the New Haven Police Chief, called the emergence of organizations like the Latin Kings symptomatic of the crisis that is eroding urban America. He said in a recent interview that he welcomed any efforts of the organization to turn its image around. Chief Pastore recently had a meeting with Ms. Codianni and others from her organization at a community policing substation in Fair Haven, to discuss their concerns and any future initiatives. He added that changing the public's fear of the organization would not be easy.
"It's great that they want to rechannel their energies because there's a lot of leadership qualities in the group," he said. "But society has been intimidated by the Latin Kings for too long. They have to recognize that their reputation is tarnished and there's a lack of credibility."

HEADLINE: The Business That a Brake Tester Built

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
ON the ground or in the air, Bernard Milano is preoccupied with safety and high technology. As a corporate pilot for Primerica and most recently Dun & Bradstreet, Mr. Milano has flown around the world half a dozen times as captain of Gulfstream and Falcon jets. And because of his flexible schedule as a corporate pilot, in which he flies only 8 to 11 days a month, he has had time to develop a business of his own, Ardsley Mobil Automotive Service Center, which he says is the only high-technology service station of its kind in Westchester.
"What gives us that distinction is a brake-testing machine I had installed after I bought the station seven years ago," Mr. Milano said. "It is an extremely sophisticated and expensive piece of equipment, which cost us $35,000, but technically it is the state of the art," he said. "This level of equipment isn't for the average service station, but we wanted to attract demanding customers. We excel in Jaguar repairs, and I thought it would be a great marketing tool. There are only four machines of its kind in all of New York State, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania."
For the mechanically ungifted, Mr. Milano described the brake tester as "a computerized machine that literally gives customers an 'EKG' profile of their cars." The process is the same, he said. "When the car goes up on the rack, the brake tester makes a diagnosis in as little as a minute. But in that time the car is weighed. The wheel alignment on all four wheels is checked; the brake-system performance is analyzed, and then all the information is cranked out in a computerized report."
 
Satisfaction and Profitability
 The printouts, he said, which are given to the customer, enable them to monitor their car's performance.
"There are a lot of things that can go wrong with a car," he said. "If a customer is driving to Florida, for instance, and has car trouble, the print-out contains valuable information that will be useful to a strange mechanic."
The brake tester, he said, is paying its way in customer satisfaction and profitability. "It yields so much important information that even car dealers and other service stations bring in their cars to us for a testing."
Customers having work done on their cars are not charged extra for an inspection on the brake tester, Mr. Milano said, but someone wanting only a checkup would be charged $40 plus tax. The hourly labor rate varies from $65 to $75 depending on how "exotic" the car is.
Mr. Milano, who is 35, said he has been working at the station in one guise or another more than half his life. "When I was in school I had a part-time job there," he said. "The station is a landmark in Ardsley. There has been a service station on the same corner since 1926. It was previously known as the F.H.L. Service station when it was owned by Floyd Lichtenberg, when I was a kid. Many years later I bought it from Mr. Lichtenberg."
 
A Changing Industry
 But, he said, the station he worked in as a teen-ager bears little resemblance to the one today. "Those 'Gasoline Alley' days are gone," Mr. Milano added. "I remember when I was in high school, everybody with even a slight mechanical bent used to tinker with their cars. But today, you can't monkey with a car. It's even impossible to change carburetors because high-tech computer microprocessors control their function."
A few years after he bought the station, Mr. Milano said, he realized the best way to keep business growing was to upgrade the service. "The industry was changing," he said. "It was becoming so specialized that technicians were needed to service cars instead of mechanics. It was expand or die. We decided to expand."
Using their own money, Mr. Milano and his wife, Isabel, who is his partner and takes care of the bookkeeping and business end of the business, invested about $750,000 to remodel the 5,000-square-foot building with five king-size bays.
"At the station we only do mechanical work," Mr. Milano said. "We're set up like a dealership in that every car we work on gets dealer parts, and every car we service is tested on the brake machine for free."
 
Jaguars a Specialty
 Customers come from all over the county and include many Jaguar owners. "Jaguars once had a bad rap for always being in the shop," Mr. Milano said. "But they have been vastly improved. We service both the brand-new models and the classics. We even find original parts for the classics, but like any other high-powered car, they both need periodic checkups. The way I started servicing Jaguars is that some of the executives I fly for brought their Jaguars in, and through word of mouth other Jaguar owners followed."
In addition to the equipment that he has installed, Mr. Milano employs 21 technicians. "They receive ongoing training weekly at an automotive facility," he said. "They also have a library of service manuals, electronic technical service bulletins and access to a technical hot-line service."
He continued: "We're not talking about mechanics, but highly skilled, highly educated individuals who are looking not for jobs but careers here. They earn $35,000 at the beginning and can work up to $70,000 with full benefits included."
 
Fascination With Jet Engines
 The connection between his own two careers, he said, is his mechanical ability. "It was the mechanical aspects of flying more than the romantic idea that attracted me," he said. After graduating from St. John's University in Queens, with a bachelor's degree in administration, Mr. Milano continued his studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. "Embry-Riddle is known as the Harvard of the aeronautics industry," he said. "I went there because I was fascinated with jet engines."
Two years later, Mr. Milano graduated with an associate degree and received a license as a commercial pilot and flight instructor.
"My first job was with a Cessna dealer teaching classes of 10 students how to fly," he said.
 
Victims of the Recession
 The planes he flies for corporate clients have all been based in hangars at Westchester County Airport.
"What isn't common knowledge is that the Westchester Airport is the largest corporate jetport in the world," he said. "And when it comes to the travel activities of executives, corporations prefer to keep a low profile."
Recently, he said, more than one corporate jet had become a victim of the recession. "When corporations have to cut back, the $30 million jet may be one of the first things to go," he said. "A lot of corporations are using commercial airlines today, which is another reason I am very glad to have a business. We expect to do $1.5 million to $2 million in sales this year, which is up 20 percent from last year's figures."

HEADLINE: New Momentum for Electronic Patient Records

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Mass.

 BODY:
Dr. Barry G. Zallen, a pediatrician at the Harvard Community Health Plan center here, turns to the Apple Macintosh on his desk, steers the cursor to a patient's name and clicks, and a 5-year-old girl's record appears. Dr. Zallen, who has no computer background, instantly gets a detailed account of the girl's chronic cough, the medication he prescribed, her medical history and a list of her previous visits.
Through a central computer, Dr. Zallen's colleagues also have access to these records, so they all share up-to-date data on each of the center's 7,300 patients. Cumbersome, often illegible paper records stuffed into file folders have been banished. 
 The computer does not stop there. It also The system also walks the doctor through the diagnosis of a variety of illnesses by setting out a list of symptoms. It enables Dr. Zallen to send prescriptions to the center's pharmacy and order diagnostic tests. It tracks every prescription and test result and alerts him if a patient doesn't fill a prescription or have a test. It reminds him of allergies or other conditions. All this goes into a data base that could later provide valuable information for researchers.
"This is the future," Dr. Zallen says.
That future has been a long time coming. The health care industry has been very slow to enter the information age, but it could be ready to make the leap. A number of big medical centers, like the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, are investing in systems like Harvard's (see box). With costs soaring and reform in the air, the time is certainly ripe: It is estimated that $40 billion to $80 billion could be saved annually if such computerized record systems come into wide use.
Interest has heated up in the past year, under rising pressure to cut costs and improve quality. President Clinton's calls for competition among medical providers have increased the sense of urgency for hospitals, practices and clinics to become more efficient. Many realize that despite the initial costs, computerized records are not a technical luxury but an economic necessity.
"Only 1 or 2 percent of health care facilities have started toward this," said Everett Hines, an analyst with Coopers & Lybrand. Those that do not do it "will be taken over by more aggressive competitors or disappear."
Justifying the costs is a tough order. "If you go to a local hospital and ask what they'll save, they can't show you the numbers," said Dr. Paul Carpenter, who is in charge of setting up the Mayo Clinic system. "There are so many intangibles."
But the savings would be enormous. The systems could feed information into nationwide data bases, which could then be studied to determine which treatments work. This invaluable evidence would enable doctors to eliminate unnecessary exams and surgery. The systems could also eliminate the need for repeating tests when results are lost.
True, many hospitals have computer systems, mostly for accounting. But it is a long way from this to a nationwide data base.
One obstacle is the catch-up costs. The industry is paying the price for ignoring information technology's potential for three decades. While most industries spend up to 6 percent of revenues on data systems, health care devotes barely 1 percent.
IN addition, there are privacy concerns. Patients worry about confidentiality if there is such wide access to intimate details, and many local regulations inhibit the use of electronic records. But proponents say computerized records actually offer far more security, with passwords and encryption technology, than paper records, which are easily misplaced or removed.
Physicians tend to err on the side of caution. If information is missing from a record, a test will be reordered or a patient will stay longer in the hospital. Dr. Zallen said the Harvard system, the most sophisticated now in use, has changed the way he practices medicine, cutting out time-consuming searches through erratic paper records, sharply lowering the risk of error in both diagnoses and prescribing drugs and providing immediate, up-to-date information for other clinicians.
Even as the center in this Boston suburb demonstrates the wonders of such systems, it is also a testament to the difficulty of installing them on a wide scale. The center, for example, is simply a test site for Harvard Community Health Plan, one of the nation's largest HMO's. Only 12 doctors and nurses in Burlington now have access to the system, even after two years of operation.
The test system was installed, at a cost of several million dollars, as the center was being built. Donna DeAngelis, director of the project, estimated that it would be at least five years before an organization-wide system could be up and running for the more than 1,000 physicians and 550,000 patients at the 14 Harvard centers.
IN years past, physician resistance to computers has been high. But today, physicians under 40 (Dr. Zallen is 39) have used computers in school and are ready.
Still, the concept of having records accessible to the estimated 550,000 physicians and 7,000 hospitals nationwide remains a distant goal. Most observers predict that it will be the end of the decade before the infrastructure is in place to make it feasible.
"In the year 2000 we can have the kind of computer-based record most of us thought we could have in 1980," said Dr. William Stead, a researcher at Vanderbilt University who is working to install such a system.
And Dr. Clement J. McDonald, a researcher in computerized records who is on the staff of the Regenstrief Institute for Health Care at the University of Indiana, adds: "It's very hard. The analogy is not a heart transplant, it's a brain transplant."
First, hospitals, H.M.O.'s, and group practices must push ahead to install computer-based systems internally before there is any hope of creating the networks and standards needed for a nationwide system.
Proponents of computerized patient records seek more than just the conversion of paper records. They say these systems can and should change the way clinicians work. Charles Singer, a health care technology consultant in Wakefield, Mass., said health care providers must embrace the changes that are sweeping corporations. The computerized record should be the basis for a re-engineering of health care in the search for greater productivity, he said.
Roberta Clarke, a Boston University management professor who specializes in health care, said each effort to track data, such as seeing whether people having prostate surgery end up getting better or worse, has a start-up and management cost. "You end up reinventing the wheel for each of these studies," Ms. Clarke said.
The concept of computerized records is already more than 20 years old and continues to foster debate. Even the discussion about what constitutes a computer-based record and what to call it still rages.
"A lot of places say they have it already," said Dr. Paul Tang, a physician on the faculty at Stanford University Medical Center and an engineer at Hewlett-Packard. "And even though some institutions are more computerized than others, no one has the whole thing."
In January 1992, the Computer-based Patient Record Institute was created to spearhead a national effort to build an electronic data system. By bringing together hospitals, computer makers, software companies and health care professionals, the institute intends to set a clear definition of what constitutes the computer-based patient record and how to make it a reality.
Along with the functions in the Harvard system, the institute's definition includes a requirement for both inpatient and outpatient records as well as image-processing capability, for storing X-rays, CAT scans and MRI scans electronically.
"There hasn't been an economic incentive to create a perceived need for these systems," said Dr. G. Octo Barnett, director of the computer science lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. "Physicians have felt medical records are abysmal and gotten worse for 50 years, but the economic crisis will bring the change."
 There is also room for optimism. Rather than wait for a national referendum, many hospitals, HMO's and clinics have pushed ahead with computer-based record systems despite the costs. In addition, several ambitious initiatives are under way in medical centers at schools like Vanderbilt, Duke and the University of Wisconsin.
The wait for a nationwide system may be longer than proponents want. "It's up to the Federal Government when it happens," said Dr. Carpenter, citing the need for an information highway to be in place before other technologies can be applied. "If all the legal issues were handled state by state, it would take the next half century to implement."
 
 
COMPUTERIZING FOR SURVIVAL
 At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., Dr. Paul Carpenter is overseeing an ambitious three-year, $100 million plan to create a system similar to the one at Harvard Community Health.
The plan calls for a computerized patient record system covering the entire Mayo network, which includes facilities in Rochester, Jacksonville, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz.
The installation of such a system, serving 500,000 patients a year, will be daunting. But Dr. Carpenter is ambitious and says it will work if it is done correctly. "The driving concept is to have the right information at the right time and the right place," he said.
The Crozer-Keystone Health System in Delaware County, Pa., a tightly affiliated group of four hospitals and assorted clinics,recently signed an $80 million, 10-year contract with Shared Medical Systems of Malvern, Pa., to install an enterprise-wide data system. Shared Medical is a $400 million supplier of health care data services.
The goal is to create a single electronic patient record accessible to all 4,000 clinicians at every Crozer-Keystone facility.
John C. McMeekin, president and chief executive of Crozer-Keystone, said it was difficult to sell his directors on such a large capital expenditure but they finally understood that the need outweighed the expense.
He said he turned to Coopers & Lybrand and Perot Systems to get a cost-benefit analysis. "They told us we didn't have much of a choice," Mr. McMeekin said. "If we were to survive, we had to make the commitment."
Mr. McMeekin said such a system can be installed only as fast as the clinicians will allow, citing physician resistance as the "Achilles heel of this vision."

HEADLINE: Fitness That Blooms in the Spring

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
AT Tiger Schulmann's Karate and Fitness Center in Yonkers, the focus is on the total body -- the mind as well as the muscles. "No machines, no racquetball courts, no swimming here," said Toni L. Caserta, program director. "Just self-discipline and self-defense."
In Scarsdale, at East Coast Fitness Center, yet another approach is taken. The free weights, Nautilus circuit, Stairmasters and tanning beds serve a mostly male clientele, average age 18 to 24. There, pumping iron is the order of the day, the manager, Michael Lewandowski said. 
 In Dobbs Ferry, at the Rivertown Center for Yoga and Health, fitness "is a matter of looking at the body from the inside out," said the co-director, Brahmani Holly Liebman. Along the road to a smaller waistline, she said, "People can find inner peace, too."
 
Many Exercise Options
 And in White Plains, at Club Fit, it is a combination of approaches -- aerobics, free weights, Nautilus machines, yoga, stress-reduction seminars and nutrition, among them -- that promises both a better body and a sense of well-being to a mostly "working professional crowd," said Debra Gersten, the fitness and exercise director.
Whatever kind of exercise one does -- and there are many options to choose from in Westchester -- May is the month to focus on getting in shape. Westchester is kicking off National Physical Fitness Month today at 2 P.M. with its second annual Great Westchester Walk-In at the Kensico Dam Plaza in Valhalla. Sponsored in part by the county's Department of Health and the Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, it is a free event to promote walking as an ongoing fitness activity for people of all ages.
Also this afternoon, the Yonkers Pulse Healthy Heart Program Walk-In, sponsored by the health departments of the city, county and state along with other organizations, will be held at 2 P.M. at Redmond Field on Cook Avenue.
And Bicycle Sundays, sponsored by the county's Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, resume at 10 o'clock this morning along a seven-mile stretch of the Bronx River Parkway that is closed to vehicular traffic. The county closes the parkway every Sunday from May through October except on May 30, Sept. 5 and Oct. 10.
Also, May 19 is National Employee's Health and Fitness Day, and the physical-fitness industry has named May as its Commit to Get Fit Month.
 
Goals for the Year 2000
 The Federal Department of Health and Human Services has set physical fitness goals for the year 2000, which include increasing to 85 percent the number of Americans over 6 years old who participate regularly -- five or more times a week -- in a fitness activity.
In New York State, polls show that three-fourths of all residents do not exercise regularly, said Christopher Maylahn, an epidemiologist with the State Health Department.
And nationally, it is estimated that only 42.2 million Americans, or about 17 percent of the population, work out regularly -- 16.7 million of them in health clubs, according to the Boston-based Association of Quality Clubs, a trade organization representing 2,000 health clubs.
But as the Federal Government attempts to get more Americans to exercise, there are indications that the fitness revolution of the 1980's may be tapering off in this decade, a trend that has health experts and the fitness industry worried, said Harvey Lauer, president of American Sports Data, a Hartsdale marketing firm that serves the sports and leisure industry.
"We will never go back to the sedentary life styles of the 1950's," Mr. Lauer said, "but there have been some declines in recent years."
Despite fitness fads and fashions -- like in-line roller skates, step aerobics, specialized foot gear and home gyms -- Mr. Lauer's organization reported that "80 percent of all sneakers are never sweated in."
In part, the recent decline in participation in fitness programs can be attributed to the recession, which caused some people to put off spending $300 to more than $900 a year for club memberships, said Steven M. Goodfriend, a research manager for the Association of Quality Clubs.
 
Offsetting the Aging Process
 To bolster their memberships, fitness-club managers said they have begun pitching their services to a broader market -- targeting men and women in their 40's and 50's, the elderly and children -- and stressing the long-term benefits of working out.
"We're emphasizing cardiovascular fitness more than weight lifting now," said Sarah Collins, manager of Court Sports II Health and Fitness in Yonkers. "People are more interested in a lifetime of health and fitness than just putting on muscle in the short run."
At Club Fit, Jocelyn M. Leigh, a personal trainer, works with women older than 30, who "need to build up muscle density, not only for the esthetics but to protect their bones," she said. "Staying fit offsets the aging process."
Said Felix Corona, owner of Flex Fitness in North Tarrytown and the 1991 Natural Mr. U.S.A. ("natural" meaning that no steroids were used to build muscle bulk): "The emphasis clearly is shifting. We're realizing fitness is not just about huge muscles, but about cardiovascular health and proper nutrition."
 
Walk for Life Campaign
 Walking, health experts say, competes with aerobic classes, weight lifting and Nautilus circuits as a way of staying fit for life, and it is less expensive. "It's free, it's fun, and most everyone can do it," said Joan E. Sullivan, assistant director of the County Health Department's Bureau of Disease Control.
The county is sponsoring its Walk-In as part of the New York Walk for Life Campaign, Ms. Sullivan said, because County Health Department statistics show that during 1989 the state had the highest rate in the country of deaths from heart disease -- 275.3 per 100,000 residents. Westchester had an even higher rate -- 280.8 per 100,000 people. In Yonkers during 1989, where the State Department of Health sponsors the Pulse Healthy Heart program, the rate was higher still -- 404.6 per 100,000.
The State Health Department, which has targeted high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, a sedentary life style and overweight as the major risk factors in heart disease, promotes walk-ins and sponsors seven Pulse Healthy Heart programs besides the one in Yonkers, Mr. Maylahn said.
Dr. Jean Rosenbaum, director of the American Fitness Association, a research organization in Durango, Colo., recommends walking three times a week at a brisk pace to combat heart disease. "The only cost for walking," he said, "is a decent pair of shoes."
 
Medical Consultations Suggested
 Dr. Rosenbaum, who also recommends weight lifting, even for older people, said: "The debilitation of old age is not necessary. Instead of withering on the vine, exercise."
But doctors in the county had some warnings about how and where people should exercise.
"Unless you are a proven college athlete, check with a doctor before you set out on an exercise program," said Dr. Michael V. Herman, chief of cardiology at the New York Medical College and the County Medical Center in Valhalla. "I'm a great enthusiast of appropriate physical fitness, but within a person's abilities to perform it.
"Most of us," he added, "are overfed and under-exercized and should proceed with caution."
Dr. Herman recommended consulting a doctor before starting an exercise program, and stopping an activity immediately if any of the following symptoms are noted: chest pain, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, undue fatigue or unusual joint or muscle pain.
 
A Need for Supervision
 Dr. Murray Low, director of the Westchester Cardiac Rehabilitation Center in Scarsdale, said he was pleased with all the attention given to fitness. "Finally, the Clinton Administration has the focus on preventive care, rather than acute care, with all its higher costs."
But he recommended stress testing before proceeding with an exercise program and checking to make sure that fitness instructors and personal trainers are properly certified, preferably by the American College of Sports Medicine.
"There is a lot of misinformation out there," Dr. Low said. "And exercisers have to be supervised properly. If someone has high blood pressure, it may be dangerous to lift weights. And if someone is overweight, he or she shouldn't start with jogging."
"But most of all," he said, "people can't undo in one day what took 30 years to happen. There's no magic bullet for getting fit."

HEADLINE: The State's Drug Companies Face New Political Environment

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHILE the rest of the Connecticut economy languishes, pharmaceutical research is growing across the state. Boehringer Ingelheim in Ridgefield, Miles Laboratories in West Haven, and Pfizer in Groton are all opening or building major laboratory expansions, and smaller operations are following suit.
A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, David Emerick, said an estimated 12,000 people in Connecticut worked in drug research and development, which placed Connecticut ninth in the country. 
 "It's the industry nobody knows," Mr. Emerick said. "It's an invisible industry. The public sees a pill coming out of a bottle and has no idea what it took to get it to that point."
Now, as President Clinton and other national political figures attack the spiraling cost of pharmaceutical products, there is increasing concern about the impact on Connecticut, and drug companies in the state are considering how they can counter the criticism.
 
Future Is Uncertain
 "We obviously are very concerned, just as all the companies are, about the impact those kinds of comments could have," said David W. Nurnberger, a spokesman for Boehringer Ingelheim, a German company in the middle of doubling the size of its United States headquarters in Ridgefield, to 500,000 square feet.
A spokesman for Miles Laboratories, Donald Hyman, said that company had just completed the second phase of its research center expansion in September. The company more than doubled its scientific staff, to 230 biochemists, chemists and biologists. With plans for a third phase already on the boards, Miles expects its scientific staff to total 600 people by 1998, for research into diabetes, dementia, bone and auto-immune diseases, and other chronic conditions.
"That's assuming we have the kind of business environment that allows us to sell our new products and develop new products," Mr. Hyman said. "The business environment right now is, shall we say, a little uncertain. It's a difficult time for us, and we're watching things closely in Washington. We're trying to catch up, from a lobbying point of view."
Some industry analysts believe the debate over drug costs will continue for a while, but there is little danger that the drug industry will suffer serious harm.
"I don't think health care reform will be as draconian as people expect," said an analyst with Stein, Rowe, Furnham Inc., Art McQueen. "I think there are going to be negotiations between the Government and industry, and the compromise will be something both sides can live with."
Still, over the last couple of months, the President and some prominent members of Congress have attacked drug company profits, and said controls on the price of pharmaceuticals was one way to control health care spending, a proposal that has executives in some of the pharmaceutical companies on edge.
"We support the President's idea of managed care, and extending Medicare coverage to prescription drugs, but we oppose the idea of price controls," Mr. Hyman said. "How will you produce the next generation of breakthrough drugs if you have price controls? There will be no incentives."
"Smallpox, polio, diphtheria -- these are all laughed at today because of the drugs private industry has developed," Mr. Hyman said. But we have new scourges to deal with. All of this research is expensive, and we have to pay for it."
Not all drug development companies are worried about the President's criticisms. The owner of one small company said price controls could work to his company's benefit.
Edward B. Michaels, president of E. B. Michaels Research Associates Inc. in Bridgeport, said big companies had huge advertising budgets, and could easily crowd out smaller competitors.
 
Millions for Marketing
 "New products are very difficult to bring onto the market," Mr. Michaels said. "You need to spend millions of dollars to make people aware of a new product -- money that could be better spent on research and development."
President Clinton's plan to control the prices of drugs could force the big drug companies to rethink how much money they spend on advertising and marketing, which could improve the competitive climate for companies like his, he said.
The big drug companies, though, are also often the only ones that can afford the billions of dollars it takes to develop new drugs, and for the tests it takes to get them through the regulatory process.
Mr. Emerick, the manufacturers' association spokesman, said research and development spending in the drug industry would cost an estimated $12.6 billion this year, 13.5 percent over 1992.
Drug makers point out that hundreds of compounds are developed for every one that makes money. Without financial incentives to bring out new and better drugs, drug research and development might be deemed too much of a risk, said the president and chief executive officer of Pfizer, Allan Steere.
 
Future of High Technology
 Pfizer increased its research staff to 4,000 people from 1,700 in the early 1980's, with the bulk of the growth at its research center in Groton.
The state has also staked its financial future in part on pharmaceuticals. Two years ago, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. ran on a platform that stressed the future of high technology industry in Connecticut, industry that could bring high-paying, white-collar jobs to the state. He used the pharmaceutical company as an example of the type of industry Connecticut should try to attract.
That strategy has not changed, despite the national call for health care cost control, said a spokesman for the state Department of Economic Development, Joseph Cohen.
New health policies "could actually produce increased business for the pharmaceutical companies in Connecticut," Mr. Cohen said. As the Federal Government expands Medicaid and Medicare to include pharmaceutical coverage, to make sure everyone has access to medications and immunizations, the companies could benefit, he said.
 
'Very Bright Future'
 "We're not changing our direction at all," Mr. Cohen said. "We think the pharmaceutical industry has a very bright future in Connecticut."
Mr. Hyman said he believed there were three reasons for the recent attacks on drug company profits. First, he said, drug costs are more visible: people generally pay for prescriptions and other drugs out of pocket, while many other health care costs are billed directly to insurers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that drug costs account for 7 cents of every dollar spent on health care in the United States; in Japan, it is 30 cents.
Another factor, he said, is that drug companies are easy to attack from a political perspective. "Most Congressmen don't have a pharmaceutical company in their district," Mr. Hyman said, "but they all have hospitals and doctors."
The third factor in the attack is that drug companies have not done enough from a public relations standpoint, telling people what pharmaceutical companies have done to keep health care costs down.
"We've done a poor job of telling our story," Mr. Hyman said. "We've done a good job talking to doctors and scientists and other health care providers, but we haven't spent a lot of time talking to the patients."
Mr. Steere said, for instance, that most people are not aware that of the 100 most prescribed pharmaceuticals today, 95 were developed by private industry, compared with three by government or university laboratories and two by individuals. The average American works 40 minutes to pay for the same pharmaceuticals that cost people in Germany, France and other industrialized countries a full hour's wage, he said.
And drugs are one of the few areas where the United States has maintained an edge through innovation, which helps with the international balance of trade, Mr. Steere said.
 
'A Peanut' in Total Costs
 "So, we were all caught off guard by the vehemence of the attack on the industry, particularly because we're a peanut in terms of total health care costs, and because we could be such an integral part of controlling costs," Mr. Steere said.
Pharmaceutical companies contend that drugs can help prevent, or shorten, hospital stays, which is where most of the country's health care dollars are spent. Medications are being developed every day that prevent disease, which is far less costly than treating someone who is sick.
"We're part of the solution, not part of the problem," said Brian M. McGlynn, a spokesman for Pfizer.
Mr. Steere, who is president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said the industry has begun lobbying members of Congress to make sure nothing damaging to the drug industry is passed. "Little by little, we're making ourselves heard," he said.
Drug company officials are stressing what they say are the facts showing that pharmaceuticals are a good buy. A study by the University of Mississippi Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, for instance, found that the growth in the list prices of pharmaceutical drugs has actually slowed in recent years, from 11.6 percent a year in 1989 to 6.4 percent in 1992.
"Should this trend continue, it is likely that prescription drug prices will decline in real terms, relative to price levels in the economy as a whole," the study concluded.
Pfizer recently promised voluntary price controls: There will be no price increases on many of the company's major products -- like procardia XL for heart patients and Feldene for arthritis sufferers -- and no individual price increase will exceed 4.5 percent, the company said in a Jan. 25 news release.
Pfizer and the other pharmaceutical companies that are doing business worldwide say they will try to make sure their voice is heard in the national debate.
"We've dealt with every form of government regulation and health care system," Mr. Steere said. "No one knows, with certainty, what direction the President's health care policy will take. But we can live with any rational national health care scheme."
Still, there is considerable concern about how the debate will finally end. "If our industry is subjected to restrictive government price controls, virtually the entire pharmaceutical industry would become a public utility," Mr. Hyman said. "With all due respect to power and water companies, is that the model of innovation and risk-taking the nation needs to guarantee the next generation of breakthrough drugs?"

HEADLINE: RECORDINGS VIEW;
Timeless Purity From the Soul Of Bluegrass

BYLINE: By BILLY ALTMAN; Billy Altman has written about pop music for Entertainment Weekly and Rolling Stone.

 BODY:
Of all the threads that together form the fabric of country music, none have held more proudly to their origins than bluegrass. Several generations have passed since the groundbreaking 1940's recordings by such pioneers as Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Carter and Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys. Such recordings set in motion the revolution that gave Southeastern hillbilly string band music a bold new shape and, ultimately, a trademark name.
Nearly half a century later, the genre's parameters remain virtually unchanged. Whether made in 1947 or 1993, good bluegrass has the same pristine sound: of acoustic stringed instruments played with precision -- often at blinding speeds -- and high-harmonied voices singing plaintive tales of home and hearth. 
 That bluegrass has retained its essential purity despite changes in the rest of country music is due to several factors. For one thing, the music's limited success in the marketplace has discouraged outsiders from infringing upon it. (Flatt and Scruggs's 1962 theme from "The Beverly Hillbillies" television show and Eric Weissberg's "Dueling Banjos" from the 1972 film "Deliverance" are the most famous of the genre's few pop hits.) For another, bluegrass has maintained a working relationship with Nashville -- the Grand Ole Opry includes bluegrass performers on all its shows -- as well as with the folk audience, which regards bluegrass as a link to an otherwise vanishing American music heritage.
Finally, bluegrass has produced a number of artists -- Jim and Jesse McReynolds, Mac Wiseman and Jimmy Martin, to name a few -- whose lifelong dedication to the genre has helped keep it vibrant. Chief among these artists, of course, is the ubiquitous Mr. Monroe, now past 80 and still a godlike presence on the Opry stage and bluegrass festival circuit. But if the mandolin-playing Mr. Monroe is the father of bluegrass, then the 66-year-old banjo player and singer Ralph Stanley, who has been performing mountain music since 1946, must surely be its soul. His recent two-CD set, "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning" (Freeland Records 9001), is recommended to anyone interested in bluegrass or the authentic sounds of traditional country music.
In both his playing and singing, Mr. Stanley has been fiercely loyal to the hill country music he and his brother Carter grew up hearing in southwestern Virginia. Since his brother's death in 1966, he has been a teacher and living legend to the many sidemen who have gone through "bluegrass boot camp" under his direction. Mr. Stanley has some 145 recordings to his credit, but his new album may well be the crowning glory in a career that has spanned the entire history of the genre he helped create.
The 30-song collection, split evenly between secular and sacred material (hence the title), is filled with new versions of Stanley brothers classics, including "Rank Stranger," "All the Good Times Are Past and Gone" and "Vision of Mother." These are songs whose stark, natural imagery and simple messages of the value -- and the price -- of honor, love and faith really do sound as old as the hills that inspired them. On all of them, Mr. Stanley displays flawless, economical banjo playing -- a fascinating blend of the old-fashioned, two-finger "clawhammer" style with the more modern three-finger technique perfected by Mr. Scruggs. Mr. Stanley's vocals are taut and soaring; even when young, he came across like an old-timer; his lonesome tenor now seems otherworldly.
What sets this work apart, though, is the exceptional effort put forth by an all-star lineup of guest vocalists who queue up to pay homage to, and partake of, Mr. Stanley's timeless music. For some, it is a reunion: Ricky Skaggs, who began his career as a teen-ager with the Clinch Mountain Boys, is heard on two bittersweet ballads, "All I Ever Loved Was You" and "Sea of Regret." The strong, clear voice of Charlie Waller, founder of the Country Gentlemen, anchors the gothic "Banks of the Ohio" (about a man who drowns his lover because she won't marry him) and "The Fields Have Turned Brown," in which a wandering son learns by letter that his broken-hearted parents have been dead for years.
Mr. Monroe joins Mr. Stanley for graceful renditions of two Monroe standards, "Letter From My Darling" and "I'll Meet You in Church Sunday Morning," and Mr. Martin, a onetime Blue Grass Boy, provides a gritty lead on "All the Good Times Have Passed and Gone."
For Vince Gill, Dwight Yoakam and Patty Loveless, the recording is a chance to reveal sides of their musical personalities usually precluded by their star status. Mr. Gill and Ms. Loveless ring in with lilting harmony vocals on several tracks. Mr. Yoakam's reverential singing on "Down Where the River Bends" and on his atmospheric composition "Miner's Prayer" is a revelation for an artist often viewed as an outsider by the country establishment. And for country veterans like George Jones ("Wonderful World Outside"), Tom T. Hall ("The Water Lilly") and Emmylou Harris ("I Never Will Marry"), who give strong performances regardless of the surroundings, it's one very good day at the office.
Even amid the accumulated talent, Ralph Stanley manages to dominate the album. He sings lead on only a third of the tracks, and his banjo solos always tend to be part of the whole rather than calling attention to themselves. And yet, it is his idiosyncratic harmonies and perfectly placed instrumental runs that elevate each of these performances to a higher esthetic ground. Hearing Mr. Stanley sing "Heaven's Bright Shore" with one of bluegrass's brightest young stars, the 21-year-old Alison Krauss, a listener senses the torch not being passed but shared, and those stubborn bluegrass roots growing deeper into the ground.

Mild-Mannered Quilters Pursue Quarry

BYLINE: By Cara Greenberg

 BODY:
NEW YORK is a mecca for quilt makers from overseas and from the heartland, and that includes Connecticut. The Phabric Phantoms shopping tour last Monday, led by Marilyn Henrion and Diane Rode Schneck, included Hiroko Matsuda from Kagoshima, Japan; Leslie Granbeck from Minneapolis and five women from Connecticut towns where most fabrics are tiny flower prints.
"We don't do calicoes," said Paula Nadelstern of the Bronx, speaking for those who consider their quilt-making an art. The group assaulted seven fabric shops in Manhattan, seeking nontraditional materials. Stops included Handloom Batik on Mulberry Street, which sells Indonesian and Indian imports, and Paron Fabrics on West 57th Street, where, for $4.50 a yard, they bought French cottons. 
 At B & J Fabrics on West 40th Street, crushed silk and metallic organza ($20 a yard), novelty cottons with fish and cowboy prints ($8 a yard), subtly woven Japanese ikat cloth ($15 a yard) and vibrant African kente cloth ($15 a yard) made one want to re-enroll in home-economics class.
The women bought a yard here, half a yard there. At Paron Fabrics, Jennifer O'Brien, the president of the Nutmeg Quilters Guild in Ridgefield, Conn., marveled over the prices. "Nine dollars a yard for Liberty of London!" she said. "It's $24 to $28 where I live."
Margo Bacon of Brookfield, Conn., said she joined the tour because "I wanted to find all these places." Florence Suerig of Greenwich, Conn., added: "New York is so vast. This way, you go into seven or eight places that are for sure good places."
Mrs. Henrion and Ms. Schneck run Phabric Phantoms tours on demand, varying itineraries with the interests of each group. The daylong tours cost $35 a person. The two women choose stores on the basis of fabric quality, price and integrity.
"We know which ones you can trust on fiber content," said Mrs. Henrion, whose quilts have an M. C. Escher-like complexity. She and Ms. Schneck publish New York Unraveled!, a quarterly newsletter for quilting enthusiasts. Mrs. Henrion and Ms. Nadelstern invented Quilt-O-Rama, a board game.
Today's quilting subculture includes artists whose work incorporates materials like newspaper headlines, gum wrappers, ugly ties, dryer lint and Christmas lights. "If you can sew it down, you can put it in a quilt," Ms. Schneck said.
In front of B & J Fabrics, Mrs. Henrion gave a short, to-the-point orientation. "They're very nice here, very helpful," she said. "They'll cut halves. The prices marked on the bolts are one or two dollars more than the price you will pay -- ask."
Every woman on the tour confessed to being a fabric junky. "I've got six or seven unfinished projects and enough fabric to last three lifetimes," Ms. Granbeck said.
Kirsten Bell of Newtown, Conn., said quilting was great "because you can justify constantly buying fabric."
"I have 40 feet of shelves stacked with fabrics, and I keep buying more," she said.
Several members of the Phabric Phantoms tour agreed that there was a common thread running through the worldwide community of quilt makers. Indeed, Ms. O'Brien and Ms. Matsuda became pen pals because of their interest in quilting, and Ms. Matsuda was visiting her friend for the first time.
"It's a carry-over from the days of the quilting bee," Ms. Schneck said of the quilting network. Yet, quilt making remains an individualized form of expression. Ms. Nadelstern said: "Each of us is going to go home and create something totally unique with what we've bought. Golfers and bird watchers don't have that."
Phabric Phantoms shopping tours are run on demand, usually twice a month; (212) 982-8949 or (212) 249-5094. More information about the tours will be available at the Manhattan Quilters Guild booth at the Great American Quilt Festival, May 12 to 16 at Pier 92, the Hudson River and West 52d Street.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: TOP BOSNIAN SERB, FACING U.S. ACTION, SIGNS A PEACE PLAN;
VOTE SET ON ACCORD

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VOULIAGMENI, Greece, May 2

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from his sponsor in Belgrade and the threat of American air strikes, the leader of Bosnia's warring Serbs signed an international peace plan today intended to end the devastating year-old civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The endorsement by the leader, Radovan Karadzic, came after months of on-again, off-again talks in which he seemed intent primarily on buying time so his forces could seize more territory. 
 Today he said his agreement to the plan, which has already been signed by rival Muslim and Croatian factions, hinged on the approval of his self-styled parliament of Serbian nationalists, which is to meet on Wednesday at its headquarters in Pale. The assembly unanimously rejected the plan six days ago, but this time Dr. Karadzic appeared confident that he could bring his forces into line.
 
Prodding From Milosevic
 Diplomats said Dr. Karadzic capitulated under prodding from President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who has provided the arms, supplies and ideological support for the Serbs' campaign of "ethnic cleansing" in Muslim and Croatian areas of Bosnia. Retaliatory sanctions imposed last year and tightened last week by the United Nations on the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro are destroying its economy.
If the Bosnian Serbs accept the plan on Wednesday, the signing today would theoretically lead to a cease-fire throughout Bosnia and the deployment of at least 50,000 troops for the biggest, most ambitious, expensive and dangerous peacekeeping operation the United Nations has ever undertaken.
In a departure from usual policy, the heavily armed peacekeepers would have orders to use military force as necessary to compel dissident commanders to comply with the plan's provisions.
 
Need for Quick Commitments
 But it was unclear if, or when, major nations would be willing to commit the 50,000 to 60,000 troops needed to enforce the plan, which calls for a cease-fire, disarmament and the creation of 10 semi-autonomous provinces dominated by the major ethnic groups under a weak central government.
With only 7,000 United Nations troops stationed in Bosnia now, diplomats said that lining up an adequate number to enforce the plan could take weeks. They emphasized that the Western allies should commit troops quickly to the peace effort if they wanted it to remain alive.
The signing ceremony, which came after two days of talks among Serbian, Muslim and Croatian leaders at this luxury beach resort near Athens, brought immediate pleas from mediators for the Clinton Administration to drop its threats to use military force against the Serbs now that the Serbs seem ready to stop fighting.
"I don't doubt it has helped concentrate minds," said Lord Owen, who with former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance drafted the peace plan. "But now the time is to talk of peace, not war.
"I certainly hope there will be U.S. peacekeepers in blue helmets as well as troops from Russia," he added.
Lord Owen said that if countries that already have troops serving in the United Nations force in Bosnia -- including Britain, France and Canada -- agreed to commit those soldiers to the new force, "we will be making a good and fast beginning."
President Clinton called Dr. Karadzic's decision a "positive step," but said the United States would continue to press for tougher allied action if the Serbs failed to act in good faith.
 
Threat of U.S. Action
 Skeptical of promises from Bosnian Serbs, the Clinton Administration decided in principle on Saturday to commit American air power to help end the fighting but delayed a final decision. So far it has had little success in persuading European allies to join an operation involving force.
Britain and France have resisted direct military intervention by American forces, arguing that it might provoke the Serbs to attack troops in the United Nations force. Military strikes would also force them to suspend the crucial convoys that are feeding more than 2.3 million people in Bosnia, they argue.
Under the peace plan, the estimated 50,000 troops, probably including a substantial number of Americans, would be sent to Bosnia to oversee the withdrawal of Serbian forces from much of the territory they have conquered. Critics say the partition would nonetheless reward the Serbs, who made up less than a third of Bosnia's population before the war began in April 1992.
Lord Owen said that since the United Nations lacked the expertise to organize and command a force of tens of thousands with a complex mandate providing for serious military action, the Security Council was likely "to ask NATO to play a role in the planning and command and control procedures."
While diplomats attending the talks consider the threat of American intervention redundant if the Serbs keep the agreement they made today, the tightening trade blockade that contributed to their reversal is likely to be relaxed only gradually, if the Security Council finds concrete evidence that all sides are carrying out their promises.
After praising Dr. Karadzic's "courageous" decision to sign the plan, Lord Owen called for it to be put into action as soon as possible so that peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina could "spread out" and defuse the armed standoff between Serbs and Croats in the Krajina district of neighboring Croatia as well as the tensions between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
 
Serbian Attacks Continue

But even as Dr. Karadzic signed the plan, Serbian offensives continued in northern, eastern and western Bosnia. Heavy shelling, infantry attacks and many casualties were reported in Gorazde, one of three Muslim towns in the east that has not yet fallen to the Serbs.
United Nations officials said the Serbs besieging Gorazde nonetheless allowed an aid convoy through to the town for the first time in a month, Reuters reported.
Although some Bosnian Serbs in Pale said they disagreed with Dr. Karadzic's decision, Lord Owen said they had little choice but to endorse the peace plan. There is "formidable pressure on them from Belgrade," he said, "because the war machine is being fueled from across the border."
Last week, after the Bosnian Serbs unanimously rejected the Vance-Owen plan, President Milosevic of Serbia sent them an angry letter saying they had no right to subject Yugoslavia's 10 million inhabitants to new and harsher economic restrictions.
The United Nations Security Council had voted to impose the stricter penalties only if the Bosnian Serbs refused to sign the settlement. The Council set a deadline of April 26, the day after a referendum in Russia, to insure that Russia would not use its veto power to block the new sanctions.
Russia is a traditional ally of the Serbs, and President Boris N. Yeltsin feared he might lose a vote of confidence if his Government supported draconian sanctions against the Yugoslav Government. Mr. Yeltsin's victory last Sunday, followed by his warning that the Serbs must sign the peace plan, ended any hopes on their part that he might be replaced by someone more sympathetic to their cause.
Another factor in the Serbs' calculations today was the recent hardening in the Clinton Administration's decision to press for military intervention and the re-arming of beleaguered Muslim forces, officials said.
 
No Boundary Changes
 The agreement Dr. Karadzic signed today is identical to the one he rejected just over a week ago and contains no changes in the boundaries of the 10 new provinces that will be carved out of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
When rejecting this map in the past, however, Dr. Karadzic has complained that the Serbs were being asked to reduce their share of the country from more than 70 percent at present to around 43 percent, ceding most of its industries and richest mines to other ethnic groups.
In particular, Dr. Karadzic has sought to carve out new corridors connecting the three Serbian-controlled provinces created under the plan and giving them direct access both to Serbia and to the Serbian-dominated Krajina area of Croatia.
Such demands aroused fears among Muslims that the Serbs are still hoping to create an independent state in Bosnia and Herzegovina that would eventually unite with Serbia.
In the end, Dr. Karadzic settled for a compromise proposed by mediators guaranteeing Serbs freedom of movement between their provinces along demilitarized roads under the control of the United Nations forces who will ban unauthorized military convoys. Dr. Karadzic was also assured that the Serbs will have a veto over the nationality of the peacekeeping forces put in control of these roads.

HEADLINE: HEALTH-CARE COSTS MAY BE INCREASED $100 BILLION A YEAR

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Government financial experts have told the White House that President Clinton's health-care plan may require $100 billion to $150 billion a year in new public and private spending by Government, business and consumers, depending on the scope of benefits guaranteed to all Americans.
Several Administration officials contend that those numbers are too high and are urging the financial experts to reduce their estimates. So far, they have refused to do so. 
 The estimates, coming at a time when Congress is anxious about new taxes needed to pay for a reorganization of the health-care system, are in confidential work papers from the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform.
 
Beginning to Circulate
 Financial experts have been working on cost analyses for months, but only recently, as the Administration's thinking has crystallized, have estimates of overall costs begun to circulate inside the Government. They have not been made public before.
The financial experts, from the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, estimated the cost of three possible packages of benefits. The least generous would cost $99.5 billion a year, while the most generous would cost $150.6 billion, they said.
Not all that money would come from the Government, but the Administration has not decided how the cost might be divided among government, businesses and households. Nor has Mr. Clinton decided which type of package to propose when he unveils his plan this month, though White House officials have said it will be comprehensive.
 
Cost and Coverage Vary
 The three possible benefits packages would cover hospital and doctors' services and some prescription drug costs, but they vary widely in how much of the cost would be covered by insurance and how much consumers would have to pay.
The manager of the task force, Ira C. Magaziner, estimated in early February that the health program might require $30 billion to $90 billion a year in new spending by the Federal Government alone. The nation as a whole is expected to spend more than $900 billion on health care this year.
White House officials say the new estimates are subject to change because final decisions on the details of the President's plan have not been made. Moreover, they argue, people should not be alarmed by the estimates because total spending on health care in the United States is already increasing by $100 billion a year. They say Mr. Clinton's plan will eventually slow the increase.
Most of the new money -- $69.5 billion to $82.2 billion, not all of it from the Government -- will be needed to provide coverage for people who do not have any health insurance, the actuaries said.
The Health Care Financing Administration runs Medicare and Medicaid, the programs for 67 million people who are elderly or poor. The agency's chief actuary, Roland E. King, and his staff have decades of experience estimating health costs and population trends. On Capitol Hill, they are respected for independence, integrity and accuracy. But some economists at other agencies still favor lower estimates.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the head of the task force, said in an interview last week that it was "very difficult" to get Government agencies to agree on cost estimates or even on procedures for estimating. To some extent, the disagreements involve technical issues. But they could have a big political effect on members of Congress, who will be asked to help finance Mr. Clinton's plan with new taxes.
 
Clash Between Agencies
 Work papers from the task force show disagreements between two agencies in particular. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, a unit of the United States Public Health Service, offered lower estimates for "insuring the uninsured": $42.6 billion to $49.3 billion a year from all sources, or roughly 60 percent of the cost computed by financial experts from the Health Care Financing Administration.
The lower estimates assume that uninsured people are generally healthy, like insured workers. The higher estimates assume that substantial numbers of the uninsured will be heavy users of health care, like Medicaid recipients.
Mr. Clinton has said for more than a year that he wants to require employers to provide or arrange health insurance coverage for their workers. He has said his plan will provide "the security of guaranteed access to comprehensive health care" for all Americans.
White House officials say it will reduce administrative costs, curb inflation in the health-care industry and save money in the long run. But significant savings are not expected for five or 10 years, and Mr. Clinton wants to take immediate action to provide coverage for the 37 million people who lack health insurance.
 
'A Conceptual Exercise'
 Kenneth E. Thorpe, the Federal official in charge of cost estimates for the task force, said the work papers were prepared as part of "a conceptual exercise" to help Mr. Clinton understand the cost of various options proposed by his health-policy advisers.
Work papers from the task force show these costs for other elements of the President's plan but do not specify how these costs would be divided:
*Better coverage for families with meager health insurance could cost $12.5 billion to $38.3 billion a year, depending on the scope of benefits. In many families, the head of the household has coverage from an employer, but his or her dependents have no insurance.
*Coverage of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries would cost $8 billion to $10.3 billion a year.
*Coverage of long-term care, in the form contemplated by the White House, might cost $7.7 billion to $15 billion a year.
*Upgrading care for poor people, homeless people, migrant farm workers and others who are "medically underserved" would cost $1.8 billion to $4.8 billion a year.
Mr. Clinton has already asked Congress for a tax increase of more than $270 billion over five years. That money is to reduce the Federal budget deficit, not to pay for his health-care plan, which will require large amounts of revenue beyond those already requested.
 
Looking Beyond Politics
 In a speech last week, Mr. Magaziner seemed to minimize the political difficulty of getting Congress to raise taxes.
"Often," he said, "our friends in the media focus their whole attention on health-care reform as if what specific piece of money might have to be raised next year to help us insure the uninsured is the most important thing in health care.
"We know better. We know that what is really going to matter to the American people five years from now, 10 years from now, is not what amount of money was raised initially to get over the hump of getting the uninsured insured. What's really going to matter is what happens when I go to my doctor. What happens when I get ill? How does my insurance coverage look? Does it really protect me or not?"
Businesses, households and Government are listed in the documents as the main sources of money for Mr. Clinton's plan. If the Federal Government pays less, businesses and households pay more.
 
The Cost toof Employers
 Thus, under one set of assumptions used by the White House, American businesses would pay $168 billion a year in health insurance premiums for employees under current law. Many small businesses do not now provide health coverage, but if the Government required all employers to provide a low-cost set of health benefits, spending by employers would rise by $59 billion, to a total of $227 billion a year, the work papers say.
If the Government required employers to provide a generous set of health benefits to their workers, the employers' cost might rise by $87 billion, to $255 billion a year, the documents say.
At the heart of Mr. Clinton's plan is a proposal to guarantee a uniform set of health benefits for all Americans. All three packages would help pay for hospital and doctors' services, X-rays and laboratory tests, prescription drugs and some mental health services. Dental care would be covered under two of the three plans.
The austere plan, as conceived by the Administration, would provide more extensive coverage than 20 percent of private health insurance plans now in force. The generous plan would provide more protection than 90 percent of the existing private plans. The medium-cost proposal would provide more coverage than half the plans now in effect. Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, private health insurance would continue, but the Government would regulate the industry to guarantee that all Americans had access to a minimum set of benefits.
In public comments over the last three months, Administration officials have often discussed their desire to guarantee comprehensive health benefits. But they have generally refused to discuss the cost or the tax increases needed to finance it, and they have emphasized potential savings rather than new costs for employers or employees.
When asked for an estimate of cost, Robert O. Boorstin, a spokesman for the task force, said, "I'm not going to talk about that one."
Mr. Magaziner said: "There will be significant savings in what we propose. The difficulty is that those savings mostly begin to come in a five- to 10-year time frame. If you want to move quickly to expand coverage, you've got to spend money before that. So there is a timing issue here."

HEADLINE: Balking at Clinton in Party Bedrock

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, May 2

 BODY:
They call their Congressman Jerry in the blue-collar Polish neighborhoods of South Milwaukee, where the Democratic Party still holds a place of importance in people's lives, along with close families, tidy lawns and attending church.
But as Representative Gerald D. Kleczka prepares to vote in the House Ways and Means Committee this month on the tax proposals in President Clinton's economic package, the message the Democratic lawmaker is hearing from his constituents goes against the grain of Administration policies. The predominant theme in his mail and town meetings, his staff members say, is that spending should be cut before taxes are increased. 
 At a town meeting on Saturday attended by 40 constituents in West Allis, an industrial suburb just west of Milwaukee, Mr. Kleczka was forced to parry a barrage of attacks on Government waste and Congressional privileges, as well as Mr. Clinton's plan to allow homosexuals in the military and his easing of restrictions on abortion.
 
Clamor Forces Critical Look
 Andrew Wolf, a 73-year-old retired welder, said: "You people in Congress don't want to listen. You're spending millions of dollars over a study to find out why truck drivers get tired."
Mr. Kleczka says he wants to support Mr. Clinton as much as possible, but the clamor from home is forcing him to take a critical look at some important elements of the President's legislative program. He has already declared his opposition to the free trade agreement with Mexico, and he promises to oppose Mr. Clinton's requests to finance the space station and superconducting supercollider.
The Ways and Means Committee begins drafting Mr. Clinton's tax plan this week, and Mr. Kleczka says he will support the President's requests for new taxes on fuel and higher-income recipients of Social Security.
But he says he will oppose the Administration's proposal for an investment tax credit for business. And he says he is undecided on Administration requests to keep taxes on capital gains lower than proposed rate increase on wealthier individuals.
As a junior member of the tax-writing panel, Mr. Kleczka would not normally be considered a force. But with the committee's chairman, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, distracted by a Federal investigation of his finances, Mr. Kleczka and the 14 other new committee members have acquired great potential influence.
 
'Cut More Before We Spend'
 "We're going to try to see that President Clinton does well," Mr. Kleczka said. "But that doesn't mean I'm in lock step."
Mr. Kleczka's meeting on Saturday was punctuated by impassioned speeches and other dramatic demonstrations of strong political views. Some people distributed literature criticizing Government spending, with an outline of Mr. Kleczka's voting record on things like his support for the "giveaway" of money for foreign aid and his support for the "unconstitutional" financing of legal services for the poor.
"We need to cut more before we spend more," said Rudolf Pfister, a 59-year-old telephone installer. Expressing the prevailing mood against Washington, he added: "There are the lobbyists who wine you and dine you to sway your vote. Who do you think we are -- you think we are smoking marijuana down here?"
The drumbeat of middle-class anger and criticism was so fierce that one middle-aged man rose to tell those at the meeting, "Maybe you all should run for Congress."
"No," responded Mr. Kleczka, as he lifted up his pen to show he was taking notes. "I'm writing fast."
 
Pledges to Use Sharp Knife
 The 49-year-old Representative explained that his work on the Ways and Means Committee was separate from the process by which Congress approves spending. He pledged to take out a sharp knife when spending bills came to the House floor later this year.
The mood in West Allis, a community hit hard by high real estate taxes and factory closings, reflects some of the troubles Mr. Clinton faces as he attempts to marshal the public behind his policies. It is also the kind of district of tradition-minded conservative Democrats that will be a battleground should Mr. Clinton seek re-election.
Mr. Clinton only narrowly defeated President George Bush in West Allis in November. Many people did not like Mr. Clinton's pro-choice views on abortion.
Mr. Kleczka has managed to remain popular here, because of his strong constituent services and his down-home style. His popularity has allowed him to resist the opinions of many of his constituents who oppose the national Democratic Party's social agenda.
Judy Clark, a 47-year-old housewife, urged Mr. Kleczka to oppose Mr. Clinton's plan to allow homosexuals in the military. "Homosexuality is not a civil rights issue," she said. "It comes down to values and morals and beliefs."
But Mr. Kleczka responded: "I don't think any group in the society should be faced with discrimination. As far as gays in the military, I support the President's action."
The Congressman urged greater tolerance, and to break the tension, he pointed to an elderly woman and asked if she could be certain the woman sitting beside her was not a lesbian. "I can, because she's my sister," the woman snapped back.
Everyone, including Mr. Kleczka, had a good laugh.

Making Welfare Work By an Emphasis on Jobs

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
MORE people now receive welfare than attend public school in New York City.
Graduation rates for both groups are alarmingly low. The ranks of welfare recipients are swollen by the school system's failures. But few candidates in tomorrow's school board elections, while sermonizing about ancillary issues in a stampede to claim the moral high ground, draw a parallel between one group and the other. And some defenders of the poor argue that further education may not always be as good an antidote to welfare as work. 
 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, in the preface to a forthcoming report by the New York State Business Council's Public Policy Institute, warns that tolerating a range of behavior from pre-teen pregnancy to bureaucratic hobbling of his Family Support Act amounts to "collective madness."
So too, critics insist, is merely preaching abstinence while withholding sex education and condoms from youngsters.
Mr. Moynihan's outrage forms the preamble to a largely non-ideological analysis of New York's efforts so far to transform eligible welfare recipients into productive workers. The critical study, by David Shaffer of the Public Policy Institute, the Business Council's research arm, is to be released later this month.
It suggests that while the recession has impeded the goals of Mr. Moynihan's Family Support Act, the state has been slow to expand its most successful programs and to embrace the evidence of what works: a wide range of job preparation and search programs and education and training as vital elements of job preparation rather than as a goal to be pursued to the exclusion of employment.
Under Mr. Schaffer's vision, the elderly, disabled, children and others unable to work would still receive regular grants. Others would join an employment security system that would provide a training stipend while preparing people for work, pay for a public works job, and offer parental leave benefits for single parents with young children -- modeled, in part, on New York's Working Toward Independence Program and on America Works, a private company that gets paid by local government only when it produces results.
A recent study by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation found measurable progress in California's jobs program, which requires schooling for welfare recipients without a high school diploma or the equivalent or are not proficient in English and cannot find a job within a few weeks.
"Making welfare-without-work somewhat less attractive and less common is one necessary way of attacking the problem," Mr. Schaffer writes (adding, though, that when a punitive approach has been tried "workfare has indeed been a disaster"). "But it is also important to try to make work, even in entry-level jobs, more attractive."
He figures that a mother of two on welfare in New York City receives a $2,856 basic grant, $636 in home energy payments, a $3,432 housing allowance, $2,784 in food stamps for a total of $9,708 annually, or 80 percent of the poverty level. If the mother had a minimum-wage job, she would make $8,829 in salary, $2,880 in food stamps, $3,360 in public assistance, a $1,200 earned-income credit and would pay $4,200 ($175 a month per child) for day care, $2,500 ($50 a week) in work-related expenses and $678 in Social Security taxes for net income of $8,891. Working for $8.50 an hour -- twice the minimum wage -- would disqualify the mother for public assistance and for Medicaid after one year, which would reduce her net income to under $9,000.
Mr. Schaffer rejects calls from conservatives to lower benefits and from liberals to raise the minimum wage. Rather, he suggests a state earned-income tax credit or letting working welfare recipients keep more of their wages before the basic grant is reduced.
The caveats: training, education and public works employment can be costly; many welfare recipients are ineligible for jobs because of age or dysfunction. Still, some programs seem to work. Tried together, they may tip the ratio between the number of New Yorkers in school and on welfare and improve graduation rates among both groups.

A NEW ATTITUDE ON SMALL BUSINESS
After decades of counting on big business and local government to create jobs, New York City must now look mainly to small companies to rebuild its decimated jobs base and thus must make it easier for them to operate, political leaders, economists and urban planners say. This represents a new attitude toward small businesses, which for years have lacked the clout to pressure City Hall for the financial incentives granted to large corporations that threatened to leave the city. A1.
 
SEX SHOPS TEST NEIGHBORHOOD TOLERANCE
New York City has long held a reputation as one of America's most permissive cities, especially on issues that touch on First Amendment protections of free speech and expression. But the striking proliferation of sex video stores, topless bars and nude dance clubs in neighborhoods where they have rarely ventured before -- from Chelsea to Marine Park in Brooklyn, from the Upper East Side of Manhattan to Forest Hills in Queens -- is now straining that tolerance. B3.
 

POLICE PONDER ACTION ON ILLEGAL DRIVERS
The New York City Police Department said that it is considering new procedures to crack down on unlicensed drivers in the wake of three car accidents in the last three weeks that killed three pedestrians in Brooklyn, all children, and injured several others. Yesterday, a 90-year-old woman was killed in Brooklyn by a car driven by a man who the police said was intoxicated. Unlike in the other recent fatalities, the driver charged in the crash did not have any license suspensions, the police said. B3.
 
TAKING THE SCHOOL BATTLE TO THE VOTER
The battle for control of New York City's 32 school boards moved to churches, streets and parks, as opponents made a final push in a heated election that some combatants hope will chart the ideological future of education in the city. Congregants at St. Patrick's Cathedral picked up voter guides produced by Pat Robertson's conservative Christian Coalition. In Central Park, volunteers for the Gay Men's Health Crisis passed out another voter guide. And the Rev. Al Sharpton took to the pulpit of the Mount Ollie Baptist Church in Ocean Hill-Brownsville to denounce what he called meddling in local issues by right-wing religious groups. B5.
 
BIAS SUSPECTED IN ATTACK IN BROOKLYN
A 16-year-old youth told the police that he was attacked with fists and walkie-talkies and that eight of his friends were roughed up on a Brooklyn street by 20 to 30 men in Hasidic garb who said his "kind" was not wanted in their neighborhood. The police said they were investigating it as a possible bias incident. B2.
 
REGION
 
LOBBYING FORMS TRIAL BACKDROP
The trial of Armand D'Amato, who is charged with 24 counts of mail fraud in connection with filing false paper work for $120,500 he received from Sperry Corporation and its successor, Unisys, opens a window on the world of lobbying. B6.
 
ODDS ON CASINO BILL HARD TO FIGURE
For all the public-relations thundering about jobs and the endlessly repeated television and radio advertisements by Mirage Resorts of Las Vegas, the final outcome of Connecticut's casino gambling debate remains a crapshoot, and people like Gary D. Le Beau are the reason. For the last nine months Mr. Le Beau, a Democratic State Representative from East Hartford, supported the casino plan. But with the first floor votes only a few weeks away, he has turned, scared by the power and money of the gambling promoters who he now thinks could end up running the state if they get approval to build the casinos they want in Bridgeport and Hartford. B6.
 
THE FLEAS THAT SAVED MAIN STREET
Something happens in Chester, N.J., on weekends. No one is sure when it started, exactly. But every Saturday morning, throngs of tourists pour into this pastoral Morris County borough as if the carnival were in town, hanging out all day and staying for dinner. And even more show up on Sunday, when Main Street might as well be Disney World. Most residents say that what started the phenomenon was the flea market. B6.

HEADLINE: Black Muslims Enter Islamic Mainstream

SERIES: Muslims in America -- Second of four articles.

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Every Friday afternoon, hundreds of black men, women and children stop work or school for a couple of hours and hurry to a 15,000-square-foot building on the edge of town.
They represent the rainbow of black America: suburban and urban; professional and poor; deep brown and light tan. They pull up in faded station wagons and gleaming Mercedes Benzes. Inside, the men sit in the front; the women in the back. Many used to be Baptists, African Methodist or Roman Catholic. 
 Now they are Muslim.
They gathered here, at least 600 strong, on a recent afternoon at their mosque, the Atlanta Masjid al-Islam. It was time for the prayer known as juma, as it is every Friday around the Islamic world, including dozens of neighborhoods in the United States.
After the service, they rushed back to their offices or classrooms, back to the bustle of mainstream America in which so many black American Muslims place themselves, in sharp contrast to the old days of the "Black Muslims" and the racial separatism of the once-dominant Nation of Islam.
"We make a conscious effort to be open and involved in all aspects of American society," said Plemon Tauheed El-Amin, an imam, or leader, in Atlanta who was educated at Harvard University.
Like many other black American Muslims, Mr. El-Amin was once a member of the Nation of Islam but later embraced a more conventional Islam, which rejects the Nation's racial theories. "We don't make distinctions based on color or race," he said. "No longer are we an isolated community, happy to keep to ourselves."
No one knows exactly how many black American Muslims there are but estimates range from 500,000 to 1.5 million. They are police officers in Newark, soldiers in Germany, college professors in Chicago and the Mayor of Kountze, Tex., where there are only two Muslim families and where 70 percent of the 2,700 residents are white.
They have opened hundreds of mosques, from sparkling modern buildings to weather-beaten houses. They run dozens of schools that teach Islamic culture along with advanced algebra and American history.
And even though they are only a small fraction of the 30 million blacks in the United States, their influence among non-Muslims is real and visible. The Muslim greeting, "as-salaam alaikum," or peace be with you, echoes through some inner-city neighborhoods almost as frequently as "Good morning." For Muslims the skull cap called a kufi is a symbol of humility; for non-Muslims it increasingly conveys style. Muslim chaplains are on the staffs of many prisons, where conversions are common. And more and more, tenants in troubled housing projects call on Muslims to patrol their streets and face down drug dealers.
The 2,000 members of the Atlanta masjid, or mosque, one of the largest and most active black American Muslim communities, can loosely be called orthodox Sunni Muslims, as are the majority of the world's Muslims. But by no means are black American Muslims monolithic in Atlanta or elsewhere. In this city alone, there are at least three distinct communities.
 
17 or 18 Variations
 As many as 17 or 18 significant subgroups of black American Muslims are scattered across the country, mostly in or around inner cities, with as many leaders. The majority are generally aligned with mainstream Islam, but some are theological splinter groups, like the Moorish Science Temple, the Five Percenters and at least three versions of the Nation of Islam, said Aminah McCloud, herself a Muslim and a professor of Islamic Studies at DePaul University in Chicago.
Most of the three million to four million Muslims in this country are immigrants. Black Americans account for most of the country's native-born Muslims. In the past, ties between immigrant groups and black American ones were minimal, but some on both sides are now working to build links.
Some converts say they are Muslim first and black second. Others say the opposite. Some love America, others shun it.
The reasons black Americans have turned to Islam are varied. For some it is a cultural statement, a recognition of spiritual ties to Africa, where Islam spread from Arabia centuries ago.
The emphasis on discipline and conservative values may attract people who live among too much crime and social disorder. And in the face of white racism, some are also drawn to Islam by its reputation for assertiveness. "Young black people see Islam as more of a fighting religion, whereas Christianity is seen as a kind of passive, turn-the-other-cheek religion," said Conrad Worrill, who heads the Inner City Studies program of Northeastern Illinois University.
Generally, black American Muslims, like most Muslims around the world, oppose abortion. And in keeping with Islamic principles they frown on premarital sex, short skirts and spoiled children. They forbid gambling, eating pork and drinking alcohol.
Like the Roman Catholic Church, Islam does not typically allow women to ascend to the highest level of the religion: the imam or prayer leader. Besides being separated from the men when they pray in the mosques, women often wrap their hair in scarves to protect their modesty.
 
'The Change'
Move to Join The Mainstream
 The members of the Atlanta masjid are part of a large group of black American Muslims in the United States that have joined mainstream Islam. Although they have their own local imams like Mr. El-Amin and 51-year-old Ibrahim Pasha, a Muslim since the age of 4, nationally they follow the spiritual guidance of Warith Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muhammad, who led the Nation of Islam for 40 years until his death in 1975.
In a remarkable and traumatic transition, since his father's death, Mr. Mohammed has guided most of his father's followers away from racial separatism and firmly into the embrace of moderate Sunni Islam. This continuing effort is known among black Americans as "the change."
Mr. Mohammed is believed to have 100,000 to 250,000 followers. By contrast, the biggest Nation of Islam group, led by Louis Farrakhan, which for the most part is carrying on the teaching of Elijah Muhammad, has about 20,000 followers.
But even after all these years, Mr. Mohammed still thinks he must spend considerable time reminding his followers of the change. "Too many people are holding on to the old ways," he said in an interview.
Every Tuesday, he flies to Chicago from his home in Little Rock, Ark., to tape his weekly television show about the Muslim world and to give lessons on Islamic vocabulary and culture because "so many of us have recently converted to Islam and are not aware of Muslim expressions."
In a recent taping, as he smiled into the camera like an experienced late-night talk show host, he said he wanted his audience to remember the change and to understand that Islam "is a religion for all people."
In many ways Mr. Mohammed has become part of the religious establishment. Last year, he became the first imam ever to give the invocation before the United States Senate. In the 1980's, he voted Republican in Presidential elections because of his own anti-welfare beliefs, and last year he backed President George Bush over Bill Clinton.
Mr. Mohammed's followers "always listen to him, but they don't always follow his politics," said Lawrence H. Mamiya, a professor of religion at Vassar College.
During the war in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Mohammed was a strong supporter of Saudi Arabia and the United States, not a universally popular position among Muslims. "The imam's stance is always pro-America," said Nevorn K. Askari, a 37-year-old pediatrician and a member of the Atlanta masjid. "I don't feel that way."
But Mr. Mohammed's relationship with the Saudis was strong long before the first bomb dropped in the gulf. The Saudis have donated most of the $8.5 million to build a mosque for Mr. Mohammed's followers in South-Central Los Angeles and are committed to building at least five others across the country.
Mr. Mohammed says he supports the Palestinian struggle for "a home and a right to self-determination" but he does not condone "terrorism or attacks on innocent people on behalf of that cause," said the imam's special assistant, Abdul Malik Mohammed. But so far that support has been no more than verbal, and Mr. Mohammed's publications do not display the obsessively anti-Jewish attitudes of the Nation of Islam.
The relationship between black American Muslims and immigrant Muslims has been improving, but there are still ethnic and cultural differences, the assistant said. "Immigrant Muslims were seeing African-Americans the way the media portrayed African-Americans, as lazy and criminal. And the African-American Muslims were seeing the immigrants as the media portrayed third world people, as lazy and criminal," he said.
Imam Mohammed's efforts to pull his followers into the Islamic mainstream have indeed broken some barriers between the groups, but there is still not much cooperation on political or social issues.
 
The Roots
An Antidote To Indignities
 The roots of Islam run deeply through the soul of black America, stretching back to at least the early years of the century and perhaps much farther. Islam had spread to West Africa by the 12th century, and historians believe that some slaves brought to the Americas were Muslim. The slaves were quickly converted to Christianity.
The first significant group of black Americans identifying with Islam in this century was the Moorish Science Temple founded in Newark in 1913. Several other groups followed, but it was Elijah Muhammad 20 years later who introduced Islam, at least a highly unorthodox version of it, to black Americans on a large scale.
His was a fiery blend of Islam, the Bible, black nationalism, racial chauvinism, military-style discipline and bootstrap economics, which his son said was probably the message dearest to his father's heart.
According to the Nation of Islam, whites were created by a mad scientist as a curse on the superior black race. The white man was the devil and the Nation wanted to be separate. It was the white man who flooded black neighborhoods with liquor and drugs and poverty. And it was the Christian church that told blacks to be patient and forgiving.
During its glory years of the 1950's and 1960's, the Nation of Islam dismayed many, scared some and saved others from a life of crime and drugs, including its most famous convert, Malcolm X, who left the Nation and moved toward mainstream Islam before his murder in 1965. For many members, the Nation was more than a religion. Setting up blacks as racially superior, it was an antidote to pervasive white racism.
Safiyyah Shahid, the daughter of a Baptist preacher in Atlanta and now the principal of the Atlanta masjid's elementary and high school, joined the Nation of Islam in 1968 for reasons that continue to resonate among many black people today, though she later made the change.
"I joined the Nation because I thought the Christian church represented more of a barrier to African-American progress," she said. "There was too much talk of waiting for the by and by, too many pictures of a white Jesus. I liked what the Nation was saying about do-for-self, that the black man had a lot of dignity, that we had been written out of the history books."
 
The Groups
Large Branches And Offshoots
 At least three groups claim to be the Nation of Islam today: a small band in Detroit; another with headquarters in Atlanta, and the biggest and best-known, with temples in most large cities, led by Mr. Farrakhan from Chicago.
His is one of the fastest growing of all the movements, Professor Mamiya said, adding, "When he talks out about racism in American society, he strikes a responsive cord, especially among the young."
Mr. Farrakhan, who declined requests for an interview, began his Nation of Islam in 1978 after disagreeing with Mr. Mohammed's plans to move toward mainstream Islam. For a few years, Mr. Farrakhan had about 1,000 members. Today, he has more than 20,000.
Whether Mr. Farrakhan and his Nation of Islam are true Muslims is the source of much debate within the American Muslim community. In traditional Islam there is no talk of separation of people based on race. Mr. Farrakhan has also made comments about Jews that are widely regarded as anti-Semitic, and his group publishes literature regarded as anti-Semitic. Recently, Mr. Farrakhan has been toning down the Nation's racial message, Professor Mamiya said.
Even more unsettling to many Muslims, however, is the Nation's belief that Allah appeared in Detroit in 1930 in the person of W. Fard Muhammad, the founder of the Nation of Islam, who passed his message and work on to Elijah Muhammad before he disappeared in 1934. Orthodox Islam says that there is only one God and that the Prophet Muhammad was his last messenger.
Still, many black Muslims are reluctant to criticize Mr. Farrakhan or other splinter groups too harshly. Mr. Mohammed, eager to avoid bad feelings, said of the Nation: "I have to accept it as a Muslim community. We see it as one in transition, moving much slower than we did."
The two men do not often see each other and they have very different styles. Mr. Farrakhan travels with bodyguards and keeps a tight grip on his Nation. He lives in Elijah Muhammad's Chicago mansion, known on the streets as "the Palace."
Mr. Mohammed usually travels alone, carrying his own bag. He does not have or want, he says, any direct control over his followers. "I'm not against leadership," he said. "I'm against dictators."
The two men did meet recently in Harlem at the funeral of a highly respected black American imam, Yusuf Shah, who bridged both worlds. As dozens watched, Imam Mohammed and Minister Farrakhan embraced.
"Although there are smaller groups, there are actually two African-American Muslim leaders: Farrakhan and myself," Mr. Mohammed said in an interview before the funeral. "He's the leader of those who hold on to the old ideas. I'm the leader of the change."
But Islam in America is sprouting many leaders and variations in tradition.
In a rough pocket of Atlanta called the West End, Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, known in the 1960's as H. Rap Brown, the fiery civil rights leader and Black Panther, is the spiritual leader for hundreds of families here and in 30 other cities, including Chicago, New York and Detroit.
Dozens of his followers have bought houses near the group's mosque, a one-story building overlooking a basketball court where Imam Al-Amin and his followers play ball and talk religion with neighbors.
"We make them believers right here," Imam Al-Amin said as some men shot baskets. "We play the best ball around."
Imam Al-Amin interprets the Koran strictly, and rejects much of Western civilization. "When you take a sense of the creator out of anything, like prayer in school, you produce serial killers, rapists, abortionists, the dregs of mankind," he said.
The imam and his followers strive to distinguish themselves as Muslims and to maintain their spiritual distance from the larger society, which they see as being almost hopelessly corrupt. The men wear beards, robe-length shirts and kufi caps. The women wear long dresses and scarves.
At night, they patrol their neighborhood, chasing drug dealers and other criminals. They make and sell incense from one of their of small stores, whose windows are filled with sports trophies the members have won.
"The Prophet didn't pray all day and he didn't play all day," Imam Al-Amin said. "He had a balance. That's something else we're striving for."
 
Beliefs
Model Community Is Being Built
 A few miles away, the solemn call to prayer washes over the parking lot of the Atlanta masjid. Depending on the wind, the sound can travel a quarter of a mile or more. It is broadcast over loudspeakers five times a day, beginning at daybreak.
"We've had a few complaints about it, especially in the morning," Mr. El-Amin said in an interview in his office at the mosque.
Like Muslims everywhere, the members of the Atlanta masjid try to pray at the five prescribed times a day, either at the mosque or wherever they happen to be.
"We're trying to build a model community," the imam said. "It's hard to do in America with a liquor store on every corner. We're not forcing our religion on people. We're just trying to show them there's another way."
To spread the word, they send teams onto college campuses, into the malls and through the public-housing project across the street. Monthly, a group from the mosque has "a dialogue, not a debate," with a group of Christians from a nearby church.
The mosque also operates a 300-student school, through 12th grade, open to non-Muslims, and the students do their part to show "that Muslims aren't a bunch of terrorists," said the imam's 17-year-old daughter, Fatima, who has been accepted by Harvard University and Smith College, from where her mother, Sandra, graduated.
Most of the students' parents are blue-collar workers, but others own their own businesses. The group also owns the small shopping center where its mosque is and leases space to Muslims and non-Muslims, including a Korean family that sells beer and pork, which are forbidden to Muslims.
When the faithful arrive at the mosque, everybody takes off their shoes and sits on the floor, which is covered by a green carpet. The men and boys go to the front of the large room, the women and girls to the back.
Mr. El-Amin said the men and women were separated for modesty's sake. The imam said there were obvious differences between the sexes that must be maintained. "We don't want to destroy the natural identities, especially the role of the woman as mother," he said. "We're turning away from the natural roles of men and women, and we're producing monsters."
Mr. Mohammed, the national leader, said he was trying to encourage his followers around the country to advance women in the church. "It's a problem we'll have to deal with," he said. "The Catholic Church has the same problem."
In this respect, perhaps, Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam may be ahead of other Muslim groups. His branch has at least five female ministers, Dr. Mamiya said.
Dr. Askari, the Atlanta pediatrician, and Mrs. Shahid, the principal, said they did not feel discriminated against as Muslim women. Instead, they said, they felt protected and respected by the brothers.
At 16, Jamillah Karim, a senior at the W. Deen Mohammed High School a few blocks from the Atlanta masjid, said she sometimes thought her male classmates had it easier than the girls, not at school, but in life.
The girls stand out more after school because they wear long blue skirts and white scarves as part of their uniforms. The boys wear blue pants and white shirts. They can blend in at the mall or on the corner.
"You think you'd be more attractive to the opposite sex if you dressed more like everybody else," she said. "Watching music videos you wonder how'd you look in those clothes. You always think you're missing out.
"I like being a Muslim. But sometimes it's hard. New friends assume we don't watch TV, go to parties, the movies, nothing fun. It's almost like they don't look at us as normal teen-agers. Then when they get to know us, they're surprised. We're normal people. The only difference is, we're Muslims."
Next: An immigrant Muslim community comes of age.
 
 
 
NAMES BIND CONVERTS TO THE FAITH
 In keeping with Islamic tradition, most American converts take Muslim names as a sign of their faith, often changing their names legally. The names, usually Arabic, bind the living to great figures or concepts from the Islamic past, providing inspiration for daily life.
Common is Muhammed or Mohammed, for the Prophet himself. Other historical names are Ali, for a nephew of Muhammed who played a crucial role in the faith's early history, Hasan and Hussein for grandsons of Muhammed, Khadijah and Zainab for wives of Muhammed and Fatimah for a daughter.
Ali was also a great Islamic general. Hence the name Muhammed Ali -- selected for the boxer by Elijah Muhammad, late leader of the Nation of Islam -- evokes a powerful combination.
Many names include the Arabic word for one of the 99 attributes of Allah, the creator, in the Koran. One attribute is rahman, meaning "gracious" or "beneficent." No one could have the trait as fully as Allah does, so the word Abdul, meaning "servant of," is added, and Abdul Rahman means "servant of the most gracious."
Karim, meaning "generous," is another of the 99 attributes, and Jabbar means "the compeller" or "mighty one." Hence the basketball star's name means "generous servant of the compeller."
Most often, people pick their own names. "You look for good qualities you will try to represent in your life," said Dr. Abd'allah Adesanya, assistant imam of a mosque in Brooklyn. Dr. Adesanya combined Arabic and African influences in choosing his name. His first name is Arabic for "servant of Allah," while his surname is from the Yoruba language of West Africa and means "the crown repays suffering."

They Eat Whales, Don't They? A Fight Resumes

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 29

 BODY:
As he surveyed his restaurant one recent pre-holiday evening, Kiyoo Tanahashi was proud that almost all the wooden chairs and tatami mats were occupied by office workers or college students partaking of the house specialties -- whale steak, whale bacon, fried whale, smoked whale, raw whale and whale soup containing slivers of whale tongue.
But Mr. Tanahashi, who dishes out the equivalent of two whales a year, turns sour when he thinks of the ban on commercial whaling that is making restaurants like his Kujiraya, which means whale store, an endangered species. "I am rather angry that outside countries would tell us what food we should or should not eat," he said. 
 The freedom to eat what one chooses has become a rallying cry among whaling supporters on the eve of a crucial meeting of the International Whaling Commission, the 39-nation group that regulates whaling.
The annual meeting, which will be held in Kyoto from May 10 to May 14, comes when the moratorium on commercial whaling that has been in effect since 1986 shows signs of cracking.
Iceland has withdrawn from the commission, though it has not started whaling, and Norway announced last year that it would resume whaling, although it will remain a member of the commission. Now Japan, with the meeting on its home turf, will push -- against long odds -- to have the ban lifted.
 
The Opposing Arguments
 Japan and Norway argue that the moratorium, initially put in place to revive stocks that had been depleted by decades of excessive whaling, is no longer needed for certain types of whales. The whaling commission's scientific committee has estimated that there are 760,000 minkes, a relatively small whale, in the Southern Hemisphere. Japan says that catching 2,000 a year would have no effect on the population.
Those opposed to whaling say that whales in general are still in such a precarious state that even the minke whales should continue to be protected.
But now the issue is becoming whether whales, which many people consider majestic creatures with high intelligence, should be hunted at all, even if their numbers permit.
Some countries, including Australia and New Zealand, already have said whaling should never resume and the United States is also strongly in the antiwhaling camp. France has proposed that the entire Antarctic region south of 40 degrees latitude be made into a whale sanctuary. The idea, supported by the United States, will be a major item on the agenda in Kyoto.
"If we were using whale meat to offset the hunger of the third world it might be permitted," said Dr. Michael F. Tillman, acting assistant administrator for fisheries at the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the leader of the American delegation to the Kyoto conference. "But that's not what's happening. It's going to the most expensive restaurants in the largest cities in the world."
Japanese officials argue that the idea of a whale sanctuary represents the imposition of one nation's morals on another and is, in a sense, a form of Japan-bashing. Why, they ask, should Western nations be allowed to kill cows and pigs and Japan not allowed to kill whales.
"We should not make a new religion of whale-ism," said Kazuo Shima, Japan's commissioner on the whaling body and deputy director general of the Government's Fisheries Agency. "We believe science and we believe scientists. We should not permit religious arguments in this field."
Japanese officials say they want to take a stand to insure that other species, like dolphins and different types of trees, also do not come under protection for what they say are irrational reasons.
Last year, the International Whaling Commission approved a computerized formula for calculating the permissible yearly catches for some types of whales. But it said it would not allow any whaling to resume until it approves other necessary measures, like monitoring and inspecting whaling ships.
At this year's meeting, Japan and Norway will push for approval of such plans, thereby clearing the way for whaling to begin. But it is considered unlikely that the commission will complete the work this year, especially since countries opposed to whaling will delay the process as much as possible.
"The longer this thing drags out the more people in Japan will forget about eating whale meat," said an official of an American environmental group.
Norway has said it will resume whaling this summer, even if the commission does not allow it.
Japan, however, is not expected to take such a bold move or to withdraw from the whaling commission. Despite its tough words now, it is unlikely the nation would risk the enmity of the United States and many European nations for the sake of a whaling industry that, in terms of Japan's overall economy, is insignificant.
The nation has been trying to years to reverse a poor environmental image that stems from its history of industrial pollution and its reluctance to cease trading in whales and other endangered species like tortoises. Even though it has stopped commercial whaling, Japan continues to catch about 300 whales a year for research purposes, with the meat ending up at restaurants and food stores.
Japan now has only four boats with 28 crew members active in catching a few types of small whales that are not protected, according to the Fisheries Agency.
"The industry's gone," said Kunio Yonezawa, an adviser to the Japanese Government on the whaling issue. "We are fighting for a cause, not for economic interests. We have to insure the principle of rational use of ocean resources."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Uneasy Days for the Bond Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
This week could be bumpy for the bond market.
The beginning of every month brings the Labor Department employment report and the traumas that come with waiting for its release on Friday. But coming just after last week's report on the economy's weak performance in the first quarter, the jobs report could be more jolting than usual. It will be scrutinized to see if the slow trend in economic growth is continuing or was just weather related. 
 Possibly even more disturbing -- though of much less importance in an economic sense -- will be the Treasury's announcement on Wednesday of its plans for the quarterly auction this month and the related release of a report on how the Treasury can reduce its borrowing costs. That report is expected to be released Wednesday or earlier.
Speculation about what the report will say about the future of the 30-year bond auction has added to the market's recent volatility. The market seemed to signal this concern Friday as the price of the 30-year bond dropped 19/32 and the yield jumped to 6.92 percent, its highest level in a month.
Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., said uncertainty about the Treasury's plans had put a lid on trading recently. "There is a reluctance to take any more risk than necessary now," Mr. McCarthy said.
The concern centers on the size of the 30-year bond auction. The Treasury has already cut the quarterly sale from $12 billion in November 1991 to $9.25 billion this February, a reduction of 23 percent. But the Clinton Administration's deficit-reduction plan is assuming $16 billion in savings over five years from cutting the costs of Government borrowing. One obvious path to savings is to shift borrowing from higher-interest-rate, long-term borrowing to shorter-term, lower-interest-rate maturities.
Many analysts and traders are philosophically opposed to any major changes in the Treasury's borrowing mix because they prefer predictability, which means fewer surprises that can provoke losses. Still, the prospect of a smaller auction of 30-year bonds had helped send prices higher because it would mean less supply to meet the same demand.
 
Smaller Cut Is Expected
 As the announcement approaches, market opinion seems to have changed about the size of the possible cut in the 30-year auction. Earlier expectations were for a big cut -- including a move from four to two auctions a year. Now, a less significant shift is anticipated -- an opinion that seems to fit with the promises of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that there would be no radical change. But he has never defined what radical means.
Mr. McCarthy is looking for a cut in the 30-year bond auction of $750 million, to $8.5 billion; a $250 million cut in the 10-year auction, to $10.5 billion, and an increase of $500 million in the three-year auction, to $16 billion.
After the selloff in the market on Friday, it did not appear that such a small change would weaken the price of the 30-year bond any further. In fact, the most significant outcome of the Treasury announcement would be the removal of the uncertainty. Of course, a bigger reduction would now be a surprise and would be expected to push bond prices higher.
As for the employment report, forecasters expect the data to show that the economy is growing faster than the 1.8 percent annual pace of the first quarter but no faster than the 3 percent annual pace in many predictions. The consensus estimate for the increase in nonfarm payroll jobs is around 175,000, which is a little higher than the average monthly increase for the first quarter of 153,000.
With such a report, the outlook for the market would be neutral. Assuming no surprises from the Treasury on the 30-year bond, there is nothing right now to drive market yields on the bond out of a trading range that runs from a low of 6.72 percent to a high of around 7 percent.
April retail sales, which are to be released on May 13, might have that potential. If they show a strong rebound from the 1 percent decline in March, there will be more proof that the consumer, who stayed at home in the first quarter, is coming back. That could worry those who are hoping that slow growth would pull yields lower.
On the other hand, the April inflation reports which come on May 12 and May 13 could lay the groundwork for higher prices and lower yields if the data are in line with the surprisingly small jumps for March.
The current market forecast is summed up by Glenn Murphy, chief investment officer at Travelers Asset Management International in Hartford, who said, "The bull market is over, but the bear market is not around the corner."

HEADLINE: Mandated Insurance Faces Fight

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Small businesses are making an emotional 11th-hour appeal to head off the Clinton Administration's plans to require all companies to pay for health insurance for their workers -- a mandate that critics say could bankrupt thousands of companies and cause large-scale layoffs.
Small business is squaring off not only against President Clinton, who needs employers to help finance the huge cost of extending coverage to uninsured Americans, but also large companies, which already provide health coverage and say small companies are not doing their share. 
 The resistance of small businesses could be the political Achilles' heel of the President's health plan. If small business blocks the requirement, the President will have a devilish time groping for other ways to pay for his ambitious health-care changes.
 
 
Fever Pitch
 With the Clinton Administration expected to produce its health-care proposal in May, to be followed by months of Congressional debate, lobbying on the issue has reached a fever pitch.
The debate has pitted an array of small-business organizations, like the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation -- all of whom say many of their members cannot afford to provide health benefits -- against the United States Chamber of Commerce and many of the nation's industrial giants.
Representatives of small business are gearing up for a strong attack once the Administration introduces its plan, but they are already pressing their views among members of Congress and to Hillary Rodham Clinton's health-care task force.
 
 
'Unbelievably Expensive'
 "There's a huge division here," Stephen Elmont, chairman of the National Restaurant Association, said. "For large companies, this is a non-issue, because they are already providing insurance, but for small business, it's a huge issue -- not because we don't want to do it, but because it's unbelievably expensive."
During the Presidential election campaign, Mr. Clinton said he intended to require employer contributions to health insurance, and he has given no sign of relenting, though subsidies may be proposed to soften the impact.
The Urban Institute estimates that it would cost American companies at least $30 billion more a year if the Government required them to cover employees working 18 hours or more a week. Otherwise, the Government may have to pick up the tab.
Documents from the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform say the Administration's plan could cost Government, businesses and households up to an additional $150 billion a year. The nation's businesses now pay $168 billion in health-care premiums a year; requiring all employers to pay for a low-cost set of health benefits -- including the upgrading of benefits in some cases to meet the Federal standard -- would cost them $59 billion more.
Of the 37 million Americans who now lack health insurance, 28.5 million are workers and their families.
To cushion the impact on small businesses, the President's health-care advisers are considering placing a ceiling on a business's health-care payments of 7 or 9 percent of its payroll. Under such a ceiling, small businesses would pay only a part of the insurance for minimum-wage employees, with the Federal Government paying the rest.
 
Government Subsidies
 Some small businesses can live with such a ceiling, but are pressing for it to be as low as possible. But many businesses oppose any requirement to provide coverage, arguing that workers can buy their own insurance, perhaps with the help of tax breaks or Government subsidies.
How, they ask, can a small retailer or restaurant owner who relies on minimum-wage workers afford thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands -- of dollars in health-care insurance each year?
In the view of large businesses, many small companies are trying to shirk their responsibilities. It is unfair, big business executives argue, that many small companies do not provide coverage because the rest of society ends up paying the medical bills for their workers -- with big businesses picking up much of the tab.
The Big Three auto makers and other large manufacturers are particularly galled that many small businesses routinely hire the spouses of workers at large manufacturing companies without providing health coverage, knowing the manufacturers will foot their health insurance bills by providing family coverage.
"As a nation in a global economy, we can no longer continue having our manufacturers carrying the health-insurance costs not only of their own workers, but of the workers' spouses who are employed elsewhere," said Walter Maher, director of Federal relations for the Chrysler Corporation.
He cited one estimate that all of this cost-shifting had socked American manufacturers with $11.5 billion a year in extra health-care costs. This represents a fourth of their health-care bills.
Mandated coverage would fall disproportionately on businesses with fewer than 50 employees, because so many of them do not provide coverage. About 10.5 million of their 40.2 million workers lack health insurance, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute. By contrast, among businesses with more than 500 employees, only 5 million of the 54 million workers lack coverage.
Although big business appears to be carrying the day so far, small business is optimistic that it can persuade its friends in Congress to block any mandate requiring employer-paid health insurance. Some Republicans, especially conservatives in the House, are expected to pounce if the Administration proposes such a mandate.
"I think this will have a lot of trouble on the Hill," Mr. Elmont of the restaurant association, said. "Workers' compensation costs are already out of control. We pay through the teeth in payroll taxes. The Administration has just added a parental- leave requirement, and they're talking about raising the minimum wage. To say we're going to pull out the stops over health insurance is an understatement."
 
 
Scary Prospect
 For some small businesses, the prospect of mandated health coverage is downright scary. Typically, it costs small business $1,800 a year to cover an unmarried employee and $4,000 to $5,000 for a worker with dependents.
Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, gave the example of a business owner earning $35,000 with five employees who earn $15,000 each. "If the small-business owner has to pay $3,000 a year in health insurance for each one, that's $15,000," he said. "This lowers his earnings to $20,000, and it could mean he has to lay off workers or go out of business."
Worried that such a mandate would disproportionately hurt small business, some Administration officials are considering another financing option: a payroll tax on all employers.
Supporters of mandatory health coverage insist that requiring companies to provide insurance for all employees could ultimately lower health insurance costs. They argue that only when every employer provides coverage will the Administration be able to fully set up its managed competition plan to squeeze down health costs.
Under the Administration's plan, individuals and small businesses would pool their resources and buy health insurance coverage through cooperatives. These powerful cooperatives would be able to bargain for much lower rates than small businesses now receive.
"If small business got off its knee-jerk opposition to a mandate and analyzed these proposals, they'd say it is extremely fair to small business," said Henry E. Simmons, president of the National Leadership Coalition for Health Care Reform, which represents large corporations. "It would control their costs and enable them to do something most of them are already doing -- providing health coverage -- without having their health costs double every six years."
By some estimates, about 75 percent of businesses with fewer than 100 employees provide coverage; far more than 90 percent of those with more than 100 workers provide insurance.
Among the states, only Hawaii requires employers to provide health-care coverage, a mandate that took effect in 1974. Jack Lewin, the state's health director, says the system has helped to hold down health costs without imposing huge burdens on small business. Oregon is now phasing in such a requirement.
But illustrating the political difficulties of such mandates, a Massachusetts plan to require employer coverage in 1992 was delayed by the heated opposition of small business.
Supporters of mandated coverage acknowledge that it could impose a formidable burden on companies with many minimum-wage employees, who earn $4.25 an hour, or $8,500 a year for a full-time worker. Employers could be expected to scream if they were required to pay for $4,000 in health insurance for an employee earning $8,500 a year.
To soften the blow, the Administration is looking at setting ceilings on the payments by small businesses. With a ceiling of 7 percent of an employee's pay, an employer would pay about $600 for a minimum-wage worker.
Small businesses also fear that they would be required to provide coverage for part-time workers. The Administration is considering requiring employers to make partial health-care payments for part-time workers -- an employer might thus pay for half a policy for an employee working a 20-hour week.
If small businesses are not required to pay for any coverage for part-time workers, as small business lobbyists are demanding, that would be a substantial incentive for them to hire two part-time workers rather than one full-time worker.

HEADLINE: New York City Looks to Small Businesses for Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
After decades of counting on big business and local government to create jobs, New York City must now look mainly to small companies to rebuild its decimated jobs base and thus must make it easier for them to operate, political leaders, economists and urban planners say.
This represents a new attitude toward small businesses, which for years have lacked the clout to pressure City Hall for the tax concessions and financial incentives granted to large corporations, like CBS, Chase Manhattan, Morgan Stanley and Prudential Securities, that threatened to leave the city. 
 Indeed, there is finally widespread acknowledgment that the complaints that many small-business owners have voiced about high taxes, infuriating fines, confusing regulations and byzantine bureaucracy may have merit and that the city government is more of a hindrance than a help to small businesses in New York City.
 
A Political Consensus
 This consensus includes not only Mayor David N. Dinkins and his prospective challengers in this year's mayoral race but also City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman and Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker who is chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
"New York has to reinvent its economy and that means making it easier for small and dynamic businesses to flourish here," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "Right now we don't understand our advantages, and we certainly don't have policies that take advantage of our advantages."
Given the city's fiscal woes, making life easier for small businesses -- all businesses, for that matter -- involves radically reducing the cost of government so taxes and fines can be cut. It means vastly improving the efficiency of city services, which may require letting private companies take over some functions.
"They're all very, very difficult," Mr. Rohatyn said. "I have no great illusions that all are going to happen or some are going to happen."
Such changes would require big sacrifices from powerful interest groups that have shown time and again an unwillingness to make them.
These include unions like one representing sanitation workers who work short shifts for a full day's wage. They include state legislators who refuse to have the state pay for the city's 25 percent share of its Medicaid and welfare costs, penalizing the city for a high concentration of poor people. They include owners of one-, two- and three-family residences who scream when anyone mentions how unfair it is that commercial property-tax rates are more than six times theirs.
 
Much to Offer, Despite Everything
 Whatever the obstacles, New York still has enormous advantages to business: a diverse population, a huge, talented pool of labor, access to the companies and institutions that make it an international business and cultural center, 134 universities and colleges, and many leading research hospitals.
The result is a vast market with thousands of sizable niches, from printing financial documents for Wall Street to making music videos to supplying food to Indian restaurants. But given the high costs a business faces, from those imposed by the government to rents, utility charges and crime, only the truly fittest entrepreneurs can survive, let alone flourish. "The reality is New York City is not a good place for most small businesses," said William A. Sahlman, a Harvard Business School expert on financing entrepreneurs.
The figures bear this out.
While the number of small businesses, those with fewer than 100 employees, increased by 24 percent nationally in the 1980's, the city's grew by just 4 percent. Not coincidentally, the number of private-sector jobs in the city grew only 9 percent, or less than half the rate for the country as a whole.
The city has generally relied on local government and large companies for jobs. Companies with 500 or more workers employ nearly one out of every three people in its private sector. Nationally, their share is less than one in four.
But jobs at large corporations in New York City have vanished at an alarming rate. Of the 228,800 private-sector jobs lost between 1988 and 1991, 93,000, or 40.7 percent, were at large companies.
By comparison, employment at companies with fewer than 100 employees fell by only 58,660 in the three years, and their share of private-sector jobs edged up to 47.1 percent.
Signs are not promising for a rebound at large companies. The number of corporate headquarters in the city plunged in the last decade, continuing a long decline. Companies in financial, business and professional services -- the sector that fueled the 1980's economic boom -- had been mauled by the end of the mergers and acquisitions binge and the recession.
 
Ideas to Help Small Enterprises
 Ideas are not scarce on how to create a more hospitable environment for small business. They range from the modest but possible to the grandiose.
The former includes providing low-cost incubation space for fledgling biotechnology companies, which might enable the city to profit more from discoveries at its research hospitals. Another is Ms. Holtzman's proposal to use city pension funds to obtain federally guaranteed loans to entice light manufacturers to an underused duty-free zone at Kennedy International Airport, where they could import parts and export assembled products.
More sweeping is the Dinkins proposal to ease rigid laws governing where businesses like supermarkets and large discount stores and industrial concerns like warehouses, electronics assemblers and garment makers can locate. Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, argues that large-scale retailing and light manufacturing would provide tens of thousands of badly needed lower-skilled jobs. By attracting lots of shoppers, large retail stores could also help neighboring small businesses.
 
Bruising Experience In the Permit Maze
 Virtually all entrepreneurs clamor for one-stop shopping for permits. Consider what Abraham Mammen, owner of two Indian restaurants in Jackson Heights, Queens, went through when he bought his second restaurant.
Six months after he bought the restaurant, a Fire Department inspector told him the kitchen exhaust system did not comply with city regulations and fined him $350. Mr. Mammen was shocked. The system had been operating for 10 years and seemed to have all the needed permits.
Mr. Mammen hired an architect to design an exhaust and fire-extinguishing system and to submit the plan to the City Buildings Department. He then hired another specialist to submit a plan to the Fire Department.
Both departments approved the plans. Then the Health Department told him the kitchen layout was wrong. "The Buildings Department doesn't care what the Health Department says and the Health Department doesn't care what the Fire Department says," he said.
In response to such complaints, the Dinkins administration is preparing guides to regulations for specific industries. The next goal is one location to obtain all the needed permits. "We have to make it easier for a person with entrepreneurial drive," said Wallace L. Ford 2d, Commissioner of the Department of Business Services.
While this problem seems within grasp, the same cannot be said of another one: the heavy burden of taxes and fines.
"It's going to be very difficult for any administration in the near future to make substantial cuts in taxes and fines because of the city's budget crisis," said Stanley Schair, partner of a small Manhattan law firm and chairman of the Small Business Committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Indeed, the fiscal problems explain the survival of taxes that everyone agrees are especially harmful to small businesses. These taxes -- the unincorporated business tax, the personal income tax surcharge, the commercial rent tax, the city corporate income tax, and state and city hotel-room taxes that hurt tourism -- generated $2.77 billion in the last fiscal year. Fines brought in $405 million more.
 
Fledgling Company Threatened by Taxes
 But to make ends meet now, the city may be damaging its future by driving out the likes of the Cadus Pharmaceutical Corporation, a biotechnology company in an old printing shop in lower Manhattan. The 13-month-old company, which now has 5,000 square feet of space, needs 18,000 more. Its president, Jeremy M. Levin, wants to stay in New York but is not sure he can.
"Every dollar I spend on taxes is one less spent building our technologies, which will provide the company with a long-term basis for survival," he said.
Cutting taxes and fines would require substantially cutting municipal costs. Even the city's latest fiscal crisis was not severe enough to persuade city unions to improve productivity or the state to assume the city's share of Medicaid and welfare.
Nor is there reason to believe that other proposals -- like transferring to the state or selling city-owned hospitals, prisons and airports, and replacing city employees with private companies in functions like trash collection and school cleaning -- would be any easier to achieve.
"It is one thing to put your finger on what are the best policies when you're not in power," said Matthew P. Drennan, an economist and urban planner at Cornell University. "It is quite another to enact such policies as mayor."
Mr. Rohatyn, who is backing Mr. Dinkins's re-election bid, believes such actions are inevitable. "I just don't believe the status quo is viable because what I see coming down the road in the next two, three or four years," he said, referring to the city's anticipated budget deficits.
New York's government employment of 236,918 is one of the highest relative to its population: more than 32 per 1,000 residents. These figures exclude more than 100,000 employees of agencies like the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Housing Authority and the Transit Authority.
But Mayor Dinkins is not threatening to make deep job cuts, possibly because the city's employees, many of them minorities, are constituents.
Nor is the Mayor, who raised annual taxes by more than $2 billion to cope with the city's fiscal problems, promising deep tax cuts soon. Indeed, he wants to extend the personal-income-tax surcharge that raised the top rate to 4.46 percent from 3.4 percent. It is to expire in December.
"The main point I am going to be making is taxes, taxes, taxes," said City Council President Andrew J. Stein and a Democrat like Mr. Dinkins.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former United States Attorney seeking the Republican nomination, added, "There's no question that the policies and programs have aggressively driven jobs out of New York City by failing to get control of government spending and then having to subsidize government by confiscating increasing amounts of money from the private sector."
 
Debating the Value Of Tax Cuts
 The most extreme proponent of tax cuts is Stephen Kagann, an economist and adviser to Mr. Stein. He calculates that if the city cut taxes by $4 billion over four years, 600,000 private-sector jobs would be created in six years and the city would break even in four years. In the interim, he contends, the city would only have to trim spending by 3 or 4 percent.
But Mr. Sullivan, the former banker Mr. Dinkins recruited last spring as architect of economic strategy, scoffs at this proposal as supply-side absurdity.
Mr. Stein said he also would not take that gamble. Like the other mayoral challengers, he says taxes should be cut in tandem with spending.
Mr. Dinkins has committed himself to freezing property and corporate-income taxes and water and sewer fees. He would have the city exempt 28,000 small businesses from the tax on commercial rents. The administration has also taken steps, and promised many more, to reduce the number of fines on small businesses for minor violations.
But the administration's position is that it cannot cut taxes until the state assumes the city share of Medicaid and welfare and the local economy rebounds. "It would be very helpful for the city and state to gradually reduce the tax burden, but the city will have to participate fully, or even more than fully, in the national recovery to have a chance," Mr. Sullivan said.
Instead, Mr. Dinkins has vowed to streamline the city's web of regulations and make it much easier for businesses to navigate the bureaucracy when seeking service, bidding for contracts or obtaining permits.
His administration has also created some small-business loan programs and set a goal of awarding 23 percent of city contracts to businesses owned by minorities or women. And it has begun to do something about a major problem for small retailers: street vendors.
These steps have heartened some small-business owners, who see Mr. Dinkins as the first mayor in decades who wants to help them.
But many think the Mayor is too timid to take decisive action. "The Mayor has shown good intentions and gestures, but we still need vigorous, courageous leadership," said Sung Soo Kim, co-chairman of the Small Business Congress, a group formed to press City Hall for relief.

Personal Income Tax Surcharge
 
Top rate of 4.46 percent on individual income over $65,000 and joint incomes over $108,000.
 
REVENUE: $405 million in the 1992 fiscal year, which ended on June 30.
 
CRITICISM: Only New York and Washington have a progressive personal income tax. New York's top rate is the highest in the nation. A 1992 study by the Comptroller's Office found that most businesses go where there is no city and no state income tax.
 
City Corporate Income Tax
 
8.85 percent tax on income before deducting compensation to owners and officers.
 
REVENUE: :$1.17 billion in year that ended June 30.
 
CRITICISM: New York is one of few cities to tax corporate incomes. Business owners say it amounts to double taxation of incomes of owners and officers. Corporations in the city also have to pay 11.88 percent state corporate income tax, for state and local income taxes of more than 20 percent.
 
Commercial Rent Tax
 
6 percent on annual rents above $11,000 in Manhattan below 96th Street and on rents above $15,700 elsewhere.
 
REVENUE: $708 million in fiscal '92.
 
CRITICISM: Unique to New York City and raises the already high cost of renting space. Double taxation because rents typically include property taxes.
 
Unincorporated Business Tax
 
4 perent tax on the income of owners or partners.
 
REVENUE: $366 million in fiscal '92.
 
CRITICISM: Results in double taxation of the income of small-business owners who must also pay the city's personal income tax. meaning they have to pay a city tax of as much as 8.86 percent on their incomes.
 
State and City Hotel Taxes
 
4 percent state sales tax, 4.25 percent city sales tax; $2 city occupancy tax; 6 percent city hotel tax; 5 percent state tax on rooms $100 or more.
 
 
REVENUE: $114 million alone from city hotel and occupancy tax on fiscal '92.
 
CRITISICM: New York has the highest tax on hotel rooms in the world. The city Comptroller's Office estimates that these taxes cost the city $1.1 billion in lost convention business in 1988-92.

HEADLINE: CHESTER JOURNAL;
The Fleas That Saved Main Street

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

DATELINE: CHESTER, N.J.

 BODY:
SOMETHING happens here on weekends. No one is sure when it started, exactly. But every Saturday morning, throngs of tourists -- from kissy couples to large, extended family groups -- pour into this pastoral Morris County borough as if the carnival were in town, hanging out all day and staying for dinner. And even more show up on Sunday, when Main Street might as well be Disney World.
Downtown Chester, all four blocks of it, is day-tripper heaven. Tourists trek in throughout the year from all over New Jersey, New York and Connecticut to browse the antique stores and boutiques, experience a meal in the town's landmark inns, marvel at one- and two-story colonial buildings and take in the apple orchards and horse farms along the way. 
 Now that May is here, even more will be coming. It is flea market season here, when 10,000 people cram into the 1.6-square-mile borough (population 1,214) every Sunday for the Chester Lions Club Flea Market.
In fact, the flea market is what most residents, whether in credit or blame, point to for starting the tourist phenomenon in the first place.
"When we started, downtown was mostly boarded up," said John Lefand, a past president of the Lions Club. That started to change, he remembers, when the Lions Club fund-raising market, now 22 years old, started getting word-of-mouth publicity on the regional flea market circuit. Crowds came and specialty stores followed.
But if the flea market quickened downtown's pulse, Main Street returned the favor. The Lions Club market, which was once like a big garage sale, now boasts 250 vendors, selling everything from socks to furniture, on a 12-acre lot not far from the main drag. The Lions Club made more than $90,000 last year by renting space to merchants, and donated it to local and regional charities.
"Our season runs through October 31 and it's a hit every weekend," said Mr. Lefand. "There's a spillover from the market to downtown and downtown to the market."
In a sense, the resurrection of downtown Chester is a familiar story. Similar tales could be told in Woodstock, N.Y., or Frenchtown and Lambertville, N.J., along the Delaware River, or any number of small towns across the country, where the answer to solving the riddle of the shopping mall ("How do you keep residents from abandoning downtown?") was to turn stores into shoppes.
The transformation has made Chester, an old iron-ore mining village that became an affluent rural commuterville, so popular it makes the state tourist guides.
But charm and popularity has a price. The weekend crowds mean that Main Street, which is also Route 24, never gets a traffic break. In fact, on weekends, traffic is worse. Cars that jam the skinny road hem and haw, sizing up the shops from the driver's seat. Parking requires the reflexes of a fighter pilot. And the traffic backups entering and leaving the flea market, off Route 206, can extend for miles.
"For what I do, it's the kind of town you want to be in," said Brian Rizzolo, who opened Aunt Petty Pat's Parlour Antiques and Such 11 years ago, when Main Street's metamorphosis was in progress. But, he added, "I can understand why some people would rather come during the week. I can't say that my most fun time is to walk through large crowds."
And while Chester's stable of stores carry a definite cachet, there is that ever-looming danger, common to all villages with artsy boutiques, that the kitsch will ride in like fleas on a hound.
For residents of the borough, weekends are a time to duck for cover. While a few stores cater to local residents, Taylor's Ice Cream Parlor, Chester Hardware and the bookstores notable among them, Main Street belongs to the tourists. And then, only the hale and hearty.
"I came early this time," said Clara Rosenberg of Morristown, who was visiting Chester on this first flea market day of the year. "But I can already see the cars coming. Yikes."

HEADLINE: Big Aircraft Leaser Races the Clock for Financing

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 2

 BODY:
The GPA Group P.L.C., the aircraft-leasing company that is the largest purchaser of commercial jets, is scrambling to avert a financial crisis that could leave the company crippled and even jeopardize its survival.
Faced with a severe cash squeeze caused by its rapid expansion just as the airline business went into a steep slump, the company is hurrying to complete a deal with its lenders, suppliers and bondholders before it has to make $200 million in debt payments in the next two months. At the same time it is discussing selling a big stake to one or more outside investors, including the General Electric Company of the United States. 
 The negotiations are being watched intently not just by the banks and investors to whom GPA owes $5.5 billion, but also by aircraft manufacturers, which can ill afford the collapse of a leading customer.
 
 
Buying and Leasing
 GPA was built into a huge force in the aviation business over the last two decades by Tony Ryan, its chairman. The company buys planes from manufacturers and then leases them to airlines, which often find it less expensive to lease aircraft than to buy them. GPA sells the planes and the leases in a package to investors, using the proceeds to buy more planes.
But last year, the company's fortunes went into a downward spiral. Airlines, battered by a worldwide recession, needed fewer new planes. And the privately held company's plan to raise $800 million through an initial public stock offering collapsed, leaving it unable to finance its planned aircraft purchases and imperiling its ability to repay its debts.
For now, the company, which is based in Shannon, Ireland, has arranged to cancel or defer much of the $12 billion in aircraft orders it had placed with the Boeing Company of Seattle and the Airbus Industrie consortium of Europe, although it is still locked in a dispute with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation's aircraft unit in Long Beach, Calif.
 
Working With Lenders
 GPA also seems close to agreement with all but a handful of its 138 bank lenders, led by Citibank. Under the proposed deal, people involved in the negotiations said, the banks would defer $1 billion in principal repayments on GPA's $3.3 billion in bank loans until the end of next year and would give back to the company $100 million in principal payments made in recent months, in return for higher interest rates. There also appears to be pressure from some banks for management changes at GPA.
But the company has so far been unsuccessful in its plan to raise $200 million from investors, and without new equity it is unclear whether the banks will agree to the deal.
Before they agree to take a chance on financing a turnaround, potential equity investors, and perhaps the banks as well, appear to be pushing GPA to demand that holders of $2 billion of unsecured high-risk junk bonds pay part of the price for the company's problems.
Last week, GPA hired the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation to advise it on rearranging the bond debt. People involved in the negotiations said GPA was not, as rumored, preparing to ask the bondholders to swap the debt for equity in the company, at least not yet.
 
A Fluid Situation
 Instead, they said, the company appears to be interested in concessions like deferred payment on the bonds. But they added that the situation was changing almost daily and that the banks and potential new equity investors could still force a debt-for-equity swap over the company's objections.
Some analysts said that such a swap, which given the company's weak condition would amount to an admission that the bondholders are unlikely to get their money back, is the only way for GPA to dig itself out of its financial hole.
"Without equitizing a significant portion of the unsecured debt, I believe the company's ability to raise new equity is nil," said Jack Hersch, an analyst at M. J. Whitman in New York, which trades in distressed bank loans and debt securities.
GPA has been trying to raise equity primarily from its existing shareholders, which include banks, other financial institutions and airlines around the world. Its banks had previously made new equity a condition of their debt-rescheduling agreement, but last week GPA said it expected to sign the bank deal before raising new equity.
Although many shareholders have proved reluctant to invest more money in the company, GPA said it was "encouraged by indications received in recent days from some of our major shareholders of their willingness to participate in the capital raising for more than their pro rata share." People involved in the negotiations said that the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, one of several Japanese institutions with stakes in GPA, was among those that had agreed to increase their stake.
GPA has also been looking for new investors and has had discussions with a number of airlines and investment groups, industry executives said. But much of GPA's attention, they said, has been on discussions with General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., which is one of the two leading aircraft-engine manufacturers (the other is the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies). G.E. owned as much as 22 percent of GPA during the 1970's and at one point sought unsuccessfully to acquire the entire company before selling its stake for a large profit.
G.E. subsequently bought a smaller aircraft-leasing business and is considering taking a big stake in GPA, perhaps a majority holding, people involved in the negotiations said. But they cautioned that General Electric remained wary of any deal that would increase its debt level and lower its debt ratings.

HEADLINE: Joan S. Rader, 58, G.O.P. Party Officer And School Trustee

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Joan Sperry Rader, who was active for two decades in the Republican Party in Connecticut, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 58.
The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, William Donald Rader. 
 Mrs. Rader, who had lived in Greenwich since 1965, was a real-estate broker and longtime school trustee. She was elected in 1989 to a two-year term as the vice chairwoman of the Republican State Central Committee of Connecticut, becoming its highest-ranking female officer. She was re-elected to a second, successive term and held the office at the time of her death.
Her many volunteer activities over the years included serving as a trustee of the Eagle Hill School in Greenwich, a private day and boarding school for learning-disabled children and teen-agers.
 
A Brooklyn Native
 Since 1981 she had been a real-estate broker with Douglas, Elliman Pickering Associates in Greenwich.
Mrs. Rader was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Edward G. Sperry, who was for some years president of the Sperry Products Company, which manufactured railroad and subway track-testing equipment and other products in Connecticut and on Long Island, and the former Mary Elizabeth Garvin, who was a company director.
She grew up in Oyster Bay, L.I., and graduated in 1956 from Vassar College, where she majored in economics. In 1958 she married Mr. Rader.
Besides her husband, Mrs. Rader is survived by three daughters, Judith Anne, of Boston, Jennifer Caroline, of Springfield, Ohio, and Elizabeth Rader Edwards of Riverside, Conn.; two sisters, Judith Sperry Beavers of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Joy Sperry Emery of Ballston Lake, N.Y., and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Office Costs Are Faulted

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
International financial institutions must avoid wasteful spending on their offices, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said on Saturday.
His comments were made after the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was widely criticized for spending $80 million on renovations of its offices, which included new furniture and decorative touches in Carrara marble. 
 It is critical that "the international financial institutions exercise prudence in their administrative costs, including salaries, travel, benefits and facilities," Mr. Bentsen told the World Bank and International Monetary Fund Development Committee.
The international financial institutions lend to middle-income and poor nations, with the goal of lifting the standards of living in those countries.
It is important that "taxpayer money is spent wisely, not wastefully, to insure adequate public support," Mr. Bentsen said. He encountered strong criticism of the bank's spending when he asked Congress to approve money needed to meet the United States' share of new financing for the international institutions.

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses Argentina On Patents

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, May 2

 BODY:
Despite Argentina's deep changes in opening markets to foreign competition, selling state companies and stabilizing the economy, the Clinton Administration has notified the Government of Carlos Saul Menem that it has not yet done enough.
The Office of the United States Trade Representative is considering taking the first steps that could eventually lead to trade sanctions against Argentina, if the Government fails to pass a law that protects the patents of American pharmaceutical companies here. 
 Argentine officials are worried about the potential action, saying that any hint of sanctions could send a damaging signal to financial markets and outside investors at a time when the country needs continued investment from abroad for further growth.
 
Making a List
 The American trade officials must decide which countries to single out as those that fail to protect the intellectual property rights of American companies. And Argentina is high on the list of candidates.
"United States companies have suffered significantly in Argentina as a result of lack of patent protection and the United States Congress has made it very clear that we have an obligation to do what is necessary to protect the interests of American companies abroad," said a senior official of the trade office. "I know Ambassador Kantor feels strongly about this," he said, referring to Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative.
The United States pharmaceutical industry contends that it loses up to $200 million a year in Argentina because of pirating of its patents.
The process now under consideration at the trade office with regard to Argentina has become known as the Special 301 review program of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. The law requires that by the end of each April the trade office must publish a list of the countries that it regards as the most abusive in permitting the pirating of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
 
The Ultimate Weapon
 When a country is put on the list, the trade office has a month in which to decide whether to begin a formal investigation. After the investigation is completed, trade sanctions can be placed against the country, the ultimate trade weapon of the executive branch.
American officials say that the other Latin American country with heavy patent stealing by pharmaceutical companies is Brazil. The Brazilian Congress is also debating passage of a patent law, but American trade officials say they have not seen the legislation and they doubt it will provide adequate protection.
Officials of the Clinton Administration say the issue goes beyond the loss of American pharmaceutical profits. They say they may want to use the case of Argentina as an example to other Latin American countries about the cost to a developing country, in terms of lost exports and investor confidence, if it does not respect intellectual property rights.
"United States firms are losing billions every year from a lack of patent protection and this Administration is intent on changing that," the trade official said. "Moreover for countries like Argentina, strict patent laws that stop pirating should actually stimulate intervention and investment there, something those countries say they are interested in."
Ira Shapiro, the general counsel of the United States trade office, testified before Congress that Argentina along with Brazil, India, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan were countries that have made little progress in recent years in passing strong patent controls.
 
Change Is Opposed
 For its part, the Menem Government has been frustrated in getting passage of the patent law, now hung up in Congress. The law faces a powerful Argentine pharmaceutical industry with sales of more than $2 billion that has exerted broad influence on Congress.
Government officials fear that even the hint of possible trade sanctions could cause foreign investors to think twice about investing in Argentina and look elsewhere in Latin America, like Chile.
Multinational drug companies here say the Argentine companies copying their drugs actually charge more for the final product than the multinational manufacturers -- as much as 30 percent, some say. And that represents enormous profits because no research and development costs are involved.
"The original product needs 10 to 12 years of research and hundreds of millions of dollars in costs, and here the imitations only require large sums of money for marketing," said Rafael Alonso, the director of patents for the Argentine Chamber for Specialized Medicines, representing the multinational companies.
Mr. Alonso and others say quality control among Argentine companies is lax, which poses a potential health risk to the public.
 
Charges Are Denied
 Representatives from the national laboratories reject such charges, saying their prices are 8 percent to 9 percent lower.
They say the multinationals were aware the laws were different when they entered the Argentine market. An 1864 law protects the manufacturing process, but not the final product.
"We are not pirates, nor copiers, as we are accused," said Anibal Caprile, president of Cilfa, the group of 17 Argentine companies lobbying against the new law. "We use a different process than the original and arrive at the same final product, and that is permitted by our laws."
Indeed, the debate over pirating American drugs has been an intense issue here for two years. Ambassador Terrence Todman of the United States has taken a highly public stand on getting patent protection legislation passed. President Menem has promised several times to meet a deadline for Congress to pass the law but has repeatedly failed.
 
Stalled in the Legislature
 The bill, which American officials say is a model patent law, is hung up in eight congressional committees. The snag has led Argentine and American officials to doubt that anything will be done. They also warn that if Congress adjourns without passing the bill, under congressional rules it must reintroduce the bill and begin the legislative proceedings anew, a process that could take another two years.
In the past, drugs patented and tested by American companies have been produced and placed on the shelves of Argentine pharmacies by pirating companies here even before the American manufacturer got approval to sell the drug in the United States, American Embassy officials say. Moreover, the pirating by Argentine companies has gotten so sophisticated that one biotechnology company, Bio Sidus, is marketing the cancer drug, interferon B.

HEADLINE: Canada Races to Ratify 3-Nation Trade Pact

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 2

 BODY:
The North American Free Trade Agreement may face opposition in the United States Congress, but Canada is rushing to ratify the monumental pact that would bind 360 million people into a single market.
Having already cleared most of the major legislative hurdles, the Nafta Implementation Act is headed toward a final vote in the House of Commons in mid-May, despite opposition charges that the Government is ramming the bill through and polls showing strong opposition. 
 "As for general participation by the Canadian public, it will be zero," lamented Dave Barrett, trade spokesman for the socialist-oriented New Democratic Party, which contends that an existing five-year-old trade pact between Canada and the United States has caused the loss of thousands of Canadian jobs. The new pact, broadened to include Mexico, would replace the old one.
While polls show that more than half of Canadians remain opposed to the latest agreement, ratification is proceeding without major protests or demonstrations. Five years ago, the opposition to the pact with the United States was so rambunctious that an election had to be fought over the issue.
That experience led many to think that the Government this time would face an almost impossible task of winning approval of the more far-reaching North American accord.
But opinion analysts say that the pact evokes more resignation and fatigue than anger -- in contrast to American attitudes over Mexico's looser anti-pollution enforcement and low wages, which have raised fears of an undermining of American environmental and labor standards.
"Because Mexico is a long way from Canada, worry about eroding standards is just not so prevalent here," Angus Reid, a pollster, said. Canada's trade with Mexico is less than 2 percent of its trade with the United States.
Mr. Reid's polls suggest that opposition to the three-nation agreement, while still robust, especially in labor union circles, is diminishing. In March of last year he found 64 percent of Canadians opposed. By November, when he conducted his latest survey on the accord, naysayers had dropped to 53 percent.
Five years ago the Canadian-American pact stirred relatively little public interest in the United States. Then it was Canadians who fretted about deterioration of their standards from a closer union with the United States.
 
 
'Less Adamant'
 According to Donald J. S. Brean, professor of international economics at the University of Toronto: "It's now accepted that the pro-trade side has won. People remain opposed, but they are less adamant about it."
For the agreement to take effect, negotiations on environmental and labor side accords must still be wrapped up, and the United States Congress and the Mexican Congress still have to ratify it. President Clinton voiced confidence at his news conference on April 23 that the side deals would soon be completed. Negotiators next meet in either Toronto or Ottawa in mid-May.

Bobby Watson Leads His Own Big-Band Revival

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
A year and a half ago, Bobby Watson pulled together some big-band arrangements he had been working on, took them to Columbia University's jazz orchestra and led the orchestra in a surprisingly successful concert. Mr. Watson, known as a saxophonist and composer, had big-band aspirations, not a fruitful thing to have, given jazz's generally enfeebled economic situation. The concert, often brilliant, looked as if it was set to go down in legend, a one-time event making Mr. Watson one of those rare jazz composers lucky enough to hear their music played by a large ensemble, if only for one night. With big bands seemingly relegated to the dustbin of history, the music was destined for the security of Mr. Watson's desk drawer.
But the current jazz renaissance has had all sorts of salutary effects, not the least of which is a flowering, albeit small, of interest in big-band music among both audiences and musicians. Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall both have jazz orchestras; Jimmy Heath and Slide Hampton have started large ensembles recently, and Wynton Marsalis moves closer to fronting a big band every year. Illinois Jacquet's orchestra was one of the highlights of the 1980's, and the American Jazz Orchestra, David Murray's big band and Clifford Jordan's orchestra have all offered exceptional music. Along comes Mr. Watson, who has just released his first album on Columbia Records, "Tailor Made," which happens to be a big-band album. 
 Mr. Watson brought roughly the same band heard on the album into the Village Vanguard for three nights, and on Friday night, for its first show, it played surprisingly fluid music. Over the last 15 years, Mr. Watson has been producing some of jazz's most optimistic compositions, first with Art Blakey and then with a series of his own groups. His pieces resonate with a type of blues sunniness, in which small bits of bitterness make his optimism seem realistic. Small-group arrangements and compositions don't always make an easy transition to large ensembles, but on Friday night, Mr. Watson's pieces metamorphosed into big orchestrations, with the main themes underlined and surrounded with all sorts of asides, punctuations and embellishments.
There was a real ingenuity to the material. The band dropped away occasionally, leaving Mr. Watson and several saxophonists to perform unaccompanied, or he would let the band drift into honking discord, or set up soloists improvising against one another. At times the band drifted into light Latin jazz, which kept it from swinging as hard as it should and accentuated a prettiness that seemed more like Hollywood than New York. But for the most part, Mr. Watson's music maintained his own elemental harmonic personality. And Mr. Watson, his improvisations voluminous and flaunting a ripe and fleshy tone, kept the show tense and exciting.

HEADLINE: The Administration's Trade War

 BODY:
The President calls for raising the tariff on Japanese minivans tenfold; his Treasury Department puts the proposal on indefinite hold. The President promises to hold up the free trade agreement with Mexico until he negotiates stringent conditions on the environment and labor; his chief trade negotiator, Mickey Kantor, goes before Congress to propose tame conditions. The President vows to push the Uruguay Round of international trade talks to conclusion; U.S. negotiators stymie negotiations.
The Clinton Administration is engaged in a trade war -- with itself. 
 One side -- led by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, his chief trade economist, Lawrence Summers, and the White House adviser, Robert Rubin -- fights to preserve the U.S.'s traditional commitment to rules that every country, including the U.S., pledges to follow. Should the U.S. break the rules by, for example, shutting out imports that threaten domestic producers, the Treasury officials fear that other countries will follow suit until trade shrivels and every country suffers.
On the other side are Mr. Kantor and Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers -- backed by Democrats representing industries threatened by foreign imports. They call for a more muscular approach, whereby the U.S. wields its huge market clout to bully partners into granting trade concessions. Ms. Tyson, the more circumspect, calls for "cautious activism" to counter foreign threats to high-tech industries.
But in the hands of politicians like Mr. Kantor, cautious activism easily slides into rank protectionism. Minivans aren't high tech and U.S. manufacturers, accounting for over 90 percent of the market, aren't threatened by foreign competition. All the proposed tariff hike would accomplish is to jack up prices to consumers by thousands of dollars. Apparently Mr. Kantor prefers to reward Chrysler rather than the middle-class families his boss has sworn to defend.
Ms. Tyson and Mr. Kantor are backing other aggressive trade policies. They advocate managed trade, whereby Washington would set numerical targets for, say, exports of auto parts to Japan and retaliate if Japan misses the mark; they also back laws that would allow the U.S. to retaliate against trade practices it unilaterally decides are unfair -- even if such retaliation violates existing trade agreements.
Aggressive retaliation against foreigners who bend the rules isn't new; it's been the policy and practice of every recent Administration. Last week Mr. Kantor broke no rules by threatening to retaliate against Japanese restrictions on U.S. companies bidding for government contracts.
But for the U.S. to bully partners by violating international trade rules is new -- and dangerous. It invites destructive trade wars and taxes consumers in the process. The only people likely to cheer Mr. Kantor are the special interests he would serve and fund raisers at the Democratic National Committee.

HEADLINE: A Breakthrough on Bosnia?

 BODY:
President Clinton's escalation of pressure on the Serbs to make peace in Bosnia appears to be yielding encouraging results. In the most hopeful sign in months, the recalcitrant leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, has signed the international peace plan designed to end fighting in the Balkans.
If the Serbs really mean to halt their genocidal onslaught, this is indeed a diplomatic triumph. Under the peace plan approved yesterday in Greece, the Bosnian Serbs would be forced to yield roughly a third of the territory they have seized and would be denied the corridors they seek to link Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper. 
 Although the plan, named after its crafters, Lord Owen of Britain and Cyrus Vance of the United States, was initially denounced as a sellout that would reward Serbian aggression, in the chaos that is now Bosnia it is beginning to look like the best available life raft.
But the danger remains that Serbian agreement to the plan may be nothing more than a cynical sham to defuse the rising pressures for allied military intervention. That makes it especially important for the Clinton Administration to keep up the diplomatic pressure, as Secretary of State Warren Christopher is now doing by continuing his rounds of European capitals to forge a firm and unified approach.
President Clinton has it just right when he insists that the Serbs must show by deeds, not just by words, that they accept peace. The Serbs must stop their artillery shelling of helpless cities . . . stop ethnic cleansing of Muslims from areas the Serbs have seized . . . stop the flow of arms from Serbia to Bosnia . . . and allow humanitarian relief to reach sick and starving victims.
A large hurdle lies just ahead. The self-styled parliament of the Bosnian Serbs, dominated by hard-liners, is scheduled to vote on the plan on Wednesday. The hard-liners must be left in no doubt whatsoever that if they persist in slaughtering lightly armed opponents and unarmed civilians, the allies will ratchet up the diplomatic and economic pressure and consider again the need for military intervention.
That warning to the hard-liners could be amplified if Secretary Christopher's understandings with European leaders this week are given wide publicity -- to let the Serbs see they will face a determined and unified coalition.
Several factors probably combined to spur Dr. Karadzic to sign the peace document yesterday. His backers in Serbia proper came under increasing pressure as the existing embargo on trade was greatly tightened and Serbian assets were seized abroad. That may have led Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, to urge a cooling off.
President Boris Yeltsin, fresh from a resounding referendum triumph, made it clear that Russia would not ride to the Serbs' rescue, increasing the pressure. And President Clinton let it be known Saturday that he was ready to commit American air power, lift the arms embargo that blocks shipments of guns to the Bosnian Muslims, and possibly help create "safe havens" for the Muslims to protect them from Serbian attack.
The Administration has many tasks remaining. Its goals need to be clearly defined before it commits troops or aircraft, either through military strikes or participation in an international peacekeeping force. And it will need to generate support from Congress and the public for any military commitments. But the hopeful developments this past weekend suggest that the Administration and its allies may finally be on the right path.

HEADLINE: Crucial Support Virtually Assures McCall's Election as Comptroller

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 3

 BODY:
Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, the Legislature's most powerful Democrat, endorsed H. Carl McCall for State Comptroller today, virtually assuring that Mr. McCall will become the first black to hold statewide elective office in New York.
If he is elected by the State Legislature on Wednesday, as is expected, Mr. McCall plans to resign as president of the New York City Board of Education by the end of the week, said his spokesman, Steven Alschuler. 
 Mr. McCall's departure comes as the board also is seeking a new schools chancellor to succeed Joseph A. Fernandez. Mayor David N. Dinkins will appoint a new member to replace Mr. McCall on the seven-member board, but the board, on which the majority has been aligned against Mr. Dinkins and Mr. McCall, will then elect a new president. Other board members, appointed by the borough presidents, said Mr. Dinkins would have a very hard time winning the board presidency for his new appointee. [Page B8.]
Mr. Weprin, who has been under heavy political pressure for weeks about his decision, said today that he selected Mr. McCall, a vice president for state and government relations at Citibank, because of his management skills and because the election of a black comptroller "offers a historic opportunity for New York State."
 
'A Real Responsibility'
 The 57-year-old Mr. McCall, who also has served as state commissioner of human rights, a state senator from Manhattan and part of the United States mission to the United Nations with the rank of ambassador, said he was relieved and honored by Mr. Weprin's decision.
In an interview, he said his selection served as recognition of the contributions made by black Americans since the Revolutionary War. "That recognition has come late, but it has come," he said. "And we have a real responsibility, once put in a position like this for the first time, to be a credit to all of the people who made it possible."
Mr. Weprin said he took into account the preference of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who supported Mr. McCall, and of his Democratic colleagues, who he said were split almost evenly between Mr. McCall and his main opponent, Carol Bellamy, a former City Council president. "My judgment was that Carl McCall by a very narrow margin -- because Carol was very qualified -- would make a better comptroller," Mr. Weprin said at a news conference.
But Bellamy supporters said the Speaker's decision ultimately reflected politics within the Capitol. It was more expedient, they speculated, for him to alienate the Democratic women in the Legislature who supported Ms. Bellamy than to anger the black legislators who backed Mr. McCall.
And they accused him of giving too much weight to Mr. Cuomo's wishes. Ms. Bellamy had made a campaign issue of the relative independence of the two candidates from Mr. Cuomo.
Though disappointed, Bellamy supporters in the Legislature said they would follow Mr. Weprin's lead and help elect Mr. McCall on Wednesday. "There will be no rebellion, but there will be repercussions, I imagine, and a lot of bad feelings," said Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, who like Mr. Weprin is a Queens Democrat. "Is there ever going to be a chance for women to move up or is it always going to be someone else's turn?"
 
A Dramatic Climax
 Mr. Weprin's decision provided a dramatic climax to what had become one of the most peculiar campaigns in New York political history.
It was a race where the electorate consisted not of the state's 9 million voters but of its 211 legislators, and really only the 127 who form the Democratic majority.
The campaign began in February, when Edward V. Regan, a Republican who had been Comptroller since 1979, said he would resign on April 30 to take a job with an economic "think tank." The State Constitution provides for the Legislature, sitting as a whole, to fill the position when a vacancy occurs in the middle of a term.
Because Democrats hold a solid majority, a united Democratic front was assured of electing one of its partisans. But with the Democrats divided between Mr. McCall and Ms. Bellamy, it fell to Mr. Weprin, the leader of 101 of the 127 Democrats, to make a final awkward choice.
The comptroller job, which pays $110,000 a year, is coveted for both professional and political reasons. The comptroller is the sole trustee of the state's $56 billion pension fund, the auditor of state agencies and local governments, and the chief critic of state budgeting and borrowing practices. The position also is one of only six elected statewide offices, including two United States Senate seats, making it a potential springboard to higher office.
With Mr. McCall's election, it will be the first time in at least half a century that all four of Albany's statewide elected officials -- the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller -- will be Democrats, said John A. Marino, the state Democratic chairman.
 
Vote Is Scheduled
 Mr. Weprin and Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, a Democrat who technically serves as the president of the Republican-majority State Senate, scheduled a vote by the Legislature on the interim comptroller for Wednesday at 10:30 A.M.
John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said Senate leaders were still deciding whether to participate in the vote. If they did not, the Republican leaders could either boycott the session but allow Mr. McCall's election to take place or offer a legal challenge to the process.
Ms. Bellamy, who narrowly lost the 1990 general election against Mr. Regan, declined to comment on her previous pledge to challenge Mr. McCall in a 1994 Democratic primary if she did not win the interim appointment.
If elected on Wednesday, Mr. McCall will serve the unexpired portion of Mr. Regan's term and then will run for a full four-year term in 1994. As an incumbent, he would begin with a significant advantage in name recognition and financial support.
But Mr. McCall lost a statewide Democratic primary for lieutenant governor in 1982 to a white candidate. And he would face the challenge of running as a black candidate in a state where no member of a minority group has ever won a statewide general election and where black voters last November comprised only 10 percent of the state total.
This year's race featured a number of conflicting undercurrents, as groups yearning for power struggled for political advantage.
Black legislators and other supporters of Mr. McCall made clear that they considered the election an opportunity for the state's Democratic Party to repay the black community for decades of loyal support. Women felt their time had come after consecutive unsuccessful statewide campaigns by Bella S. Abzug, Elizabeth Holtzman, Ms. Bellamy and Geraldine A. Ferraro.
And in the final hours of the campaign, a number of Puerto Rican lawmakers in the Legislature broke with the state's black legislators, who traditionally have been political allies. After a weekend of negotiations, they threw their support to Ms. Bellamy, at least partly because they perceived that she was more committed to supporting Hispanic candidates in coming citywide elections and to providing state business to Hispanic-owned banks and brokerage houses.
Even though the gambit by the Puerto Rican legislators failed to help Ms. Bellamy, it reinforced the growing sense that there are two distinct minorities in New York politics and that they can no longer be relied on to work in tandem.

HEADLINE: Financing of $31.4 Billion Budget Presented by Dinkins Is Criticized

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins presented a $31.4 billion budget plan yesterday that drew criticism from independent fiscal experts for putting off tough decisions in an election year.
Mr. Dinkins proposed a modest series of cuts, including eliminating the Police Cadet Corps, ending 300 community college classes and slowing reductions in the commercial rent tax. But the core of the plan was his proposal to close a half-billion-dollar budget gap by relying on state and Federal aid that has yet to materialize. 
 The Mayor has been struggling since January to close a $2.1 billion gap between the city's revenues and expenses in the $31.4 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Mr. Dinkins's task became harder in April, when the State Legislature rejected his request for about $660 million in aid, leaving the city with more than a $500 million gap.
The spending plan released yesterday, which represents an $800,000 increase over the current budget, is the fourth Mr. Dinkins has proposed and comes a few months before he faces re-election. It reflects a fiscal situation less dire than what he encountered in his first two budgets, which he put together as the recession took hold. But the Mayor is under more strain than last year, largely because of a major labor settlement, which will cost the city about $400 million, and a drop in property tax revenue of at least $400 million as well.
 
Modest Spending Cuts
 To close the gap without cutting services, Mr. Dinkins said he would rely on a combination of modest spending cuts, a series of one-time revenue strategies, an unusual borrowing scheme, a greater-than-expected surplus from this year's budget and $530 million in state and Federal help, which has yet to materialize.
If the Federal and state aid fails to arrive, Mr. Dinkins threatened to carry out nearly $176 million in additional budget reductions, cutting such politically popular expenditures as city-financed day care, dental work for children, drop-in centers for the homeless and summer school.
The Mayor's plan drew criticism from independent fiscal experts, who said it depended too heavily on one-time revenues like bond refinancings and borrowing against future property tax receipts, which seem intended to tide the city over until after election day. His main rivals in the election -- Rudolph W. Giuliani and City Council President Andrew J. Stein -- said Mr. Dinkins was failing to provide leadership in making tough decisions to get the city's finances in order.
But Mr. Dinkins said his reliance on help from his fellow Democrats, particularly President Clinton and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, did not mean he was avoiding difficult decisions. Beyond election-year politics, he said, there was a basic question of fairness: that based on the state and Federal taxes the city pays, it is shortchanged in terms of state and Federal aid.
"The suggestion that we ought to just fold our tent and not fight is just not in me," Mr. Dinkins said. "We go to the contingencies if we have to, but I'm going to fight like hell in the meantime."
Already in the budget are an additional $128 million in cuts to city agencies that come on top of the $623 million in reductions the Mayor proposed in January.
The new measures include cutting more than 50 positions in the Transportation Department to save $7 million and erasing the Public Service Corps for a saving of $1.4 million. The measures also include a cut of $4.3 million from the maintenance budget for parks and playgrounds.
 
Scaled Back Initiatives
 The Mayor has also scaled back or slowed the pace of some of the popular initiatives that he announced with great fanfare in January. He has proposed delaying by three months the opening of 15 new "beacon" schools that provide social services to save about $2 million. He has also trimmed a proposed exemption from the city's commercial rent tax for 28,000 small businesses. He proposed $30 million worth of exemptions in January and put off granting two-thirds of that yesterday.
The proposed budget would increase the size of the city work force slightly, to 213,968 employees, from the 212,488 in the current year, city officials said. That increase is a result of the hiring of about 1,000 police officers ahead of schedule next spring, and the hiring of 500 environmental protection workers required under Federal clean-water guidelines, officials said.
The Speaker of the Council, Peter F. Vallone, described the Mayor's budget as "politically realistic" and "not totally Alice in Wonderland." He said that he would help Mr. Dinkins lobby for the state and Federal aid but added that there would be tough negotiating over what cuts to make should the aid not come through.
The fiscal experts faulted the Mayor for failing to permanently shrink the size and cost of the government to bring expenditures in line with taxes.
"Its a budget that says we're pulling out all the stops to get through this year," said Charles Brescher of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private budget monitoring group.
 
Call for Structural Changes
 Mr. Brescher said that whoever wins the election in the fall will face huge billion-dollar gaps in future years because Mr. Dinkins has failed to make fundamental changes in the work force. "If you cash in all your one-shots now," he said, "you're postponing the day when you have to make these structural changes."
Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the State Municipal Assistance Corporation, questioned the wisdom of depending on Albany and Washington for more aid to avoid hard decisions.
"Between the actions the city expects the state and the Federal Government to take, there is a considerable amount of money not in place," he said. "The longer you wait to deal with the problem, the more drastic the action that will need to be taken."
The Mayor's political opponents were quick yesterday to try to exploit what they saw as political opportunities in the budget.
"This is one that the Mayor can't escape responsibility for, though I know he will try desperately," Mr. Giuliani, the probable Republican candidate, said. "This deficit is largely due to his failure to manage the city."
Mr. Giuliani said much of the budget gap stemmed from the Mayor's failure to stick to his negotiating position with municipal unions, that he would only grant pay raises financed through increased productivity. Mr. Dinkins ultimately agreed to modest wage hikes that will still cost the city $428 million next year. "The Mayor added 400 million in raises and got nothing back in productivity except promises," he added.
Mr. Stein, who is challenging Mr. Dinkins for the Democratic nomination, echoed the same criticism. "He hasn't changed the fundamental culture of the way the work force functions in New York," he said.
Jeffrey L. Sommer, the deputy director of the State Financial Control Board, said Mr. Dinkins's budget contains more than $675 million in one-time revenues that will not help the city balance its budgets in the future.
Those measures include borrowing $215 million from a bank by using unpaid property taxes as collateral, refinancing of city bonds and stretching out bond payments to save about $214 million, and selling the Off Track Betting Corporation for $55 million.
 
'High Risks'
 "We still see high risks in fiscal year 1994 and the city has not addressed the multibillion dollar problems in fiscal years '95 through '97," he said.
The city benefited from higher income tax revenues than it had projected in January, even though property tax revenues dropped by nearly $400 million, city officials said. Overall taxes will bring in about $114 million more than expected in the current fiscal year and will produce about $90 million more during the next year, officials said.
Mr. Dinkins put in his budget $6.3 million in capital funds and a grant for the New-York Historical Society that, along with an equal amount of state assistance, will breath new life into the organization, which was nearly out of business.
The Mayor's plea for more aid from the state met with carefully hedged support from the Governor and legislative leaders.
Governor Cuomo did not promise to provide the relief from state mandates Mr. Dinkins has asked for, but he did point out that he had already proposed mandate-relief measures that would save much of the $280 million Mr. Dinkins is seeking, including proposals that would have the state gradually assume Medicaid costs.
"I've told the Mayor that all these mandate relief items are worth pursuing," Mr. Cuomo said. "It would be hard to get all the way to $280 million, but it's certainly worth pursuing."
Charles E. Schumer, a Democratic Congressman from Brooklyn, said Mr. Dinkins would face an uphill battle in Washington, where the prevailing wisdom in Congress is that the Federal budget should be cut, not expanded.
"The tone in Washington is unfortunately for more cuts out of the President's budget," he said. "It's going to be tough, but we'll do our best."

HEADLINE: Insurers Are Limiting Sales in Risky Areas

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
A rising number of insurance companies are stopping or limiting the sale of property insurance in coastal areas and other regions prone to natural disasters, actions that are likely to push up prices and force many consumers to turn to Government-sponsored plans for coverage.
The cuts are in response to the worst year of property losses ever for the industry, which continues to face unusually severe losses this year. 
 The American Insurance Services Group, an industry trade organization, announced yesterday that losses in the first quarter of this year, which included coverage of the bombing of the World Trade Center and the blizzard on the East Coast, topped $2.8 billion, up from $810 million for the period a year earlier. Losses for last year, which included Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and the riots in Los Angeles, totaled $23 billion, up from $4.7 billion the year before.
 
Review of Risks
 As a result, the industry is undergoing a thorough re-examination of its risks in future disasters, particularly on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, where building has been heavy the last two decades.
Insurance commissioners in Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York and Texas said that dozens of carriers had decided to stop selling or renewing policies for homes and other property. In Florida, companies are seeking increases in premiums amounting to 40 percent or more.
State Farm, the nation's top home and private property insurer, has also put a limit on policy sales in California, where earthquake and fire risks are high. Some agents also report a reduction in coverage in hail-prone areas of the Farm Belt.
Regulators say the biggest impact will be felt in Florida and Hawaii, where premiums are likely to rise sharply and the availability of private insurance will shrink. Those consumers who are unable to find private insurance will be forced to buy coverage from state-sponsored pools, which often cost far more than the private market, or from Government-sponsored "FAIR (fair access to insurance requirements) plans," which provide basic coverage.
In other states, like New Jersey and Louisiana, insurance commissioners say further cutbacks by insurers could hinder economic activities in shore areas and harm housing industries just starting to recover from a recession. Even with stop-gap government programs, new home buyers and developers might be discouraged by high prices or difficulties in finding coverage.
New Jersey's Insurance Commissioner, Samuel F. Fortunato, recently accused Cigna and the Ohio Casualty Group of Insurance Companies of illegally restricting sales near the New Jersey coast and said he had met with many other companies to discourage them from abandoning coastal areas.
"In my view, a good deal of this is a knee-jerk reaction," Mr. Fortunato said. "We will not tolerate any company turning its back on the Jersey shore."
New York's Insurance Commissioner, Salvatore Curiale, said yesterday that he had been informed by Allstate, Travelers and Geico that they planned to limit coverage on Long Island, which the industry considers particularly vulnerable to hurricanes.
Although Mr. Curiale said he believed other companies would take their place in most areas, homeowners in coastal areas will find much higher premiums or insurance available only from FAIR plans, which provide limited government-sponsored coverage for high-risk areas.
"Long Island is going to be the next place to experience some market- availability problems," said John Snyder, a vice president with A. M. Best, an insurance rating service in Oldwick, N.J. "Along the coast you will have problems locating coverage."
By far, the biggest impact has been in Florida. Allstate Insurance, the second-largest carrier in the state, announced last month that it would refuse to renew policies for 25 percent of its customers, or 300,000 property owners in the state, and that it planned to request rate increases of 40 percent or more. But Allstate is not alone.
Jill Chamberlin, a spokeswoman for the Florida insurance department, said that 36 companies, including State Farm, Prudential and Travelers, have announced that they will either stop writing homeowners and other property coverage in the state or severely restrict it.
She said that in the last 23 years, the insurance industry took in $10.8 billion in premiums in the state, while in several hours of Hurricane Andrew it lost $16 billion.
As a result, Ms. Chamberlin said that some analysts had estimated as many as 500,000 customers would be unable to find insurance from private carriers and would be forced to buy coverage from a newly established Joint Underwriting Association. The association will offer at least minimum coverage but at a cost 25 percent higher than the already rising standard market.
One problem for the association, Ms. Chamberlin added, is that the association has no funds of its own other than premiums paid in. If another big hurricane or large disaster should strike, the remaining insurers would have to pay claims, a process that many companies could not afford.
"We are looking at the urgent need for responsible companies to get their risk exposure under control," said Tom Gallagher, Florida's Insurance Commissioner. "But we won't let it become a license to take advantage of the citizens."
In Hawaii, where Hurricane Iniki caused more than $1.5 billion of damage, the insurance department estimates that more than 70,000 of the 218,000 homeowners policies in the state will not be renewed. Companies like State Farm and Transamericaearlier this year put restrictions on available coverage.
Sharp cutbacks in the availability of property insurance is also being felt in southern and central Louisiana, where Allstate, State Farm, and other companies with more than 50 percent of the market are curtailing sales, said James H. Brown, the state's Insurance Commissioner.
Mr. Brown said he expected that as many as 50,000 homeowners may have difficulty finding coverage in the private market and those forced into the state's Joint Underwriting Association will be hit with 15 to 20 percent increases in premiums.
State Farm has also announced that it will limit the sale of new policies in Texas, where the company has a 32 percent share of the market, and in California, where many insurers believe they are overexposed to risks after the 1989 earthquake and the Oakland fire of 1991.
Mr. Snyder of A. M. Best said he expected some restrictions of coverage in Kansas, where losses to hail were severe in recent years.
In a news conference yesterday, Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, and Robert Hunter, the president of the National Insurance Consumers Organization, said the industry is using last year's losses as an excuse to raise prices unfairly. With assets of more than $160 billion, they said, the industry is in a position to sell more than $10 billion more property insurance across the nation.
But spokesmen for the industry and a number of industry analysts disagreed, saying the industry's failure was overselling in the past and not paying enough attention to future risks.

 Over the last several years, the property-casualty insurance industry's overall profitability wasbelow that of most other American industries, though insurershave benefited from big gains in their investment portfolios as stocks and bonds rose sharply in the 1980's and early 1990's.
But, industry analysts say, when investment gains are excluded, the industry fared poorly on its basic insurance business.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Worried by U.S. Criticism Of Curbs on Construction Bidding

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 3

 BODY:
For months, the Government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has been trying to end the stream of embarrassing revelations about millions of dollars in illegal donations to prominent politicians, mostly in return for multibillion-dollar construction contracts.
Now, just as the scandals were beginning to die down, the Government is threatened with a new and unwelcome set of investigations, this time from the Clinton Administration. 
 Last Friday, in the latest challenge to Japan on trade, the United States threatened to impose sanctions against Tokyo if negotiations did not increase American access to the construction market within 60 days.
The Administration action revived one of the most contentious issues in the countries' trade relations: Washington's accusation that bid-rigging and political connections keep Japan's huge public-works contracts out of the hands of American companies.
 
Another U.S. Complaint
 The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said Friday that despite a 1988 agreement to let American companies bid on some projects, the market has remained fundamentally closed. His statement was one of the angriest challenges to Japan since the new Administration took office.
In Tokyo, however, Japanese officials seem less concerned about the American demands than with the prospect that they will direct new attention to the bribery scandals.
Japanese commentators concede that the bribery revelations of the last few months clearly gave Washington the ammunition it needed.
And for the first time, many commentators are drawing a strong link between the corruption at home and the foreign complaints that Japanese markets often exclude outsiders.
Government officials denounced Washington's threat of unilateral action. The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Masamichi Hanabusa, said, "The Japanese construction market is institutionally nondiscriminatory and open."
Prime Minister Miyazawa said the threats did not reflect the 1988 agreement because the Clinton Administration "was apparently not informed by the previous Administration of the contents so far agreed upon in negotiations between the two countries."
But even critics of Mr. Kantor made no effort to argue that public-works projects are allocated on merit.
"To our regret, there are various areas in which Japan must improve," Yomiuri Shimbun, a major daily with strong ties to the ruling party, said in an editorial on Sunday. "The current system is a hotbed of bid-rigging and cozy relations among politicians, bureaucrats and members of the construction industry," the paper said, adding, "The system is a strong barrier to foreign companies."
Since the 1988 agreement, United States companies have won a few contracts.
But in supporting Mr. Kantor's action last week, the United States Commerce Department maintained that progress has been poor, saying American companies had won only $189 million of the $700 billion Japanese market for public- and private-sector construction last year, while Japanese companies had won $1.5 billion of the $425 billion United States market.
 
The Files of a Power Broker
 In response, Japanese officials say American companies would have won more contracts if more of them had opened offices in Japan. Americans say, however, that with so little business available to them, it makes no sense to invest in expensive office space in Japan.
Ever since the arrest two months ago of Shin Kanemaru, 78, once the power broker of the Liberal Democratic Party, newspapers have been full of disclosures of how one major Government project or another was awarded under suspicious circumstances.
Construction concerns are believed to have been the biggest source of the $50 million in financial certificates, cash and gold bars found in Mr. Kanemaru's offices. He has since been released from jail and is awaiting trial on tax-evasion charges.
Japanese officials are loath to concede any link between the bid-rigging disclosed in Mr. Kanemaru's case and others, and Washington's contention that the system is rigged.
In fact, as many lesser players in the industry are quick to note, the system is rigged against all outsiders.
Prime Minister Miyazawa has so far said almost nothing about the scandals, and instead has promised reforms that would make it far more difficult for companies to influence politics.
But little progress has been made so far, and the reform proposal, critics say, is full of loopholes. For example, companies would still be allowed to classify millions of dollars of expenses as "unexplained costs."
Though companies must pay a stiff tax on such amounts (legitimate expenses are generally exempt from taxes), the category permits them to funnel kickbacks to politicians with little fear they will be traced.

HEADLINE: The Hotel Industry Is Roiled By Frequent-Guest Awards

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
A donnybrook between the giant Marriott Corporation and Hilton Hotels is riling the hotel industry. And as the invective has intensified, the Hyatt Hotels Corporation has cautiously sided with Hilton while Holiday Inn has come down equally gingerly on the side of Marriott.
"But mostly it's been kind of fun just sitting back watching our competitive brethren go at one another," Ken Pierce, a vice president of Holiday Inn, said. 
 Outwardly the fighting is over the value of a new Marriott awards program for guests, allowing frequent-flier miles on six airlines even without flying on them. But industry officials say the bad blood, or at least the willingness to spill it in public, is symptomatic of the struggle for dominance in the hard-hit hospitality industry, which is trying to attract business customers with perks for frequent travelers.
The traveler is the key to the value of the perks the different chains offer. With its bonus frequent-flier miles Marriott offers more miles -- generally the preferred perk -- than most competitors right now; alternatively, guests can choose hotel points redeemable in hotel stays, merchandise or travel once enough points are accumulated. In contrast, Hilton offers mileage on the top three airlines -- American, United and Delta -- plus points. The Hilton program is especially generous for couples.
After a building binge in the 1980's, the hotel industry has lost billions of dollars in recent years from overcapacity and a weak economy, both of which have depressed room rates. Now, foreseeing improved industry fortunes by 1994, the major chains are waging a bare-knuckled battle for customer loyalty.
"The whole point of these marketing programs is to boost a hotel company's name, particularly among business travelers, and boost demand," Margo Vignola, the lodging analyst at Salomon Brothers, said. "While there's a budding recovery under way in the industry, the full-service hotels, which cater to business travel, remain soft."
Ms. Vignola does not foresee an industrywide escalation of the incentive programs as long as the economy improves. "But if the recovery falls flat, you'll probably see them raise the stakes," she said.
Incentive programs, giving customers frequent-flier miles or free rooms, cost hotel companies $8 to $10 a guest. During good economic times, hoteliers say those programs pay for themselves by generating new business. But during economic slowdowns, the programs often wind up trying to take business from competitors. It is the fear of that happening, analysts say, that has helped intensify the current feud.
"I don't remember these kinds of public feuds in the past," said Mark Lomanno, research manager for Smith Travel Research in Gallatin, Tenn., which compiles statistics for the American Hotel and Motel Association. While hoteliers may trade private potshots, and chains often denigrate competitors in advertisements that are only slightly veiled, others agreed that they cannot remember any such squabble involving so many industry leaders.
What ignited the fight was Marriott's announcement in mid-April that beginning last Saturday guests at its 250 hotels worldwide could earn frequent-flier mileage on any of six participating airlines. Because travelers need not fly to receive the miles, and because there is no limit on the mileage that may be earned, Marriott called the program "precedent setting."
 
 
'Same Old Stuff'
 On the very day of Marriott's announcement Hilton blasted the program as "the same old stuff in a new package," and it has kept up its barrage of public criticism.
"The Marriott program is nothing more than a guise," said Michael Ribero, senior vice president of marketing for Hilton, in an interview. "We think the consumer is being deceived."
Marc Yanofsky, Hyatt's senior vice president of marketing, said in a similar vein, "It's clear that Marriott is scrambling eggs, hoping the consumer thinks the smaller omelet looks more appetizing."
Marriott has responded in kind.
"If you've spent as much time flat on the mat as Hilton and Hyatt," said Ralph Giannola, Marriott's vice president of marketing, "you'll say anything not to take another beating."
Joe Brancatelli, executive director of Frequent Flyer magazine, tends to agree with Mr. Giannola. "By Hilton and Hyatt going ballistic," he said, "this indicates to me they have been caught flat-footed."
 
 
Bondholders' Lawsuit
 Marriott, which faces a bondholders' lawsuit to prevent it from restructuring into two companies, is generally regarded as the industry pacesetter in combined size and innovation. It has some 750 properties worldwide, but its mileage program applies only to its 250 full-service hotels and resorts in the industry category known as upscale -- just below luxury and ahead of basic, economy and budget.
Hilton has 240 hotels and resorts worldwide, Hyatt has 165, almost two-thirds of them in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Holiday Inn, whose growing top-of-the-line properties compete in the luxury market with the three other chains, has 1,700 properties worldwide.
While all four chains enjoy occupancy rates above the industry average of 62.8 percent for upscale hotels, according to analysts, all are suffering from room rates that averaged only $66.60 for the upscale hotel sector last year -- well below what is required to service their debt, much less turn a profit.
Marriott's Honored Guest Awards is also the industry's biggest "frequent stay" program, with more than five million members. Holiday Inn's Priority Club program has three million members, while the Hilton HHonors program claims three million and Hyatt's Gold Passport more than two million.
At one time, Marriott offered both points and frequent-flier miles on participating airlines -- a benefit the industry terms "double dipping." But almost two years ago it required guests to choose between them.
Under the Marriott Miles program that went into effect Saturday, guests receive -- in addition to 500 frequent-flier miles for each stay -- an additional 2,500 bonus miles after every fifth stay.
Marriott did away with double-dipping, Mr. Giannola said, because its research showed that it was not necessary to offer both to attract frequent business travelers. And the difference between Marriott's program and those of Hilton and Hyatt is, he said: "Their philosophy is you can have a little bit of points and a little bit of mileage. We're saying you can have a lot of points or a lot of miles."
The participating airlines are American, British Airways, Continental, Northwest, T.W.A. and USAir. Continental's frequent-fliers earn 1,000 miles for each Marriott stay and 5,000 bonus miles after five stays, while T.W.A. frequent-fliers earn 1,000 miles for every stay at a Marriott outside the United States and 2,500 bonus miles.
Mr. Brancatelli of Frequent Flyer said that 73 percent of the magazine's readers prefer miles to frequent-stay programs, and that by trumpeting its miles program, Marriott is tacitly acknowledging as much. "This is a perception game," he said. The fact is that right now the two most important stay programs in the industry are Marriott's Honored Guest and Marriott Miles."
But that is not the way the competitors tell it.
 
 
'Credibility Problems'
 "What Marriott has done is cut its program benefits by precluding members from double-dipping," Mr. Ribero of Hilton said. "It's a cost-saving initiative that's being packaged to minimize consumer backlash."
He added: "The whole frequent- travel marketplace sometimes suffers from credibility problems with the fine print, and Marriott is adding to this problem. When consumers realize what they've been taken in by, it's going to give the entire industry a black eye."
What has most ruffled the feathers of other hotel chains is Marriott's claim that its program is unique.
ITT Sheraton, for example, has proclaimed in newspaper ads that it has been offering frequent travelers a choice of points or mileage for years at each of its more than 300 properties in North America.
Inter-Continental Hotels -- with only 10 hotels in North America but 98 more around the world -- offers frequent-flier mileage on American, United and six foreign carriers.
"Not only is it not necessary to have flown on any carrier to claim mileage," said Charles Brownfield, an Inter-Continental vice president, "we offer 500 miles for each night, not 500 miles a stay."
Hyatt offers frequent-guest points for every dollar spent, and 500 miles on United, USAir, Delta, Northwest or Alaska Air. But to qualify for miles, except on United, it is necessary to have flown one of the participating carriers.
Hilton also offers double-dipping. "If we matched the Marriott program," Mr. Ribero said, "we'd actually be taking away some of the benefits we offer our guests."
Those benefits include points for each dollar spent, as well as 500 miles on American, America West, United, Air Canada or USAir, or 1,000 miles on Delta. Only USAir and Delta require that guests fly on their airlines to be awarded the miles.
Hilton and Hyatt claim that Marriott is actually trying to reduce the cost of its awards program, which they portray as troubled.
"They have a huge liability because their program is very big, unwieldy and costly," Mr. Ribero said. "So they have had to do some kind of cost containment, and they're making it look like it's a tremendous benefit."
Hyatt's Mr. Yanofsky said, "If you borrow from the future to pay for the present," alluding to the widespread perception that Marriott's frequent-guest program was overly generous in years past, "the future ultimately arrives."
Mr. Giannola of Marriott scoffs at assertions that its awards program is in trouble. "If we were, we wouldn't be looking to expand its scope this way," he said, "because buying airline miles is not the inexpensive route to the frequent traveler's heart. But we can do it cost effectively."

HEADLINE: Islam in New York: Growing Presence of Diverse Peoples United by Faith

 BODY:
To get an idea of who New York City's Muslims are, stand outside the Islamic Center of New York, the city's most prominent mosque, on Third Avenue at 96th Street in Manhattan.
On a recent religious holiday, through its doors came Pakistanis in flowing pastel gowns, black Americans wearing kente-cloth hats, an Albanian couple trying to quiet their crying daughter, West Africans in high head wraps, Bahrainis in business suits, Egyptian cab drivers, Yemeni restaurateurs, a young Bosnian who stood up in mid-service and gave an emotional appeal for his countrymen. 
 The city has about 70 mosques, nearly twice as many as a decade ago, said Dawud Assad, associate director of the Muslim World League in New York City and president of the city's Council of Mosques. He said it was difficult to say how many Muslims there were in the city, but he estimated 800,000, up from about 680,000 a decade ago.
The Muslim population has also become more diverse by race and nationality as more and more immigrants have arrived seeking political or economic refuge.
"New York has the most cosmopolitan Islamic community in America," said Marc Ferris, who did research on Islam in New York for a coming book on Muslim communities in the United States. "To say a mosque is Pakistani or Guyanese just means they started it. Once it is open, everyone just comes on by."
 
Schools for the Faithful
 Roughly half of the city's Muslims are recent immigrants, and about half of them are South Asian, Mr. Assad said. Arabs make up the second-largest group.
New York Muslims have founded about 10 schools, most teaching through the eighth grade but some continuing through high school. The schools are scattered throughout the city, with a concentration in Jamaica, Queens, where many Asian and black American Muslims live.
Financed with donations and tuition, the schools combine standard school subjects with study of the Koran, Islamic history, Arabic and other religious topics. Lessons are scheduled around the daily prayers.
On religious holidays and on Fridays, the Muslim holy day, a mosque is usually packed with worshipers of various nationalities who may live or work in the neighborhood and go to the mosque because it is most convenient. But most other times the mosque reflects a particular Islamic ethnic group, serving as a place where congregants can speak their common native language, give money and gifts to those headed back to the homeland, exchange job information and gossip about local politics.
The mosques range from lavish Ottoman-style buildings to basements of car-service garages. In downtown Brooklyn, the Islamic Mission of America is the cornerstone of the Arab district on Atlantic Avenue, where Arab restaurants, bakeries and cafes give the area the feel of downtown Cairo. Founded in 1939 by a Moroccan immigrant, the mosque is among the oldest and most prominent in New York.
 
A Surge From Europe
 Perhaps 20 percent of recent Muslim immigrants to New York are from Eastern European countries like Albania, the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia.
Albanian Muslims, who have tended to settle in Flatbush in Brooklyn, account for one of the biggest surges. Many live near the Albanian American Islamic Center for New York and New Jersey, where Imam Isa Hoxha oversees Friday prayers -- in both Arabic and Albanian -- for about 300 people each week.
By some estimates, at least 100,000 Asian Muslims live in the area, most from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan but many also from Malaysia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. They live mostly in Queens, especially Flushing, where the Muslim Center of New York has expanded from a single apartment in 1975 to a large building now under construction.
Pakistani immigrants are by far the most active group in spreading the word of Islam and building Islamic institutions in the New York area, Mr. Ferris said. In 1983, they built the Islamic Center of Corona in Queens, the city's first mosque to be built as such. Before then, mosques were mainly established in abandoned buildings, storefronts and basements, where many still are.
Pakistanis are also behind a most American way of transmitting the holy word: bumper stickers that read "I <heart> al-Islam." They are not shy about ferreting out and calling up lapsed Muslims on Fridays to nudge them to prayers.
"Every since the 50's, the Pakistanis have done the most to promote Islam in New York," Mr. Ferris said. "The reason they work so well here is because they often speak English and keep a high profile. Some go door to door just like Jehovah's Witnesses."
 
Bound by Need
 In 1913, long before Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X popularized the Nation of Islam, Noble Drew Ali started the Moorish Science Temple in Newark. Today there is a large concentration of black American Muslims in the New York area, many of them in Harlem, Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant.
A few scattered storefront mosques attract fundamentalists, who draw inspiration from the visions of outspoken imams like Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who for years has called for the overthrow of the Egyptian Government.
The area's Muslim community is often bound more by necessity than by love. Muslims are a minority, and suspicion and hostility often surround them.
"Even Shiites and Sunnis go to the same mosques in New York," Mr. Ferris said, referring to the two major Islamic sects, which often feud. "Some say religion is the most tenuous of threads, but Muslims really stick together."

HEADLINE: WEST OFFERS PLAN TO CLEAN UP EAST

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUCERNE, Switzerland, April 30

 BODY:
After more than three years of hand wringing over the environmental disasters left by Communism, the rich nations of the West have adopted a common strategy to help clean up in Central and Eastern Europe.
A plan adopted on Friday by nearly 50 environment ministers from virtually all of Europe, the United States, Canada and Japan identifies the most urgent targets and lists projects deemed most manageable in the former East bloc, including western Russia. 
 The plan, called the Environmental Action Program, says air pollution is the most serious health hazard in the region, where lead, sulfur and soot have already affected the population. Second, it calls for improving and protecting drinking water, which is often laced with heavy metals or toxic chemicals. A third priority, it says, is to stop damaging nature in ways that may be irreversible.
 
What the Plan Leaves Out
 Experts involved in drawing up the accord said it was also noteworthy for what it left out, like projects on the wish lists of Eastern governments and Western environmentalists that could cost billions to carry out. Cleaning up rivers and toxic dumps, removing hazardous waste or decontaminating former military sites, the plan says, have no priority, given the limited money available in the West.
The program, prepared by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development after discussion with all the governments involved, is likely to be used as a blueprint for environmental action in the East in the coming years. Experts say that while the program is not binding on any country, it will influence how Western donors lend and spend their money.
"It's a game plan and it says: It will be a lot easier to get money from us if you do the following," an American expert said.
While the program is the firmest commitment yet from the West that it will help clean up, diplomats said it also includes the bluntest message to date that the West does not intend to pay for redressing most of the environmental havoc caused under Communism.
Resources for the environment "will be severely constrained over the next 5 to 10 years" while costs will be very high, the plan says.
 
$30 Million Is Pledged
 An author of the plan said: "You'll see projects to clean air and drinking water. But there won't be a lot of talk about digging up waste; it will just have to stay there."
The idea is that the program will not have its own funds but will have the ability to generate loans and grants, some of which are held up in Western banks or government aid budgets because of what has been described as a shortage of data or skilled staff in the East. At the three-day conference here, Western governments pledged a total of $30 million, including $10 million from the United States, to pay for technical preparation needed to get loans and projects under way.
"We think the plan is very good," said Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. "It gives us concrete proposals and practical solutions."
It also places much of the onus on governments in the East. They would be required to take steps that also make economic sense, like reducing waste of energy and water, improving maintenance and monitoring new waste, the plan says, stressing that small investments in conservation can have major environmental benefits.
The main emphasis of the plan is to think small. Inexpensive solutions like new filters, storage tanks and switching from coal to gas, it says, "can be more appropriate than massive programs, most of which will have a relatively low benefit-to-cost ratio."
 
A Message to Industry
 A World Bank official said: "This is as much a message to Western industry, which has been pressuring to sell their new and expensive clean-up technology in the East. They have to understand that they cannot just come and duplicate those mega-sales in the East."
Among the targets indentified as the most urgent in the program are Czech and Polish lignite-fired power plants, where the reduction of sulfur emissions to Western European standards would cost a fortune, said Kurt Lietzmann of the German Environment Ministry. But he said the plants' toxic sulfur dioxide could be cut by almost one-third by adjusting temperatures, repairing pipelines and installing filters, instead of building huge desulfuring plants.
At the three-day conference here, environment ministers from Russia, Slovakia and other nations said that environmental issues, for all their gravity, had moved far down on domestic agendas because of the immediate problems of jobs, food and financing.
While delegates from East and West said they welcomed the new program, disenchantment on both sides was much in evidence in the corridors. Western experts complained that work in the East was uncommonly difficult because of the constant turnover of ministerial staff and the shortage of basic skills that prevent the monitoring of current Western-financed projects, let alone the start of new ones.
Delegates from the former Communist countries complained that the West had been long on promises and short on providing money.

Companies that work for other companies are getting popular

BYLINE: By Robert Hurtado

 BODY:
WALL STREET is taking a shine to companies that take care of business for other companies.
Known as outsourcers, these specialty companies perform specific services or manufacturing tasks under long-term contracts with corporations, which once handled the tasks themselves. The use of these companies for everything from medical care to computer software gained momentum during the recession and now is a permanent part of the landscape, since the idea is to increase the operating efficiencies of large corporations. 
 "As Corporate America continues to downsize, its reliance on specialty outsourcers should continued to grow," said Alison Bisno, director of research for Stephens Inc., a brokerage firm based in Little Rock, Ark. "Why add to overhead costs when you can farm out the job and save on the expense of machinery, benefits for employees and production capacity?"
Professional investors suggest looking for companies that dominate a market niche. "Lock your sights onto those outsourcers with a strong market position in a growing industry and chances are good you have picked a winner," Ms. Bisno said.
Hospitals are a major business for these companies. Coastal Healthcare Group Inc. of Durham, N.C., has contracts with hospitals to supply physicians for emergency treatment in obstetrics, anesthesia, gynecology and pediatric services.
Earlier this year, Coastal bolstered its position as the largest publicly traded "pure play" in physician outsourcing by acquiring the Medicus Medical Group in Oakland, Calif.
John Runningen, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta, estimates that Coastal will earn $1.05 a share in 1993, up from 85 cents last year. Its stock closed yesterday at $19.375, up 37.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
Mounting political pressure on health-care companies to control costs is expected to benefit companies like the Healthcare Services Group, the country's largest provider of housekeeping and laundry services for nursing homes and retirement centers.
The Huntington Valley, Pa., company recently reported 1992 earnings of 61 cents a share in contrast to a loss in 1991. Keith Mullins, a special-situations analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, expects a gain to 85 cents a share in 1993 and to $1.05 in 1994. The shares closed yesterday at $10.25, up 25 cents, on Nasdaq.
Among the beneficiaries of the trend to contracting for services in manufacturing are the RCL Acquisition Corporation of New York, which recently agreed to merge with the HRM Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Hauppauge Record Manufacturing Ltd. on Long Island. HRM is the country's largest duplicator of audio and videocassette tapes and has major music companies like Elektra, RCA and Polygram as its clients. The company is also planning to enter the market for compact disk duplication.
Pro forma financial results for RCL, including HRM, for fiscal 1992 ended last July 31 show earnings of 29 cents a share. Thomas Heysek, an analyst with RAS Securities, estimates the company will earn 60 cents a share in 1993. RCL shares closed yesterday on Nasdaq at 523/32 , up 5/32 .
Large software developers like the Microsoft Corporation and the Aldus Corporation rely on the Prism Group of Woodenville, Wash., to fulfill production orders for computer software disks. Prism is able to mass-produce the disks, print the packaging material and ship directly to a software publisher's customers. Prism is expected to grow quickly and emerge as a leader in the disk-duplication industry, some analysts say. They expect it to earn 80 cents to $1 a share by 1995, up from 5 cents in 1992. Prism shares closed at $3.625, off 12.5 cents, yesterday on Nasdaq.

HEADLINE: April Purchasing Data Show Weaker Economy

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A dearth of new orders seems to have brought the nation's manufacturing growth to a standstill in April, dashing hopes for a quick rebound from last quarter's slower economic growth.
The closely watched purchasing managers' index, which provides a first look at the economy's performance in the previous month, fell to 49.7, its lowest level since September, from 53.4 in March. 
 The purchasing managers' survey of 300 executives, released yesterday, suggests that the economy kept slowing weeks after blizzards and floods in March, and that manufacturing may even have contracted a bit in April. Technically speaking, a reading below 50 indicates that manufacturing is shrinking and a reading below 45 suggests that the entire economy is doing so.
"The economy has been on a slowing track since February," said Robert J. Bretz of Pitney Bowes Inc., the chairman of the National Association of Purchasing Management's business survey committee. "And the weather can be used to explain only part of it."
Manufacturers also cut employment last month, according to the survey.
"We feel we're in a period of stagnation," said F. Kenneth Iverson, chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, a steel producer based in Charlotte, N.C.
Clinton Administration officials used this new evidence of weakness to promote its plans to stimulate the economy. "This can only raise the likelihood that the Administration will produce a new stimulus package and that the American people will support it," said a high-level Administration economist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his appointment has not yet been confirmed.
But some executives -- including several who said they had voted for President Clinton -- said the real trouble with the economy was a growing lack of faith among business people in the Administration's economic policy, as well as sheer uncertainty over how the policy would evolve.
"The reason you have a slow recovery is a lack of business confidence," said George Hatsopoulos, chief executive of the Thermo Electron Corporation, a Waltham, Mass., maker of pollution-control equipment. "Business is very worried about another hit of government spending."
Mitchell S. Fromstein, chief executive of Manpower Inc., the country's largest temporary-help concern, agreed, saying there was "a crisis of confidence."
"There's a very uneasy sense that business is going to be expected to pay the cost of the Clinton Administration's new agenda," he said.
Virtually every important indicator of manufacturing activity covered by the purchasing managers' survey was down. More companies reported production declines. The growth of new orders stalled and factories' order backlogs -- a harbinger of production to come -- stopped expanding as they had in previous months. Manufacturing employment continued to shrink.
These are all signs that the huge inventory growth in stores in the last quarter, a result of consumer anxiety and bad weather, was rippling through to industry.
"It's very clear evidence that the manufacturing sector didn't catch on to theslowdown early enough and was continuing to produce as if the strong upturn were going to continue through the first quarter," said Kermit Baker, chief economist at Cahners Economics. "It will take a couple of months for the economy to catch up with their production levels."
 
Rebound in Export Orders
 One high note in the otherwise downbeat report: Export orders, which took a nose dive in March, bounced back strongly. More than three-fourths of the companies in the survey say they sell their products overseas.
But other signals that usually indicate a pickup in manufacturing activity -- firmer factory prices and longer delivery times -- actually reflected a temporary shortage of steel.
"The increase in steel orders is really due to some increase in car sales and production," Mr. Iverson said. "The other is the anticipation of higher tariffs." The Clinton Administration recently raised tariffs on imported steel.
Economists and executives say that the April report on manufacturing probably suggests a lull, not the beginning of a downward spiral. This stop-go pattern has already been repeated several times since the economic recovery began nearly two years ago.
 
Echoes of September
 In September, for example, the purchasing managers' index also fell below 50 percent as factories pulled back for a couple of months, waiting for customers to use up inventories before they began to reorder again. Once that happened, activity picked up again.
"The manufacturing sector, as it has tended to over the course of this recovery, got out ahead of the rest of the economy," Mr. Baker of Cahners said. "Every time there's some glint of hope, they start cranking up production, then they see that demand isn't as strong as they thought and that's the triple, quadruple dip."
But a Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence Lindsey, warned about making too much of a single month's numbers. "I'd rather wait for a trend to develop," he said.
"You get little bunches of pluses and minuses," he added. "We had terrible weather. Lots of reasons to be suspicious about March and April data. I expect a little bunch of positives to come soon."

Slippage in Building
 WASHINGTON, May 3 (AP) -- The East Coast blizzard slowed construction spending in March, the Government reported today.
Spending for residential, nonresidential and government building slipped eight-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $442.7 billion, the Commerce Department said. This was the first drop since spending fell 1.4 percent in August.
Despite the harsh winter, spending in March was 5 percent above that of a year earlier. And the Commerce Department said spending in both January and February, also slowed by winter storms, was better than first thought.
The agency revised the January figure to an increase of three-tenths of a percent, rather than the 1.3 percent drop originally estimated, and said spending in February rose 1.2 percent, rather than the one-tenth of a percent it reported last month.

HEADLINE: College's Ties to Church Group Challenged

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., May 3

 BODY:
Opponents of the University of Bridgeport's affiliation with a group sponsored by the Unification Church filed suit today, challenging the agreement.
The suit contends that the agreement with the Unification Church group, the Professors World Peace Academy, violates the private university's charter and state laws governing nonprofit institutions. 
 It also contends that the State Board of Governors of Higher Education, in renewing the accreditation of the financially troubled university, exceeded its authority by accepting the academy's role. The academy, financed by the Unification Church, pledged $50 million in aid in return for the right to select up to 60 percent of the university's trustees.
"As a result, a cult now controls a university in the largest city in Connecticut," said Michael A. Stratton, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs. "It is not only illegal and against public policy, it is just plain wrong."
The chairman of the university's trustees, Colin Gunn, responded that the complaint "represents nothing more than a rehash of matters that have already been considered at length by the Board of Governors of Higher Education."
The suit, he said, is "merely another attempt to hamper and harass the university."
The university's administration and trustees have been the focus of protests by professors, employees and former students ever since they began considering an affiliation with the Professors World Peace Academy as a way of resolving a financial crisis at the university.

HEADLINE: Late Rally Produces Solid Gains for Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market snapped to attention on a broad front yesterday, after a morning session muffled by a weak April report from the nation's purchasing managers, data that are thought to be a harbinger of the economy.
Money swerved from the bond market to stocks in the late afternoon, when bonds became more expensive on buying attributed in part to the expectation that the economy would remain sluggish and restrain interest rates. In generally light trading, all major stock indexes closed up solidly. 
 Yesterday's trading was something of a reverse image of Friday's trading, when bond prices plunged in thin trading, luring some money from stocks and causing a 20-point rally in the Dow to fizzle.
 
Final Surge
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.91 points yesterday, to 3446.46, with all of the gain coming in the last hour of trading. The New York Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.08 point, to 244.54, but trading volume was relatively low at 225 million shares, compared with 247.5 million shares on Friday. Gaining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered losers by 1,099 to 805.
The Standard & Poor's 500 was up 2.27 points, to 442.46, and the Nasdaq composite index, made up mainly of stocks with a smaller capitalization, was up 5.29 points, to 666.71. The American Stock Exchange composite index closed up 1.25 point, to 422.21.
The Dow Jones transportation average was up 14.70 points, to 1,607.54, though still far below its April 16 peak of 1,683.08. It rose mainly on the strength of Delta Air Lines; AMR, parent of American Airlines, and UAL, parent of United Air Lines, on no discernible news.
The Dow Jones industrials were lifted mainly by six stocks: Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, McDonald's, General Motors, Goodyear Tire, Merck and Kodak. These stocks accounted for nearly all of the rise. Higher first-quarter earnings contributed to most of 3M's rise; General Motors voted yesterday to maintain its quarterly dividend, but McDonald's rose on no discernible news.
 
Disappointing News
 The National Association of Purchasing Management reported a decline in its index of manufacturing activity to 49.7 percent in April; most analysts had expected an increase to 54 percent. The group surveys officials buying supplies for large companies. Construction spending for March, which declined eight-tenths of a percent, in line with expectations, added to the gloom.
The gold stocks, which received intense investor interest last week, were mostly down, paralleling a drop in spot gold futures prices. Gold set for June delivery fell $1.90, to $354.40 an ounce. Newmont Mining, which sold a large block of its stock to the financier George Soros, closed down 1 5/8, to 47 1/8. An exception: Freeport-McMoran rose 1/8, to 20.
Investors are looking for winning stocks with new urgency. Traders who had bought $1,000 of Dow industrial stocks at the beginning of April and held them would have lost almost $4 by the end of the month. Investors buying the same amount of S.& P. 500 stocks would have lost more than $22 in the period.
One indicator of that interest is the way investors in Nasdaq trading snapped up the initial public offering of Fidelity New York, which converted to a stock savings bank from a mutual savings bank. It was the second most heavily traded stock of the day, at 4.2 million shares. It closed at 13 1/2, up from the initial price of 11 1/2.
The most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange was Wal-Mart Stores, closing down 1/2, to 26 1/4, on no discernible news. Yesterday 4.56 million Wal-Mart shares traded hands, nearly twice the Friday volume of 2.57 million shares.

HEADLINE: Julio Gallo, 83, Wine Industrialist, Dies

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Julio Gallo, who helped to build the immense E.& J. Gallo Winery and in the process helped change Americans' drinking tastes, was killed Sunday afternoon when a vehicle he was driving veered off a dirt road on a family ranch near Tracy, Calif., about 80 miles east of San Francisco. He was 83.
Mr. Gallo, the longtime president of the company, which is one of the world's largest winemakers, was driving the vehicle, The Modesto Bee, a California newspaper, reported yesterday. He was flown by helicopter to Memorial Medical Center in Modesto, where he was declared dead on arrival. According to the Stanislaus County coroner, he died of a cervical spine fracture and partial dislocation caused by blunt-force trauma.
 
Family Injured
 Mr. Gallo's wife, Aileen, and two granddaughters were in the vehicle, a Jeep Wrangler, which plunged 35 feet down an embankment and into a shallow pond, an officer of the Tracy rural fire department said. 
 Mrs. Gallo, who is 80, and Gina Gallo, 26, were injured in the accident and were taken to Eden Hospital in Castro Valley, where Mrs. Gallo was treated for a fractured sternum and rib and Gina Gallo for fractured ribs. Both were reported to be in satisfactory condition and were released yesterday. The other granddaughter, Amie Gallo, 22, was not hospitalized.
Mr. Gallo and his brother Ernest -- his elder by one year and the chairman of the privately held winery, based in Modesto -- each amassed a personal fortune estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Fortune magazine reported late last year that the two men owned the entire winery business and that their combined wealth was $1.3 billion.
Jon Fredrikson, a wine industry economist based in San Francisco, said yesterday that the $1.3 billion estimate was plausible. But some wine industry executives in central California estimated, after Mr. Gallo's death, that he and his brother each had assets of only about $300 million.
The Gallo business has annual revenue of about $1 billion. It sells an estimated 150 million gallons of wine a year and claims roughly 26 percent of the United States wine market. It markets 16 brands of wine, of which 7 are among the 20 top sellers in the country.
From his desk at the company's headquarters, the amiable Julio Gallo oversaw the buying of the grapes and the making of the wine, remaining active and touring vineyards regularly until his death.
His brother created the company in its mammoth form, oversaw sales and was the driving force. According to wine industry analysts, Julio Gallo was partly responsible for the company's growth and its role in increasing wine consumption by Americans after World War II.
In 1983, the wine critic for The New York Times, Frank J. Prial, said, "The Gallos' influence has been enormous -- and far more positive and benevolent than most people think."
But the company has had its troubles. It signed a consent decree in 1976 with the Federal Trade Commission to stop pressuring its wholesalers; the order was rescinded in 1983.
The winery was also boycotted for five years in the 1970's by the United Farm Workers in a dispute over worker representation.
In 1986, the Gallo winery sued Ernest and Julio Gallo's younger brother, Joseph, who had earlier managed vineyards for his brothers. The suit involved accusations of trademark infringement related to Joseph's opening of a cheese factory near his home in Livingston, Calif., using the family name. Legal documents and depositions in the case gave the public a rare look inside the business.
Eventually, the winery prevailed in its litigation with Joseph, who was barred by a court from using the family name in business.
Documents from the litigation and other data were the basis for a recent book, "Blood and Wine: the Unauthorized Story of the Gallo Wine Empire" (Simon & Schuster), which chronicled the family's rise and Joseph's counter-contention that Julio and Ernest had cheated him of one-third ownership in the business.
The author, Ellen Hawkes, recounted how the brothers' father, Joseph Gallo Sr., also known as Giuseppe, was a pubkeeper who entered grape-growing when Prohibition began, and went on to become a large-scale provider of wine grapes to the eastern United States, where home winemakers were legally permitted to make 200 gallons of wine a year during Prohibition.
Ms. Hawkes contended that Joseph Gallo Sr. shot his wife, Susie, to death and then turned the weapon on himself. The deaths were ruled a murder-suicide by the police, but the author reported that the motive was never known.
She argued that it was the elder Mr. Gallo who founded the Gallo Wine Company, in 1909, and that Ernest and Julio simply continued the business. The company's official history, however, said the two sons founded the company outright. It said the two were untutored in winemaking when their parents died and had to learn the art from a booklet they found in a library.
 
A Matter of Pride

The company grew primarily because of the popularity of Gallo's inexpensive wines. The company's success was a matter of fervent pride for both Julio and Ernest Gallo. Fred T. Franzia, a nephew of Ernest who became the president of the Bronco Wine Company, a small rival, once said: "They want to go out being known as the greatest winemakers, as well as the greatest wine marketers."
The bespectacled Julio Gallo was in charge of orchestrating the wines' tastes and controlling production costs. He and his staff got the grapes largely from California growers who had signed long-term contracts with the company.
Under his guidance, the wine business was a technology innovator. It pioneered the use of stainless-steel winemaking vats and computers for wine blending.
Although most of the Gallo wine output is unpretentious, a Gallo vice president, Charles Crawford, once said that when Mr. Gallo began making a premium-quality Chardonnay -- which was introduced in 1981 -- he was so discriminating that half the crushed grapes were rejected.
Mr. Gallo was largely responsible for the company's longtime refusal to turn out vintage wines -- those made from grapes grown in a single winemaking year, or vintage.
But the Gallo brothers eventually broadened their range of products and began producing, and energetically marketing, varietal and vintage wines, which have greater appeal to sophisticated wine drinkers. In the 1970's the company built a 200-yard-long subterranean complex for aging the varietals. It was furnished with more than 600 oak wine-aging casks, each with a capacity of 4,000 gallons.
While overseeing such wide-scale operations, Mr. Gallo did not stint on research, and the company prides itself on employing platoons of chemists and viniculturists. Aggressive product research has enabled the company over the years to introduce successful and relatively inexpensive products like Thunderbird, Ripple, Spanada and Boone's Farm for the mass market
In so doing, the company incurred widespread criticism for appealing to minority groups with some wines that were generally perceived as cheap and meant for drinkers who were interested in the alcohol's effect, not in the wine's savor. Thunderbird, Ripple and other inexpensive wines with relatively high alcohol content are often referred to in the wine industry as street wines.
In recent years, the Gallo business has broadened its market by promoting its midpriced wines and its Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers.
Another problem for the company has been that growth in the consumption of wine in the United States has slowed, except in the premium wine category. People are drinking less wine, but drinking wine of higher quality, industry analysts report.
The Gallo brothers, seeing sales of some of their traditional wine categories dwindle, began making a major effort to shift their production into premium wine categories.
With that goal in mind, Julio Gallo was highly active in his last years in the company's vast program to develop new vineyards, mostly in premium grape-growing regions in Sonoma County in northern California.
Mr. Gallo was born March 21, 1910, in Oakland, Calif., grew up outside Modesto and was graduated in 1929 from Modesto High School. In his early years, he labored in a vineyard near Modesto that belonged to his father, an immigrant from the Piedmont region, in north and northwestern Italy, which also has a wine industry.
In addition to his wife and the two granddaughters, Julio Gallo is survived by a son, Robert J. of Modesto; a daughter, Susan Coleman, and numerous other grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Broadly Lower And British Pound Retreats

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Despite an early spurt, the dollar ended broadly lower yesterday on a report that the American manufacturing economy shrank in April for the first time in seven months.
The report was the latest in a string of negative economic data and cast a shadow on a day already marked by thin trading. Markets in Tokyo and London were closed for holidays. 
 But the British pound retreated amid speculation that Britain's recovery may not be as strong as indicated by recent figures.
The dollar was up more than a pfennig against the German mark in the morning, but reversed course when the National Association of Purchasing Management released its monthly survey showing that the manufacturing economy contracted in April.
The April weakness further demonstrated that March's widely reported gloom could not be brushed aside as just the product of winter storms.
"I got the feeling the market is rethinking this whole recovery scenario," said Robert Ortiz, vice president in corporate sales at Continental Bank in Chicago.
The bearish dollar sentiment is building ahead of Friday, when the Government is to release employment figures for April, the month's most closely watched economic data.
But the dollar rose nearly 1 pence against the British pound. Lisa Pazer, an analyst with MMS International, traced the movement to a report in The Sunday Observer that the British Government had manipulated recent unemployment data to paint an overly rosy economic picture.
Traders said the report was "the fundamental backdrop to what happened in the pound today," the MMS analyst said.
The pound was quoted at $1.5620 in European trading, down from $1.5700 late Friday in London. In New York, the pound settled at $1.5650, down from $1.5733 late Friday.
The dollar slipped against the yen in New York trading, closing at 110.78 yen, down from 111.10 late Friday.
Financial markets were closed in Britain for a spring bank holiday. Markets are also closed until Thursday in Japan for a series of holidays.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Surge in Silver Is Halted; Weak Industrial Data Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver futures prices fell from a 21-month high yesterday after an industrial survey signaled weakness in the manufacturing economy. Gold and platinum prices also fell.
In other commodities markets, grains and soybeans ended mixed; hog futures surged, and oil futures rose. 
 Silver for May delivery dropped 9.9 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to $4.29 an ounce. The contract traded as high as $4.45 during the session, 6.1 cents above Friday's settlement and the highest price for spot deliveries since July 1991.
June gold fell $1.90, to $354.40 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange. July platinum dropped $3.30 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $386.60 an ounce.
Investment funds sold silver after seven straight days of gains that had increased its price by 54 cents -- about 14 percent. The selling was prompted in part, said analysts, by the report by the National Association of Purchasing Management, saying that the manufacturing economy contracted in April for the first time in seven months.
The report "injected some caution in the trade," said Stephen Platt, metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago. He said the market was due for a correction after the recent gains. Silver has industrial uses and is regarded by some as an indicator of industrial activity.
Analysts did not pronounce dead a longer rally in silver that had lifted its price by nearly 27 percent -- from a low on Feb. 22 of $3.51 an ounce -- but neither did they express confidence that it would soon resume.
"We've never really trusted the rally in silver," said George Milling-Stanley, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York. "There's nothing on the fundamental front to justify it."
In other commodities markets, the prices of grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade in advance of a corn-crop report after the close that said there would be planting delays because of bad weather.
Hog and pork-belly futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on reports of surprisingly light sales of hogs to meatpackers.
Light crude oil for June delivery rose 4 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $20.57 a barrel.

HEADLINE: City Lights and Space Ads May Blind Stargazers

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
AS the glare of artificial light spreads ever more pervasively across the planet's night skies, astronomers are having nightmares.
America's great observatories now face the possibility that huge commercial billboards may soon be rocketed into orbit, while cities fearful of crime are flooding the night sky with ever brighter lights. Added to this plague of light pollution, astronomical observatories also face increasing interference from such mundane sources as radio-operated garage-door openers, 
 For much of the 20th century, astronomers have waged a losing campaign to keep night skies as dark as possible. Light pollution is a particular problem for the largest telescopes, which seek out the most distant and faintest galaxies at the edge of the universe. But now, great observatories that were once safely distant from the scattered glow of city lights are seriously threatened. Many scientists believe that the day will come when terrestrial astronomy becomes unproductive, and optical and radio telescopes will have to move to the far side of the Moon.
Two of the latest developments astronomers see as threats are indirect results of America's recession. The economic malaise has blighted downtown shopping districts, with the result that cities are scrambling to make them more appealing, in part by adding bright lights. The economy has also reduced Federal financing of several branches of science, leading some Government scientists to work with promoters on such projects as commercial advertising in space.
A major uproar followed the announcement last month that Space Marketing Inc. of Roswell, Ga., in cooperation with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and the University of Colorado, planned to launch a one-mile-wide display satellite into orbit around Earth. The spacecraft, made of thin plastic film, would reflect sunlight to Earth from aluminized letters or symbols. Orbiting at an altitude of about 180 miles, the sign would be just legible to the naked eye.
A description by its developers says that from the ground the satellite will appear to be somewhere between the size of the full moon and the size of a half moon, depending on variations in atmospheric effects. But highly reflective parts of the spacecraft that catch the Sun at an optimum angle may make it seem much brighter than the Moon. The "orbiting billboard," as detractors call it, would carry instruments made by Livermore to study Earth's atmosphere, and would entail no direct expense to the Government. Instead, the project would be supported by commercial sponsors, who would gain the right to use the spacecraft's symbol in their advertising.
The announcement prompted an angry letter to astronomers throughout the world from Dr. Derek McNally, a British astronomer who is chairman of an environmental committee of the United Nations International Council of Scientific Unions.
"The ultimate disaster for astronomical science is now clearly identified: commercial advertising from space," he wrote. "Such a misuse of space involving the launch of solar reflectors carrying advertising material, to appear as bright as the Moon (as a minimum), orbiting with 90-minute periods, will virtually wipe out deep-sky astronomy."
Mike Lawson, president of Space Marketing, denied in an interview that the proposed spacecraft would hurt astronomy. "The purpose of our 'Environmental Space Platform' is to help scientists who could not otherwise afford to do so to put environmental sensors into orbit," he said. "The project will be supported by commercial sponsors identified with environmental causes, who can display our symbol in advertising, just as sponsors of the Olympics do."
The mile-wide spacecraft, shaped like an ordinary billboard, would be visible over any given spot on Earth for only about 10 minutes at a time, and would not be visible at all during the middle of the night when it would be out of reach of the Sun's rays, its designers say.
When it is launched in 1996, it will cause astronomical observatories no more problems than do airplanes flying across the lines of sight of the big telescopes, Mr. Lawson said. Moreover, the "Environmental Space Platform," consisting almost entirely of thin Mylar plastic film, would re-enter the atmosphere and burn up within 20 days of launching.
These assurances have not mollified opponents.
 
'Trojan Horse' in Sky
 The Center for the Study of Commercialism, a public interest group in Washington, is organizing a coalition of scientists and laymen to oppose the project. "We see this orbiting billboard as a Trojan horse," said Karen Brown, a spokeswoman for the organization. "A would-be space advertiser needs only a permit from the Department of Transportation to launch his satellite. The Space Marketing satellite may be the first of many."
Dr. Preston Carter of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, who is working with Space Marketing on the project, explained that the billboard satellite could be packed into a very small container for launching by a Delta rocket or even a smaller Conestoga rocket, or by a fairly small European, Russian, Chinese or Japanese rocket. In space, gas would be used to inflate thin Mylar tubes forming the rigid structure of the sign, and this structure would support a huge sheet of Mylar that would face Earth.
With the end of the cold war, Lawrence Livermore, a Federal nuclear weapons laboratory, has been ordered to apply as much of its scientific expertise and equipment as possible to benefit the economy. Support of commercial projects in space appears to fall within this new mandate.
But even without space advertising, astronomers are fighting against lengthening odds to stem the flood of light and radio pollution that spoils many types of measurement.
One of the latest threats to astronomy has arisen in the city of San Diego, where urban blight and crime have squeezed many businesses out of downtown neighborhoods. Many residents and merchants attribute the flight of businesses to the city's street lights, which, since their installation in 1984, have bathed the city in the bright, pure yellow light produced by low-pressure sodium vapor.
Viewed through a prism, this light is concentrated in two rather narrow lines of the spectrum, lines that can be filtered out by astronomical observatories. Yellow low-pressure sodium street lighting is important to observers using the mighty 200-inch telescope at Mount Palomar about 40 miles away. (The size of astronomical telescopes is expressed in inches or meters as the diameter of their light-collecting mirrors.)
 
San Diego Lighting Plan
 But last month a committee of the San Diego City Council voted to replace some of the low-pressure sodium lights with high-pressure sodium lights that emit a peach-colored light. This light is smeared across most of the visible spectrum, and astronomers cannot filter it out.
In the next several weeks, after a vote by the City Council, the city government is expected to order the change. A spokesman for Mayor Susan Golding, who spoke on condition that his name be withheld, said he knew of no scientific studies proving that lighting had any direct effect on crime.
"But a lot of people in San Diego object to these yellow lights -- bug lights, they call them -- partly because they wash out all color, and partly because the lights are perceived as invitations to crime," he said.
Dr. Robert J. Brucato, assistant director of the Palomar Observatory, which is administered by the California Institute of Technology, said: "This is a very unfortunate development. It's hard to say at this point just how damaging high-pressure sodium lighting will be for us, but it's bound to hurt observations of very faint objects -- the distant galaxies and quasars that are the main thrust of astrophysical science these days.
"Caltech is not asking San Diego to tolerate a high crime rate, but we don't know of any evidence that yellow light promotes crime any more than white light."
An investigation in 1980 by the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice concluded that "while there is no statistically significant evidence that street lighting impacts the level of crime, there is a strong indication that increased lighting -- perhaps lighting uniformity -- decreases the fear of crime."
 
Losing Battle in New York
 The lights seem not to be widely used outside of California, although statistics are not readily available. In New York City, for instance, where high-pressure sodium is the standard, astronomers at Columbia University, which has quite a large telescope, "gave up the fight many years ago," said Dr. Joseph Patterson, a professor of astronomy.
Light pollution has increasingly forced major observatories to move their resources away from the continental United States to darker places, including the mountains of northern Chile. "In California, light pollution from Santa Cruz and other communities was one of the reasons we decided to move much of our support to observatories on Mauna Kea mountain on the island of Hawaii," said Dr. Stan E. Woosley of the Lick Observatory.
Although light pollution is degrading astronomy in California, some other states seem to be holding the line. Dr. David Crawford of the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona said the city governments of Tucson and other nearby communities had been highly cooperative in reducing sky glow by using low-pressure sodium lighting and placing shields over outdoor lights. Hawaii also maintains strict rules limiting outdoor lighting to protect the large observatories on Mauna Kea.
Light pollution does not necessarily block all forms of optical astronomy, and a great old telescope exposed to the lights of Pasadena, Calif., may have gained a new lease on life.
In 1917 when it was commissioned, the 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson near Pasadena (affectionately known as "the 100-inch") began a career of breathtaking observations that reshaped understanding of the universe. In the 1930's Edwin Hubble and his colleagues used the 100-inch in their historic discovery that the universe is expanding. But by 1985, the lights of Pasadena had washed out the sky to such an extent that the Carnegie Institution of Washington decided to close down the 100-inch.
In 1989, however, astronomers and other admirers of the 100-inch created the Mount Wilson Institute and began soliciting donations to put the great telescope back to work. Dr. Robert Jastrow, head of the institute, said he hoped that this goal would be realized in July.
"Light from incandescent lamps in communities near Mount Wilson will continue to prevent deep-space observation by the 100-inch," he said, "but we can still do important work on objects within our own galaxy -- hunting for planetary systems, for example."
 
Problem of Radio Interference
 Stray visible light is merely one of the plagues of astronomy. Another is a thickening global smog of radio interference.
As astronomers increasingly focus on objects at enormous distances from Earth, they must concentrate on the part of the electromagnetic spectrum consisting of radio waves. Because the universe is expanding, light reaching Earth from distant objects undergoes a Doppler shift analogous to the drop in the pitch of a train whistle as it recedes from a listener. The recession of distant objects from Earth shifts visible light to lower frequencies in the radio range, and radiotelescopes are therefore increasingly important to astronomy.
But radio interference has sharply increased in recent decades. Powerful commercial broadcasting stations sometimes cooperate closely with radiotelescopes to avoid washing out signals from distant space, but a more serious problem, according to Dr. A. Richard Thompson of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Charlottesville, Va., is the radio haze created by small appliances.
"A lot of things laymen take for granted give us a lot of trouble," he said. "Things like welding machines, automobile computers and ignition systems, fluorescent lights, electric motors, and so on. And then there are things like radio-operated garage door openers.
"Paradoxically," Dr. Thompson said, "large sources of radio pollution are easier for us to identify and compensate for than are weak radio sources. The weak signals get mixed into the radio background, and are very hard to separate from the extremely weak signals from space we're looking for."
What of the future?
"We worry about a lot of things we see coming -- mobile phone systems that will go directly through a galaxy of 77 communication satellites, for example.
"I guess it's possible that eventually we'll be chased away to the Moon, if we want to continue doing astronomy," Dr. Thompson said.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Time For Apologies

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Something important is missing in all the talk about how only American muscle and guts are bringing peace in Bosnia -- an apology to Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen.
The apology is a matter of decency. It is also a matter of understanding what happened, to help protect the peace in case it actually comes about. 
 Apology is due to these two honorable men from all the columnists, editorial writers, politicians and academics who vilified them while they fought for a political basis for peace.
I have been in rooms where journalists treated them as prisoners in the dock. In print, they were accused of being Chamberlains, of creating a new Munich, of selling out freedom and human rights, by outlining a political settlement.
Americans, private and journalistic, sent hate mail and spread dinner-table nastiness. I got all that myself just for supporting the Vance-Owen plan that is now accepted by Europe, the U.S., Belgrade and all Bosnians but a small group of Serbian hard-liners.
Mr. Vance said little in counterattack; that is his way. But Lord Owen has a fine tongue in him, which let it be known he has only one cheek to give to his country.
The Clinton Administration did not denounce them. But during the campaign and after inauguration, it wasted months by refusing to support the Vance-Owen plan.
Washington implied it could do better. But, like the journalistic and political packs, it came up with nothing else. That meant the U.S. could exert no decisive pressure on the combatants because it had nothing to offer.
When the Clinton Administration decided there was more to the Presidency than hey baby -- hey baby, it's all about money -- it began doing well. It accepted Vance-Owen, acknowledging it was the difference between peace, with all the Balkan complications, and the continuation of a particularly horrible civil war.
Washington also supported increased sanctions against Serbia itself. And Mr. Clinton's team resisted the American Bombing Association. Every day it was after them to start plastering Bosnian Serbs right away, yesterday, and get on smartly with bombing Belgrade.
That would have made the Balkan war an American war. That could still happen.
But resisting bombing for so long paid off for the U.S. Last week Belgrade backed far off from its Bosnian Serbian clients.
Maybe advance bombing talk helped. But Belgrade acted before Mr. Clinton made up his mind. Tough U.N. sanctions were biting deep into Serbia's economy, far deeper than into Iraq's before Desert Storm. Serbia is intimately tied into European markets, and did not have the advantage of Jordanian sanction-breaking so useful to Saddam Hussein.
Now the mighty U.S. and a small bunch of Bosnian Serbian hard-liners have each other by the throat.
Mr. Clinton has just about committed himself to bombing if the Bosnian hard-liners turn down Vance-Owen. Neither he nor the American public want that. And if the hard-liners in the Bosnian Serbian "parliament" do refuse -- or double-cross the U.N. later -- they will be bringing American power into the war, which their own sponsors in Belgrade are desperately trying to avoid.
I have been against the U.S. entering the war by bombing. But like people everywhere I hope the Bosnian hard-liners listen to the world and do not bring bombing down on their countrymen.
The critics of Vance-Owen choose to forget that the plan is not simply the only settlement on the table. It also includes the essential condition for any peace: a military schedule for disengagement and partial disarmament by all parties.
The U.S. still does not have what it needs most -- clear-cut understanding about how deep in the U.S. will get, and when if ever it will get out. But without the disengagement part of Vance-Owen, U.S. troops sent to join a U.N. force in Bosnia would be not keeping a peace but fighting a war from the day they landed -- something Mr. Clinton said he would not do.
Since it is not likely that Mr. Vance, his outstanding deputy Herbert Okun or Lord Owen will get their apology from their vilifiers, here's one to a member of the trio from a supporter.
In one column I referred to Lord Owen as a rather crabby Englishman. He corrected me: Welshman, he said, Welshman.

HEADLINE: Water-Rate Freeze Maintains a Balance

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Marjorie Shea and Peg Kocher wrote (letter, April 20) to express their concern that my program for affordable water and sewer rates -- a two-year rate freeze followed by at least a two-year inflation-limited cap on rate growth -- would produce cutbacks in resources for watershed protection and other critical environmental programs. This is a misplaced anxiety.
Our rate freeze is based on a plan developed by the Department of Environmental Protection that establishes long-term balance between revenues and key service needs. That plan reprioritizes the use of D.E.P. resources to increase investment in long-term, cost-saving programs: watershed protection, water conservation, preventive infrastructure maintenance and customer service. 
 This includes funding for over 350 watershed-protection personnel upstate, $47 million in capital funds for land acquisition, over $60 million in capital funds to upgrade our sewage-treatment plants upstate, and another $120 million in capital funds for additional watershed-protection investments over the coming decade.
My administration fully understands that spending money to prevent watershed pollution, instead of spending far greater sums later on filtration to clean it up, is the best way to protect both the public health and the pocketbook of our people.
These policies require a long-term vision and an ability to make long-term resource commitments. The rate freeze will not threaten that.

HEADLINE: A Test for Clinton in Race for Aspin's Seat Today

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JANESVILLE, Wis., May 3

 BODY:
Bill Clinton is not on the ballot, but he is definitely in the campaign here to fill Les Aspin's seat in the United States House. The Republican candidate is running against the President, and his Democratic opponent is running away from him in Tuesday's special election.
The rolling dairy lands and lakeside industrial towns in the southeast corner of the state is a swing district, Republican in some Presidential elections, Democratic in others. 
 But this time around, local polls indicate that the race in the First District between Mark Neumann, a Republican home developer, and his Democratic opponent, State Representative Peter Barca, is too close to call.
The contest may finally come down to a tug-of-war between organized labor, which generally backs Mr. Barca, and a coalition of people opposed to gun control and abortion, backing Mr. Neumann, over who can get out the larger vote.
Mr. Neumann has attracted President Gerald R. Ford, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and former Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp to campaign for him and back up his contention that the election is a referendum on President Clinton's first 100 days.
At a fund-raising event in Janesville on Saturday night, Mr. Dole, the Senate minority leader, said the vote would be "a preliminary indication of how the President is doing."
 
Is Clinton Really a Factor?
 Voter turnout could be as low as 25 percent because it is a special election. And many voters and local political analysts scoff at the notion that the race is a vote about Mr. Clinton, saying that such an idea only has importance in Washington. Nevertheless, the tenor of the campaign suggests that support for Mr. Clinton's message and economic program may be eroding in the nation's midsection.
At a rally in downtown Janesville in a pouring rain today, Mr. Neumann told supporters that the election results would reverberate around the country. "The news stories on national television Wednesday can either be the people of Wisconsin have sent a vote of confidence for President Clinton, or the news story can be, we do not want the tax increases," he said.
In radio debates and campaign speeches, both candidates have railed against the free-trade agreement with Mexico, which Mr. Clinton has generally endorsed, and they have competed over plans for cutting spending.
Mr. Neumann has strongly opposed Mr. Clinton's economic package, and Mr. Barca has suggested that he might also vote against it if it includes the proposed energy tax, which he says would hurt manufacturing in Wisconsin.
Mr. Barca pointedly noted in an interview Saturday that he did not invite any national Democrats to campaign for him. "If I supported the President on everything, lock, stock and barrel, then there would be a referendum," he said.
In another interview with editors of The Wisconsin State Journal last Tuesday, he was quoted as saying, "I don't think Clinton's plan is that hot, frankly."
 
Lining Up Constituencies
 Mr. Barca, the third-ranking Democrat in the state Assembly, bases his election hopes on his reputation as a longtime friend of the auto workers and members of the government employees union in Racine, Kenosha, Beloit and Janesville.
Mr. Neumann is counting on the farm vote, and hopes rainy weather will persuade the farmers to take time off from plowing their soybean and corn fields to vote. He has campaigned by jogging across the winding side roads of the district, a stunt that has gained him favorable publicity in the farm-town press.
A victory for Mr. Neumann, who lost in a challenge to Mr. Aspin last November but gained valuable name-recognition in the process, would raise the Republican membership in the House to 177 members against 257 Democrats and one independent.
In another special election on Tuesday, a Republican is expected to win easily in Ohio, where Representative Bill Gradison retired before his term ended.
Mr. Aspin represented the Wisconsin district for 22 years before his appointment as Defense Secretary, but the district voted heavily in favor of President Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, for the Democrat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 and for Mr. Clinton last fall. Ross Perot won nearly 25 percent of last November's votes.
Most voters do not seem to link the election directly to their feelings about the President.
After shaking hands with Mr. Barca at a bingo get-together at the Racine Y.M.C.A. on Saturday evening, Rick Bernal, a 33-year-old foundry worker, said: "I don't believe Clinton is living up to his words, particularly on taxes. But I'm going to vote for Barca because he's with the union."
Odile Kirby, 75, a hostess at a fast-food restaurant, agreed, saying: "Why should this be a referendum? Clinton does his thing and we in Wisconsin do our thing."

HEADLINE: Middle-Class but Not Feeling Equal, Blacks Reflect on Los Angeles Strife

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Every so often, Dr. Delaney Smith will pull out a year-old videotape and relive the Los Angeles riots on his wide-screen television, watching the flames rise against the night sky and feeling the rage of his people all over again as the liquor stores and gas stations burn only blocks from his home.
"It has never left me," Dr. Smith, an internist who specializes in emergency medicine, said recently. "It brings me back to my roots. I don't ever want to forget." 
 For middle-class blacks who are living evidence of the nation's civil rights gains, the beating of Rodney King and the recent second trial of four white police officers in the case have been agonizing reminders of how much more has to change before they are truly accepted as equals.
Interviews with more than 70 well-to-do blacks in Los Angeles and around the country suggest that blacks did not find the convictions of two of the four officers a catharsis or a cause for celebration. Rather, they saw those verdicts as a grudging half step toward justice, a bittersweet culmination of a very bleak year.
 
'The Deepest Sadness'
 "When I heard the verdicts, I couldn't stop crying," said Dr. Donna Franklin, a Chicago writer and consultant. "It was crying of the deepest sadness. One piece of it was release. The other was, 'Will our children ever know the absence of racism?' "
She and others interviewed said they had lowered their expectations about race relations over the last year. They told of efforts to stand up to indignities and said they were rethinking their spending habits, putting money and economic clout behind other blacks and black-owned businesses.
Despite the whoops and cheers from a black church near the South-Central district that bore the brunt of the riots, there was no jubilation along predominantly black Crenshaw Boulevard or in the black middle-class sections of Leimert Park or Inglewood, all in or near the South-Central area.
"Justice was blind in one eye," said Dr. Richard Williams, a Los Angeles cardiologist. "Here was a black man who was severely beaten, and they only convict 50 percent of the people charged with beating him."
Those interviewed in Los Angeles said they had spent the last year trying to focus the anger they felt toward the officers who beat Mr. King, toward a Simi Valley jury that had acquitted them of state criminal charges, toward what they see as unequal treatment for blacks in everyday dealings in a white-dominated society.
The people who embraced integration in their climb into the middle class are now talking with bitterness and resignation about separation and solidarity. Last year's despair, they said, has turned to defiance.
"We have had to look in the mirror of our society," said Steven Lott, an architect here. "What I see is very ugly."
 
Citing Toll of Verdict
 He and others say they were angered that the officers' guilt in the beating took two trials, millions of dollars in legal fees, riots, millions more in lost property and dozens of lives to prove.
"Look at what it took to get this verdict," said Doris Davis, a Los Angeles teacher, a quaver in her voice.
While others talk of healing, those interviewed talked of doing for themselves and supporting one another in the way they said the Jews and Asians had done.
Many have turned inward in the last year, transferring money to black-owned institutions from white-owned banks, seeking out black businesses to repair their automobiles or buy wall-to-wall carpeting. They have been creating consortiums and cooperatives to serve the inner city and generally viewing the country as a more hostile place than they did before the Simi Valley jury verdict.
"We carry around a rage in us," said Walter Allen, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has written on racial issues. "We carry the weight of the race and the weight of racism. The Rodney King case has radicalized black folks that used to be mild-mannered. It has brought people face to face with the country's racial caste system."
Some are showing solidarity by putting their money where their concerns are. Since the riots, some black businesses are reporting banner years, with black customers seeking out the companies to show their support.
"I will drive on fumes to get to a black gas station," said Zna Portlock, a lawyer who, while recently looking for a new doctor, went down a list of physicians and called their offices to see which ones were black.
Gerald Hutchinson, owner of an auto-body shop in the Crenshaw District, said the beating case had done more for business than the few advertisements he used to buy. "It's a shame to have this happen for people to be more aware," he said, "but it's paying off."
The three black-owned financial institutions in Los Angeles posted gains in deposits despite the recession, which slowed growth at some other banks. At Founders National Bank in South-Central, deposits rose to $75 million from $60 million. The accounts held by black churches tripled to 50 after the riots, said Carlton Jenkins, the bank's managing director.
Deposits at the black-owned Broadway Federal Savings and Loan rose to $3 million from $2 million, while those at Family Savings Bank rose to $113 million from $109 million.
Mr. Lott, the architect, said he had transferred his firm's account to Founders after nine years at a white-owned bank, which he said had made the company jump hurdles for routine services like providing a line of credit despite the firm's good credit rating.
 
Making Banking Inconvenient
 Allysunn Walker, executive director of a youth program here, recently closed her account at Security Pacific Bank and opened a checking account, savings account and certificate of deposit at a black institution, Family Savings Bank.
The location of the bank, in the heart of the South-Central district, was not especially convenient, the rates were no better and, in fact, the switch meant she had to rearrange her schedule to do her banking in the daytime, when she feels safer in the neighborhood. But the place is black-owned, they know her by name and she likes the idea that the money will go for loans to blacks.
"My money is a little money, but it's mine," she said. "I feel like I'm indirectly helping my people."
Others are showing a new and tentative sense of oneness in other ways. Barbara Blackman, a librarian, stood in line at a Pasadena beauty-supply shop with her teen-age daughter Cherika and a half-dozen blacks recently and grew uncomfortable as she watched an Asian clerk scold a black man trying to make a return.
"The clerk was yelling and screaming at him," Mrs. Blackman said. "It was very disrespectful. He had only made the purchase an hour before. Suddenly someone in line said: 'We don't have to take this. We can take our money somewhere else.' "
The whole line of customers set their shampoo and rollers on the counter and walked out. "It was a matter of supporting this man," Mrs. Blackman said. "I said, 'Cherika, let's go.' Society needs to realize that we do have a certain amount of dignity and pride."
This has not been an ordinary year, as Mrs. Davis, the school teacher here, found when she was collecting some forms from her fellow teachers. She said she had asked a white teacher for hers. When the teacher did not have it ready to turn in, she appeared nervous and agitated and said, "What are you going to do if I don't get mine in -- burn down my house?"
She said racial fears reached an absurd point one day when her 23-year-old nephew visited her school in his baggy pants and dreadlocks. When he waved to her from down the hall, two white co-workers ducked.
"No matter how far we thought we had gotten, we haven't gotten anywhere," she said, the pain of years of rejection in her voice. "We've tried to become part of this country. Trying to impress white people is like trying to impress your daddy. No matter what you do, they still see color first. I say, forget them."
Blacks and the rest of Los Angeles are tensely awaiting the next legal developments in the case -- the sentencing of the police officers and the trial of four blacks in the beating of Reginald Denny, a white truck driver, on the first day of rioting.
Some blacks are already angry at what they see as a double standard, where the black defendants face higher bail than the white officers and more serious charges -- attempted murder -- for what they see as a nearly identical beating. They say they are troubled by the implication that crimes against whites are considered more serious than those against blacks.
"When they do something to a white man, all of a sudden it matters," Professor Allen said. "If they do something to a black person, it's fine."
At the core of all this is the sense that no matter how much shampoo or gasoline they buy from black businesses, there is little they can do about economic and racial inequities that create privileged white suburbs and desperate minority ghettos.
"It wasn't us that needed to change," said Wesley Snipes, the actor who lives just west of Los Angeles. "The change has to come from white America."
Indeed, there is deep frustration that the riots got so much more attention than the unemployment, poverty, crime, isolation and racism that many believe set the scene for the turmoil.
"What matters is what led to the rebellion in the first place, and none of that has been addressed," said Dr. Medria Williams, a black clinical psychologist who counsels teachers and students in the South-Central district. "The country has learned nothing from this, and that is the tragedy."

HEADLINE: CLINTON SEES NEED TO FOCUS HIS GOALS AND SHARPEN STAFF

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
Smarting from losses in early battles with Congress and from criticism of his first 100 days, President Clinton conceded today that his White House was "out of focus" and that his staff needed to be better organized.
Mr. Clinton, overburdened by his own crowded agenda, admitted his dissatisfaction in remarks to reporters in which he outlined a new effort to focus his Administration. 
 "One of the things that you risk when you try to get a lot of things going in a hurry -- and we tried to get a lot of things going in a hurry because four years passes in a hurry -- is that you wind up having people work very, very hard but maybe getting a little out of focus," he said. "And I think we can bring it -- tighten the focus a little, and I think that's what we ought to do."
 
2d Deputy Is Likely
 To help in that effort, he said, he will probably appoint a second deputy to assist his longtime friend, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the chief of staff. The Administration mentioned no names in connection with the new appointment.
Administration officials say Mr. McLarty has been stretched thin trying to oversee both the White House's internal operations and Mr. Clinton's relations with Congress.
Mr. Clinton's unusual mea culpa was delivered in the Oval Office on a day in which his Secretary of State traveled abroad seeking support for the Administration's desire to lift the arms embargo against Bosnian Muslims and its plan to use air strikes against Bosnian Serbs.
At home, in the face of a looming Congressional defeat, Mr. Clinton had to retreat from his program on childhood vaccinations. But the White House also tossed another program into the political mix on Capitol Hill today: an $8 billion, five-year project to revitalize the nation's cities. [Page B9.]
 
Lack of Staff Coordination
 Mr. Clinton and members of his senior White House staff have admitted in recent weeks that their approach to government has often been scattershot. The President's $19.5 billion plan to stimulate the economy foundered under the weight of a Republican filibuster in the Senate because of political and communications problems. Efforts to sell Mr. Clinton's emerging health-care plan, hampered by secrecy and presented so far mainly as a package of new taxes, also appeared to be in trouble.
Mr. Clinton suggested today that one problem was a lack of coordination within his staff. "We think that there needs to be a little tighter coordination here to make sure that we've got our priorities straight, and that those priorities are communicated all the way down through the staff, and a little better focus," he said.
Mr. McLarty has maintained an unusually low profile for a senior White House aide, spending much of his time running the White House staff and smoothing relations with Congress. He is assisted by Mark D. Gearan, the only deputy chief of staff, who was appointed after Harold I. Ickes, a longtime New York politician, was dropped from consideration.
Unlike previous Administrations, when chiefs of staff like John H. Sununu and Donald T. Regan were attacked by their own aides in tough political times, the Clinton White House showed no signs of internal sniping at Mr. McLarty's performance.
 
'Not a Big Shake-Uup'
 Mr. Clinton went out of his way to say that he felt his staff had generally done a good job "on balance."
"As nearly as I can tell, we put more major initiatives out there in 100 days than any of my recent predecessors," he said, "and we're working on some very major problems."
During the Presidential campaign, power shifts became commonplace in the Clinton campaign as the fortunes of various consultants and advisers rose and fell. But Mr. Clinton seldom dismissed anyone, even if the person fell out of favor.
"There's not a big shake-up coming," one official said today. "But there will always be changes.
"It is as much a decision to look forward as to look back. We've had a lot of balls in the air in the last 100 days, and it doesn't get easier. It gets harder when you have health care and reconciliation coming up."
 
Critique of a Friend
 Mr. Clinton appears to hold special affection for and loyalty to Mr. McLarty, a childhood friend and former energy company executive who had little Washington experience before his appointment. But by acknowledging that his friend needed more help, Mr. Clinton seemed to be admitting what Democrats outside the White House have only speculated about: Mr. McLarty might lack the political acumen expected of a President's chief of staff.
White House officials said the coming changes should not be considered a wholesale revamping of West Wing responsibility. Instead, they said, the result could be that White House officials will begin grouping into clusters to meet on issues with an eye toward covering the political, policy and legislative bases.
A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said senior aides had been meeting for weeks to "kind of just figure out how we can get to the top of our game in the longer term."
But in the current atmosphere, even an offhand comment was enough to drive the President off course. On Monday, Mr. Clinton was forced to apologize to Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, for a mocking joke delivered at the White House correspondents' dinner on Saturday night. The President accused Mr. Dole -- falsely as it turned out -- of trying to gain $23 million in Government pork-barrel spending for his home state of Kansas.
 
Mrs. Clinton Reappears
 The White House has responded recently to at least some of the criticism. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had come under fire for closing her health-care task force meetings and who had stayed mostly out of reporters' reach since the inauguration, has begun granting interviews again. This week she appeared on the cover of three national magazines.
And after weeks of preoccupation with Washington politics, Mr. Clinton has also begun looking outward again. David Wilhelm, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has been charged with reporting to the President on what voters are saying around the country.
"What I think we need to do, frankly, is to get the focus back on to the things that I have been working on from the beginning," Mr. Clinton said. "Passing the major economic programs; giving -- making sure that Congress will adopt the spending cuts, but reaffirming that I have no interest in raising taxes until spending is cut -- no tax increases without the spending cuts; getting the budget program through so that we can keep interest rates down.
"After all, I just got here. I've never operated here before, and there are some things that are very different about the way Washington works -- some good, and some not so good.
"But I think that we're on the right track, and I just want to focus now on the work before us, which is passing this budget."

 BODY:
The Government's main economic forecasting gauge plunged 1 percent in March, the biggest drop since the middle of the 1990-91 recession. It was the latest report to raise questions about the strength and durability of the economic expansion. 
 But some economists said other statistics from April, including the month's auto sales, suggested that consumers were beginning to increase their spending.

HEADLINE: Delay Sought in Law Meant to Trim Welfare Rolls

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration asked Congress today to postpone the effective date of a law passed under President Ronald Reagan that would require states to find jobs or job training for tens of thousands of married welfare recipients or face a loss of Federal welfare funds.
The request to the House Ways and Means Committee came as the committee began public discussion of the tax and spending bill that is the core of President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan. 
 The expectation of Administration officials, lawmakers and lobbyists is that the committee will approve most of the basic elements of the Clinton plan next week, and that the House of Representatives will follow suit by the end of this month. But the plan faces strong opposition in the Senate, and the outlook there is uncertain.
The welfare proposal involves a 1988 law that was supposed to go into effect this October. It requires the states to find jobs or training for at least one parent in 40 percent of the two-parent families receiving checks under Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the basic Federal welfare program. The percentage is supposed to rise each year until it reaches 70 percent in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 1996.
 
An Unrealistic Goal?
 Wendell E. Primus, a deputy assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, asked that the requirement be postponed for two years. He told the committee that most states would be unable to meet the goal because their welfare rolls had mushroomed during the recession and the necessary training programs had not been created.
About 300,000 two-parent families nationwide, representing 1.2 million people, are on welfare and would be affected by the change in the law. That is a small proportion of the total welfare population of about 13 million, mostly families with a single mother.
The rules on single-parent families would not be changed. Under the law, the states must place 11 percent of these parents who are eligible in jobs or training in this fiscal year, and the percentage is to rise to 15 percent in the next fiscal year. Parents with children under age 3 are exempt in most states; some states exempt only parents with children younger than 1 year.
Last year, the Federal Government made $1 billion available to the states under this program, and the states were supposed to match this with their own funds. But only $600 million was used because the states did not come up with the matching funds to get the rest.
 
Campaign Promise Recalled
 Mr. Primus said the Administration would address the question of work requirements when it submits its welfare program to Congress later in the year. In his campaign last year, Mr. Clinton promised to end the current welfare system and replace it with one that would eventually withdraw welfare benefits from parents who refused to work or enter education or training programs.
Administration supporters said the request to delay the work requirement in the law did not reflect a retreat from the campaign principles but rather was a recognition that compliance with the law was impossible.
In the discussion of the main parts of the legislation, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said he was "firmly committed to help President Clinton achieve his basic plan."
The central elements of the plan would raise the income tax rates and Medicare taxes of the wealthy, increase the corporate tax rate, impose a new tax on fuel, require upper- and middle-income retirees to pay taxes on a larger portion of their Social Security benefits, cut Medicare and Medicaid spending and eliminate or restrict many tax deductions, including those for business meals and club dues.
 
How Lawmakers Feel
 The lawmakers seem likely to reject Mr. Clinton's proposal for an investment-tax credit for business. The proposal, meant as an economic stimulus, is believed by many economists to be a waste of money and has generated little support in business circles.
Instead of a variety of cuts in the Medicare program recommended by the President, the committee seems likely to approve a two-year freeze in payments for services by doctors, hospitals and laboratories.
Representative Fortney (Pete) Stark, a California Democrat who heads the health subcommittee, said he did not necessarily expect the freeze to become law but meant it as a "placeholder" until the Administration's overall health plan was announced.
One section of the bill would raise to $1,750 a year the earnings threshold above which Social Security taxes must paid for household employees like maids and nannies. The threshold is now $50 a quarter, a figure that has not been changed since 1950 and a level so low that it is widely ignored.
 
Juggling the Numbers
 Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee made it clear today that they would fight almost every aspect of the Clinton plan. One after another called it the biggest tax increase ever proposed, a claim that is true or false depending on how various calculations are made. Democrats retorted that it was actually the biggest deficit reduction every proposed, an assertion that also can be both proved and disproved.
The Democrats' 24-to-14 committee majority means they can ignore the Republican opposition and still approve the bill handily. The full House will consider the legislation under rules that strictly limit amendments, meaning that whatever the committee approves will probably be passed and sent to the Senate.
The measure, meant to reduce the deficit by nearly $500 billion over the next five years, would raise taxes by a net of about $260 billion during that period. The remaining deficit reduction would come from spending cuts.

HEADLINE: Clinton Proposes Assistance To Troubled Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration announced today that its plan for improving the nation's most distressed neighborhoods would combine minor new spending, moderate tax breaks for businesses and a major new emphasis on the coordination of existing programs.
The program would assist 110 neighborhoods, chosen through a competitive process. But the top 10, to be called "empowerment zones," would receive most of the advantages. Six would be urban, three rural and one on an Indian reservation. 
 In a conference call today to leaders from five communities, President Clinton said the plan, which would spend $8.1 billion over five years, would bring "new economic growth, opportunity and hope in areas long denied their piece of the American dream."
Of that money, $4.1 billion would be tax credits to businesses for each worker they hire from the distressed neighborhoods. Another $1 billion would be new spending, and $3 billion would come from existing programs by earmarking them for the selected areas.
 
Variation of Idea
 The anti-poverty initiative is a variation on the idea of "enterprise zones," which was enthusiastically endorsed by previous Republican Administrations but never became law. Jack F. Kemp, President George Bush's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, argued that cuts in capital gains taxes could attract businesses into distressed neighborhoods.
The Clinton plan even borrows a favorite word of some conservative anti-poverty planners: empowerment.
But Clinton Administration officials place less stress on the tax breaks, which they say are insufficient to attract businesses that fear assaults on their buildings or employees.
Instead, they are calling for a more coordinated approach that would integrate economic planning with a social services strategy intended to stabilize neighborhoods. "Not a dime will go out without a coordinated strategy developed at the grass-roots level," Mr. Clinton said in the conference call, whose participants included Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York.
 
Waivers on U.S. Policies
 Under the Clinton plan, communities would submit outlines of their business and social services strategies. They would be encouraged to seek waivers from Federal agencies to use existing, highly regulated programs in new and creative ways. Most Federal programs are now bound by complex regulations that make experiments difficult if not impossible.
Programs that provide money for nutrition, education and day care, for instance, might be combined to create a comprehensive center for children.
"The mayors told us, 'What would really help more than another little program here and there is if you would take away some of the strings that restrict us,' " said Gene Sperling, a White House deputy assistant for economic policy, who helped form the plan.
The Federal selection panel would be led by the Cabinet secretaries from the relevant domestic agencies, including the departments of Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Agriculture and Labor. In selecting the neighborhoods, they would be agreeing to provide the waivers.
Richard Cowden, executive director of the American Association of Enterprise Zones, endorsed the plan. "I think states and localities will find this is much more flexible," than previous proposals, he said. The association represents governments that run the 700 enterprise zones created under local and state laws.
Mr. Clinton's proposal comes after a campaign in which he said little about the country's most blighted neighborhoods, focusing instead on a broader appeal to the middle class. As President, he has stressed some portions of his strategy to help the working poor, calling for additional tax credits to supplement their wages, for instance, and a system of national health insurance to cover all Americans.
But he has not taken action on his campaign promises to overhaul the welfare system, and today's plan is the first to address the poorest Americans.
 
Earlier Plans Watered Down
 In the past, proposals for enterprise zones have been watered down in Congress, with many lawmakers trying to gain one for their own district, thus diluting the advantage to any one area.
The Clinton plan tries to deal with that problem by creating 100 "enterprise communities," that would receive priority for certain Federal programs, including community policing and community development banks.
But the more expensive incentives are to be concentrated on the 10 neighborhoods with the most promising plans. "We don't want to dilute the money so much that we don't learn anything," from the process of local experimentation, Mr. Sperling said.
The Clinton proposal also offers a different kind of tax break from the earlier plan, which would have spent about $5 billion over five years. That plan, pushed by the Bush Administration, mainly offered cuts in the capital gains taxes paid by employers who move to distressed areas. The Clinton plan attaches its tax breaks, up to $5,000 for each employee they hire from a designated zone, to hiring policies.

Sales of New Cars and Trucks Surged Last Month

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 4

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and trucks rose 10.1 percent in late April, as automotive demand rose for the third consecutive month, to the highest level in almost 30 months.
For all of April, figures released today by the auto makers showed an 11 percent increase. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales for the April 21-30 period was 6.9 million, up from 6.1 million during the comparable period last year and up from 6.6 million in mid-April. But according to the broader measure of demand for all vehicles, the seasonally adjusted annual rate was 14.1 million cars and trucks in April, compared with 13.6 million in March and 12.9 million in February.
In large measure, the steady increase in automotive demand has been accompanied by the recovery of ground lost by the Big Three to Japanese producers. In April, the American auto makers accounted for 73.9 percent of total vehicle sales, compared with 70.8 percent of sales in April 1992.
 
 
'Strengthened Our Optimism'
 Even the General Motors Corporation, which has had the weakest recovery of the the Big Three, posted strong increases for the month. J. Michael Losh, vice president and group executive for sales in North America, said an 11 percent sales increase at his company in late April had "strengthened our optimism."
Economists, financial analysts, dealers and auto executives concurred that demand had reached its first sustained recovery since the fall of 1990, when the recession and the Persian Gulf war combined to depress automotive buying. Indeed, the poor results helped precipitate a financial debacle at G.M. that swept its chairman and several top executives out of office.
David Healy, automotive analyst for S. G. Warburg & Company in New York said good weather, consumer optimism and pricing incentives played a role in the recovery.
"Showroom traffic has increased," said Leo Mayas, sales manager for Robbins Chevrolet-Nissan-Oldsmobile in Houston. "It seems like people are more confident."
 
 
'Positive Momentum'
 Robert L. Rewey, vice president of marketing and sales operations for the Ford Motor Company, said, "Importantly, the automotive market appears to be accelerating its positive momentum."
But Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, cautioned that "with economic indicators pointing toward slow growth, it will be hard to top April's sales pace."
Stronger sales of light trucks, which include sport-utilities vehicles and mini-vans, have sustained the recovery, as more and more buyers are switching from cars. April marked a record month in light-truck sales for all of the Big Three.
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks in late April totaled 440,027; sales of domestically built cars in the period rose 8.9 percent, to 256,855, while sales of domestically built light trucks rose 11.8 percent, to 183,172.
For the month, total automotive sales, including domestics and imports, totaled 1,252,968, an increase of 11 percent from April, 1992. Sales of cars rose 7.4 percent, to 773,485; sales of light trucks rose 17.5 percent, to 479,483.
 
 
G.M.'s Aggressive Pricing
 G.M. has been able to gain ground by pricing its vehicles aggressively, through a combination of discounts, rebates and price increases that are more moderate than competitors. The Cadillac de Ville, for example, carries up to a $2,000 rebate in some parts of the country, which helped increase its sales 23.1 percent for the month. A restyled de Ville is being offered this fall.
G.M.'s cars sales for April rose 6.3 percent, to 280,937; G.M.'s light-truck sales rose 19 percent, to 163,154. Ford's car sales rose 12.5 percent, to 164,669; Ford's light-truck sales rose 15.2 percent, to 145,200. The Chrysler Corporation's car sales rose 38.2 percent, to 76,248; Chrysler's light-truck sales rose 21.8 percent, to 115,809.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales rose 5.8 percent, to 65,585, partly on the strength of its Lexus luxury division; Toyota's light-truck sales rose 15.3 percent, to 22,791.
The Honda Motor Company's car sales fell 4.3 percent, to 60,015. The Nissan Motor Corporation's car sales rose 23.6 percent, to 41,879, while light-truck sales rose 11.5 percent, to 16,463.

'Drive American' Ban
 WASHINGTON, May 4 (AP) -- Foreign auto makers have been barred from the "Drive American Quality" event on May 25 and May 26, at which members of Congress, their staffs and Clinton Administration officials will get a chance to drive their choice of 120 cars made by General Motors, Chrysler and Ford.
An official of the United Auto Workers, which is co-sponsoring the event with the United States auto makers, confirmed today that cars with foreign nameplates will not be allowed -- even if they are made in the United States.

HEADLINE: European Gypsies Issue Call For Human Rights at Meeting

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SNAGOV, Romania, May 2

 BODY:
At a time of ethnic warfare in the Balkans and of growing ethnic tensions elsewhere in Europe, the continent's most widely dispersed minority, the Gypsies, have begun to seek international recognition and protection.
For the majority of Europe's estimated eight million Gypsies, who live at a bare subsistence level, the highest priorities are enough food for the day and shelter from the elements. 
 But after recent attacks on Gypsies in Germany, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Croatia, a handful of Gypsy leaders are starting self-help initiatives and joint appeals for international aid.
Assaults have left 26 Gypsies dead in the former Czechoslovakia, 6 dead in Romania and hundreds of Gypsy dwellings burned to the ground in the last three years. The assaults, combined with widespread poverty, have prompted tens of thousands of Gypsies to flee northward to wealthier countries, all of which would like them to go away.
 
Romania Co-Sponsors Meeting
 The atmosphere of heightened hostility and the dire economic plight of most Gypsies formed the background of a four-day conference here in a former royal villa overlooking Lake Snagov.
The conference was co-sponsored by the Romanian Government and the Project on Ethnic Relations, a Princeton, N.J. group that is financed by the Carnegie Foundation. It was organized in large part by Gypsy leaders from 14 countries and it drew government representatives from 11 countries.
According to the organizers from Princeton, Alan Kassof and Livia Plaks, the role of Romania as a co-sponsor represented the first time that a European government gave official recognition to the Gypsy community.
The diversity of Gypsies spread across more than a score of countries became immediately evident. Although their language, called Romany, originated in India a thousand years ago, it is spoken in widely varying dialects. As a result, many of the Gypsies here had to communicate through interpreters or in French or English.
 
Who Is King of Gypsies?
 There were other differences. At one stage supporters of Iulian, who has proclaimed himself Emperor of all Gypsies, got into a heated argument with supporters of Ion, who calls himself the King of the Gypsies.
But the dominant figure of the conference was Nicolae Gheorghe, a 47-year-old sociologist from Bucharest. Mr. Gheorghe drafted the agenda for the conference, which included "human rights in full equality," projects to link widely dispersed Gypsy communities, job training, creation of a Gypsy information center and "documentation of violence against Gypsies."
Asked to characterize the results of the Snagov meeting, Mr. Gheorghe said: "It is a beginning. We are trying to establish our identity."
At the conclusion, the delegates approved a statement they called the Snagov Declaration, urging European governments and international organizations to pay more attention to issues that concern Gypsies.
The problems Gypsies face became evident during a trip by delegates to Mihai Kogalniceanu, a town of 10,000 on the Black Sea where 16 Gypsy families were burned out of their homes in 1991 after an ethnic clash.
Working with Mr. Gheorghe, nearly all of the burned dwellings have since been replaced by the local authorities.

The growth in trading in natural gas futures may be here to stay

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
SO many traders have swarmed into the natural gas futures pit in the last few months that the New York Mercantile Exchange is about to move them into a remodeled, expanded trading area.
The exchange is acting none too soon. More contracts were traded for natural gas on April 27 than for any other futures contract that day for a physical commodity on the New York exchange, even more than crude oil. It was the first time that natural gas had led the pack in trading volume since the exchange introduced gas futures contracts in April 1990. 
 The large swing in prices this year for the spot-month contract is the biggest reason for the trading surge. "The futures are a more reliable and more financially secure means of transacting business" when prices are unpredictable, said Philip K. Verleger, an energy commodities specialist and visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The May contract reached a high of $2.758 per million British thermal units when it expired on April 23, compared with the low settlement price this year on Jan. 19 at $1.551 for the February contract. The June contract gained 2.8 cents yesterday, at $2.317. A year ago, the spot-month contract price was less than $1.60.
Gas marketers and futures traders are unsure whether trading in natural gas contracts can permanently overtake crude oil, the world's most widely traded nonfinancial futures commodity.
Special factors have been driving natural gas prices in the last few months -- like March snowstorms in the East and new accounting rules that prompted pipeline companies to reduce gas inventories in their transportation systems.
Yet natural gas is a vast industry in the United States, and many specialists say this year's trading surge is no aberration. The industry's share of the nation's total energy market is 25 percent and growing. Its price pattern has also been more volatile than the price trend for crude oil, which has been unusually calm for two years. Crude supplies 40 percent of the nation's energy.
Mr. Verleger said that gas buyers, producers and Wall Street firms that specialize in gas contracts were behind much of the trading surge, not speculators. Big users of natural gas like steel and auto plants and local utilities use the fixed-price contracts to limit and spread their risks that prices will zoom to financially ruinous levels. For their part, many producers are willing to pledge deliveries at prices more than 60 percent above the depressed levels a year ago.
AIG Trading, Louis Dreyfus Energy, Morgan Stanley and Paribas Futures Inc. are among the most active Wall Street firms in gas-futures trading. The Enron Corporation, the big natural gas company, is another major participant.
Contracts on the New York exchange can be bought for delivery on dates as distant as 18 months. Options, swaps and other variations written on those monthly contracts are designed for gas deliveries at a fixed price for 10 years or more.
The current price sequence for monthly gas futures contracts indicates that spot prices will fall to $2.244 this summer. The peak price for the next 12 months is on the December contract, at $2.64. The price average for those 12 months is $2.327 but it can shift rapidly, said Brian Manolis of Paribas Futures. It was below $2 in March.
But some analysts say the spot price cannot stay above $2.50 for long because, at that price, hundreds of large gas users switch to cheaper low-sulfur fuel oil. That should lower demand.
"To date, we have not seen prices sticking over $2.50 for any substantial period of time," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, chief executive of Enron's gas marketing group in Houston.

Law Students Get Close To Human Rights Cases

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
The Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School is so little known that its phone number is not listed in the law school directory.
But the clinic's work is public. Operating out of a small office at the law school are 10 to 17 law students, sometimes exhilarated, sometimes depressed, often bleary with fatigue. The students are part of the team that filed suit in Federal District Court in Brooklyn in March 1992, challenging the United States' policy of detaining Haitian refugees at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. 
 Last May the team expanded the case to challenge President George Bush's policy of forcibly returning all Haitians to Haiti, without determining whether they were political or economic refugees.
The students have spent the last year working 40 to 100 hours a week on behalf of the refugees, reading 50,000 documents, flying to Guantanamo and missing classes.
"I don't think any of us realized what we were getting into," said Veronique Sanchez, a 27-year-old student from Chantilly, Va.
In the next week or two, the students expect a decision on the Guantanamo issue from Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. of Federal District Court. The interdiction part of the case has been argued in the Supreme Court, and a decision is expected in June.
The students' odyssey had its genesis in a law school course taught by Professor Harold Koh and an adjunct, Michael R. Ratner, in which students represent victims of human rights abuses in Federal courts. Some recent graduates persuaded the professors to file suit on behalf of the Haitians, and to develop the case, the two men wanted firsthand accounts from Haitian refugees who had just been released from Guantanamo and were being detained in Miami.
Guido Calabresi, the dean of the law school, agreed to send 12 students to Miami to interview the refugees in March 1992, during spring break.
"There were cultural differences," said Laura Ho, a 23-year-old student from Tacoma, Wash. "I'd ask a refugee, 'Why did you flee?' and he would say, 'I had problems.' "
The students had to elicit specific information. Where had the refugees been on the night of Sept. 29, 1991, when President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted by the military? Who in their families was killed? What organizations did they belong to? Were they starving? Were they working?
Each night the students wrote up the interviews, filled out forms and, at the end of the week, returned to Yale.
In a lawsuit, both sides are entitled to see the other side's relevant documents.
"The Government gave us 50,000 documents in one month, memos from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the military on Guantanamo," said Steve Roos, 27, a student from Seattle. "Each student would read at least a thousand."
Students slept one or two hours a night for weeks at a time, poring over the documents and finally winnowing them to 500.
By December, six of the students who were taking a class in property law realized they had missed two-thirds of the classes, which were held from 10 to 11 A.M., four days a week. "A crisis always broke out between 9 and 10," Mr. Roos said. To avoid failing, one person went to one class, took notes and made copies for the others. Another person went to the next class. The six managed to pass.
A few weeks ago the students had a breakthrough. Judge Johnson, who was appointed to the Federal bench by Mr. Bush in 1991, ordered the Government to provide adequate medical care to 50 of the sickest refugees.
When the Haitians arrived in New York last month, Ms. Ho, Mr. Roos and another student, Michael Wishnie, 27, of Newton, Mass., were at the airport to meet them. "There was incredible joy on their faces -- and ours," Mr. Roos said.
And Professor Koh's response? Mr. Roos replied, "He said to us, 'Isn't this why you went to law school?' "

HEADLINE: In Yen Windfall, U.S. Companies Prefer Profits

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 30

 BODY:
For all their complaints about how hard it is to do business in Japan, American manufacturers of cars, computers and chips are not trying to increase sales by cutting prices here after the big 10 percent surge in the Japanese yen against the dollar.
That could mean that the yen's appreciation, while making Japanese goods more costly in America, will not be as effective as Washington hopes in building up American imports to Japan and shrinking the United States trade deficit with Japan. 
 At a time when the United States Government is trying to take a tougher stance to increase sales of American goods in Japan, the pricing policies could leave American companies vulnerable to charges that they are not doing enough to help themselves but instead are milking profits from Japan by preferring high prices over high market share.
"Unfortunately at present we don't have any examples of the lowering of prices by U.S. companies," said Sadanobu Taguchi, deputy director of the price policy division at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. "This is a chance for U.S. companies to get a large share in the Japanese market if they change their prices."
Americans say there are valid business reasons for not lowering their prices. They say that distributing goods in Japan is costly. Some who manufacture in Japan say the currency difference is irrelevant and others say that merely cutting prices is no guarantee that sales will improve.
"I think Washington economists should be criticized for not understanding how American products sell here," said John Stern, the representative in Japan of the American Electronics Association. "I think Washington should stop assuming that exchange rates are a panacea for a trade deficit."
But some Japanese executives see the profit motive as the main reason for the failure to cut prices. "Our past experience shows that almost all foreign companies, more or less, want to take in the extra profit from the high yen for themselves," said Takeshi Yoda, deputy head of international business at Meidi-ya, a supermarket chain.
Most economists say that weakening the dollar versus the yen will lead to a decline in the United States trade deficit with Japan over time. That is what happened in the few years after the 1985 Plaza Accord, which sharply raised the value of the yen. However, Japan's industry seemed to adjust to the higher yen eventually and Japan's trade surplus with the world, which exceeded $130 billion last year, is now higher than it was before the Plaza agreement.
But in the short run, the higher yen is likely to lead to an increase in Japan's trade surplus, at least when it is measured in dollars. That is because it takes time for buyers to switch from expensive Japanese products to cheaper foreign ones. In the meantime, the stronger yen means that sales of Japanese products abroad account for more in dollar terms.
In theory, as the yen rises against the dollar, an American company that had been selling a personal computer here for 250,000 yen, or about $2,000, could now charge 225,000 yen and still get $2,000. If the price in yen is kept the same, however, the American company will record greater profits in dollar terms.
To be sure, accusations that companies try to milk profits from the strengthening yen are also leveled at Japanese companies. The electric utilities here are taking heat from consumers and industry for their refusal to lower their rates, despite presumably paying less for imported fuel.
 
Price Survey Under Way
 The Economic Planning Agency is conducting a price survey to see if the benefits from the higher yen are being passed on to Japanese consumers in the form of lower prices.
There has been a flurry of activity in supermarkets and department stores, which are cutting prices on foreign meat, wine, clothing and the like. These sales are advertised as aiming to pass on to consumers the benefits of the stronger yen. But privately supermarket executives say that the yen's rise is merely an excuse to have a sale for competitive purposes.
American companies offer several reasons for not having adjusted prices. One is simply that the yen's rise, from about 124 to the dollar in early February to under 111 now, is simply too recent and might be temporary.
"I don't think we have discussed it yet," said Kei-ichi Murai, spokesman for Eastman Kodak's Japanese subsidiary, which sells film here. "We are not sure if this trend is going to last forever."
The short time period since the yen's rise started, however, has not stopped Japanese companies like Sony, Honda and Mazda from announcing price increases for the products they sell in the United States.
Some Japanese distributors of American-made products have already stocked up with goods. Yanase & Company, the exclusive importer and dealer of General Motors automobiles in Japan, said it already paid for 90 percent of its inventory for the 1993 model year at a time when the yen was weaker. That leaves little leeway for lowering prices until the next model year, which begins in the fall, said Shoji Sugimoto, a director. In any case, he said, having automobile prices fluctuate monthly or quarterly with currency rates would make customers "uncomfortable."
Others say that strategic marketing factors and supply and demand, not just currency rates, play a role in determining prices. Walden C. Rhines, a vice president of Texas Instruments, said that "right now demand is very strong around the world" for semiconductors so there is no need to cut prices.
Cray Research, the American supercomputer manufacturer that has been vocal in complaining about lack of access to Japan's market, also has no plans to change prices because of the yen. "Our product is already price competitive," said Tak Kato, manager of strategic marketing of Cray Research Japan, who said the company recently introduced a new product line.
 
Japan-Incurred Costs
 Other companies, like I.B.M. and Procter & Gamble, say that they do much of their manufacturing here, so their costs are mainly yen-denominated and do not change when the yen appreciates. Even companies that import products say that much of the price in Japan reflects rent and salaries and other costs incurred in Japan.
"The local cost of doing business here is very high and it doesn't go down at all," said the head of Japanese operations for an American cosmetics company.
Another reason often cited for not lowering prices is that Japanese consumers care more about quality than about price.
"Just trying to sell a product here that's cheaper is no way to gain market share," said Mr. Stern of the American Electronics Association. In Japan, he said, "discounting your product somehow implies there's something wrong with it."
Moreover, Japanese companies are prone to match lower prices to hold onto their market share. "If you're a $50 million American company and your biggest competitor is a $42 billion Japanese company, you'd be crazy to try to get in a price war," he said.
Mr. Stern also said that American electronic products that were successful here were often imitated by the Japanese manufacturers after a couple of years. "People want to make profits off the product while it's still unique," he said
 
Discount Stores Popular
 Japanese executives say the notion that Japanese consumers avoid inexpensive products is outmoded. Discount stores have become popular in the recent economic slump, and some American personal computer companies have broken into the Japanese market by offering lower prices.
The trade ministry, which has done a pricing survey for the last few years, has found that in some cases, foreign products sell at far higher prices in Japan than they do in other nations. The foreign companies argue that this is because of Japan's bloated distribution system and not because of their own pricing policies.
This year, in an apparent attempt to embarrass such companies, the ministry said it would consider printing specific brand names in its survey. That sent some American and European businessmen into a panic, and they and their governments protested. The Japanese eventually dropped the idea.

HEADLINE: Dow Dips Slightly on Economic Concerns

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market floundered yesterday, thrown off an already uncertain course by more bad news on the economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average was off a fraction of a point, as other major indexes rose slightly in relatively heavy trading. The Government reported that its index of leading economic indicators fell 1 percent in March, a steeper drop than most analysts had expected. 
 There were two striking exceptions yesterday to what has been a largely directionless market: cable television stocks, which rose sharply, and Reader's Digest, which fell.
 
Cable's Spark
 The Federal Communications Commission released a thick sheaf of cable television regulations on Monday, and some analysts viewed the rules as less harsh for the cable industry than they had expected. Cable stocks were led by Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable system operator, which rose 2 1/2, to 21 1/2. It was the most active stock on any exchange, with nearly 13.7 million shares changing hands.
Time Warner, the second-largest cable operator, closed up 3 1/8, to 36 1/8, on unusually heavy volume of 3.3 million shares. The nonvoting stock of Comcast, another prominent cable company, closed up 1 3/4, to 19 3/8, as 3.04 million shares were traded. The company's voting shares were also active, gaining 2 1/8, to 20 5/8. Cablevision Systems closed up 3 5/8, to 33 1/4.
Reader's Digest hit a new low during the session, at 40, but recovered slightly to close at 40 1/2, down 6. The publisher of magazines and books announced lower than expected earnings, primarily because of lagging sales in its books and home-entertainment division. For investors, the real shock was the company's announcement that it would take up to two years to fix its problems in the American book market.
 
Stability in Gold
 The gold stocks closed unchanged to slightly mixed. An exception was Newmont Mining, which has sold a large stake to the financier George Soros. It closed up 1 1/4, to 48 3/8. Gold contracts for June delivery closed up 40 cents, to $355.70 an ounce.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.27, to 3,446.19, after trading in a narrow range for most of the session. The previous day it staged a late 19-point rally after a generally listless session.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index closed up 0.69, to 245.23, and gaining stocks outnumbered losing stocks by 1,267 to 702. Volume of 268.3 million shares was 19.2 percent higher than Monday's volume of 225 million shares.
The Standard & Poor's 500 closed up 1.59, to 444.05, and the Nasdaq composite index, made up of smaller-capitalization and high-technology stocks, was up 11.45, to 678.16. The American Stock Exchange composite index closed up 2.55, to 424.76.
The Dow rose as much as 15 points in early trading, seemingly shrugging off the gloomy report on leading economic indicators. But by noon, the Dow fell into a narrow trading range that straddled both positive and negative territory.
Intel was the second-most-active stock on any exchange, with trading volume of 4.3 million shares. It closed up 4 3/8, to 101 3/8, possibly on an analyst's speculation that Intel was negotiating to acquire an I.B.M. plant to increase its ability to make microprocessors. Intel has had trouble meeting demand for its 486 microprocessor, the heart of many personal computers.

HEADLINE: Regulator Says Connecticut's Largest Power Company Harassed Worker

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Northeast Utilities, Connecticut's largest power company, persecuted one of its engineers because he called a safety problem at a nuclear reactor to the company's attention, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said yesterday.
Moreover, it said, Northeast delayed reporting the problem even though it could have affected the safety of other reactors around the country. 
 The Federal commission said the violation of its rules was even worse because top officials of Northeast, including the company's chairman, were "aware of it, but failed to act in an effective manner to correct the situation."
It proposed a $100,000 fine and characterized the violation as being in the second most severe category; nationally, only three or four such violations are issued each year, and Northeast has not been cited that way since 1984.
 
Retaliatory Actions
 "We take whistle-blowers seriously, and we expect our licensees to take them seriously also," said Joseph Fouchard, the chief spokesman for the commission. The commission found, among other things, that managers at the utility, in retaliation, improperly sought to give the engineer, Paul M. Blanch, bad performance evaluations and initiated an audit of overtime and expense reports in the department he supervised.
The company said it was working on a detailed rebuttal and would file it within the 30 days allowed under the commission's rules.
Mr. Blanch, 51, who filed a complaint four years ago, said, "I feel very vindicated." But he added: "They agreed with me, but in the meantime I am unemployed. The action against Northeast and to protect me should have occurred within three months; why does it take four years?" He had quit his job at Northeast in February, after 20 years.
His next goal, Mr. Blanch said, is to get a job in which he could improve the quality of regulation of the nuclear industry. He is suing the company that makes the transmitters, Rosemount, of Eden Prairie, Minn., a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Corporation, contending that the company "influenced Northeast to supress my uncovery of the defect."
 
Further Study Pledged
 The chairman of the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, Clifton A. Leonhardt, said he found the Federal report "very troubling."
"It suggests a violation of a basic compact that's involved in the operation of four nuclear plants within the borders of Connecticut," he said. His agency will study the report, he said, and decide whether it will take action beyond what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has done.
At Northeast, a spokesman, Anthony Castagno, said: "Our position is that no employees or supervisors or managers did anything that violated regulations at all. We don't believe there was any harassment or intimidation."
Mr. Castagno said that the commission had investigated the company in 1990, after other workers complained of harassment, and that it had found the majority of employees felt comfortable raising safety concerns. Since then, he said, Northeast had established a phone number for employees to make anonymous calls, installed suggestion boxes and established a "peer program" under which employees could relay their concerns to workers at their level to be passed on to managers.
 
Helped Develop Solution
 But in its report yesterday, the commission said that "various workers" at Northeast said they would not raise safety issues with management, because of the way Mr. Blanch had been treated.
Mr. Blanch discovered in the late 1980's that an electronic transmitter in use in one of Northeast's reactors -- as well as plants around the country -- tended to fail without giving any indication that it had done so. The result of the failure was to leave control-room instruments indicating a reassuring, but false, water level. Northeast adopted a solution that Mr. Blanch helped develop, a computer program that watches for a telltale lack of activity.
When other utilities that use the equipment formed a joint research group on the issue, the commission said, Northeast and the manufacturer of the equipment blocked Mr. Blanch from becoming chairman of the joint group.
The commission also faulted the company yesterday for failing to report promptly that in 1986 and 1987 5 of the 12 transmitters of the type Mr. Blanch had identified had failed. The failure file a prompt report is serious, the commission said, because the problem "could involve the safety of other nuclear-power plants." But the commission did not propose a fine.

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Fall 1%, Casting Doubt on Recovery

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The Government said yesterday that its main economic forecasting gauge plunged 1 percent in March, the biggest drop since the middle of the 1990-91 recession. It was the latest report to raise questions about the strength and durability of the economic expansion.
President Clinton used the portent of possible future weakness that was suggested by the index of leading indicators to urge Congress to adopt his budget plan without delay. The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, labeled the report "a wake-up call for the White House to drop its tax-and-spend campaign." 
 But economists inside and outside the Government took a less alarmist view. A top Administration economist who insisted on anonymity because he had not yet been confirmed said that the decline was a "cause for concern" rather than a harbinger of another recession.
David A. Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, said, "The economy is very slow but not nearly in as much trouble as that number suggests."
Some economists said they expected the indicators to turn up next month. "As the spring weather sets in, activity should rebound enough to offset most if not all of the drop in March leading indicators," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence.
Indeed, other reports yesterday suggested that consumer spending revived in April. Sales at major retail chains rose 2 percent from March, according to the latest Johnson Redbook survey, and car and truck sales surged. [Page D5.]
And several of the 11 leading indicators -- including jobless claims and consumer expectations -- have turned positive since March, suggesting that the index may not keep declining.
Still, the March drop in the leading index, which seeks to predict economic activity six months ahead, was not only large, but pervasive: nine of its components fell. The biggest negative factors were a large drop in building permits, a rise in initial jobless claims, a shortening of the factory workweek and a worsening of consumer expectations about future economic conditions. The only two bright spots were minuscule increases in the prices of stocks and industrial materials.
Economists fretted that many of the components -- from money supply to new orders for consumer goods -- appear to have peaked several months ago, another indication that the economy might have gotten stuck on a plateau after December.
And several executives confirmed that the expansion, while continuing, was quite sluggish.
"Loan demand is soft," said John B. McCoy Jr., chief executive of the Banc One Corporation, the nation's eighth-largest bank. "We're seeing some loan growth out west in Colorado and Arizona and a little in Texas, but other areas have slowed down."
 
 
'It's Not Broad Based'
 Brian D. McLaughlin, chief executive of Hurco Industries, a midsize machine tool company in Indianapolis, said that while his business had been picking up in the last three months, orders were coming primarily from the Midwest and from a just couple of industries. "It's not broad based," he said.
Private and Government economists, however, warned that too much should not be read into a one-month decline in the leading indicators. "It would be premature," said Larry Moran, an economist at the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which compiles the leading indicators.
The forecasting index has occasionally predicted recessions that never arrived: for example, in 1987 after the stock market crash and in the early years of the long, strong Reagan recovery.
To reach the conclusion that the expansion is in serious trouble, Mr. Moran said: "You need to have a big decline. One percent is big. You need widespread decline. Nine of 11 is widespread. But we also need several months. We only have one month."
 
 
Index Above Pre-Recession Peak
 In the case of March, the decline followed a fairly rapid rise in the six previous months. And the leading index remains well above its pre-recession peak.
And some of the decline in March indicators -- namely those related to construction and possibly the factory workweek -- may have reflected the effect of blizzards and floods for the month. Most economists, including the Administration economist, say that several components have since turned up.
In addition, initial jobless claims have improved, dropping from 376,000 to 367,000 in April. And consumer expectations have edged higher, according to the Conference Board. The purchasing managers' survey on Monday, while negative, showed that orders for key consumer goods -- clothing and cars -- were up in April. And that survey also showed that delivery times, one component of the leading index, lengthened in April, another plus.
 
 
Drop in Money Supply
 There have been some declines in April, too. Stock prices edged down in the month and so did prices for materials. There was also a drop in the M-2 money supply (currency, checking accounts and some time deposits).
"It's tough to make a buck, margins are still brutal," said Michel D. Hobbs, a Connecticut home builder, "but activity seems to have picked up in the last few weeks."
Mr. McLaughlin of Hurco said that business had picked up "primarily because a lot of smaller shops are adding overtime and buying new equipment. They are signs that we haven't seen in a long time."

HEADLINE: Timetable Outlined for Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The nation's top trade official said today that the Administration hoped to complete a tentative agreement on reducing tariffs and eliminating quotas by early July. The ambitious goal reflects a quietly growing enthusiasm among Administration officials for a global trade pact but could complicate efforts to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said he hoped to strike the deal on access to foreign markets before President Clinton goes to Tokyo in early July for a meeting of the heads of state from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. Such a compromise would clear away the biggest remaining obstacle to the completion of the global free-trade talks to broaden the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
 Mr. Kantor's comment represented the first time a Clinton Administration official had set a clear timetable for industrialized nations to complete a global trade pact this year.
 
'Some Positive News'
 The Bush Administration negotiated a compromise last November with the European Community on farm subsidies, the other issue that has bedeviled the current round of world trade talks, which began in Uruguay nearly seven years ago.
"What we're attempting to do is work on market access in the Uruguay Round and have a preliminary agreement on market access, especially in the industrial products area and services area, prior to the G-7 meeting in Tokyo," Mr. Kantor said, "so that at the G-7 meeting we can have some positive news from those meetings about the Uruguay Round, which will then, we hope, give a great impetus to the round itself."
In a subsequent telephone interview, Mr. Kantor said he envisioned a deal among Canada, Japan, the European Community and the United States. The trade ministers from all four trading partners are scheduled to meet at the end of next week in Toronto, and Mr. Kantor said he planned to pursue this goal there.
Such a preliminary deal would still need approval from the rest of the 112 nations in the GATT talks. But Jules Katz, who oversaw the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT negotiations for the Bush Administration, said that poor countries were eager to join a deal by industrialized nations. A preliminary deal would not set tariffs for every category of product but would leave many tariff cuts unresolved as bargaining chips for talks with poor countries.
 
Willing and Able Leadership
 Asked why he thought such a goal might be feasible now after so many years of failure, Mr. Kantor initially joked, "Maybe naivete." He then contended that President Clinton was showing strong leadership on the issue, and that American trading partners were very willing to negotiate.
The completion of national elections five weeks ago in France, where the free-trade talks are very unpopular and became a campaign issue, also helped, Mr. Kantor said.
Other Washington trade experts point out that a shift in the community's leadership in early January resulted in new leaders who are more willing and political able to strike a deal. The experts also said that the odds of a successful GATT deal seem to be improving now because the Clinton Administration appears to be seeking a less ambitious pact than did Bush Administration.
For example, Mr. Kantor has called for only a few restrictions on the ability of American companies to seek protection from foreign goods that are subsidized or sold below cost, a practice known as dumping. The Bush Administration had sought extensive GATT restrictions on these dumping and antisubsidy cases.
Another Democratic Administration, President Carter's, concluded the last round of GATT negotiations in 1979 by pursuing a modest agreement after the Nixon and Ford Administrations had failed to negotiate a broader pact.
 
A Spate of Talks
 Mr. Kantor spoke today at a conference at the State Department organized by the Council of the Americas, a trade group of nearly 300 multinational companies that do business in Latin America. He also pointed out that the United States and the European Community planned more frequent minister-level meetings on the world trade talks in the coming weeks than at any time in the last seven years.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Kantor met with Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's vice president for external economic affairs to discuss trade issues. He is scheduled to meet Sir Leon again here on Thursday, in Toronto at the end of next week and in Paris at the beginning of June. Both sides have refused to reveal any details of their discussions.
President Clinton said almost nothing about GATT in the Presidential campaign. So he did not come to office with the same commitment that he had made, in a campaign speech on Oct. 4, to put the North American Free Trade Agreement in place.
Mr. Kantor said very little about the GATT in his first weeks in office but now mentions it routinely as the backdrop for various bilateral trade negotiations with the European Community and Japan.
Sir Leon and Mr. Kantor have indicated in recent weeks that they sought progress before the Tokyo meeting. But Mr. Kantor's comment today was the first indication that an actual deal might be struck by then.
 
Effect on North American Accord
 GATT negotiations on tariffs are likely to create political difficulties for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would eliminate trade barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States. Some industries that would benefit from the North American pact, like textiles, would be hurt by the tariff concessions now planned for GATT.
Mr. Kantor, however, said the two pacts could be handled at the same time because both would produce American jobs.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Retreat of Dollar Continues Amid Jitters Over Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar weakened further against other major currencies yesterday amid jitters about the United States economy. Trading volume was light ahead of April employment data due out Friday.
Market participants are hoping that the payroll numbers, the first major figures not influenced by March's severe winter storms, will give a more accurate picture of where the economy is headed. 
 The British pound, meanwhile, gained only marginally against the dollar as traders continued to take profits following sterling's recent rally.
The dollar began declining in London in a delayed reaction to Monday's weaker-than-expected report on United States manufacturing from the National Association of Purchasing Managers. The London markets were closed on Monday for a national holiday.
But more sour economic news from Germany kept the dollar from falling further against the mark. Six leading economic institutes predicted in an annual report that Germany's economy will shrink 2 percent this year. The group added that stingy interest rate cuts by the German central bank, the Bundesbank, are prolonging the country's recession.
That raised some speculation that the Bundesbank's central council, which meets tomorrow, will step up interest-rate reductions to help stimulate Germany's economy. That would tend to help the dollar by making mark-denominated investments less attractive.
"I think the reason the dollar's breakdown was not sustained is because people stepped back and said, 'Why should we push the dollar any lower if the Germany economy is still weak?' " said Geoffrey Dennis, a currency strategist at James Capel & Company.
The dollar weakened against the Japanese yen but failed to break below the psychologically important 110-yen level, in part because of fears of further central bank intervention following last week's action by the Federal Reserve.
Financial markets in Japan were closed yesterday for a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 110.25 yen. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar fell to 110.25 yen from late Monday's 110.78 yen.

 BODY:
A sports quiz:
Three teams -- the New York Knicks, the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers -- got off to the best start in the professional basketball playoffs that began last week, each winning its first two games. What else do these teams have in common?
Sheer coincidence, probably, but they are known as three of the most ardent users of computers in the National Basketball Association. In the last two years, pro basketball has become a test bed for mobile computing, and the Knicks, Bulls and Lakers have enthusiastically embraced the technology. 
 Using big sports arenas as their factory floors, and games won as the key gauge of market prowess, pro basketball teams are now employing computers much as other businesses do, especially companies with managers and workers who are constantly on the move.
 
Coming Up With Predictions
 Armed with notebook computers, fax modems and specialized software, the teams compile scouting reports, analyze statistics and create models to predict what players and teams might do in specific game situations. In a matter of minutes and a few keystrokes, the machines permit coaches to do work that used to take hours of laborious sorting through statistic sheets and play diagrams.
To motivate players, some teams, like the Knicks, compile specialized performance rankings, not only shooting percentages but also "teamwork" measures like the number of times a player dives for a loose ball or helps a teammate on defense. The player rankings are posted on the locker room wall. If a player sees his performance slipping in some category, the message to improve is clear.
Among mobile computing customers, "basketball teams are as good a prototype as any," said Richard Shaffer of Technologic Partners, a computer consultant in New York. "They don't have offices. They travel a lot. And, hey, it's a business."
Besides basketball coaches, the market may include an estimated 40 million mobile workers -- from traveling salesmen to interstate truck drivers -- although analysts disagree on precisely how to define the mobile computing business and the size of the potential market.
Today's primary mobile "platform," the notebook computer, accounted for about 13 percent of worldwide personal computer sales last year, according to Dataquest Inc., a market research firm. Within a few years, that share will rise to 25 percent or so, a Dataquest analyst, Janet Cole, predicted, adding that some analysts say notebooks will outsell desktop machines by the late 1990's.
The real payoff for mobile computing is several years down the road, when wireless communications, intelligent software and miniaturized machines are expected to come together in a futuristic world of easy-to-use hand-held "personal digital assistants." In theory, these machines will respond to written or spoken commands, communicate with other people's hand-held computers, and retrieve and display everything from movies to scientific documents.
 
Competing Suppliers
 Hundreds of companies are developing equipment and services for this personal digital future. The big players in computers and telecommunications -- A.T.& T., I.B.M., Motorola, Apple Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and others -- are all in the chase. Yet there are smaller companies, like the Go Corporation, a pen-based software maker, and start-ups, like General Magic, which is working on operating software for hand-held wireless computers.
But that is the future, and getting there will involve developing new markets for mobile computing with more modest technological steps forward. So companies are working to spread the use of computers well beyond offices to police officers on the beat, ambulance drivers, traveling sales representatives and other mobile workers.
"The desk personal computer revolution never touched these people, but mobile computing will," said Bruce Claflin, general manager of mobile computing for the I.B.M. Personal Computer Company.
The International Business Machines Corporation sponsors the computing program in the N.B.A. and considers it both a test market and a promotional venue for showcasing its computers. The company, long a laggard in mobile computing, finally has something to show off.
In the past, Mr. Claflin conceded, I.B.M.'s mobile offerings were "marginally competitive and overpriced." But last fall, with the introduction of its new laptops, especially its high-end color machine, the Thinkpad 700C, I.B.M. became a serious competitor in the field.
 
Special Software for Sports
 The 27 N.B.A. teams are equipped with conventional Thinkpad notebooks. Recently, several teams have been experimenting with a pen-based model, the Thinkpad 700T, loaded with specialized basketball software developed by Information and Display Systems Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla. The pen-based system allows coaches and scouts to diagram plays and store them, up to 99 plays for each of the 27 teams.
Robert Salmi is a 33-year-old assistant coach of the Knicks and one of pro basketball's self-taught computer aces. A 6-foot-7-inch former college basketball player, Mr. Salmi knew little about computers before Pat Riley, the Knicks head coach, came to him early in the 1991-92 season and told him what he wanted.
Mr. Riley has a well-deserved reputation for being as demanding a task master with his coaching staff as he is with his players. He wanted to have the team's computers massage the statistics on scoring, rebounds and assists that were churned out daily by the league. But Mr. Riley also wanted a data base of in-house figures that reflect effort and behavior, like diving for loose balls. "Pat Riley wants to know everything," Mr. Salmi said.
Like most computer neophytes, Mr. Salmi struggled at first. Frequently, he sought the help of the computer experts at Paramount Communications Inc., which owns Madison Square Garden and the Knicks. "I went to them so often, they hated me," he recalled. "They'd run when they saw me coming."
Today, Mr. Salmi is comfortable with computers, speaking knowledgeably about data base programs or pen-based machines. But mostly, he views the computers as a tool that saves time and that can pinpoint problems and opportunities.
For example, Mr. Riley might ask his assistant for additional statistics on their initial playoff opponents, the Indiana Pacers, whom the Knicks beat twice last week.
The coach, Mr. Salmi says, might want to know the Pacers won-lost record in games when they were out-rebounded, or when their guard Reggie Miller took more than 15 shots and made more than 50 percent in a game, or when their forward Rick Smits scored more than 20 points. Or in games when all three happened.
"Two years ago, that would have meant three or four hours of going through files and stat sheets," Mr. Salmi said. "Today, I can snap that out in five minutes."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Platinum Plummets in Price; Silver Off and Gold Is Firmer

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices were pounded yesterday by signs of sluggish economic growth and perceptions that the metal had become overvalued in its recent run to a 23-month high.
Silver futures also fell, extending Monday's loss, while gold prices firmed slightly. 
 On other commodity markets, lumber futures tumbled; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; oil futures retreated, and most livestock and meat futures fell.
Platinum for July delivery sank $9.30 on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $377.30 a troy ounce. The move followed a $3.30 drop on Monday.
 
Silver off by 2.4 Cents
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, June gold rose 40 cents, to $355.70 a troy ounce, and May silver fell 2.4 cents, to $4.266 a troy ounce, after a plunge of 9.9 cents on Monday.
Platinum and silver have industrial uses that make them sensitive to economic signals. Yesterday's Government report of a 1 percent drop in the index of leading indicators, the sharpest decline since November 1990, worried investors, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York.
"If we get a recession and people stop buying cars, platinum could be selling for less than gold," said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in New York. Platinum is used in the catalytic converters of all cars sold in the United States.
Mr. Savaiko said platinum and silver had become too costly relative to gold, and their declines represented attempts by traders to realign the price relationships.
Lumber futures crashed to a three-month low on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as abundant supplies continued to find few buyers in a construction market weakened by foul weather.
Light sweet crude oil for June delivery fell 18 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $20.39 a barrel. June heating oil fell 0.30 cent, to 55.58 cents a gallon. June unleaded gasoline fell 0.22 cent, to 61.59 cents a gallon and June natural gas rose 2.8 cents, to $2.317 for 1,000 cubic feet.
In livestock trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle for June delivery fell 0.25 cent, to 76.97 cents a pound. May feeder cattle fell 0.02 cent, to 86.20 cents a pound. June live hogs slipped 0.05 cent, to 52.55 cents a pound, and May frozen pork bellies sank 1.28 cents, to 42.82 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Failures Fall 10.2% in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The number of United States business failures fell by 10.2 percent for the first quarter, reflecting a stronger economy in the first three months of 1993 than in the period a year earlier, the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation said yesterday.
Dun & Bradstreet reported 23,180 failures, compared with 25,824 for the first quarter of 1992. The decline was accompanied by a substantial drop in dollar liabilities associated with bankruptcies, which fell 42.7 percent, to $12.9 billion, from $22.5 billion in the first quarter of 1992. 
 Joseph W. Duncan, vice president and chief economist for Dun & Bradstreet, said that with the exception of a few states -- particularly Florida, Michigan, New Jersey and Connecticut -- failures were down across the nation, indicating a broad economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Budget Pleases Many Arts Institutions

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
While holding out the possibility of cutbacks in a number of city services, the budget announced on Monday by Mayor David N. Dinkins brought cheer to the Department of Cultural Affairs and many arts institutions.
The Mayor's proposed $31.4 billion budget, which is subject to City Council approval, adds $3.6 million to the Cultural Affairs expense budget (increasing it to $85.3 million for fiscal year 1994), and provides $6.3 million to match a grant from the State Legislature to rescue the financially troubled New-York Historical Society. 
 In addition, $7.5 million is earmarked for new capital projects like new roofing for the Brooklyn Museum.
 
'Ecstatic' About the Increases
 Luis R. Cancel, Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, said: "The Mayor has obviously taken to heart how the cultural community helps New York's economy. I'm ecstatic."
Asked about the concern he expressed on Monday that bailing out the historical society with $6.3 million might create "the appearance of rewarding an organization for mismanagement," Mr. Cancel said, "This money will flow through the Department of Cultural Affairs, and you may rest assured that we will have vigorous oversight on how it is spent."
While spokesmen for the historical society said they were thrilled by the budget, others complained that Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Cancel had "politicized the process."
For example, $2.2 million is scheduled for increased support for some members of the Cultural Institutions Group, an umbrella organization for arts institutions that occupy city-owned real estate. But only 13 of the group's 31 members -- ranging from the Brooklyn Academy of Music to P.S. 1 in Queens -- received increases, and one such increase went to Lincoln Center, which is not a member. Those that did not receive an increase include the Staten Island Children's Museum and the Jamaica Arts Center in Queens.
 
Every Group for Itself
 "It used to be that the C.I.G. would be funded together as a unit," said Gregory Long, chairman of the group and president of the New York Botanical Garden. "But now they've politicized the process. The 18 groups that got no increase don't want to work together in the future. They're going to be forced to fight for themselves and lobby against each other."
Mr. Cancel said that he rejected the charge of "politicizing the budget process," that he had been motivated by a desire to "allocate the available money in a way that would have the greatest impact."
The Culture Voucher Program, a new initiative conceived by Mr. Cancel, will receive $500,000 to start a pilot program under which 12,500 seventh-grade school children will be given "passports" worth about $40 to cultural events of their choice.

HEADLINE: Benefits of Federal Spending on Infrastructure

 BODY:
To the Editor:
During the debate on President Clinton's job stimulus package, I sometimes wondered if the Republicans ever gave a thought to the young lives that their filibuster may have impacted. I am a 69-year-old woman whose whole life has benefited from Federal spending during the Great Depression, even though that spending was not directed specifically toward me or my family. I can remember the strikes, the bread lines and the many hungry people who came to our door asking for food. I can also remember the jokes about the Works Progress Administration. 
 But the W.P.A. was not a joking matter in my life. My beautiful, well-designed high school in Freeport, Ill., was a W.P.A. project. In 1991 I went back to my 50th high school reunion. I found my old school building still one of the finest I have ever seen. And as a retired teacher and parent who has lived in many parts of our country, I have seen many school buildings. Not only did my class of 1941 have a beautiful school with comfortable classrooms, gym, library and band room; we had beautiful, original art hanging in the halls. And who did these paintings? Why, artists paid by the Illinois W.P.A. Arts Project.
At the 1991 reunion my old buddies and I recollected the first live symphony concerts we had ever heard, brought to us each year by the Illinois W.P.A. Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Izler Solomon. Then there was the first professional theater most of us had ever seen, the plays presented by the Chicago W.P.A. Theater. Out-of-school activities for us as teen-agers were picnics at the nearby White Pines State Park, built by the boys in the Civilian Conservation Corps, a park that has been and is enjoyed by thousands of visitors each year.
I can't speak for the contractors and workers who built my wonderful school and beautiful park, nor for the painters, musicians and actors who otherwise would have been jobless during that difficult time, but I can speak as an individual who had all kinds of wonderful experiences opened to her, and whose youth and whole life was tremendously enriched by the expenditure of public funds.
And to think that those funds have benefited and are still benefiting countless others. Would that our senators today had the breadth of understanding displayed by those of the New Deal period. They too could enrich the lives of generations to come.

HEADLINE: Benefits of Federal Spending on Infrastructure;
Dole's Role Distorted

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your April 23 editorial on "Mr. Dole's Selfish Strut" grossly misconstrues the Kansas Senator's leader
ship of the successful Republican filibuster against President Clinton's economic stimulus package. You paint a distorted picture of the Senator in three respects -- his position, his record and his motives. 
 Regarding Bob Dole's position on the stimulus package, you describe his disregard for "the poorest, weakest and most undefended Americans, who might have profited by [the Administration's] job programs and by a stronger economy." In blasting the Senator's distaste for "creating jobs," you seem to endorse a theory that died along with European and Soviet Communism -- that governments should create jobs directly.
Mr. Dole argues not that unemployed Americans should be ignored, but that new jobs can be better provided by the private sector. Government's proper role is to foster a favorable business climate. This is the only effective recipe for sustained economic growth.
Mr. Clinton's spending plan, which basically amounts to providing cheap summer work for teen-agers, hardly delivers the "good jobs" he promised in his campaign. It's like putting a Band-Aid on the forehead of a headache sufferer: it fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the problem, but nonetheless creates the illusion of positive action.
You also distort Mr. Dole's record, insisting that he was instrumental in expanding the Federal deficit during the Reagan-Bush years. On the contrary, Senator Dole was a consistent and sober voice of spending control while other members of Congress (both Republican and Democrat) sought to party indefinitely on borrowed money.
Indeed, Mr. Dole often cites as his greatest achievement his forcing the 1985 austerity budget through the Senate by a vote of 50 to 49. This draconian package froze Social Security COLA's and axed 25 domestic programs. Unfortunately, neither the House nor the Reagan Administration was able to stomach the deep cuts; and a fatter budget was passed instead.
Finally, you question Mr. Dole's motives by calling him "selfish." This name-calling is utterly without basis. If he were only interested in his own electoral success, he wouldn't threaten to derail the Clinton gravy train. He would simply guide a portion of "stimulus" spending back to the voters of Kansas and reap the benefits.
Instead he made it his mission to fight the elements of Mr. Clinton's economic plan on which the President misled the voters. In his campaign, Mr. Clinton promised to cut two dollars in spending for every new dollar in taxes. Yet in his budget proposal, the ratio runs 4 to 1 in the opposite direction.
This stimulus package was entirely unnecessary. Real G.D.P. increased at an annual rate of 4.7 percent in the last quarter of 1992 (an especially impressive upturn, given that shallow recessions like the one of 1991-92 usually see very gradual recoveries); the economy was clearly rebounding vigorously without any injections of Federal spending.
So why did President Clinton deliberately break a campaign promise to include the stimulus package in his budget? The answer is obvious: so he could falsely claim credit for bringing about the recovery, thereby improving his chances for re-election in 1996. Now that is selfish behavior.

HEADLINE: Eritrea, an Inspiration for Other Peoples

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your editorial of April 28, "Eritrea's Harder Test Is Peace," you presented a challenge for Eritrea to establish a "generous peace with Ethiopia." This is truly an important test for Eritrea. However, it is an equally important challenge for Ethiopia to make peace with Eritrea. 
 With the establishment of a democratic Government in Ethiopia, the process of healing and genuine cooperation is under way. Ethiopia has agreed to respect the outcome of the referendum. Both nations are exploring ways to cooperate economically. Eritrea has agreed to guarantee Ethiopia access to the sea.
In fact, the real test of the new government in Eritrea is to develop a comprehensive strategy to rebuild the shattered infrastructure, and eliminate dependence on food aid. Water supply, agricultural productivity, communications, factories and so on were destroyed in the bitter 30-year war. Becoming self-reliant is a daunting task.
It is important not to forget that Eritrea was a pawn in cold-war strategic rivalry. This places a moral responsibility on the United States to actively become involved in reconstruction. By providing food aid, loans and technical assistance before a Somalia-like crisis develops, the United States will incur a lower and politically more acceptable cost.
Your editorial raises a concern about the trepidation of other African nations over redrawing post-colonial borders. In fact, the new Eritrea borders are the very ones drawn by the colonial powers. Rulers and tyrants in other African nations may be alarmed over this development; however, oppressed citizens in other nations are inspired by the hard-won self-determination of the Eritrean people.
With appropriate economic aid, Eritrea, in an irony of history, will become a crucial element for stability in the volatile Horn of Africa.

In findings expected to alter the direction of cancer research, scientists have discovered the existence and are near to pinpointing the location of a gene that causes several major cancers, and they have discovered a new way that aberrant genes cause the disease.
The gene, carried by 1 in 200 people, leads to colon cancer and a variety of other cancers, including uterine and ovarian. 
 Although the gene itself has not yet been isolated, the discovery is expected to lead within a few years to the development of a test to show whether a person carries the gene.
 
Odds Are Discouraging
 About 65 percent of people who carry the gene will develop colon cancer, a co-author of the new report, Dr. Albert de la Chapelle of the University of Helsinki, said in a telephone interview, adding that they constitute at least 13 percent of all colon cancer patients.
Ninety to 100 percent of those who carry the gene will get cancer, Dr. de la Chapelle said. Those who do not develop colon cancer will probably develop cancers of the uterus or ovary, or cancers of the stomach, small intestine, gall bladder, urethra, pancreas or kidney. Among those who do not get colon cancer, uterine cancer predominates. About half the women with the gene who do not get colon cancer get uterine cancer.
 
'Genuine Double Whammy'
 People who know they have the gene can have regular tests to detect cancer at an early stage, when in most cases it is more likely to be cured. And if they are at risk and find out that they do not carry the gene, they will be spared a lifetime of expensive, uncomfortable tests and worry.
All previously discovered cancer genes act by removing normal brakes on cell division, thus allowing cells to proliferate wildly. The new gene, in contrast, allows hundreds of thousands of mutations to accumulate in other genes.
 
'Genuine Double Whammy'
 The gene was found to lie in a small area of chromosome 2, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain the hereditary information in humans.
As for the other finding, the scientists said that the discovery of a new way for a gene to cause cancer would alter the direction of cancer research.
"This is a genuine double whammy," said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Center for Human Genome Research at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.
 
'Phenomenally Exciting'
 Dr. Bernard Levine, chairman of the department of gastrointestinal oncology and digestive diseases at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said: "It's phenomenally exciting. It implies a new mechanism of cancer, a new class of genes."
Dr. Henry T. Lynch, a colon cancer specialist at Creighton University in Omaha, said, "In my opinion, it's the most important finding on this disorder in 30 years."
According to the American Cancer Society, colon cancer will be diagnosed in 152,000 Americans this year, and 57,000 will die. It is the third-leading cancer in men, after prostate and lung cancer, and the second-leading cancer in women, after lung cancer.
The latest discoveries are reported in three papers that will appear on Friday in the journal Science.
 
Many Mutations
 Two of the papers, by Dr. Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins University Oncology Center in Baltimore and Dr. de la Chapelle and their colleagues, report on the location of the gene and the observation that it induces hundreds of thousands of mutations in other genes.
The third paper, by Dr. Stephen N. Thibodeau and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., reports on finding the hallmark of the new cancer gene, the hundreds of thousands of mutations, in tumor cells of colon cancer patients who did not have a family history of the disease, raising the possibility that the gene is even more common than previously estimated.
Although millions of people might want to know whether they carry the gene, there are no facilities in place for mass testing. In addition, the test so far is only applicable to people from large families with a history of colon cancer where genes that are carried along with the cancer gene can be followed through the generations. This is an expedient that allows scientists to track the gene without actually isolating it. Researchers estimate that it might take two years before a genetic test is ready for everyone at risk of colon cancer.
"We don't have testing facilities set up," Dr. Collins said. "We don't have primary care organized in a way where we can do genetic counseling. These are going to be complicated issues. We have to move very quickly to develop tools to help primary-care practitioners. I don't think we can wait until something is marketed."
Dr. Levine agreed, saying: "This is one situation where we're way behind the science already. We don't have enough genetic counselors, we don't know all the ethical, economic and family-planning implications. Clearly, we don't have the expertise yet to provide people with the right sort of advice."
About two years ago, scientists discovered a different colon cancer gene, one that elicited a peculiar, and uncommon, form of the cancer. The gene causes a rare inherited syndrome, called familial adenomatous polyposis, in which people develop hundreds of thousands of tiny polyps on the wall of the colon. Some of the polyps develop into cancer.
The newly located gene is on a different chromosome, has no association with the rare inherited disorder and accounts for the exceedingly common, hereditary form of colon cancer.
Scientists caution that the new research, like any other new scientific claim, needs to be replicated by others before it can be considered absolutely certain. For example, the claim to have discovered the first colon cancer gene was followed five months later by an announcement by the same researchers, including Dr. Vogelstein, that the real gene they were looking for was actually immediately adjacent to the one they originally identified.
Until now, people looking for cancer genes consistently found tumor suppressors, genes that when mutated lead to wild and uncontrolled cell division. The familial adenomatous polyposis gene is a tumor suppressor, for example.
Dr. Vogelstein said he was astonished when he and his colleagues noticed that the new colon cancer gene was quite different. Instead of making cells divide, it caused cascades of mutations in other genes. Small, repeated segments of genes were expanding and contracting all over the genome. "This just totally blew our minds," he said.
He speculated that the colon cancer gene might lead to mistakes in copying DNA, the genetic material in the nucleus of all human cells, before a cell divides. If mistakes are not corrected, or if mistakes are actually induced, mutations could quickly accumulate, leading to cancer.
"The thing to remember is the time factor," Dr. de la Chapelle said. "We are talking about a cell or a cell clone that accumulates mutations over a long period of time. That explains why you don't get tumors when you are 2 or 12 but when you are 40."
The accumulation of hundreds of thousands of mutations was what struck Dr. Thibodeau and his colleagues as they studied cancer cells from people with colon cancer. Most of the 87 patients they studied had no family history of cancer, Dr. Thibodeau said. But in 15 tumors, or 17 percent of the group, "we observed these unique genetic alterations," he said.
Dr. de la Chapelle said the surprisingly high percentage of patients with the excessive mutations might indicate that the hereditary colon cancer gene is more common than investigators had suspected or it could be they are new mutations, the first emergence of the colon cancer gene in a family.
 
Traditional Beginning
 Dr. Vogelstein, who has studied the genetics of colon cancer for years, said that he and Dr. de la Chapelle had begun their search in the traditional way, by looking for families in which colon cancer shows up in generation after generation. Members of those families presumably carry a gene that causes the cancer. The researchers studied two large families, one in North America and one in New Zealand, that had many members in three generations who had developed colon cancer or other cancers associated with the gene.
"The major challenge in genetics is to determine the role of heredity in common diseases," Dr. Vogelstein said. "The problem with colon cancer is that it really is so common that even when you see what looks like a familial pattern, it is very difficult to tell whether it really is genetic. When something occurs in 6 percent of the population, you're going to see clusters in families just by chance."
But, Dr. Vogelstein added, "now that we have the linkage, we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is a genetic cause" for these cancers.

HEADLINE: LEVY ON PAYROLLS IS GAINING SUPPORT

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials said today that they were seriously considering asking employers to pay a percentage of their payrolls in premiums to help finance health care for all Americans. To raise more money, employees would also have to pay a portion of their earnings.
Employers would pay the premium to a regional health insurance purchasing group, which would buy coverage for hundreds of thousands or millions of people. The "payroll premium" would apply to all companies that take part in the purchasing pool, including many small businesses that do not now provide health benefits to their workers. 
 Most of the nation's biggest companies serve as their own health insurers, and the Administration would probably let them continue to do so. But it hopes to lure them into the new purchasing pools.
 
Capping the Premium
 The Administration has been searching for ways to pay for its plan to revamp the nation's medical system. White House officials have assured business executives that the premium would not exceed 7 percent of payroll. If that is the case, the money would cover only part of the cost. Businesses in the program would pay the premium instead of whatever they now spend on health benefits for workers and retirees.
The Administration has discussed many other sources of revenue, including a national sales tax and higher cigarette taxes. While the cigarette tax increase is likely, the sales tax idea has apparently been discarded as politically unacceptable.
Last week Administration officials mentioned the payroll premium as one among many options. Today they said there was a strong possibility that it would be included in President Clinton's proposal this spring.
Mr. Clinton has not decided on a specific payroll premium rate. But in recent meetings with business executives, Administration officials have suggested that companies would pay a flat premium of 7 percent of payroll.
The nation's total payroll is $3.6 trillion this year. If all employers take part in the purchasing pools, a 7 percent premium or tax would raise more than $250 billion a year. The employee contributions could raise an additional sum of $40 billion to $60 billion.
John F. Sheils, a vice president of Lewin-VHI, a consulting concern that specializes in medical economics, estimated that public and private employers now spend $200 billion a year for employee health benefits, while workers pay $55 billion.
The payroll premium would thus raise some additional money for health care. Equally important, it would spread costs differently, reducing expenses for some companies that now have very high costs for employee health benefits. It would impose new costs on companies that now spend little or nothing for such benefits.
 
Seeking Support of C.E.O.'s
 Ellen L. Goldstein, director of health policy at the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, a trade group composed mainly of Fortune 500 companies, said the proposal for a payroll premium had a dual purpose. "It is designed as much to get 20 C.E.O.'s on stage supporting the President's plan as it is to finance the program," she said.
Indeed, the payroll premium could garner support for the President's plan from some chief executives. Companies with older workers in manufacturing industries often pay more than 7 percent of payroll in health benefits.
For instance, Robert L. Ozment, director of insurance at the Ford Motor Company, said his company spent $1.35 billion, or 19 percent of payroll, on health benefits for workers, retirees and dependents last year. That is more than the $1.1 billion that Ford spent on steel, he said in an interview.
Small businesses generally oppose any requirements for them to provide or pay for health insurance. Some big businesses like the idea of paying premiums to an insurance purchasing group; others dislike it.
Business executives say a payroll tax or premium would increase the cost of hiring workers and would make it more difficult to create jobs, as Mr. Clinton wants to do. White House officials reject such concerns. Under the President's proposal, they say, employers would have at least two years to adapt to any new requirements.
 
Is It a Tax?
 Kristin Bass, manager of human resources policy at the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, had another complaint: the payroll premium, she said, "is really a payroll tax."
Vice President Al Gore said the premium was not a tax because it would not be paid to the Government. But a White House official acknowledged that this was a "metaphysical distinction," with little practical significance for employers.
White House officials have expressed confidence that the President's plan will hold down medical costs, and they have assured business executives that the premiums would not rise above 7 percent of payroll. But executives distrust such assurances.
Mr. Sheils, the health policy analyst at Lewin-VHI, said, "Health costs will almost certainly continue to grow faster than income and wages." To cover such costs, he said, the tax rate will need to rise above 7 percent.
 
Recalling California Plan
 The proposal for payroll premiums resembles a health-care plan proposed last year in California by the State Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, and one of his deputies, Walter A. Zelman, who is now working for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the head of the President's task force.
Mr. Garamendi and Mr. Zelman proposed "a single unified health-care system" for California and said it would be financed this way: "Each employer would pay a premium based on payroll. The overall average premium would be 6.75 percent of payroll, which would include the current cost of health care under workers' compensation."
In addition, they said: "Each employee would pay a premium based on wages and salaries. The overall average premium would be 1 percent of wages and salaries, with low-income workers paying less."
Under Mr. Clinton's plan, the 7 percent premium would cover the cost of a comprehensive package of health benefits defined by the Government. Workers could negotiate with employers for additional benefits. But employers could probably not take tax deductions for the cost of such extra coverage, and the benefits might be treated as taxable income for employees.
Mr. Clinton rejected suggestions today that he was spreading himself too thin and should delay sending his health-care proposal to Congress.
At a ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House, Mr. Clinton told a group of nurses, "The lobbyists are lining up, strategizing about how they're going to pick this health-care proposal to death." But he said he would not bow to their pressure.
"I ask you to commit today not to let the special interests tell us that we can't deal with health care, not to let the special interests spook and scare the members of Congress away from doing what is our manifest duty to the people of this country," said Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: PANEL IN CONGRESS SEEKS A NEW IMAGE

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Prompted by voter criticism of pork barrel spending, a Congressional panel widely viewed as a prime offender today adopted economic criteria for judging future projects.
"This represents a change in our thinking, a change in our way of doing business," said Representative Bob Carr, the Michigan Democrat who heads the panel, the Appropriations subcommittee on transportation. The subcommittee oversees more than $30 billion in Federal money for highways, airports, railroads and mass transit. 
 The panel's economic criteria would weigh the cost of a proposed project against the value of improved safety, air quality, congestion, travel time and other economic benefits. The guidelines, approved unanimously, are the first such criteria to be adopted by a House panel, and Mr. Carr said he hoped his subcommittee's example would inspire others.
In adopting the guidelines, Mr. Carr said the panel was moving away from decisions based on favoritism and political clout to determining "what will give us the greatest rate of return." He conceded, however, that these criteria would not totally replace arm-twisting and deal making.
"This is not a magic solution, not an effort to reduce everything to a number and put decision making on automatic pilot," Mr. Carr said. "But now we'll have some data."
He said several projects approved earlier by the committee, including a skyway in Jacksonville, Fla., would have not passed muster under the new criteria.
Representative Frank R. Wolf of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, said the new guidelines should please taxpayers because the committee's spending decisions in the past had often been influenced by "who you know or who you hired."
Although the "cost-benefit analysis" became a staple in the executive branch in the mid-1970's, Mr. Carr said Government agencies that propose projects to his panel had a spotty record. The Federal Highway Administration does a good job weighing costs against benefits, he said. But he added that the mass transit agency falls short of the mark and the aviation agencies are "a mixed story."
Mr. Carr suggested that the committee's guidelines would even be a boon to members trying to resist the appeals of constituents seeking projects. With the new guidelines, he said, these lawmakers can blame the subcommittee for the failure of projects to be approved.
The economic criteria were developed during three months of consultations with the General Accounting Office, academic experts, Wall Street investors and management consultants.

HEADLINE: Squaring Off on Taxes;
Clinton Proposals Are Drawing Fire From Supporters of 1986 Reform Law

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
As Congress takes up the President's tax plan in earnest this week, the Clinton proposals are coming under fire from many supporters of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, who say parts of the plan will sabotage that much-praised law.
Admirers of those reforms say President Clinton's proposals will violate the spirit of '86 by creating new loopholes and rewarding tax shenanigans. They say the plan could encourage creative lawyers and accountants to play the type of tax-avoiding games the 1986 law sought to stamp out. 
 Mr. Clinton's proposals have come under heavy fire from people as diverse as Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat who was the intellectual father of the 1986 tax overhaul, and Martin S. Feldstein, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Ronald Reagan.
 Compared with the tortured tax legislation that usually emerges from Congress, the 1986 tax act is considered a thing of rare beauty: simple, pure and virtually free of loopholes. The 1986 law broadened the tax base, taxed all forms of income at the same rate and lowered the top personal and corporate tax rates. It aimed to encourage companies and rich Americans to make financial decisions on their own merits, rather than to cut their taxes.
The opposition has already torpedoed the chances of an investment tax credit, which supporters of the 1986 law view as a loophole.
Another provision that many see as contrary to the spirit of '86 -- a large jump in the top personal income tax rate -- has survived partly because Democratic backers of the 1986 law say this increase is essential for cutting the budget deficit.
"The overall direction of the Administration's package is inconsistent with the spirit of the 1986 act because it increases rates, both individual and corporate, and it contains provisions that narrow the tax base," said Ronald Pearlman, Assistant Treasury Secretary for Tax Policy in the Reagan Administration.
Fans of the 1986 legislation fault several aspects of the Clinton plan in particular:
*A capital gains tax break for people who invest in businesses worth less than $50 million and hold those investments for five years. "It's the building block for new tax shelters," Senator Bradley said.
*The increase in the top personal income tax rate far above the capital gains rate, a move that could push the rich to hunt for tax shelters.
*Tax breaks to businesses that locate in enterprise zones. Supporters of such zones say these incentives are needed to help depressed urban and rural areas, but many backers of the 1986 law say the plan would distort business decisions.
*Restoring the investment tax credit. Critics say this would favor capital-intensive industries and unduly influence business decisions by, for example, swaying companies to spend more on machinery instead of job training. The 1986 law repealed an investment tax credit largely for these reasons.
 
'The Opposite Direction'
 Mr. Bradley called parts of the President's proposals a "rejection of the principle of tax reform." Mr. Feldstein said: "They're a complete reversal from 1986. That legislation sought to bring down rates, reduce the incentive for people to play games and cut out the search for loopholes. Now we're going in the opposite direction."
Administration officials deny that they are savaging the 1986 law, arguing that their proposals promote two objectives of the 1986 act -- fairness and economic growth. They say their plan also pursues another goal largely ignored by the 1986 act: deficit reduction.
They add that the proposals broaden the tax base by, for example, reducing deductions on business meals and eliminating deductions for country club membership. As for the President's plan to increase the top tax rate, they acknowledge it collides with the 1986 philosophy of lowering rates but say it is needed to raise revenues to cut the deficit.
"I don't think on the whole you can say the President's plan is inconsistent with 1986," said Samuel Sessions, Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary for Tax Policy. "We broadened the base and we increased the rates. Why did we do that? Because this is a deficit reduction measure."
 
Aims to Achieve Fairness
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said raising the top tax rates promotes fairness. "The President campaigned on a promise to restore some of the progressivity to the tax system," she said. "That may be different from what was decided in 1986, but that's what he was elected to do."
For supporters of the 1986 law, the proposed investment tax credit would be a new loophole, though Administration officials say it would spur investment and growth. Nonetheless, many business executives say they would rather forgo the credit than pay the higher corporate taxes in the President's program.
"We have virtually no support for the investment tax credit," said Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "It will ignite all sorts of gaming."
Senator Bradley faulted the President's plan for trying to collect $30 billion by raising the corporate income tax to 36 percent from 34 percent and then giving most of that money right back to companies through the investment tax credit.
"On the corporate side, this is a direct rejection of the principle of tax reform, which is to cut rates and eliminate loopholes which were used by the rich to avoid taxes," he said. "The investment tax credit serves no economic purpose other than to reward certain narrow interest groups."
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said he believed an investment tax credit and capital gains tax break for small businesses would "encourage our businesses to make investments that will create jobs, improve productivity and put us in a better competitive position."
 
Possible Revenue Losses
 According to Mr. Feldstein, director of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the worst thing about the President's plan is it would create a large gap between the top income tax rate of 39.6 percent and the 28 percent rate for capital gains.
The 1986 law lowered the top tax rate to 28 percent from 50 percent, but the President wants to raise it to 36 percent from 31 percent for families earning $180,000 or more. (The 1990 budget accord raised the top rate to 31 percent.) For families earning $250,000 or more, the proposed surtax would raise the top rate to 39.6 percent.
This, Mr. Feldstein says, will encourage lots of maneuvering, whereby the rich rush to tax-exempt bonds or transform their ordinary income into capital gains income -- for example, by putting more of their money into sophisticated financial instruments.
Mr. Feldstein says that if the rich can maneuver to cut their taxable incomes by 10 percent, some two-thirds of the $27 billion in annual revenues the President plans to get from higher rates would disappear. Mr. Feldstein exaggerates such changes in behavior, Administration officials argue, adding that their projections already account for revenue losses from such behavior.
In its tax bill, the Administration has proposed several ways to block complex ploys that turn ordinary income into capital gains. The problem is that ingenious accountants will immediately begin seeking ways around them.
Supporters of the 1986 philosophy say the President should broaden the tax base further, noting that this might allow him to raise tax rates less. One frequent recommendation is to allow homeowners to deduct interest payments on only the first $250,000 of a mortgage, down from $1 million today.
But, says Eugene Steurle, a Reagan Administration economist and a fellow at the Urban Institute: "If you're serious about cutting the deficit, you can't have all base-broadening. At some point, you have to start raising rates."

HEADLINE: Two Committees Pass Legislation On Strike Hiring

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Senate and House Democrats gave committee approvals today to legislation that would prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacements for strikers. The measure is organized labor's biggest demand from this Congress.
Although the Clinton Administration has strongly endorsed the bill, the prospects for enactment are uncertain because Senate Republicans are expected to lead a filibuster against it. Last year, supporters of the measure fell three votes short of the 60 needed to shut off debate. 
 "The Republicans will fight us tooth and nail," said Bob McGlotten, head of the legislative department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. He said organized labor was not assuming that those who voted for the bill last year would do so again. "We're canvassing each and every Senator," he said.
President Clinton's commitment to the bill may be measured by how two other Arkansas Democrats, Senators Dale Bumpers and David Pryor, vote this year. Both were among the five Democrats who voted with Republicans to keep the filibuster going last year, and supporters of the measure hope the two men can be persuaded to switch. Five Republicans voted to shut off debate last year.
 
House Approval Expected
 The House is expected to approve the measure relatively easily. Last year the House voted 247 to 182 for the bill. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, said the bill would be considered within a month. Senate scheduling will depend on how the votes look.
Today, the House Education and Labor Committee voted 28 to 15 to send the bill to the full House, and the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee voted 10 to 7 to send it to the full Senate.
In neither committee did any Democrats vote against the measure nor any Republicans vote for it.
Supporters of the bill contended that employers were using permanent replacements more and more in recent years, weakening the fundamental right to strike. Representative Major R. Owens, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, "If you can be replaced, you don't have the right to strike."
Opponents argued that the bill would invite strikes by favoring unions. Without the fear of losing their jobs to permanent replacements, said Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican, "there is little incentive for labor to make demands that are reasonable and reflect market realities."
The bill was first known as the Striker Replacement Bill. Then its supporters, seeking a more politically attractive title, renamed it the Workplace Fairness Bill. The House committee burnished the measure's image once again today, naming it the Cesar Chavez Workplace Fairness Bill to commemorate the farm workers union leader who died last month.
In 1938 the Supreme Court ruled that employers could hire permanent replacements when strikes dealt with wages or benefits or other economic matters. Permanent replacements can keep their jobs when a strike ends and strikers need not be re-employed.
In strikes involving claims of unfair labor practices, like a refusal to bargain in good faith, strikers must be reinstated when the dispute ends.
Temporary replacements, who must give way to returning strikers, have been widely used for many years by companies seeking to stay open despite a strike. But the use of permanent replacements has increased markedly in the last decade.
 
'Law of the Jungle'
 Advocates of the bill, like Representative William D. Ford of Michigan, chairman of the House committee, said the recent increased use of permanent replacements in disputes involving the International Paper Company and Caterpillar Inc. had "resulted in a near return to the law of the jungle."
Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, disagreed and maintained that replacement workers were hired in only 17 percent of recent strikes. In only 4 percent of strikes, she said, were strikers not reinstated. This showed that the present system was effective, she said, because "both sides in a labor dispute should have something to lose."
"The risks are intended to encourage settlements of labor disputes," she said.
Senator Kassebaum contended that the bill would weaken American companies' ability to compete with foreign businesses. But Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the committee chairman, said most leading industrial nations barred permanent replacements for strikers.
Senator Harris Wofford, Democrat of Pennsylvania, maintained that while he had been his state's secretary of labor, he had repeatedly seen communities torn apart when permanent replacements were hired.
House Republicans have labeled the measure the Strike Maker Bill, saying that it would give labor too much power and that it would be bad for the economy.
Representative Bill Goodling, the senior Republican on the House committee, today noted an event of 175 years ago. "This is Karl Marx's birthday," he said. "He couldn't ask for a better birthday present."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Maturities Shortened

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Treasury Department surprised the bond market yesterday by making a big change in its debt management policy, shifting its emphasis to shorter-term borrowing.
The Treasury announced that it would increase the sale of two- and three-year notes and shorter-term Treasury bills, so it can reduce its borrowing through issues with maturities of five years and over by 45 percent. In the process, the Treasury eliminated the seven-year note, a favorite tool in the corporate and mortgage markets. 
 It also said it would cut its issuance of 30-year bonds by 40 percent, to about $22 billion a year. Auctions of 30-year bonds will be reduced to two times a year, from four, starting in August.
Immediately after the Treasury's announcement, Treasury prices and yields gyrated. But by the end of the day, they were little changed, reflecting a wait-and-see attitude.
The decision seemed to be driven by two factors: The Treasury wanted to lower intermediate- and long-term interest rates, and it hoped to achieve $16 billion in savings over five years by shifting borrowings from higher-interest rate long-term securities to lower-interest rate short-term securities. President Clinton promised the savings in his budget.
"We have considered this issue very carefully and believe the restructuring of our debt mix, over the long run, is in the best interests of American taxpayers," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement. "This action to shorten the maturity of Treasury borrowing will produce real savings on interest costs over time. It is a carefully crafted and moderate move."
But the view from the bond market was different. While the 30-year bond had rallied this year in part because of expectations that the size of the auction would be reduced, many economists and analysts still opposed the move because they like the predictability and consistency of more frequent auctions. They also argued that it was a bad idea to bet that short-term interest rates would remain low.
"The real issue of whether this is a good idea or not is not whether short rates stay low for a few years but whether they stay low for 30 years," said William Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, which had predicted most of the Treasury's decision.
And Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said, "I think it will cost the taxpayer money over time." .
In addition, traders said the elimination of the seven-year note could affect the functioning of the mortgage, corporate and swaps markets, where Treasury securities are used to hedge against the risk of losses on bonds and derivative products. "We lost a hedging vehicle and that is not good," said Vin Pica, a managing director at Prudential Securities.
Some traders also wondered about how to interpret the Treasury Secretary's moves in the future. He had promised for weeks that there would be no "radical" change in the borrowing mix. But traders and analysts saw yesterday's move as just that. "I would call this much more toward the radical end of the spectrum and more radical than they had been leading the market to believe," said John Costas, managing director of government trading and sales at the First Boston Corporation.
 
Changed Auction Schedule
 The last seven-year note was issued in April, and the first time it will be missed will be in July, when the next auction is scheduled. The 30-year bond auction next week will total $8.25 billion, down $1 billion from February. The shift to a twice-a-year rotation will occur in August, with the next auction in February.
The Treasury immediately increased the size of next week's three-year note auction to $16 billion, from $15.5 billion in February. But it did not cut the size of the 10-year note auction, leaving it at February's $10.75 billion level.
That apparently reflected a decision that getting rid of the less liquid seven-year note would have a bigger impact on intermediate-term interest rates than cutting each issue some. Intermediate-term interest rates, many economists argue, are more important than the 30-year bond yield because so much economic activity, including home mortgages, are based on interest rates in the 7-to-10-year range.
The Treasury also said that because of a severe shortage of both the 10-year note and the 30-year bond, it would auction more of the 6.25 percent 10-year note and the 7.125 percent 30-year bond next week rather than selling a new issue.
Some analysts argue that reducing 30-year bond auctions can bring down interest rates by reducing supply while demand remains the same. This would push prices higher and bring down yields. But it is debatable how much rates would fall. Mr. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs argued that economic fundamentals would be far more important and suggested that this could shave no more than 5 or 10 basis points off yields.
 
Savings Could Be Lost
 As far as the savings the Treasury is seeking, a rise in short-term interest rates could wipe out the savings and even increase the cost to taxpayers because the turnover of borrowing will be so much faster and will expose the Treasury to moves in short-term rates. Many corporations now are moving to longer-term borrowing to lock in the lowest long-term rates in almost two decades.
In describing the strategy yesterday, Deborah Danker, the Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary for Federal Finance, would not estimate the savings. But the plan announced is similar to one proposed by the Senate Budget Committee, which has estimated savings of $16 billion if short-term interest rates do not change.
She said that the Treasury was exposed to a rise in short-term rates but that "there will be no flip-flopping." She emphasized that the strategy has a much longer-term focus, which is aimed at cutting the risk premium the Treasury pays when it borrows longer-term securities.
"The strategy is based over time, a long time, on the idea that the yield curve is on average upward sloping because of the risk premium for longer-term securities," she said.
In trading, the price of the 30-year bond was up only 4/32 , to 10411/32 , to yield 6.78 percent, down from 6.79 percent. In part, this was because the switch to two 30-year auctions was delayed until August. The price of the to-be-eliminated seven-year note was up only 2/32 to yield 5.47 percent, down from 5.48 percent. Traders said the drastic cut in supply was outweighed by the fact that the seven-year note was now an orphan.

HEADLINE: Clinton Again Delays Announcing His Campaign-Finance Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Still struggling to win Congressional support for President Clinton's campaign-finance package, the White House today put off announcing the measure, at the request of House Democrats who wanted more time to negotiate over the proposal.
The postponement, from Thursday to at least Friday, is the latest of several delays in the timetable that Administration officials had set for producing a political package. Mr. Clinton had pledged to move quickly after taking office to unveil legislation that would curb the soaring costs of running for office and the dominance of special interests in campaigns. 
 But he has found that moving beyond the promises of last year's campaign and getting Democrats to agree on a bill is far more difficult than he predicted. While the substance of his proposal is much simpler than, say, overhauling the health-care system, no legislation is more politically charged than a plan to change the way people get elected.
White House officials largely blame House Democrats for the difficulty. Many House members from their own party, the White House says, have been far more resistant than anticipated to changing the system that helped them win election in the first place.
 
Details and Loopholes
 After weeks of negotiations with House and Senate Democrats and officials of the Democratic National Committee, the White House has drafted the outline of a bill that would limit spending by candidates, reduce the influence of political action committees and make it easier for challengers to finance their campaigns.
But when it comes to campaign finance legislation, what is important is the details -- or, to view it another way, the loopholes -- and House Democrats were still haggling this evening among themselves over specifics in the plan. Mr. Clinton sought to speed up a resolution by dispatching his chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, to Capitol Hill last week, but the session only seemed to widen the rifts.
"I think the delays in part reflect the tremendous amount of resistance to a strong reform package," said Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which favors the changes. "The fact that these reforms might now be real has just heightened the opposition."
 
Pulled in Two2 Directions
 On one side are House Democrats who resent Mr. Clinton's efforts to tamper with the system that got them elected. Democrats in the Senate, who face re-election only every six years, have not been as nervous.
On the other side, lobbying groups and some in Congress are advocating change. They accuse Mr. Clinton of not going far enough and of being pressed into watering down his original proposal.
To accommodate the House members, the President weeks ago backed off from his campaign pledge to reduce to $1,000 from $5,000 the maximum amount a political action committee can donate to a candidate. He has made other concessions as well, like backing off a proposal to funnel public money to the national political parties.
In its latest form, the bill would offer incentives, like vouchers for television time, if House candidates capped their spending at $600,000 and Senate candidates adhered to a limit ranging from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on the state's population. The plan would also restrict large, unregulated contributions to political parties from corporations, unions and wealthy donors. And it would eliminate the tax deduction for lobbying expenses.
Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker, sought today to play down the differences between House Democrats and the White House. "I think we're coming to a very large consensus on what should be in the bill," he said. "It may not be 100 percent, but it's very substantial, and there may be some areas in which we agree to disagree. But I think in the overwhelming landscape of these issues that there is a very, very strong agreement."
Mr. Foley cautioned, however, that "there's still a very difficult problem over organizations like Emily's List," a political action committee for female candidates.
 
Support for 'Bundling'
 Emily's List contends that its efforts would be greatly damaged by a provision in the draft proposal to eliminate "bundling," the process by which organizations group individual donations to demonstrate their power.
Ellen R. Malcolm, the president of Emily's List, said: "Virtually all the top elected women are saying this is a terrible mistake. Women don't raise money from the same large donor networks that men do."
Representative Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat who is one of the most outspoken advocates of a strong bill, called on Mr. Clinton to not give in to House members who do not truly want change. "If the President is bold, we will have no choice but to be bold," he said. "We need to be shamed by the President and the Senate to do a better job."
Even if the House Democrats throw their support to the proposal, Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, has already said he will lead a filibuster on whatever legislation emerges.
Complicating the already touchy discussions is that Mr. Clinton is trying to win support in Congress for his other proposals, including his economic plan and his health-care package.
And then there is the wild card of Ross Perot, whose pet issue is political reform.
"Perot is the proverbial 600-pound gorilla on this," said Mr. Synar, who is pushing for a bill that is more far reaching than the drafts that have circulated from the White House. "It's the only thing that he really has going for him. I'm confident if we do a good job on this, Ross Perot is history."
In a study of the 1992 general elections that was released today, two organizations lobbying for changes, Public Citizen and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, sought to demonstrate why the legislation was necessary.
Among other things, the study found that in 265 of the 287 races where House incumbents faced challengers, the incumbent outspent the challenger by at least $100,000. It also found that in 211 of 287 races, incumbents raised at least $150,000 more from political action committees than their challengers raised.
 
No Cheers for Change
 "The key issue that we've been fussing about for a long time is that Congressional races are not competitive," said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen. She said the President's proposal "will have a substantial impact on that by putting a limit on expenditures."
The reluctance among Democratic lawmakers to pass a campaign finance bill was demonstrated Tuesday night when the President addressed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Dinner, a fund-raising event here.
The lawmakers and the lobbyists who bought tickets cheered when Mr. Clinton talked about reforming education, creating jobs and improving health care. But there was hardly a peep when he declared, "We ought to pass a campaign finance reform bill."

HEADLINE: Manufacturers and Farmers Oppose Clinton Energy Tax

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Manufacturers and farmers organizations declared war on President Clinton's proposed energy tax today, while at the same time opponents in the Congress said it would hurt industry and agriculture.
On the day the House Ways and Means Committee took up the energy tax, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Farm Bureau announced that they had formed a coalition of more than 900 companies and associations that would fight the tax. 
 The coalition asserted that the tax would make American industry less able to compete in the world market and seriously harm rural America.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the manufacturers group, said everyone would lose under the proposed tax "because it directly hurts the American economy at so many important points."
"This particular tax is a jobs killer," he said.
 
Unease in Both Camps
 The coalition's concerns were voiced just a few hours later by members of the Ways and Means Committee, the House's chief tax-writing committee, as Republicans said the energy tax would weaken American industry and farm-state Democrats voiced uneasiness with it.
"You're raising the price of every manufactured product," said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the committee's ranking Republican.
Representative Peter Hoagland, Democrat of Nebraska, said farmers would have problems passing on the increased costs stemming from the tax because they operate in a fiercely competitive global market.
The Administration's energy tax is based on the heat content of fuels as measured in B.T.U.'s, or British thermal units. The proposed tax, expected to raise more than $20 billion a year, would be levied on coal, gasoline, natural gas and other forms or energy.
 
What Would Replace It?
 Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who was one of the committee's most vocal defenders of the tax, said the tax was an important part of the President's proposal. He laid down a challenge to the tax's opponents, saying, "It's important to ask, 'If it were removed, what would be in its place?' "
Even with a few Democratic defections, the proposal is expected to survive the Ways and Means Committee, where Democrats outnumber Republicans, 24 to 14. But it will face a tougher time in the Senate Finance Committee, the Senate's principal tax-writing committee, because the Democrats have 11 members to the Republicans' 9. In addition, some Democrats on the panel come from states dominated by agriculture and the energy industry.
The new coalition is called the Affordable Energy Alliance and includes the American Petroleum Institute, the American Dairy Products Institute and the National Federation of Independent Business, a grouping of 600,000 small businesses. Notably absent from the coalition was the United States Chamber of Commerce.
Many energy producers oppose the tax because it would raise energy prices and probably eat into energy consumption, and industry profits.
Responding to the formation of the coalition, a Treasury official said: "There are a lot of business concerned about the effect that the deficit has on our nation's economic prospects, who are supporting the President's plan, B.T.U. tax and all. They are concerned about the consequences of a continued failure to rein in the deficit."
In a news conference, Mr. Jasinowski said the new coalition hoped to block the tax in the House, but he predicted that the opponents would have a better chance killing it in the Senate. He said the coalition would focus on contacting lawmakers in states with large energy industries, including Louisiana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas and West Virginia.
How successful Washington-based industry groups are in blocking the tax could hinge largely on whether they succeed in getting thousands of businesses and farmers around the country to fight the tax.
The coalition said the new tax would significantly slow economic growth and cost the nation more than 600,000 jobs by 1998 -- an assertion Administration officials said was vastly exaggerated.
 
Squeeze on Farmers?
 According to the coalition, the energy tax and raising the cost of using inland waterways would squeeze farmers, costing an Illinois farmer with 500 acres of grain $670 a year.
To increase the tax's chances, the Administration has changed it several times since it was unveiled on Feb. 17. Petroleum products are supposed to be taxed at a higher B.T.U. rate than other fuels with the aim of reducing oil imports. But bowing to pressures from senators in New England, the Administration decided not to place the special levy on home-heating oil because so many New England homes are heated by oil.
For coal, the tax was originally to be levied at the mine mouth, but this was changed after mining companies complained that they were not equipped to measure the B.T.U. content of their coal. The Administration now proposes that the tax on coal be collected at the utility or industrial-end user.

HEADLINE: In Cattle-Raising West, a County Wants to Help U.S. Manage Federal Lands

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RESERVE, N.M., May 5

 BODY:
In the last four years Catron County here in southwestern New Mexico has been a thorn in the side of environmentalists and Federal agencies. The county has been filing lawsuits against the Federal Government and passing its own land-use ordinances in a struggle to gain more authority over how Federal forest and grazing lands within its boundaries are managed.
Now the county, home to 2,600 people and a $21 million cattle industry, wants Washington to let it help manage Federal lands under a contract with the Government. And while many environmental groups are suspicious of the county's motives, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt may have no choice but to give the plan a hearing. 
 Catron County has become a center of the movement among ranchers, loggers, property owners and cities to make environmental protection less costly. Its latest proposal is being considered by several Government agencies, and it has been endorsed by Western Senators of both parties.
 
May Be Focus of Hearing
 The plan could become a focus of debate on Thursday when ranchers and environmental groups meet in Albuquerque at the fourth of five public hearings that Mr. Babbitt will hold on the Administration's plan to raise fees for grazing cattle on Federal land.
President Clinton's proposal to increase grazing fees by 56 percent has met with a groundswell of opposition in Western states, where roughly 258 million acres of public land owned by the Forest Service and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, are open to grazing by sheep and cattle. The aim of the Administration's plan is to end the Government's subsidy of cattle ranching in the West and ease damage to the environment.
Under the Catron County proposal, the county would contract with the Federal Government to help maintain grazing lands that extend across a region of mountains, meadows and desert larger than Connecticut. The county argues that the plan would allow it to improve the condition of Federal lands without raising the grazing fees for ranchers.
 
Government Reviewing Plan
 Aspects of the plan were described to top Administration officials last month by Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, at a White House meeting. Mr. Bingaman said in an interview that it is also being reviewed by the Interior and Agriculture Departments.
"These rural counties have very serious problems of sustaining their economic life, and we need innovative solutions to help," said Senator Bingaman. "I think this is one idea that has some merit and is worth exploring."
But environmentalists in New Mexico and around the country say that allowing Western counties, which are influenced by ranchers and loggers, such control in the management of public forests and grazing lands would weaken ecological safeguards.
"It's a terrible idea," said Sam Hitt, director of Forest Guardians, a regional environmental group based in Santa Fe. "It would set a bad precedent. I don't think counties have the expertise, and they are biased toward livestock at the expense of wildlife, water quality and endangered species."
In the past, environmentalists said they viewed the county's legal and political work with more skepticism than alarm. But the newest proposal poses a more substantial threat because of the interest it has generated in Washington, they said.
 
Seeking a New Agency
 Catron County leaders said that hiring the county to care for the range would save money for the Federal Government while demonstrating that counties could protect the environment without choking the economic life out of rural communities.
The proposal would establish a new local agency to provide range management services under contract to the Forest Service. The agency would hire experts to see that the Federal lands would not be overgrazed, that there would be cover and food for wildlife and that erosion would be controlled. Under the plan, the number of Federal employees now doing similar work would be reduced. The county contends this is where the Federal Government would save money.
"What we are after is a creative approach," said Dick Manning, a 56-year-old cattleman who runs 145 head on his Devil's Park ranch in a tight canyon along the San Francisco River 20 miles south of here. "There's a lot of environmental concerns that we share with the conservation groups.
"But we have got to solve the problems without destroying our economy, our customs and our culture. Our life styles are different, but our goals and desires about the land are not."
Mr. Manning, a central figure in the county's struggle for more authority over Federal land use, said the battle is not necessarily between ranchers and environmentalists. He sees it as county residents fighting to regain civil and economic rights that are being eroded by Government regulations.
"This country here is beautiful because people here took care of it," he said while saddling a quarter horse. "The endangered species are here because we did not ruin this ground. The pure streams are here. The forests are here. But we are accused of destroying this land and the Government is the one that is going to come in and protect it with rules and regulations. We just realized that if we don't stand up and fight it was all over."
If the plan is approved, it would be the first time a county had been contracted to help manage public range lands, Government officials said. James Perry, the assistant general counsel for natural resources at the Department of Agriculture, said that such a contract would not require amending Federal laws and could be done through administrative actions.
Since 1906, when the Government began to charge ranchers a monthly fee for every cow and calf fed on public land, every proposed increase has raised some level of opposition among ranchers in the West. But President Clinton's proposal earlier this year to raise the monthly fee for a cow and calf to $2.90 by the end of the decade, 56 percent more than the current $1.86 fee, caused a political storm.
The White House said it was time to end subsidies that were costing the Government tens of millions of dollars a year. Raising the grazing fees would also put cattle ranchers on the same competitive footing as those producing beef on private land, where the costs of leasing land is higher.
But a vast majority of the more than 30,000 ranchers who graze cattle on public land argue that a 56 percent increase would drive thousands of them out of business. They said the result would be to push families off the land, opening counties like Catron to more extensive development by resorts, condominiums and shopping centers, bringing with them higher water pollution and air pollution.
 
Population Damage Cited
 "When you replace a family ranch with five people with a subdivision of 3,000 people, that is significantly more damage to the environment," said Howard Hutchinson, a resident of Glenwood, 40 miles southwest of here, who helped prepare the Catron County proposal. "All the ramifications to the environment from removing cattle from the public lands have not been closely examined."
Such arguments about the human and environmental costs of the Administration's plan have largely been dismissed by environmental groups, particularly those on the East Coast. In the Southwest, some environmental leaders are more sympathetic to the concerns of rural communities.
Lynda Taylor, a staff member of the Southwest Research and Information Center, an environmental research group in in Albuquerque, said: "Environmentalists are locked into their perspective, and they have not looked very carefully at the legitimate concerns of a community whose life is based on natural resources. This is a new issue for environmentalists and for the West. We don't want to supplant one environmental problem with another."
 
Ranching in Gila Forest
 Here in Catron County, almost all the cattle are born and reared in the Gila National Forest, which covers 70 percent of the land. Thus ranchers are subject not just to Government grazing fees but to Federal policies controlling the number of cattle on the land and how the animals are managed.
Earlier this year, the county commissioned an economic analysis from Western New Mexico University about the effect of a 40 percent increase in grazing fees. The study predicted that if the fee was raised to $2.52 a month, the number of cattle would decline to 26,400 from 42,000. Such a sharp drop, the report warned, would reduce the number of ranches to 99 from 165, cut the number of jobs in the industry to 198 from 500 and reduce wages to less than $600,000 a year from nearly $1 million.
The study predicted that most of those who lost their jobs would take their families and leave Catron County, causing the population to drop to less than 2,000 people.
"We're like the Apaches fighting the Government to keep them from taking everything from us," said Harvey Hart, a cowboy and saddle maker. "People are struggling out here to stay alive."
The grim prospects of an increase in the grazing fee led to the county's land-management proposal.
"We can have cattle and a healthy range, and we want to prove it," said Victor Jenkins, a former Forest Service range specialist who helped draw up the plan. But Forest Service staff members here have their doubts.
"They might be in fat city for one or two years." said Gary McCaleb, a Forest Service employee. "But after that the regulations, the lawsuits, and the sheer weight of paperwork will put them exactly where we're at today -- paralyzed."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Medphone blames a messenger for its stock-price troubles.

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
THE Medphone Corporation had two options in explaining why its stock collapsed:
a) Because the Paramus, N.J., company was hemorrhaging cash, losing sales and hanging in such precarious financial condition that its own auditors doubted its survival. 
 Or, b) Because a small investor from Long Island said mean things about Medphone on a computer bulletin board.
Faced with that choice, the maker of electronic cardiac treatment systems blamed the guy with the computer. Setting a legal precedent and raising the corporate blame game to new heights, Medphone sued the investor, Peter DeNigris, for making a series of critical comments about the company on Prodigy's Money Talk bulletin board system.
Medphone said Mr. DeNigris's comments, including allegations that the company could fail and that big stock sellers were in the wings, caused shares to plummet, falling from $1.75 a share in April 1992 to 25 cents yesterday on the American Stock Exchange's Emerging Company Marketplace. On Tuesday, the company said that the Amex would delist its stock next week and that its shares would begin trading over the counter.
Mr. DeNigris sounds pretty powerful. Particularly since, according to his lawyer, Thomas F. Chansky, he did not own a computer until June -- long after Medphone shares began to collapse. Documents from Prodigy show Mr. DeNigris, a resident of Babylon, L.I., did not make his first Medphone comment until July, when the stock had already dropped to 56.25 cents a share. And the plunge could be traced to the summer of 1991, when Medphone's share price fell from $4.25 to $1.31.
No matter to Medphone. "That market decline is not objectively related to the company's performance," the company said in its complaint, filed in September. Rather, it said, Mr. DeNigris's "disparaging statements about Medphone are causing the otherwise inexplicable decline."
Well, not to wave a red flag in front of a suing bull, but if Medphone executives think shareholders had little reason to sell, they haven't been reading their own S.E.C. filings. Even a modest perusal would give any investor the willies.
Start with the company's 10-K for the fiscal year 1992, ended June 30. Sales of its medical products fell more than 50 percent from the previous year. Gross profits fell more, down to slightly more than $62,000. Meanwhile, net losses climbed, to $2.3 million from $1.6 million. The company attributed this performance to the economy.
Still don't see a reason for the "inexplicable" stock drop? Then look at the report of Deloitte & Touche, Medphone's independent auditor. "The company's recurring losses and negative cash flow from operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern," the auditors wrote in their 1992 report.
Things don't get much better in more recent filings. In the first two quarters of this fiscal year, sales grew only slightly over last year's anemic performance for the first six months, from $54,017 to $57,175. But the cost of sales also climbed, meaning gross profits fell yet again.
And Medphone has been burning through cash -- much of it raised in a 1991 secondary stock offering. During the first six months of this fiscal year, cash plummeted from $729,725 to just $27,439. There seems to be little chance of more money from the capital markets. And in its lawsuit, the company says the stock drop "effectively prevented Medphone from obtaining capital necessary for the continuation and expansion of its business," a problem for which it blames Mr. DeNigris. Inventory climbed, even as the company cut advertising and marketing efforts.
Don't think that means other expenses are being cut: Consulting and professional fees almost doubled, to more than $100,000. The reason? Pursuing Mr. DeNigris in court costs money, and apparently Medphone executives think they have nothing better to spend it on.

Group of 7 Nations: Suddenly Pals, But Can They Coordinate?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
DID the finance ministers of the industrial powers really have nothing to squabble about at their meeting in Washington last week -- or did someone spike the punch bowl with LSD? Not to worry: The psychotropic drug of choice, at least in the northwest quadrant of the capital city, remains power.
One reason sweetness and light prevailed, Shafiqul Islam of the Council on Foreign Relations suggests only half-jokingly, is that all seven ministers had been embarrassed by their governments' barroom rhetoric on trade issues. Perhaps more important, there is strong agreement on two paramount issues: the need to stimulate global economic growth and the collective interest in keeping a pro-Western government at the helm of the Russian Federation. It is possible, then, that it will be back to sniping-as-usual -- perhaps even by the economic summit meeting in July. 
 But this mini-era of good feeling does raise an intriguing question. For the last two decades, economists have been fretting over the consequences of failing to coordinate national economic policies in a world of increasingly open markets for goods, capital and labor. Has something changed to make coordination a less impossible dream?
If the industrial powers are looking for an object lesson in the doleful consequences of going it alone, they have only to look at the last few years.
Bonn's unyielding reliance on sky-high interest rates to punish trade union wage hawks and to cope with the costs of German reunification upset Europe's best-laid plans for speedy monetary unification. Toyko's dawdling on fiscal stimulus tipped Japan into recession and gave American auto makers and other protectionists a juicy bilateral trade deficit to point fingers at. Washington's dithering over aid to the former Soviet Union weakened the political hand of radical reformers and helped bring the repository of half the world's nuclear weapons to the edge of anarchy. Economic summitry had come to resemble propaganda exercises, with elected officials mugging for the folks back home.
But this latest meeting of finance ministers seemed to have been orchestrated by Miss Manners: "The Japanese stimulus package was a little bigger thanks to G-7 pressure," says Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics, "and certainly the Germans are feeling the heat on interest rates." For its part, the Clinton Administration is taking aim at the budget deficit, which the rest of the Group of Seven have been complaining about since the mid-1980's.
Is there a way to encourage more of this good thing? It was once fashionable to argue that the Group of Seven needed a permanent staff to scold governments into virtuous behavior. No longer. Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution expects the International Monetary Fund is the closest thing to the hoped-for nanny the Group of Seven is ever likely to get, and dismisses the idea that hired hands can make much difference when national interests are at odds.
Richard Cooper, a Harvard economist and senior diplomat in the Carter Administration, offers a cautiously optimistic perspective. In the early 1980's, he notes, lower interest rates were needed to dig the third world out of the debt crisis, a goal achievable through a coordinated tightening of fiscal policies and loosening of monetary policies.
But the switch was out of the question in large part because the Reagan Administration did not agree with the underlying analysis -- namely that monster American budget deficits were jacking up interest rates. Today, by contrast, there are no comparable analytic conflicts among the economic powers, and thus there is at least the hope of agreeing on which means would serve which ends.
Robert Putnam, a historian of economic summitry at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, adds another reason to accent the positive. "The only times significant work has been done at economic summits," he concludes, "is when it was a White House priority." And unlike its predecessor, he argues, the Clinton Administration seems to take the process seriously.
But Mr. Putnam is not yet uncorking the Dom Perignon. Another likely precondition to revitalizing the Group of Seven, he notes, is strong leaders -- leaders who can make good on their pledges at the expense of powerful domestic interests. And among the seven, probably only Bill Clinton qualifies. Indeed, it is hard to remember a time when so many of these heads of state had so little claim to the affection or even respect of the electorate.
For example, could Kiichi Miyazawa, whose party has been devastated by scandal, take on Japanese rice growers? Could Francois Mitterrand, a lame-duck President, challenge the French grain lobby? Is Helmut Kohl in any position to tell eastern Germans that the good life is still a decade away?
The head says no, but some hearts say maybe. "The G-7 is back," enthuses Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs International, who very much wants it to be true. "The pace and extent of cooperation is self-reinforcing," Mr. Bergsten adds, and is "more than the sum of the parts."

HEADLINE: Embattled Japanese Doctor Retains W.H.O. Post

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
A Japanese doctor, Hiroshi Nakajima, was re-elected yesterday as head of the World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, despite an extraordinary last-minute effort by the United States and European countries to block his re-election.
Dr. Nakajima won a second five-year term in a 93-to-58 vote at the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly in Geneva. 
 The United States and other major donor countries of the health organization contended that Dr. Nakajima, 65, was a poor administrator and communicator and had lost the support of the organization's 4,600-member staff.
But Japan campaigned vigorously to prevent Dr. Nakajima's ouster, and has denied accusations from Western countries that it had used bribery and threats of economic sanctions.
Dr. Nakajima's victory left a cloud of uncertainty over the future of the organization because his re-election was opposed by all the major donor countries. The United States has repeatedly said that the organization is essential to world health. But United States representatives at the World Health Assembly said that they were deeply concerned about problems that could develop between the Clinton Administration and Congress over support for the organization because loss of confidence in Dr. Nakajima's leadership was so widespread. The United States pays 25 percent of the organization's budget.
Walter Broadnax, Under Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, who led the U.S. delegation, said the Clinton Administration and the governments of "many other nations cannot justify going to our legislatures and people to request funds for W.H.O. unless we can assure those people that corrective steps are being taken in relation to both the fact and the appearance of any misconduct."
"Only managerial and leadership changes can prevent further erosion" in the organization's effectiveness, Mr. Broadnax told The Associated Press.
Dr. Nakajima passed a key hurdle last January when the organization's executive board voted 18 to 13 to recommend his re-election. Such recommendations have always led to unanimous approval at the World Health Assembly.
But before the election, a lengthy, acrimonious two-day debate erupted over the selection of Dr. Nakajima. It focused on auditors' reports on the awarding of contracts to members of the executive board prior to its January vote recommending Dr. Nakajima. Executive Board Chairman Jean-Francois Girard of France ordered the audit after reports that Japan was using threats and vote-buying to win Dr. Nakajima's re-election.
Mr. Girard said that 23 of the 31 board members were awarded contracts. Approximately 60 such contracts were awarded in the final half of 1992. The largest -- for $150,000 -- went to a former health minister in the Philippines for a study of his country's health system. Mr. Girard called the contracts legal but said that they presented "a problem of ethics."
"The question is not whether these contracts were technically within the rules," Mr. Broadnax said. But he added that the health organization "must meet the highest standards of accountability."
During the Assembly debate, Canada urged a ban on W.H.O. contracts with board members and recently retired staff members.

HEADLINE: Budapest Tries to Sell Hungarians on Capitalism

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, May 5

 BODY:
All over the Hungarian capital, a little boy in the red fez, the trademark of an Austrian grocery chain, beckons buyers. In addition, a German clothing chain's outlets and American candy shops compete for space along the Great Ring Road in Budapest with fast food franchises like Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dunkin' Donuts.
But the market economy that has brought variety to store shelves in the Hungarian capital has also brought the prospect of new monopolies. 
 Foreign retail companies are not only envied for the resources they can devote to modernizing their retail operations and advertising campaigns. They are also accused of passing up Hungarian goods in favor of imports, and contributing to the collapse of domestic industries already hit hard by the demise of the Comecon market.
Hungarians are trying to fight back against what many see as a potential foreign economic takeover. Opposition parties have called for privatization to be brought under direct supervision of parliament to insure that foreign companies do not buy Hungarian companies just to take over their markets.
The Christian Democratic People's Party, a member of the three-party governing coalition, has called for privatization in the food-processing sector to be halted. And the populist wing of the dominant Hungarian Democratic Forum is pushing for privatization to be slowed.
After a German retail group backed out of talks with the State Property Agency to buy Hungary's Centrum department store chain, a group of Hungarian businessmen made a bid for a majority share in the company.
"Retail chains with a 100-year tradition of selling Hungarian goods are dangerous to sell to foreigners whose interest is in selling through their own international networks," said Peter Vadasz, the president of Microsystem, Ltd. and the leader of the 10 businessmen who tried to gain a controlling share of Centrum.
Two years ago, foreigners acquired 70 percent of privatized property in Hungary. While that figure has decreased by now to about 50 or 60 percent, Hungarians still feel largely shut out of privatization.
Late last year, the Government decided to encourage Hungarian participation in privatization by floating shares of two prominent state-owned companies, the Danubius Hotels and Pick Salami, on the Budapest stock exchange. Now, after hesitating over the bid by the 10 businessmen, the State Property Agency has decided to float Centrum shares on the exchange.
In an attempt to coax Hungarians to part with some of their savings, the Government has also decided to offer installment payment opportunities for small investors to purchase shares in some state companies that will be listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange.
According to Eva Voszka, a specialist in privatization at the Financial Research Institute in Budapest, savings in Hungary amount to about $10.5 billion, or approximately half the value of state-owned assets.
"Savings in Hungary have grown very rapidly in the last three years, to everyone's surprise," Ms. Voszka said. "The problem is that people don't want to invest in state assets, because the profitability is very low."
Of 1,500 state enterprises, 15 percent are profitable, one-third are just surviving, and half are showing losses. Up to now, in spite of the governing party's hope of privatizing half of state property in three years, only about 17 percent of state property has been transferred to private hands.
To attract more domestic investors, the Government is considering easing terms for credit. It is also dividing large companies into smaller units that would be potentially more affordable to Hungarians.
"The splitting up of enterprises is a new slogan of the Government, and the other side of the program to create a strong middle class," Ms. Voszka said.
But critics say that by succumbing to political pressure to distribute state assets cheaply to citizens, the Hungarian Government is ducking the main economic aim of privatization.
"We've already learned that you can't just create a working class," Mr. Vadasz added. "Well, the same goes for creating a middle class."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Mark And Gold Is Off in New York

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against the German mark amid disappointment that the Bundesbank did not ease German interest rates further. But signs of a sluggish economic recovery limited the dollar's gains.
The dollar also firmed slightly against the Japanese yen, but it slumped against a resurgent Swiss franc. 
 Gold prices fell 20 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold for current delivery settled at $354.60 an ounce. Late in the day, the Republic National Bank quoted spot gold at $353.75 an ounce, down 55 cents.
The German central bank allowed money market rates to slip to 7.71 percent from 7.75 percent in its weekly open market operation yesterday. The modest easing suggested to foreign exchange dealers that the bank would not immediately cut official rates. The mark drifted against most European currencies and the yen.
"There is a belief that rates are close to bottoming out everywhere in Europe except Germany, so the mark is falling across the board," a bank dealer in New York said.
The Swiss franc finished in Europe at its strongest close against the mark since mid-December. Dealers said previous speculation that the Swiss National Bank might cut interest rates was dashed by expectations of growing inflation.
The lira held up well despite a downgrading of Italy's foreign currency debt to A1 from Aa3 by Moody's Investor Service Inc.
The dollar rose to 1.5791 German marks in late New York trading, from 1.5755 marks on Tuesday.
The dollar showed little immediate reaction to the news that the Treasury was reducing its offerings of 30-year bonds, emphasizing instead those issues with shorter maturities.
Tokyo markets were closed until today for national holidays. In New York, the dollar was quoted late yesterday at 110.55 Japanese yen, up from 110.25 yen on Tuesday.
The British pound was at $1.5663 in New York, up slightly from $1.5660 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Prices of Lumber in Plunge As House Completions Fall

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Lumber prices plunged yesterday to their lowest level in three months after a Government report that housing completions had declined.
The Commerce Department said housing completions fell 11.4 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.096 million. While much of the decline was tied to severe weather conditions, traders said building activity was not expected to improve fast enough to absorb built-up supplies. 
 "The weather has been a problem, but the industry also overestimated demand," said Curt Cunningham, president of Pacific Futures Trading in Seattle. "Housing starts have been down for the last three months, building permits were down sharply, and new construction spending was down. It looks like the economy is less robust than the industry had planned."
Lumber for July delivery settled at $311 for 1,000 board feet, down $10, the most it is permitted to fall on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Lumber has soared about $200 since November 1992 on increasing logging restrictions in the Northwest and a predicted upturn in housing demand.
 
Inventories Gained in March
 Since March 15, July lumber has fallen $137.80, or 44.3 percent, from its peak at $448.80, when mills and lumberyards began cutting prices to reduce inventories. Inventories swelled in March, as adverse weather conditions hampered deliveries to construction sites.
Mills were quoting spruce two-by-fours at an average of about $260 for 1,000 board feet yesterday, down $50 from last week.
On other commodity markets, cotton futures rose and pork belly futures rebounded while other livestock futures slipped. Oil futures were higher.
Crude oil for June delivery rose 7 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, ending the day at $20.46 a barrel. June heating oil was 0.15 cent higher at 55.73 cents a gallon. June unleaded gasoline was 0.12 cent higher at 61.71 cents a gallon and June natural gas was 9.3 cents lower at $2.224 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Despite G.O.P. Boycott, Democratic Legislators Elect McCall as Comptroller

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 5

 BODY:
Democratic members of the Legislature elected H. Carl McCall as New York's State Comptroller today, but the Republican lawmakers who boycotted the process filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the vote.
Mr. McCall, the first black to hold a statewide elective office in New York, took the oath of office immediately after the vote. Although the Republican lawsuit puts his election in the hands of a judge, Republican officials said they were less interested in unseating Mr. McCall than in changing the procedure for filling future vacancies and for managing the comptroller's office. 
 The court challenge, which will be heard on Tuesday in State Supreme Court in Albany, focuses on technical issues of legal language and parliamentary procedure. But it signifies a major constitutional rift within New York's divided Legislature.
And it generated a volley of speeches, news conferences and news releases today in which legislative leaders used unusually harsh language to attack and counterattack.
 
'Attempting Blackmail'
 "While accusing us of backroom deals, they were attempting blackmail," Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, said of his Republican colleagues.
The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I., said in a Senate debate Tuesday night that the Democratic vote was "unconstitutional," "clearly illegal," "uncalled for," "unreasonable" and "a shabby way to deal with the majority in this house."
What's more, Mr. Marino issued a statement that gave Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine's first name as Stanley, a name that Mr. Lundine does not like to be called.
Several Democratic legislators accused the Republicans of seeking to thwart the election of a black.
"While the so-called lower house has heard the booming cry of justice born from our opportunity to select H. Carl McCall, the masters of the upper house have become deaf on this occasion," said Senator Alton R. Waldon Jr., a Queens Democrat who is black.
In response, Mr. Marino said, "The issue's not Carl McCall and it has nothing to do with race."
Mr. McCall, who is 57, said today that he would begin working immediately and that he had resigned as president of the New York City Board of Education and as a vice president of Citibank. After telling The New York Post on Tuesday that "running for governor is the next logical step," he deflected questions about his political future, saying he would concentrate on the job at hand.
He called the lawsuit "an act of irresponsibility" and said he worried that it would create nervousness in the financial markets about New York State notes and bonds. But he said he would try not to let the court battle distract him.
 
'A Terrible Distraction'
 "It wouldn't be just a personal distraction," Mr. McCall said. "It would be a terrible distraction for the people of the state of New York to think that this office is in some way seige at this important time."
Mr. McCall's election made New York the 13th state to have a black holding a statewide elective office, said David A. Bositis, a senior research associate with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington organization that specializes in minority affairs.
It also marked the first time since 1942, when Herbert H. Lehman was Governor, that all four of the statewide elected officials in state government have been Democrats. That bit of history made Mr. McCall's election particularly hard to swallow for the state's Republican leaders.
Since 1979, the comptroller's office was occupied by a Republican, Edward V. Regan, who announced in February that he would resign on April 30 to become the president of an economics institute. The State Constitution requires the Legislature to fill vacancies in the offices of comptroller and attorney general when they occur in the middle of a term.
New York's Assembly has a Democratic majority while the Senate is controlled by Republicans. But 127 of the 211 legislators are Democrats, enabling the Democrats to elect Mr. McCall today. The vote was 121 for Mr. McCall with 2 abstentions.
The Republican sections of the semicircular Assembly chamber remained empty during the vote, looking like missing pieces of a pie.
Mr. Marino charged in the lawsuit that the vote was illegal because the Senate had not voted to convene a joint session with the Assembly. But state law speaks only of a "joint ballot," not a joint session. And the Democrats maintained that Mr. Weprin and Mr. Lundine, who holds the ceremonial title of president of the Senate, could call a joint ballot without the Senate's agreement.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Refocusing

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
When President Clinton confessed on Tuesday that the White House needed "tighter coordination" because it had lost clarity of purpose, he said he planned to fix things by reorganizing his staff. It may take more than that.
The President is part of the problem, in the view of many senior staff members, because of his own native ebullience, the type of experience he brought to the job and the kinds of people he chose to surround himself with. He needs to learn to discipline himself, the associates say, as well as strengthening the structure built to serve him. 
 "A wise man told me when we started that the governors of small states tended to think Washington was an overgrown state capital," said a Clinton confidant. "He told me that the President would find the lessons he learned in Little Rock of real but quite limited use here, and he was absolutely right.
"You can't do it all at once. The media are harder. The Republicans are stronger. The bureaucracy is bigger and tougher. We have to change."
 
Mondale Advice Unheeded
 Mr. Clinton populated his White House staff and the domestic departments and agencies largely with men and women of limited Washington experience, many of them very young. Observing this, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale urged Mr. Clinton to take on at least one or two ranking staff members who had worked in the White House, but his advice was not heeded. As a result, learning the ropes has taken more time than it might have.
By contrast, the President, conscious of his own lack of experience in the area, chose experienced hands for the major foreign-policy and national-security roles, and many in Washington think Mr. Clinton has done a better job in foreign affairs than on most domestic matters, contrary to the general expectation.
The linchpin of most White House operations since Dwight D. Eisenhower's has been the chief of staff. Often, like Donald T. Regan and John H. Sununu in the Reagan and Bush administrations respectively, they have been sacrificed to propitiate the gods of politics at moments of stress for their Presidents.
By all accounts, the role of Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, is rather less all-embracing than those of his most recent predecessors, and the President did not directly blame him for his troubles. Indeed, he promised to get him some help. That is expected to arrive later this week in the form of Roy Neel, a 47-year-old Washington veteran who has served for many years as an aide to Vice President Al Gore.
Mr. Neel will join Mark Gearan as a second deputy to Mr. McLarty.
 
Overworked but Competent
 White House officials sprang to the defense of Mr. McLarty and Mr. Gearan, describing them as overworked but highly competent. Still, a staff shake-up is hardly a vote of confidence in the leader of that staff, and one top aide made the faintly damning comment, "I think Mack can still make a success of this job if the reorganization is done properly."
In an effort to focus the President's message more sharply, George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, has been asked to step back from his involvement with the daily briefings and give more attention to overall media and political strategy. But it is not yet clear how the change would work, who would take over the briefings or, indeed, whether Mr. Stephanopoulos will agree to any change.
The cascade of policy proposals in recent weeks, which the President's strategists fear might make it harder to push through his economic program and health-care plan in the form he wishes, results partly from inexperience, several top officials concede.
In addition, Mr. Clinton has found it hard to concentrate on domestic objectives when foreign crises like those in Russia and Bosnia keep crowding in on the Oval Office. An aide said today that the President "is terribly frustrated with the time that stuff costs him, though he knows how critical it is to him and to the country."
 
In Love With Details
 But the problems also result from what another old friend terms Mr. Clinton's "impatience to get things done and his utter absorption in -- no, his love affair with -- all the details and the subtleties of domestic policy."
Mr. Clinton is proposing major new programs at a rate approaching that of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson at the beginning of their Presidencies. But he has smaller majorities on Capitol Hill and more tenuous support in the country than they did, and they were helped by the sense of national trauma caused by the Depression and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Because of the effort to do so many things at once, a number of Mr. Clinton's proposals have had to be sharply modified, even before they reached the floor of the Senate or the House of Representatives. That was true of the immunization program and the plan to drop the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces, among other measures.
Even more significantly, the country has been bombarded with news articles about a $10 billion program for this and an $8 billion program for that, capped by a report this week that the health-care plan might cost $100 to $150 billion, at a time when deficit cuts remains a leading national preoccupation.
As a result of such reports, and the relentless efforts of Ross Perot to picture Mr. Clinton as a man who places a low priority on cutting the deficit, the President is in danger of seeming to be not what he said he was in last year's campaign -- a new kind of Democrat -- but an unreconstructed high-tax liberal.
 
Unfavorable Numbers
 Recent polls show that more voters now see Mr. Clinton as an apostle of government spending than as a foe of big government, and some show a plurality arguing that the nation is on the wrong track. Three months ago the numbers were much more favorable to the President, and the turnaround worries his advisors.
So does the seeming ability of Mr. Perot to hold on indefinitely to most of the support he attracted last year -- almost one voter in five, a group that Mr. Clinton badly needs if he is to assure his re-election in 1996.
Some of this was no doubt inevitable, and there are signs that hard lessons are being well learned.
Never again, senior officials say, will they make the mistake of describing the Republicans as "irrelevant," as some of them did when the Senate was debating the President's economic stimulus package. The slur, like the careless remark of rival players stirring up a football team, played a significant role in promoting enough Republican unity to enable them to sustain a filibuster and hand Mr. Clinton a major defeat.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 5

 BODY:
Experts monitoring North Korea say they are increasingly concerned that the country may be preparing to use 50 tons of uranium now fueling a large reactor as raw material for nuclear weapons.
The diversion, under the guise of a long-planned change of fuel in the reactor, seems likely to come within weeks or months of June 12, when North Korea officially withdraws from the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. If efforts to persuade North Korea to respect the treaty fail, the country's hard-line Communist leadership would be free on June 12 to convert the spent fuel into plutonium, the element at the core of nuclear bombs. 
 The 50 tons would be enough to produce two or three nuclear bombs. But the elaborate process could take several months or a year, depending on the size and sophistication of North Korea's sites. United States intelligence officials say Pyongyang has kept at least some reprocessing ability hidden from international inspectors.
 
Showdown Over Inspections
 The inspections, which started only last year, ceased about three months ago, just before North Korea announced that it would pull out of the treaty. After fencing with the International Atomic Energy Agency for months, Pyongyang said it would leave the treaty when the agency insisted on visiting two sites that United States intelligence identified as being at the center of the weapons project.
Ordinarily the removal of reactor fuel is closely monitored to assure that none is diverted to weapons. But North Korea has kept the agency guessing about whether it will be allowed to oversee the process, or precisely when it will occur.
Indeed, there is a growing suspicion that the Government is using the chance to monitor the removal -- and to take samples showing whether some fuel may have already been diverted to weapons -- as a bargaining chip in its tense negotiations with the West.
"They are dangling this in front of us, perhaps as a negotiating ploy," said one official involved. "They know that we know that once this spent fuel disappears, we suddenly will have a big problem."
 
Waltzing With Washington
 The Clinton Administration is pressing China, North Korea's closest ally, to persuade the Government to permit a "special inspection" of two buildings in Yongbyon, a heavily guarded research station 60 miles north of Pyongyang.
In recent weeks United States officials have said that if North Korea rejoins the treaty's members and allows full inspections, Washington may be prepared to open direct talks with North Korea. Indeed, United States and North Korean officials met today in Washington to lay the groundwork for high-level talks to defuse the tension over the nuclear program, Reuters reported.
Several American and Japanese officials say they doubt that diplomacy will lead the North to back down. Their view is that President Kim Il Sung and his son, Kim Jong Il, have determined that international inspections would eventually bring North Korea's multi-billion-dollar nuclear program to a standstill.
"North Korea's regime sees its nuclear program as vital to its survival, and there is every reason to believe it will go to the mat to protect it," Gen. Robert W. RisCassi, the commander of United States forces in South Korea, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month in one of the most pessimistic assessments yet of the chances of keeping North Korea from becoming a nuclear power.
 
A Debate About Diplomacy
 General RisCassi, who appears to view developments in North Korea with even more alarm than do many in the intelligence community, said he was "increasingly concerned that North Korea could slide in an attack as an uncontrollable consequence of total desperation or internal instability."
"We must disabuse ourselves of the confidence we gained during the cold war that North Korea was manageable," he warned.
Indeed there is growing disagreement on the question of how to negotiate with North Korea, and in recent weeks officials in Washington, Tokyo and Seoul have frequently found themselves at odds. For weeks a debate has raged on whether actions by the Security Council to impose economic sanctions against Pyongyang would help to halt the nuclear project, or whether, as South Korea fears, it may provoke the North to lash out. Nor is it clear that China, which holds a veto in the council, would approve sanctions.
"The fact is that all the options are bad," a senior Japanese official said last week. "Military solutions to the nuclear problem are too dangerous. And even if we can get them passed, economic sanctions probably won't do much good."
No inspections have been made in North Korea since the country announced on March 12 that it would withdraw from the treaty to "protect our supreme national interest." The International Atomic Energy Agency says three inspectors were to enter North Korea last Sunday to change films in monitoring cameras, but they never received visas. The inspectors hope now to go to North Korea over the weekend.

HEADLINE: INFECTION LINKED TO TAINTED CIDER

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 5

 BODY:
A study published today has documented an outbreak of bacterial infection in southeastern Massachusetts caused by fresh-pressed apple cider.
The study by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta showed that the bacteria, Escherichia coli 0157:H7, had been found in the cider and that it had caused severe diarrhea, abdominal cramps and other ailments in 1991. 
 The same strain of bacteria in undercooked hamburger caused three deaths and 500 illnesses in the Pacific Northwest earlier this year.
The study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, was conducted by Dr. Richard Besser, a medical epidemiologist at the disease control centers.
 
Four Had Kidney Failure
 He said it was unusual to find the E coli bacteria strain in apple cider, and added, "This raises our awareness that this pathogen can survive in many different types of food."
The study was based on an isolated outbreak of diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, a severe form of the infection characterized by kidney failure and anemia. Four young children in the Fall River area developed kidney failure, and local hospital officials called in investigators from the disease control centers, a Federal agency.
Twenty-three people, ranging in age from 2 to 70, were infected by the E coli bacteria strain, apparently from drinking fresh-pressed cider made from unwashed apples and sold by the Old Swanzey Orchard, a small cider mill in Swansea, Mass. They suffered from diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Six people, including five children, were hospitalized, but none died.
Anthony Andrade, owner of the Old Swanzy Orchard, said he had cooperated fully with the investigation. Although the evidence pointed to his cider as the culprit, he said, it was never definitively proven. He settled several lawsuits and has since got out of the cider business.
 
Long-Lasting Bacteria
 Dr. Besser noted that Swanzey had pressed its cider in a manner similar to that of other small cider producers. He said that apples already on the ground, called "drops," had been pressed without being washed and scrubbed, that the cider had not been pasteurized and that no preservatives had been added.
The apples may have been contaminated on the ground by deer feces or during the cider production. Dr. Besser found that the E coli bacteria survived for 20 days in the unpreserved refrigerated apple cider.
"We don't want to overreact from one outbreak," he said in an interview. "But we have no idea how big a problem this could be."
Dr. Besser said there were two previous outbreaks of diarrhea associated with apple cider. In 1980 an outbreak of severe infection in Canada was linked to an E coli infection of fresh-pressed apple juice. Apple cider was also believed to be the cause of a Salmonella outbreak in New Jersey in 1974.
The study is a cause for concern for apple growers throughout New England; each year they produce millions of gallons of fresh-pressed cider for sale at supermarkets and farmers' produce stands. Massachusetts has about 50 large cider mills registered with the state, but many small mills are not registered.
Frank Carlson, chairman of the Massachusetts Cider Guild and owner of Carlson Orchards in Harvard, Mass., said most cider pressed and sold in Massachusetts was of high quality and made properly. "As a large producer, I can't imagine not washing and brushing my apples," he said.
Apple growers say pasteurizing is not feasible; pasteurized cider creates apple juice, a different product, and alters the taste. Mr. Carlson also said the cost of pasteurization equipment is high and "would put hundreds of mills out of business."
Dr. Besser said a survey taken at a New England trade show last year showed that 36 cider producers of 45 at the show produced nine million gallons of cider in 1991 using "drops," and that only 12 reported routinely washing and brushing the apples before pressing.
 
State Regulations Cited
 Nancy Ridley, director of the Division of Food and Drug Administration in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said she had begun a statewide effort at educating all cider producers about state regulations that require washing and brushing of fruit before processing.
She also said she was concerned about the practice of using apples already on the ground. "With drops, if you've got breaks in the surface of the apple, washing and brushing may not be enough to get inside," she said. "Somebody needs to give serious consideration to the use of drops."
Apple growers say it would not be economical to make cider out of picked apples. Some growers use culls, or slightly marred apples, in cider production, but there are not enough culls to produce the volume needed.
Large producers of apple products pasteurize all of their apple juice products, even those called cider in some parts of the country. Larry Davenport, executive director of the Processed Apples Institute in Atlanta, which represents large apple-product manufacturers, said major corporations harvest their apples from the tree and drops are not used.
Dr. Besser said: "I don't say people shouldn't drink apple cider. But for someone at risk for more severe disease, like very young children or the elderly, I'd think twice about giving them apple cider."

HEADLINE: Irving Howe, 72, Critic, Editor and Socialist, Dies

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Irving Howe, the literary critic and founding editor of Dissent magazine, who spent a lifetime advancing the cause of humane, democratic socialism, died early yesterday morning at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 72.
The cause was cardiovascular disease, the hospital said. Mr. Howe had collapsed at his home in Manhattan. 
 He was an emblematic New York Jewish intellectual, a man of modest origins who rose to pre-eminence in the serious study of ideas, literature and politics. He was known for many things, including a large, steady output of essays on culture and literature, the advocacy of democratic socialism and chronicling the Jewish experience in America.
 
National Book Award Winner
 Perhaps his most famous and widely read book was "World of Our Fathers," a history of Eastern European immigration to the United States that won the National Book Award in 1976.
Dissent, the magazine he founded and edited for nearly four decades, was for most of that time a leading journal of a certain kind of American politics. It was deeply critical of the abuses of capitalism and what its writers sometimes saw as the paranoia of this country, but it was even more repelled by leftist totalitarianism, in the Soviet Union, Cuba or elsewhere.
"Howe was always a counterpuncher who tended to dissent from the prevailing orthodoxy of the moment, whether left or right, though he himself was certainly a man of the left," said Morris Dickstein, professor of English at Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center. "Whatever way the herd was going, he went in the opposite direction."
 
A Target of Conservatives
 Mr. Howe was persistently attacked for his lifelong commitment to socialism by conservatives, including many Jewish neo-conservatives grouped around Dissent's rival magazine, Commentary. He also quarreled famously with the leading figures of the New Left in the early 1960's and was reviled by many of the student radicals of that era.
"He lived in three worlds, literary, political and Jewish, and he watched all of them change almost beyond recognition," said Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic and a friend of Mr. Howe for 20 years.
"He saw the end of socialism. He saw literature be mauled by second-rate deconstructionists and third-rate sociologists of race, class and gender. And he saw the world of Yiddish disappear."
"But he never surrendered to nostalgia," Mr. Wieseltier said. "He remained almost diabolically engaged with the politics and the culture of his time."
 
Wrote Critical Studies
 Among Mr. Howe's influential books are "'Decline of the New," "Politics and the Novel" and an autobiography, "A Margin of Hope," published in 1982. He wrote critical studies of William Faulkner and Sherwood Anderson and a biography of Leon Trotsky, the Russian revolutionary who was one of his childhood heroes.
Mr. Howe, a tall man with wispy white hair who loved vigorous conversation above all things, had many highly developed interests.
For many years he was a Distinguished Professor of English at the City University of New York, where he was famous for passionate lectures on literature. He could be abrupt and flinty when confronted with what he regarded as stupidity or sanctimoniousness. The story is told, for example, of his response when a woman, attending a lecture he gave on "The World of Our Fathers," criticized him for not titling the book "World of Our Fathers and Our Mothers."
" 'World of Our Fathers' is a title," Mr. Howe responded testily. " 'World of Our Fathers and Our Mothers' is a speech."
 
The Fate of a Radical
 Or the time in the 1960's at Stanford University when he was harassed by a student radical, among the many who felt that Mr. Howe, lacking in his commitment to "the revolution," had become a lackey of the status quo. Mr. Howe turned to the student and said: "You know what you're going to be? You're going to be a dentist."
"There is utopia and utopia," Mr. Howe once wrote. "The kind imposed by an elite in the name of a historical imperative -- that utopia is hell. It must lead to terror and then, terror exhausted, to cynicism and torpor."
"But surely there is another utopia," he continued. "It cannot be willed either into existence or out of sight, it speaks for our sense of what may yet be."
He was a bon vivant. He married three times. He loved the ballet and classical music and going to parties.
 
Last of a Breed
 Above all perhaps, Mr. Howe was among the last of a breed of public intellectuals. Like his socialist colleague, Michael Harrington, or his intellectual and political rivals Norman Podhoretz and Irving Kristol, Mr. Howe could express learned, rigorous opinions on many subjects.
He honed his skills and his ideas in the lunchroom alcoves of City College in the late 1930's, debating socialism and Stalinism, fascism, Tolstoy and the meaning of Judaism.
"Part of what he embodied is the notion of being a serious intellectual who was both political and literary," said Paul Berman, a writer and contributor to Dissent. "It's not that he had two careers, but that he lived a life informed by the ideal of being as serious as you could be, both about culture and about politics, and his idea of socialism was rooted in the old idea that socialism was itself an expression of high culture."
 
A Bronxian Tangle of Poverty
 Irving Howe was born on June 11, 1920, in the East Bronx, a community, he said in his autobiography, that "formed a thick tangle of streets crammed with Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, almost all of them poor." His father ran a grocery store that failed, then worked as a peddler and finally a presser in a dress factory. His mother also worked in the dress trade as an operator.
It was a world of close families and of Depression-era economic insecurity, but also of occasional trips to Yankee Stadium to see Babe Ruth ("the greatest man in the Bronx") play.
And it was a world of radical politics. The young Irving Howe became, he said, a socialist at the age of 14, socialism for the Jews of the Bronx being "an encompassing culture, a style of perceiving and judging."
Except for a few years as an ardent follower of Trotskyism, Mr. Howe remained attached to socialism for the rest of his life. Like many upwardly mobile children of immigrants, he went to City College, where, he wrote in his autobiography, he spent more time talking with fellow students in the cafeteria than he did in class.
 
The Army, Then Book Reviews
 He graduated in 1940, just in time to spend four years in the Army, two of those years at a remote camp in Alaska where he was able to do a lot of reading. When he returned to the Bronx, he began writing book reviews and essays in the small intellectual magazines of the time, including Commentary, The Nation and Partisan Review. For four years, he earned a living writing book reviews for Time magazine.
In 1953, he was invited to teach English at Brandeis University outside Boston, thus beginning a career that would take him to Stanford and Hunter College before he settled down for a quarter of a century at City University. In 1954, he and a group of close friends founded Dissent, which became a leading journal of what Mr. Howe called "the moderate left." He published Andrei Sinyavsky's famous essay "On Socialist Realism," one of the opening salvos of the Soviet dissident movement. He published the black writer Richard Wright, and Norman Mailer's famous essay "The White Negro."
 
A Discovery: I. B. Singer
 Also in the 1950's Mr. Howe met a Yiddish poet named Eliezer Greenberg and the two began a long project to translate Yiddish prose and poetry into English, eventually publishing six collections of stories, essays and poems. His greatest discovery came when Mr. Greenberg started reading "Gimpel the Fool," a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer, at that time almost entirely unknown to all but the readers of the Yiddish language newspaper The Forward.
"It was a transforming moment," Mr. Howe recalled later. "How often does a critic encounter a major new writer?"
Mr. Howe persuaded Saul Bellow, who had not yet achieved fame himself, to translate the story, which was published in Partisan Review, thereby beginning Singer's climb to literary celebrity among nonreaders of Yiddish.
 
Encountering the New Left
 In 1962, as Mr. Howe recalled in his autobiography, several leading members of the newly formed Students for a Democratic Society, seeing in Mr. Howe a potential elder statesman of their movement, visited the offices of Dissent. It was an ill-fated encounter.
Mr. Howe and others of his generation saw in the New Left tendencies toward violence, irrationalism, petulance and intolerance, impulses that they associated with earlier utopias of the sorts that had come to no good in the Soviet Union. Mr. Howe became a leading critic of the student radicals, even predicting in a much-noted article in the New York Times Magazine in 1970 that "the first and mildest consequence" of leftist terrorism in America would be the election of Ronald Reagan to the Presidency.
Mr. Howe retired from City University in 1986, but continued to give speeches and to write essays for Dissent. His health had been deteriorating in recent years.
He is survived by his wife, Ilana, his children, Nicholas and Nina, and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: PORT REPUBLIC JOURNAL;
Where the Biggest News Is Something From 1778

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

DATELINE: PORT REPUBLIC, N.J.

 BODY:
THE monument to the battle of Chestnut Neck is hard to find, despite its 50-foot height that pushes a resolute figure of a granite Continental Army soldier above the tops of surrounding pin oaks and scrub pines.
Most travelers come upon it by chance, just as they might stumble across Port Republic, a town walled off along with its 350 years of history because of an unintentional partnership between conservationists and traffic engineers. 
 Salt marshes protected by the Federal and state governments form a wide green- and dun-colored band around the northern end of the Atlantic County coastline. And from the Garden State Parkway, the unbroken mantle of the Pine Barrens rolls westward to the horizon.
And that suits the 992 residents of Port Republic (1990 Census) and lovers of its 19th century clapboard ambiance just fine.
The opening of the parkway in the mid-1950's parallel to Route 9 was first seen as a local boon. Until then Route 9 was the major north-south roadway, and the summer traffic crawled bumper to bumper along it on the weekends.
But the new toll road did more than ease traffic on Route 9. It captured most of it.
Tourist cabins and roadside eateries on the old highway fell into disuse and closed. No new pizza joints or gas stations, the lifeblood of the Jersey Shore, opened. No shopping malls with cineplexes and concrete garages invaded the open spaces above the marshes and the sandy woodlands. No condos rose on the muddy banks of creeks and kettle ponds.
Then casino gambling in Atlantic City, 10 miles to the southeast, was approved in the late 1970's, and real-estate values in the vicinity shot up. Developers outbid each other for land along Route 9 in anticipation of an economic boom.
It reached Smithville, a neighboring town on Route 9, but traveled no farther.
"People were stacked up and sleeping in tents to buy new houses in Smithville," said Joan Hanselman, a Port Republic resident. "We thought it was just a matter of time till it reached us."
But concern over the threat to protected marshes halted development, she said, and the housing bust of recent years finished it off.
It was a close call, said Claire Gerber, who with her husband, Ned, a utility company executive, moved into the solitude of the Port Republic woods 23 years ago.
"At night we can see the lights of Smithville through the trees," Mrs. Gerber said, noting that the offending subdivision was a mile or two away.
Worse, she added, the sunset serenity at the sea's edge is broken by the sight of brightly lighted Atlantic City casino towers stabbing into the darkening sky.
There is also the steady rumble and whoosh of cars and trucks, mostly out of sight, on the Garden State Parkway.
"The parkway does benefit us in a way," said Gary Giberson, the Mayor of Port Republic, a city incorporated in 1905.
"We collect about $15,000 a year in fines and court costs from speeding tickets the state police write on the parkway along the six miles it runs through our city," he said.
Mr. Giberson said his forebears were among the first settlers on the New Jersey coast, Dutch shipbuilders and sawyers who settled along the Mullica River in 1643.
Port Republic, between the Mullica and a branch waterway, Nacote Creek, became one of the earliest ports in the region, and it was from here that musket and cannonballs for George Washington's army were shipped.
The British sent 400 troops and nine ships in 1778 to rout the defenders of Port Republic in the fort at Chestnut Neck and burned the village, destroying all the colonial homes.
The battle monument was erected in 1911 by the Daughters of the American Revolution. The highway was rerouted in the 1920's, however, so the soldier under the tricornered hat at the top has his back to Route 9.
Mr. Giberson said his family, which held a land grant from the king, was Loyalist, which was not unusual along the New Jersey coast, a hideout for Tories and marginal types who resisted any government, including the newly independent one, that threatened to intrude on their lives.
That outlook prevails today among local fishermen who resent restrictions placed on them by refuge managers.
When people in these parts look toward the rest of the Jersey Shore and south to Atlantic City, they see little to their liking.
"Change is a four-letter word in Port Republic," said Mr. Giberson.
"When I grew up here bald eagles nested on our property, and a young man could make a good living trapping muskrats. Most of that is gone now, of course, but it's still a wonderful place to live if you like small towns and don't mind the words quaint and wholesome."
Outside, a quarter-mile away, the parkway traffic whooshed on in a steady stream, rarely stopping.

Money Market Fund Yields Change Slightly in Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered on tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were mixed in the latest week, with little movement in either direction.
IBC's Money Fund Report said yesterday that its survey showed tax-exempt money fund yields were down slightly in the seven-day period ended Tuesday after a sharp rise the previous week. 
 Tax-exempt yields were off an average 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Meanwhile, investors withdrew $743 million from tax-free funds, leaving them with $98.7 billion in assets. Analysts at the Money Fund Report noted that withdrawals were considerably less than in the previous period, when the outflow was $2.7 billion.
In the latest period, money managers increased the average days left to maturity of securities held in portfolios to 49, from the year's low of 48 days.
IBC/Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt money market fund slipped 3 basis points, to 2.01 percent, with the average seven-day simple yield off 2 basis points, to 1.99 percent. Analysts said that in the last 30 days, the compounded yield averaged 1.97 percent and the simple yield about 1.96 percent.
Besides reflecting interest rate activity in the market, the slip in yields may also be the result of a slight tightening in the amount of new issues available for pricing, which raises the price and lowers the yields.
Without state and local taxes, the taxable equivalent for the seven-day compounded yield is about 2.79 percent for investors in a 28 percent tax bracket and about 2.91 percent for those in a 31 percent bracket.
Among the tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market fund continued to be the best performer with a yield of 2.64 percent, about 9 basis points off the previous week's level, the Money Fund Report said.
 
Taxable Funds
 For the week ended yesterday, the assets of taxable money market funds declined $187 million, to $487.6 billion. Statisticians at the Money Market Report said the addition of several new funds distorted some of the figures.
Institutional fund assets, for example, showed a flow of $2.8 billion coming in. But excluding the new funds, the gain would have been about $1 billion less.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios was unchanged at 63 for the second consecutive week.
"Given the weakness of the economy and recent signs underscoring that weakness," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist for the Money Fund Report, "this week's employment numbers could spark another round of expectations about a Fed move to lower short-term rates."
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compounded yield on a taxable fund was unchanged at 2.65 percent, with the seven-day simple yield at 2.62 percent. The compounded average yield over 30 days is 2.67 percent, while the simple yield is averaging 2.63 percent.
For the third straight week, the Dreyfus Basic Money Market fund turned in the highest yield among general-purpose taxable money funds, with a return of 3.45 percent, down a basis point from the previous week.
Banks, which compete directly with money market funds for investor cash, are offering a yield of 2.56 percent to depositors, about 2 basis points lower than in the previous week.

HEADLINE: Fed Cites Improvement In Economy for April

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said today that there was "generally modest improvement" in the economy in April after the storm-related slowdown in much of the country in March.
In its survey of economic conditions, known as the beige book, the central bank said "shopper traffic and retail sales were reported to have rebounded modestly" last month. 
 The report was more upbeat than some of the Government's recent statistics. But many economists consider the beige book to be less reliable than the Government's statistical reports because it is based on informal surveys and impressions.
 
 
Short-Term Interest Rates
 The beige book was prepared for use at a meeting on May 18 of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's main policy-making committee. The group will determine short-term interest rates over the next six weeks, and most economists expect it to leave rates unchanged. The group meets every six weeks.
The report said that in most of the country, manufacturers reported increased shipments and orders, with production in some automotive and steel plants near capacity.
According to the survey of the nation's 12 Federal Reserve districts, residential real estate activity is strong or on the rise in most regions around the nation, although the Southern California market remains in a slump.
The Federal Reserve said there was a "general increase" in bank lending, noting that it was concentrated in consumer loans and home mortgage refinancings, rather than in business loans. In several areas of the Midwest, however, there was a noticeable pickup in lending to small business.
 
 
Problems in California
 In the West, the survey said, the greatest economic problems were in California, where aerospace and military cutbacks have hurt consumer confidence and economic activity, and western Washington, with the strongest growth in Utah, Idaho and eastern Washington.
Job conditions were mixed in most regions, the report said. It noted that some companies are hiring modestly, particularly in auto parts and capital equipment. But none of the 12 Federal Reserve districts anticipated a flurry of new hiring, and several districts said employers were avoiding new hiring by extending hours, using temporary workers and increasing productivity.
The report saw little in the way of inflationary pressures, a result of stiff competition, slower sales growth and consumer resistance to price increases.
The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said lumber companies reported a 20 percent drop in lumber and plywood prices from their peak in March.
According to the report, many retailers said consumer confidence was lower than at the beginning of the year. A large Midwest retailer surveyed said sales growth was held back by bad weather, concerns about tax increases and uncertainty about the impact of changes in income tax withholding.
Steel production is doing especially well, the report said, because of increased sales of motor vehicles and consumer appliances.
 
 
New York Area Is Mixed
 In the New York area, economic developments "were mixed in recent weeks, but on balance tended toward improvement," the survey said. Many retailers said their sales were below projections during February and March, partly because of severe snowstorms, although some were able to make up the shortfall in late March.
Home builders in the region reported some recent improvement and predicted that home sales would surpass last year's level. The report noted that declining vacancy rates and other factors were prompting some prominent developers to plan new rental apartment buildings for the first time in years.
The report said that no one was anticipating a building boom, however, because of worries about job security and changes in Federal taxes.
According to the report, leasing activity was brisk in midtown Manhattan, with the vacancy rate edging downward.

HEADLINE: Texas Airport Refunding Priced

 BODY:
A $205.5 million tax-exempt bond refunding by the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport was initially priced yesterday with a maximum yield of 5.10 percent for an issue due in 2002 through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company.
All the bonds are insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation, giving the financing a triple-A rating from Moody's and Standard & Poor's. 
 Yields on the remaining serial bonds range from 2.30 percent for 1994 to 4.50 percent for 1998 and 5 percent for 2001. For investors in a 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable bond equivalent yields would be about 3.19 percent for the 1994 maturity, 6.25 percent for 1998 and 7.08 percent for 2002.

HEADLINE: Home Prices: Some Drops

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Home values fell in one-third of the nation's housing markets in the first quarter from their levels a year earlier, and increases slowed in many others, a real estate trade group said today.
Homeowners in the West, particularly in California, were hit the hardest, according to the National Association of Realtors. The survey covered previously owned single-family homes in 129 metropolitan areas. 
 Prices nationwide increased 5.1 percent, to $104,200, compared with a 4.3 percent advance in the fourth quarter. But 46 of the 129 areas surveyed posted declines.
Until the economy began to weaken in the late 1980's, declines in home prices were rare during a 20-year inflation-paced boom.
The realtors said home values fell five-tenths of 1 percent in the West in the first quarter from a year earlier, to a median price of $142,200. The median price was unchanged in the Northeast at $137,400, after a drop of eight-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter. The median means half the homes cost more, and half cost less.

What About Weld?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Republican William F. Weld, successor to Michael Dukakis as Governor of Massachusetts, is building a record in office that should be a conservative's dream:
"Balanced three budgets without raising taxes or borrowing," goes his resume. "Held spending under inflation . . . received unprecedented triple upgrade in state bond rating . . . reduced Medicaid 'budget buster' rate of growth by 64 percent over a three-year period . . . cut taxes five times . . . proposed elimination of state capital gains tax for investments held for six years. . . ." 
 He's a hawk on stopping the Serbs and an ardent free-trader on Nafta. All music to Republican ears.
Why, then, is this robust, 6-foot-4, 47-year-old former chief of the Criminal Division of the Reagan Department of Justice not being thought of as a hot prospect for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination?
One reason is that we're not supposed to think about '96 yet. The immediate Republican goal is to take control of the Senate in '94, which would make Bill Clinton the first half-term President and open the way to the Restoration.
More to the point about Weld, he's outspokenly pro-choice, which is universally assumed by the punditocracy to sink a right-wing candidacy before it is launched.
Let's examine that. Assume that Clinton appoints two, perhaps even three, pro-Roe justices to the Supreme Court; that Congress passes an abortion-rights law; that the French abortion pill hits the market; and that public opinion continues in the direction of compromise -- frowning on but not forbidding abortion.
In that case, the abortion issue will not be a lukewarm button in the campaign of 1996. We will see demonstrations for the new Lost Cause, but each party must, if electability is the criterion, choose a candidate in the widening center -- or one with a running mate who is clearly pro-choice.
But Weld will be charged with being soft on gays. Although he opposes homosexual marriage or insurance coverage for partners of gay employees, he issued an executive order giving the same bereavement leave to state workers to mourn homosexual partners as straights who lose spouses. "The vote was 17 to 1 in my staff meeting," Weld recalled over breakfast the other day, "and I was the one. Homosexual rights does not poll well. Unless opinion shifts, gay rights could make it hard for a person with my views."
Maybe so, maybe not; most Republicans, like most other voters, adopt an attitude of toleration toward homosexuals, withholding the sought-after moral approval but rejecting the gay-bashing that so demeaned the Republican Convention last year. The religious right is vocal, as it has every right to be, but has no veto power over the tolerant conservatives who will be the final contenders.
"My long suit is the economic stuff," says Weld, whose hero is Friedrich Hayek. Clinton's economic plan? "I can't believe he's acting so stupidly, because he's not stupid. Maybe he's trying to be all things to all people because he wants to be liked by everybody. But he was never part of the lunchpail coalition when he was Governor -- his new tax-and-spend policy is nowhere near the view of the majority of the electorate."
Here's my morning line on the Republican race: Jack Kemp was propelled out of the gate to take an early lead, wisely fell back to conserve strength before the first turn; Bob Dole has accepted front-runnership, but the last "Mr. Republican" was Robert Taft; Phil Gramm has fallen off the pace as a dove on Bosnia; Lamar Alexander, Dick Cheney, Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, Bill Bennett are bunched in back; Ross Perot could enter and scratch himself; Pete Wilson, if he can make it to the starting gate by getting re-elected California's Governor in '94, is the dark horse to watch in the stretch.
Weld, the fiscal conservative and social libertarian, is a long shot to win, a good bet to place. If Clinton fails to lay on the whip in the White House and continues into deficit mud, he could be overtaken by a ticket with a Governor who rejuvenated the Massachusetts economy after Democrat Dukakis nearly bankrupted it.
The Republican Weld knows how to bail out a Democratic state after a liberal activist overloaded its economy with "miracle" cures. The experience could come in handy.

HEADLINE: Third World Population Explosion Demands Western Response

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The juxtaposition of two articles on the front page April 25 reveals, as in a lightning flash, the fundamental problem confronting humankind at this juncture: the ongoing population explosion. I refer to the report on the Chinese effort to control it, and the article on our immigration service's being swamped by a seemingly uncontrollable influx of asylum seekers. 
 In either case we risk drawing wrong conclusions. It would be a tragedy if the excesses connected with the Chinese effort jeopardized President Clinton's intended reversal of American policy that denied funds for family planning abroad; this reversal can only be the beginning of a more ambitious effort, together with other industrial countries and possibly through a United Nations setup, to set third world countries on the path of radical population stabilization.
As far as the asylum problem is concerned, it would be a mistake to believe that revamping immigration services would suffice to deal with it. European countries have learned what we still have to learn: that behind the genuinely political persecutees there looms an infinitely larger number of what the Germans call "economic refugees," that is, tens of millions of third world people who, facing misery if not starvation, will press against the borders of the still affluent. But unless something radical is done, no exclusion laws will help, nor will barbed wire or guns.
Humankind confronts the novel condition -- unique in its entire history -- of its global numbers outgrowing the carrying capacity of the planet (these numbers now devouring and destroying what remains of the basic resources of the world: arable land, fresh water, forests, and so on). While in former eras "surplus" populations would find "empty" regions to which to migrate, the frontier is now closed.
Even countries like the United States, Canada, Australia or even European ones that still can (and should) absorb millions, with a world population increasing by about 100 million each year and doubling exponentially within ever shorter periods, migration alone cannot solve the problem. This can only be done by developed countries jointly assisting the overpopulated countries in family planning and education, combined with aid for basic need fulfillment and old-age security systems; and, if need be, denying aid to governments unwilling to engage in such policies.
Unless we act rapidly, it may be too late to approach the problem decently. Countries might be driven toward dealing with it through authoritarian coercion.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: Europe;
Europe's Call: Lead On, U.S.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, May 6

 BODY:
Despite all their reluctance to agree with the United States about military steps to stop the killing in the Balkans, what the European allies have really wanted from President Clinton is firm leadership now that he has consulted with them.
More than one European diplomat has said in recent conversations that Mr. Clinton should stop asking them their opinion on what he plans to do and start telling them instead what he plans to go ahead with, preferably with their support. 
 After the Bosnian Serbs unexpectedly rejected the peace plan that their leader, Radovan Karadzic, had endorsed last Sunday, Mr. Clinton seemed galvanized, and he said today that the United States and its allies had to "act quickly and decisively" against the Bosnian Serbs.
But there is no European consensus on what to do to stop the killing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, or on how to prevent Croats and Serbs from carving up the country at the expense of its Muslims, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher will return home from Europe on Friday without an endorsement of military action. [Page A12.]
The degree to which the Europeans will now rally to the American banner remains to be seen. All that the European allies could tell Mr. Christopher was that whatever the next step was, it must be weighed cautiously.
But he and Mr. Clinton already know that.
During this week's consultations, the Europeans raised strong objections to Mr. Clinton's plan to lift the United Nations arms embargo enough to improve the Muslims' ability to defend themselves. Their objections to limited air strikes against Serbian supply lines and artillery positions if the Bosnian Serbs persist in rejecting the peace plan were less vehement.
The Europeans' concern about lifting the arms embargo on the Muslims was primarily that this would lead to a flood of new weapons into the region, and that if the Muslims were supplied from outside, the Russians would be under pressure to do the same for the Bosnian Serbs, with whom they share traditional cultural links.
Only the Germans, privately, supported easing the embargo, but British officials have indicated that if the United States decided to go ahead with air strikes, they would back the decision despite their reservations.
European reactions to the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the peace plan again this morning were unanimous. The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, spoke for the Europeans in saying rejection could lead to "monstrous bloodshed."
But the consensus on what to do to get the Serbs to change their minds was more of the same: Pressure should be increased on Serbia and Montenegro, which have been under economic blockade since last month, the Europeans said; the blockade should be tightened until the Serbs finally force their proteges in Bosnia to lay down their arms.
 
'Nothing Is Ruled Out'
 Mr. Christopher summed up his talks with NATO and European officials in Brussels before flying here this afternoon by saying: "We did not reach any decisions. Nothing is ruled out; nothing is ruled in."
A British official in London told the Reuters news agency today, "We keep open the option of air strikes." And Lord Owen, the co-author of the peace plan, said that in view of the "dangerous folly" of the Bosnian Serbs' rejection, "it may be that military action now has to be contemplated."
But advocates of military intervention say that as long as Western indecision reigns, nothing will persuade the Serbian forces in Bosnia to stop grabbing territory and forcing the Muslims who lived on it to flee.
The mere threat of air strikes, American officials believe, led the Bosnian Serbs' leader, Dr. Karadzic, to change his mind and sign the United Nations-backed plan after initially rejecting it. The assembly of Bosnian Serbs may have turned it down because they were still not convinced the threat of bombing was real.
 
Reasons for Not Acting
 European outrage is real, and growing, but each of the allies has a reason for not intervening militarily.
"We are constantly being led around by the nose and should not let this constant delaying and back-and-forth prevent us from doing what the Americans, the Europeans and the others concerned think necessary," the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said today.
"But on the other hand, military intervention would be a decisive, probably irreversible escalation."
So the buck went back to Mr. Clinton's desk, amid signs that Washington was preparing to act.
His predecessor, George Bush, led most of the European allies into the Persian Gulf war, but he also had the strong support of the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.
 
Fears for British Troops
 But officials in London say that in Bosnia in 1993, Britain is concerned that military action could bring the wrath of the Serbs down on the heads of its lightly armed 2,000-member force working with the United Nations to deliver food and medicine to civilians.
The French are similarly concerned about their forces in the Balkans, and have been sniping at the United States this week for thinking of air strikes as the easy way out, with no need to expose American soldiers on the ground to similar dangers.
Germany, Mr. Kinkel said, would be unable to take part in any military action on constitutional grounds, and there would be, he said, "no intervention by German soldiers in the former Yugoslavia because of what happened in the Second World War." Because of continuing resentment there, the Germans believe, their soldiers could not take part in a peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
So far, the Turks, gravely worried about their fellow Muslims in Bosnia, have been NATO's leading supporters of limited air strikes. The alliance's representatives will meet in Brussels next week to consider the next steps, but it will take strong leadership from Washington, not just consensus-building, to get them there.

HEADLINE: Job Loss in Recession: Scratch Those Figures

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Having declared last June that the recent recession had eliminated many more jobs than anyone realized, the Labor Department is now canceling that view.
The department says it overstated by 540,000 the number of jobs that were created in the late 1980's. And then it overstated, by the same amount, how many jobs disappeared in the recession. 
 Not until early this year did the Labor Department realize that any of these figures were incorrect, and that data processing companies that deliver payroll information to the Government had miscounted.
Among other things, they were counting paychecks rather than the people getting the checks -- so that a person getting a paycheck and then an overtime check came out in the data as two workers. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will formally correct the job numbers in June, the month it sets aside for correcting mistakes.
 
 
'It Just Dawned on Us'
 "We blamed the recession for eliminating jobs that had never existed in the first place," said Thomas Plewes, an associate commissioner of the bureau. "It just dawned on us recently, after we had gone through millions of records, what really happened."
Beyond jobs -- and fresh doubts about the reliability of Government economic data -- the corrections appear to shed little new light on the economy. The unemployment rate, 7 percent through March, is derived from a different source: a survey of 65,000 households. Economic growth, or gross domestic product, is calculated from revenue and income data, not job holders. Only productivity, which measures worker output, may be revised in June.
"We now find that productivity fell trivially during the recession," said Edwin Dean, the bureau's productivity expert. "We might change this to a slight drop."
But the error might have given Bill Clinton some help in the election. The "accounting mistake," as the bureau now labels it, came at a bad moment for President George Bush. Until June, the bureau had calculated the job loss during the 1990-91 recession at 1.2 million people.
When June rolled around -- the annual moment for officially correcting mistakes -- the bureau ruled that the recession had cost more jobs than earlier data suggested, and that the real job loss during the recession, which officially lasted nine months (from June 1990 to April 1991), had been 1.7 million, not 1.2 million. The bureau issued what it now says was an incorrect correction.
Seizing the new 1.7 million figure, Mr. Clinton charged that Mr. Bush had callously minimized the recession's impact -- a charge that no longer stands up so well.
"Numerous claims made about the economy during the campaign by candidate Clinton were highly exaggerated, this being one of them," said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for Mr. Bush. "But the long period of recession and sluggish recovery, irrespective of any measurement error, was what the voters responded to."
But Mr. Bush will not emerge exonerated when the bureau issues its new corrections next month. He had been credited with some of the 540,000 extra jobs counted earlier in his term. Now his record for job creation will go from a meager 1.33 million new jobs during his four-year term, down to one million or so. The bureau is still working out the exact number.
 
 
Data for I.R.S. Are Used
 Counting American jobs took on a new complexity in the 1980's. Six million American companies, almost every employer, are required to deliver payroll and tax data to the Internal Revenue Service and state tax agencies, and some of this information is also used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to count job holders.
Until the 1980's, the companies handled most of this work. Then the data processing companies got into the business, signing contracts with roughly a million companies employing 30 million people, Mr. Plewes said. Most were smaller operations with fewer than 250 workers. In an era of cost-cutting, they found it less expensive to subcontract this work. Somehow, a number of the data processors made similar mistakes: their software counted payrolls instead of people, or counted data for an entire month rather than the single week in mid-month that the bureau specifies.
This meant that a regular paycheck, for example, counted as one job holder, Mr. Plewes said. An overtime check to the same person came out in the data as a second job holder. And a bonus check, to the same employee, became a third job holder. In addition, counting paychecks for an entire month, rather than a single week, meant that people who received two or more paychecks were counted as two or more job holders.
 
 
Some Answers Emerging
 Just why these mistakes were made is not clear, but some answers are beginning to emerge. Steve Saxton, who manages the California government's program for current employment statistics, suggests that some of the companies may have shared common software. Then, too, the priority was to send pay data to the I.R.S. and to the state agencies. "Job information became secondary in this operation," Mr. Saxton said.
Fred Anderson, chief financial officer at Automatic Data Processing Inc. of Roseland, N.J., one of the companies doing the counting, takes that explanation a step further. "We do not furnish any information directly to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and we are not required to do so," he said. The obligation was only to the I.R.S. and the state agencies. And the wage and tax information that went to them was correct, Mr. Anderson said, adding, "We are now part of a general industry group that is working with the Bureau of Labor Statistics to try to improve information."
Whatever the obligation, the computerized forms included a section for listing job holders, deriving the number from wage information. And the miscount in these figures was inadvertently fixed in late 1990.
The bureau asked employers for new information, including data like the number of offices and factories in a particular county, rather than counting them as a single entity. "That drew attention to the job-counting item," Mr. Plewes said. And it apparently led to software changes that corrected much of the job overcounting, Mr. Plewes said, without anyone realizing it.
 
 
Overcounting Accumulated
 So suddenly, in the first quarter of 1991, accumulated overcounting that had taken place for five or more years, showed up as a sharp drop in the total number of jobs. Also, for the first time, the national job count covering the six million companies veered away from the bureau's own monthly survey of 350,000 companies.
In effect, the new software had corrected, in one swoop, most of the 540,000 overcount. With more than 100 million Americans holding jobs, the 540,000 represented a divergence of half a percent -- enough to notice when corrected all at once, but hard to spot over the years with only a few thousand mistakes made each month. The bureau typically uses the more comprehensive job count, published quarterly, as the benchmark to adjust the monthly figures -- although in hindsight, the monthly survey turned out to be more accurate.
"Next month, our benchmark revision will be less than 100,000," Mr. Plewes said, insisting that since early 1991, the monthly survey and the larger count have been pretty much in sync. "We are almost right on."
He is not totally sanguine, however. "I am not satisfied that this won't happen again," Mr. Plewes said. "But we are establishing pretty strong contacts with these companies. I don't think there is anyone out there in the data industry any longer missing the concept of what we need."

Economists mistook the statistical plunge for a genuinely huge job loss until its true cause came to light recently.

HEADLINE: U.S. Muslims, Despite World Spotlight, Focus on the Personal

SERIES: Muslims in America -- Last of four articles.

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich.

 BODY:
There is an almost startling contrast between a resurgent Islam's tumultuous role on the world scene and the expectations of how a growing Islamic presence will change America.
The most likely effect, most experts believe, will be to bolster the forces of social conservatism on issues like sexual permissiveness, support for parochial schools and gay rights. 
 But American Muslims, a steadily growing group who already number perhaps three million to four million, are unlikely to become a major political force anytime soon that can, for example, transform American policy on abortion or toward the Middle East. One reason is their diversity of ethnic and nation origins. Arab Americans, and African-Americans and immigrants from Pakistan and other parts of Asia often differ widely in their outlooks and agendas.
Another reason is the power of the United States to absorb and assimilate religious groups. Yvonne Haddad, a University of Massachusetts professor who has studied Islamic life in the United States for more than 15 years, doubted that even a Muslim population of 10 million would overcome that power: "I'm afraid the American machine will chew them up like it chews up everybody else."
 
How They Will Compare
 Within a decade or so, there will probably be more Muslims in the United States than Presbyterians, and sometime after that more than the estimated six million Jews. At that point, although still equaling only a small fraction of the Christian population of more than 200 million, Muslims will be comparable to some of the bigger Christian groups, like the Methodists or Lutherans.
And Muslim leaders do have definite political and social goals, some more attainable than others. These begin with changes that would make it easier to practice their faith: things like school textbooks free of anti-Islamic stereotypes, permission at school and work to observe Islamic holidays, Muslim chaplains in the armed forces, the availability of food that meets Islam's dietary code, a drug-free, less sexually permissive environment for their children.
Many of these things have been achieved in communities with established Muslim populations like Dearborn, a city of 87,000, more than 20 percent of them believed to be Muslim, abutting Detroit. The student body at some of the public schools is overwhelmingly Muslim -- citywide, it is 36 percent -- and the lunchrooms serve no pork. City Councilwoman Suzanne Sareini, a Muslim of Lebanese descent, says that she has not encountered animosity because of her ethnicity or religion.
But beyond simply protecting the Muslim way of life, some Muslims have strong hopes of exercising real influence on American policies toward Islamic movements and populations overseas, and on shaping the social environment at home.
"Muslims' primary concerns are the personal things," said Linda Wolbridge, assistant director of the Middle East Institute at Columbia University. "Can my daughter be safe on the streets, are my children going to be entrapped by drugs, alcohol or promiscuity?"
The potential of Muslim political power as well as its limits were illustrated when Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, accepted an invitation a few years ago to what he thought would be a small Pakistani street fair. "I show up Sunday at 3, and there are 10,000 people in the street," he recalled. "There were many more Pakistanis in Brooklyn than I'd thought."
But he added: "They do not really have political clout yet. Many of the people are not registered to vote, and they are not that well organized."
 
Mosaic
Islam in America Has Many Faces
Islam in America is divided between African-American Muslims, who may account for one-third of the total, and immigrants. Many of the recent Muslim immigrants from Pakistan, India and Egypt are physicians, engineers and businessmen who locate in suburbia and look forward to assimilating quickly into American society. African-American Muslims, while they include professionals, tend to be concentrated in or around inner cities.
Immigrant Muslims themselves are divided by nationality and ethnicity, by different forms of Islam and by the generation gap between more assimilated immigrants and recent arrivals. In addition, the energy and resources of Muslims in America are currently being absorbed by efforts to organize their own religious community, and to finance new mosques and schools.
And while American Muslims are struggling with these problems, they confront the same forces of assimilation and intermarriage that have pared away the ranks of other religious groups. No intermarriage statistics exist for the United States, but Professor Haddad doubted that the rate here was lower than in Canada, where, she said, two out of three Muslim women are marrying men who were not previously Muslim.
Half of those husbands convert, but many of the conversions, she said, are pro forma: "Even the Muslims call them Cupid's Muslims." Islamic law forbids Muslim women to marry outside their religion.
If there is anything that appears to unite the vast majority of Muslims, it is the conviction that the United States unduly favors Israel in its dealings with Palestinians. Muslims are also deeply dismayed at what they see as European and American inaction in the face of atrocities in Bosnia.
But Muslim leaders doubt that this feeling will extend to other international conflicts involving Muslims, like the fighting between Christian Armenia and Muslim Ajerbaijan or the clash between India and a Muslim separatist movement in Kashmir.
Nahid Khan, a London-born Muslim of Pakistani background who is a reporter at The Moscow-Pullman Daily News in Pullman, Wash., said, "All these foreign issues are taken up by the leaders of groups, but it is hard to tell whether the rank-and-file take them to heart." Usually, she added, the fervor is limited to "the ethnic groups closest to a regional crisis."
"Politics begins at home," said Abdurahman Alamoudi, executive director of the American Muslim Council in Washington. "Unless we are involved with the issues facing people here, we won't get them to appreciate our concerns abroad." He is highly critical of Muslim reluctance to get involved in local politics.
His organization, which has enlisted support from both immigrant and black American Muslim leaders, was founded three years ago to mobilize Muslims politically. It has joined with the Roman Catholic bishops' conference and Jewish and Protestant leaders in demanding international protection for Bosnian civilians. A budget of $250,000 a year, raised from 2,500 dues-paying members plus contributors, supports seven full-time workers along with many volunteers.
That is still a small presence compared with the Washington offices of many other religious groups, and it does not promise in the foreseeable future to compare with groups lobbying on behalf of Israel. The task of urging greater American consideration for Palestinians will continue to fall to Arab-American groups that are not specifically Islamic.
 
Politics
Gazing Nervously Across an Ocean
While domestic concerns may dominate among most Muslims, the international issues are the ones that make Americans worry that this country could become the spawning ground for more political violence -- or the site of it. Muslim leaders do not deny the existence of terrorists in the population here but insist that they are a tiny minority.
In Dearborn, the home to many refugees from the civil war in Lebanon and Israel's 1982 invasion, there are least a few organizers for militant groups overseas. "These people came from a war ground, a killing field, and they brought everything with them," said Charles K. Alawan, chairman of the board of trustees at the Islamic Center of America, a mosque and community center mainly serving Lebanese Muslims who settled in Dearborn and belong to the Shi'ite branch of Islam.
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, the Shi'ite Muslim group supported by Iran that has held hostages and clashed with the Israelis, "is still part of their social discussions about the homeland," he said. So is Amal, a rival Lebanese militia.
Dr. Wolbridge agreed with the view of Mr. Alawan and several other Dearborn Lebanese that the attraction of Hezbollah and Amal had shrunk as immigrants established themselves in the United States and as Lebanon became more stable.
 
A Blend of Loyalties
 Mr. Alawan himself represents a combination of loyalties that may seem inexplicable to many Americans. He described himself as a Goldwater Republican. He also sat beneath a picture of the Ayatollah Khomeini, defending Iran's as the only truly Muslim government. Of Southern Lebanese descent, he did not disguise his opposition to Israeli power over Southern Lebanon.
But Mr. Alawan's real preoccupations appeared to be his mosque's efforts to attract younger members. Like other Muslims across the country, Mr. Alawan listed abortion, public acceptance of homosexuality and premarital sex as major concerns.
Mr. Alawan supported nondenominational prayers in public schools: "In this mad rush not to infringe on anyone's beliefs, we have forgotten we are a nation that recognizes the existence of the deity," he said.
 
Priorities
Focus on Schools, Role of Women
Schooling is a major issue among American Muslims. "Muslims are moving toward a system like the Catholic system," said Amina McCloud, who teaches Islamic studies at De Paul University. "They are being forced by the increasing violence in the schools and the lack of academic focus, with people trying just to stay alive and avoid drugs."
Fareed Nu-Man, director of research at the American Muslim Council, said there are 165 Muslim full-time Muslim schools across the country, although more than 90 percent of Muslim children remain in the public schools.
Ghulam Aasi, a professor at the American Islamic College in Chicago, said that some Muslims in the Chicago area supported President George Bush because of his proposal for government vouchers to pay for private school tuition.
 
Equality for Women?
 The role of women is changing among American Muslims. Many Muslims assert that Islam and its sacred text, the Koran, affirm the equality of women, and that many restrictions on women in Islamic lands arise from local culture rather than Islam itself. But there is no consensus on where to draw the line between cultural custom and religious obligation.
Councilwoman Sareini looked forward to changes in Islamic practice as more women are educated "to read the Koran and know their rights." Meanwhile, she said that Americans had no reason to fear Muslim legislators.
The Councilwoman, a conservative whose office is decorated with photographs of Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush as well as a picture of her father outside the family's Uncle Sam's Shish Kebab Restaurant in South Dearborn, said, "Muslims will be good for the Republican party" because of their attitudes on the "family-values issues."
Deputy Mayor Adam Shakoor of Detroit disagrees. An African-American Muslim who was chief judge of one of Detroit's largest courts before Mayor Coleman A. Young appointed him to be the equivalent of a chief of staff, Mr. Shakoor said that Islam taught "compassion in terms of working-class people and have-nots that would lead a lot of Muslims to be Democrats."
Still, some Muslim leaders foresee a loose alliance with conservative Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox Jews in seeking government aid to religious schools as well as opposing abortion, pornography and the acceptance of gay relationships or other sexual behavior outside marriage.
 
Impact
How One City Has Been Changed
In Dearborn, it is easy to see the impact of the Arab Muslim immigrants, but harder to tell how much of that impact is Arab, how much is Muslim and how much immigrant.
In a city where the massive River Rouge auto works that once employed 90,000 people now employs 8,000, Muslim Arab-Americans have provided a new economic base of bakeries, restaurants and other small businesses along eastern Dearborn's Warren Avenue.
At the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, which provides language, job training, counseling, health care, child care and other programs in English and Arabic for more than 25,000 people, there is no prevention or prenatal program for out-of-wedlock adolescent pregnancies. "I can't document the teen-age pregnancies that would justify applying for funds," said May M. Berry, who directs the center's Teen Health Clinic.
In the wider Detroit area, the Council of Islamic Organizations of Michigan, headed by Imam Abdullah El-Amin, remains a fledgling group. It brings together immigrants and black Americans, helped achieve passage of a city emergency ordinance banning the sale of drug paraphernalia in convenience stores and has supported laws requiring parental notification of minors seeking abortions.
Prospective candidates for city offices are said to have started meeting with Muslim leaders much as they have always done with Detroit's Council of Baptist Pastors.
In her office at Dearborn's City Hall, Ms. Sareini said "I don't see a big wave of Islam that would change politics as we know it." But asked what America would be like with a population of 10 million Muslims, she said, "We'd be a better place."
 
The Series
 The series on Muslims in America: An article on May 2 described the diversity and concerns of the growing population of Muslims in the United States. A second on May 3 described the turn to mainstream Islam among black Americans, and a third on May 4 described how a maturing Islamic community in New England has built friendly ties with other groups.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: U.N.;
Resolution Establishes Safe Areas But Lacks Enforcement Provision

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 6

 BODY:
The Security Council voted today to declare six war-torn Bosnian cities as "safe areas" in a resolution that demanded an end to taking territory by force and called on the Secretary General to deploy 50 more military observers to protect civilians in the towns.
How the zones would be protected was not addressed in the resolution, which was adopted unanimously. Although the resolution demanded total compliance from all parties, diplomats here say the possibility of cooperation is remote, even with 50 additional soldiers to carry out the plan. 
 There are some 9,000 United Nations troops in Bosnia now, but their only mandate is to protect aid shipments. About 220 Canadian peacekeepers have been attempting to maintain a safe area in Srebrenica, which is without water or power. Srebrenica, the first safe zone, was created by a resolution passed on April 11.
 
A Third Rejection
 Earlier today, the assembly of Bosnian Serbs rejected a peace plan for the third time. Since the safe areas were intended to guarantee the safety of civilians in Serbian-held areas until the arrival of the 60,000-member United Nations force stipulated in the peace plan, the rejection vastly reduced the possibility that the Bosnian Serbs would abide by the resolution.
Speaking after the resolution was adopted, the United States representative, Madeleine K. Albright, termed the action a "palliative" and warned the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs that Washington is "consulting with our allies about new, stronger and tougher measures." She did not spell them out.
The cities cited by the council were the capital, Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde and Bihac, as well as Srebrenica. The resolution said they should be "treated as safe areas by all the parties concerned and should be free from armed attacks and from any other hostile act."
 
Whose Referendum?
 Ms. Albright criticized the Bosnian Serbs for rejecting the peace plan that their leader, Radovan Karadzic, signed last Sunday. Calling them an "unelected group of dubious characters," she said the parliament had "made a mockery of the signatures in Athens."
Noting that the parliament had called for a referendum on the peace plan that had been put forward by United Nations and European Community mediators, she raised the question of who would be eligible to vote.
"Those responsible for war crimes will be allowed to participate in the referendum, if it ever occurs," she said, but "we doubt that those forced from their homes at gunpoint will be. We know that those who now enjoy the peace of the grave will not participate."
Today's resolution came after the Security Council sent a six-member fact-finding mission to Bosnia last week. The delegation, led by the Venezuelan representative to the United Nations, Diego Arria, recommended that the idea of safe areas, which had partial success in Srebrenica, be extended to other regions.
Mr. Arria, who last week called Srebrenica "an open prison," charged today that the world "had, in a way, encouraged the Serbs" in their defiant behavior. He said threats had failed and that it was time for "concrete action" such as air strikes.
Ms. Albright said that whether or not the Bosnian Serbs agree to comply with "this and other relevant Council resolutions in the next days will determine whether we and the rest of the international community decide that the use of force is inevitable."

Chart: "Choking Yugoslavia"
 
MOST TRADE with Yugoslavia is banned. Medicine, food and relief supplies and services are exempt. As a result, inflation is running at 250 percent a month and there are shortages of basic goods, especially gasoline.
 
AIR LINKS are cut, and ships are barred from loading or unloading at Yugoslav ports. United Nations member countries are asked to impound Yugoslav ships, trains and aircraft in their territory if they violate sanctions.
 
SHIPPING through Yugoslavia by land or on the Danube River, an international waterway, is blocked. This sanction was imposed April 26, and it is too early to determine the impact.
 
ASSETS ABROAD, both private and belonging to the Yugoslav Government, were frozen on April 26.
 
DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS have been required to reduce staff levels.
 
PARTICIPATION in sports events and scientific, technical and cultural exchanges is suspended.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: Clinton's Plight;
For Bosnia's Serbs, the War Is Total, But the U.S. and Its Allies See Limits

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
The refusal of Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace settlement in Bosnia has put President Clinton in an exquisite diplomatic bind: his threat of military action has failed to produce a political solution, and the allies and Congress are still expressing reservations about carrying out the military threats.
The reason is simple. While many allies mourn for the Bosnian Muslims, others do not see a direct threat to their own national interests that would justify their deep involvement in a rescue mission. 
 The allies are ready to make sacrifices for Bosnia -- up to a point. The NATO powers feel threatened by the war -- up to a point. Mr. Clinton is wrestling with how to handle the Serbian nationalists, who seem ready to go all the way for their goals, while Washington and its allies are ready to go only part way to stop them.
Washington and its allies seem to be tailoring their strategy to what will sell at home, not what is needed to bring a decisive halt to the fighting.
 
Behind the Reluctance
 Mr. Clinton is ready to use air power and arm the Bosnian Muslims, but he says he will not commit American ground forces because he is not going to risk his domestic agenda trying to settle a European civil war.
The British and the French have sent a few thousand troops to aid in relief efforts, but they are reluctant to go further because that might imperil their troops.
Clinton aides are growing increasingly exasperated with Europe, which they liken to a family living in an upstairs apartment while the ground floor is on fire. The people upstairs refuse to call for help because they do not want their carpet to get wet as the fire is extinguished.
Mr. Clinton is unwilling to tell the United States that he is committing American troops to quell a European conflict that Europe itself is not ready to quell; for his own domestic political cover, Mr. Clinton needs to jump into Bosnia hand in hand with the Europeans.
"America has made its position clear," Mr. Clinton said in a speech to a trade group today. "It is ready to do its part, but Europe must be willing to act with us. We must go forward together."
 
The View From Europe
 The Europeans say they see things quite differently. After 40 years of American leadership, they are not used to being asked to move in tandem with Washington. They are used to being dragged. For their own domestic politics, they need to be dragged. In their view, Mr. Clinton has been acting like a general who wants his troops' permission before leading them into battle.
Now that the Bosnian Serbs have rebuffed the peace plan, the Europeans say they want Mr. Clinton to commit himself unequivocally to a military course of action, and then count on the Europeans to fall into line behind him.
But if all they want is for Washington to take the lead, why will they not even agree to lift the arms embargo on the Muslims? Maybe they fear a wider war in the Balkans more than a Serbian victory, and they just do not want to say that out loud to the Americans?
In any event, there are many reasons America cannot lead in Bosnia as it did in the Persian Gulf. At several White House strategy sessions last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, exclaimed, "Boy, was the gulf war easy compared to this!"
 
Differences Are Many
 And no wonder, a Clinton aide said.
"There what you had was one country, Iraq, invading another, Kuwait; here you have a civil war," he said. "There what you had was sand and desert; here you have trees and mountains. There what you had were neighbors who felt directly threatened by Iraq and were ready to do whatever was necessary; here the neighbors feel only a little threatened. There you were sitting on oil and there were clear-cut economic interests that the American people could understand; here the consequences are more indirect, and while they are just as important, they are less easy to describe."
And there is one more important difference. In the gulf, the allies had clearly defined, if somewhat cynical, political objectives: restore the Emir of Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back across the border. In Bosnia the allies have a map, drawn up by mediators, but they do not really have a clearly defined, workable political structure to put in place.
What sort of Bosnia do they want? No doubt the allies all have views on this, but they are complicated to explain, and when it comes to taking a nation to war, if a President has to explain it, it is already too complicated.
None of this is news to Clinton aides. They do not present their policy options as a silver bullet; everything is described as the least bad choice in a bad situation that they inherited.
 
Implications for Clinton
 But this moment of choice has real implications for the Clinton Presidency. The Bush Administration approached Bosnia as a European problem on which Europe should take the lead.
Mr. Clinton has exposed himself -- some will say courageously, others will say imprudently -- by insisting that the United States has moral, humanitarian and strategic interests in Bosnia.
But as former Bush Administration officials now ruefully note, the minute Mr. Clinton crossed that line -- from turning his back on Bosnia to saying "we must do something" -- he made his own reputation vulnerable.
"Once you announce that you're going to war, you have to win it," a senior Administration official said.
Now, if Mr. Clinton does nothing, he will look weak and indecisive, and if he does something and it fails, he will weaken himself. Only if his military strategy works and leads to a settlement might he get credit. Even then, as Mr. Bush learned in the Persian Gulf, such credit is a rapidly diminishing resource.

HEADLINE: Factory Output Up In Quarter

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The productivity of American factories soared in the first quarter, an upbeat sign for profits and another indication that the drive to make American manufacturing leaner and more competitive has continued into the 1990's.
Spurts in the production of computers and cars helped push up output per hour in the manufacturing sector, which makes up about a fifth of the economy, at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the quarter, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. 
 But productivity in the entire private economy -- which consists mainly of services like banking, health, education and retailing -- did not rise in the first quarter, the first no-growth quarter since the recession officially ended two years ago. The bureau said yesterday that productivity edged down at an annual rate of one-tenth of 1 percent, after having surged at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992.
 
A Sluggish Expansion
 Meanwhile, retailers provided further evidence that the economic expansion remained sluggish in April. Several big department store chains reported yesterday that April sales were unimpressive. [Page D3.]
The leveling of productivity ended a string of solid gains that had raised hopes that long-term productivity growth, which had been less than 1 percent during the 1980's, had rebounded to its historical average of about 2 percent a year.
"It raises a question about whether we are on a new, higher productivity trajectory, especially in services," said Lawrence Mishel, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
Economists at the labor statistics bureau, who had maintained that speculation about a revival in productivity was premature, cautioned analysts not to make too much of the data from one quarter.
 
Improvement in Employment
 The lull in productivity growth did not surprise analysts. Productivity measures output per hour of work. The Government had previously reported that in the first quarter, the gross domestic product -- the economy's total output -- had grown at only half the fourth-quarter rate while jobs had sprouted at their strongest rate in several years.
"We had a definite improvement in the employment situation in the first quarter," said Edwin R. Dean, the associate commissioner of the bureau.
Part of the lagging overall productivity in the first quarter may have been the unusually severe winter weather. "Retailers and builders were hiring because the economy was improving," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. "When the weather really knocked down consumer spending and construction, there were people on payrolls who weren't producing that much. That's obviously not going to continue."
Mr. Steinberg said he expected productivity would improve this year. "We think the stall was only a temporary setback."
Still, the report was a reminder that the slow-growth economy had either generated good productivity gains or a crop of new jobs, but not both in the same quarter. Over a period of years, productivity gains have largely determined whether real pay and living standards would rise.
The bureau also reported that hourly compensation grew at an anemic annual rate of 3.3 percent in the quarter, a bit more slowly than inflation. Meanwhile, the lack of an increase in productivity meant that unit labor costs jumped in the first quarter, a hint that profit margins outside manufacturing had probably weakened.
In contrast to the economy as a whole, manufacturing turned in a bright performance, with work hours and productivity rising in tandem. The total hours worked rose at a solid annual rate of 2.2 percent, while production increased at a healthy 7 percent annual rate. A lot of that production came from factories that churned out more computers to keep up with strong business spending on new high-tech gear and more cars and vans to satisfy the increased demand for vehicles.
The gains in factory efficiency in the last year had been the biggest in any year since 1977, and have helped drive unit labor costs down by 1.4 percent from a year ago.

HEADLINE: Investment Credit in Trouble, Clinton Seeks Alternatives

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
With the proposed investment tax credit in deep trouble in Congress, Administration officials said today that they were considering several other options to spur the economy, including new tax breaks for small business and a smaller increase in the corporate income tax.
Another option under consideration, officials said, would be to delay the proposed increases in personal and corporate income tax rates so that they take effect on Jan. 1, 1994, instead of being retroactive to this past Jan. 1. 
 Robert E. Rubin, assistant to President Clinton for economic policy, said today that in place of the investment tax credit, the White House was considering a proposal allowing companies to write off more of their investments in the year they make them.
Administration officials and Congressional aides said one possibility would be to increase the maximum investment that small businesses could write off in the first year to $20,000 or more, from the current $10,000. One legislative aide said some members of Congress were thinking of trying to raise the ceiling to $25,000.
A senior official said the Administration was also considering whether to recommend increasing the 34 percent corporate income tax by one percentage point, rather than the two percentage point increase it previously proposed.
Business executives have complained that raising the corporate income tax to 36 percent would hurt investment, and say that the smaller increase would tend to harm the economy less.
Many economists and corporate executives say the Administration's proposal to make the income tax increases effective this year has hurt consumer confidence and slowed spending.
But Clinton officials insist that over all, their deficit-reduction plan, including the proposed tax increases, has increased confidence. They acknowledge that Americans might feel freer to spend if the tax increases were delayed.
At a lunch with journalists today, Mr. Rubin said that if the investment tax credit were to die in Congress, the Administration still wanted to use the money that would have financed it to spur businesses and economic growth. The Administration estimates that the credit would cost a total of $21 billion from 1994 to 1997.
Mr. Rubin, though, denied that the measure was indeed dead and argued that it is needed to give the economy a boost when the President's deficit-reduction plan kicks in and limits economic growth.
"We think there are very good productive uses for this money if the decision is made not to go with the investment tax credit," he said, adding that he did not think that the money for it should be used for deficit reduction.
 
Incentive or Windfall?
 Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, as well as other prominent members of Congress, have criticized the investment tax credit on the ground that it favored certain industries and that companies would start making business decisions simply to take advantage of it.
They also questioned the wisdom of raising $30 billion through increased corporate income taxes and then giving $21 billion of it back to companies in the form of an investment tax credit.
The push to increase the amount of investment that small businesses could write off in the first year has come from the Ways and Means Committee, and the Administration is considering whether to support that proposal, Congressional aides said.
Thus, a company that invested $15,000 in equipment could write off $10,000 of that in the first year and depreciate the remaining $5,000 in subsequent years.
 
See Better Way to Fine-Tune
 Some Administration officials are unenthusiastic about increasing the ceiling, saying it rewards the first dollar of investment, when the more powerful way to spur the economy would be to reward the last dollar.
Gene Sperling, deputy assistant to the President for economic policy, said the Administration was willing to work with Congress to search for additional spending cuts, but he said the Administration did not want the lawmakers to scale back plans to spend $100 billion or more to increase investment in training and in public installations and services.

HEADLINE: Health-Care Plan to Be Delayed Further

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Bowing to political reality and Congressional concerns, the White House said today that there would be a further delay in sending Congress legislation to revamp the nation's health-care system.
It now appears that the legislation, being developed by Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Task Force on National Health Care Reform, will not be sent to Congress before mid-June at the earliest, Administration officials said. 
 Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said: "The task force is still on track to complete its work at the end of May. But exactly how we unveil that and when we take it up to the Hill is something that we're consulting with Congress about."
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said, "We expect that the task force will hand over its recommendations to the President, on schedule, at the end of May, and then the President will consult with members of Congress for the best time to announce it."
 
100-Day Deadline
 When he created the task force on Jan. 25, Mr. Clinton said its mission was to prepare "legislation to be submitted to Congress within 100 days of our taking office" -- in other words, by the end of April.
Mrs. Clinton was out of town tending her father for two weeks before he died on April 7. And Administration officials said the latest delay showed the President's political acumen.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders welcomed the delay. They had warned Mr. Clinton that he could suffer political embarrassment if he sent up an ambitious health-care bill while lawmakers were still debating a comprehensive bill to raise taxes, reduce the Federal budget deficit and stimulate the economy.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said the most important political question was not when the President unveiled his plan, but whether the Administration would have a strategy to "explain it to the American people."
"If you don't figure out how to articulate it, we could be here for six years," he added.
People working for the task force say there are other reasons for delaying a detailed legislative proposal. For example, they say, the President and his advisers are still mulling over fundamental questions about the design and financing of the health-care system they want to create.
Moreover, Mrs. Clinton and Ira C. Magaziner, the day-to-day manager of her task force, have been moving steadily toward bolder, more complex and more sweeping proposals to remake the nation's health-care system, even as some members of Congress urge them to simplify and scale down their plan.
Members of the task-force staff say that Mr. Magaziner has shown an insatiable appetite for technical information and has concluded that huge sums of money could be saved by radically reorganizing the nation's health-care system.
 
Zeal to Help Uninsured
 Aides to Mr. Magaziner, who is the senior adviser for policy development, say his impulses reinforce Mrs. Clinton's zeal to help millions of people who lack health insurance.
Under the Clinton plan, sometimes known as managed competition, large groups of consumers and businesses would buy care from organized networks of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies.
At the White House, the Clintons had lunch today with Republican members of Congress, who generally oppose his recommendation for a Federal law requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage to their workers. Administration officials are seriously considering asking employers to pay a percentage of their payrolls in premiums to help finance health care.
Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, the leader of a Republican senators' study group on health care, said the idea of a payroll tax or premium "gives me a lot of problems," and added: "Republican senators are not in favor of that. We have deep concerns whether small business could handle it."
Senator Chafee and other Republican lawmakers said they had assured the President that they would not criticize him for delays in sending health legislation to Congress. It is more important to "do it right" than to meet an artificial deadline, the Senator said.
At a picture-taking session in the Oval Office today, the President said he did not know when he would announce the details of his health plan.
"The most important thing," he said, "is that we're going to finish the outline of the details on time, and then we're going to enter one more round of extensive consultations before we come forward with it." The timetable for sending legislation to Congress "depends in part on how we're doing in the consultations," he added.
Mrs. Clinton told members of Congress that the President's plan would help pay for long-term care, including medical and social services for elderly and disabled people living in their own homes. But she said the new coverage would be introduced gradually.

HEADLINE: 17 Companies in Electronic News Venture

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 6

 BODY:
Some of the nation's biggest newspapers are taking another look at the electronic paperboy.
A group of 17 companies, including the newspaper publishers Gannett, Knight-Ridder and Times Mirror, plan to announce Friday that they are forming a research consortium to explore new ways to use computers and telecommunications to deliver news. The possibilities might include electronic newspapers transmitted to pocket-sized wireless computers or personalized papers printed at home. 
 The project will be carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory. Other participants will include the Tribune Company, Hearst, I.B.M., Capital Cities/ABC and BellSouth.
The five-year "News in the Future" program will cost from $1.5 million to $2 million annually. It is the latest in a series of developments indicating that newspaper publishers, after past disappointments in technologies like videotex and other forms of electronic news services, have a renewed interest in converging computer and communications technologies.
"There is a big scramble to deliver bits electronically to everyone's home," said Walter Bender, a scientist at the M.I.T. Media Laboratory and a principal researcher for the project.
"The cost factor has changed dramatically," he said. "It will cost the newspaper very little to get an electronic version to the home."
Electronic distribution, in fact, is already happening. Since last year, articles from The Chicago Tribune have been available via personal computer modem from America On-Line, an electronic information service based in Vienna, Va. And on Monday, The San Jose Mercury News will begin using America On-Line to offer virtually the complete text of each day's issue.
Initially, the Mercury News system will be a text-based version of the newspaper without pictures. But as higher-speed computer networks and data-compression technologies become available in the next few years, the paper is planning to add pictures.
"We're in a continuum of long, slow change and innovation," said Robert Ingle, the executive editor of The Mercury News. "People aren't going to flock to the electronic newspaper instantly. We need to use the printed newspaper to lead people into the new form, and this is Step 1."
There is no extra fee for the Mercury News service to customers of America On-Line, which charges $9.95 a month, plus $3.50 an hour after the first five hours of use each month.
 
 
Disastrous Early Venture
 The Mercury News, which is part of the Knight-Ridder chain of newspapers, is a good example of the willingness of the nation's newspapers to reconsider electronic alternatives. It was Knight-Ridder that in 1978 embarked on a disastrous foray into electronic publishing, known as Viewtron. The system was widely criticized as too costly and too slow, and it folded in 1986 after attracting only 20,000 subscribers.
"In 1978 we were inventing content and technology, and the market wasn't there," Mr. Ingle said. "The scars from Viewtron are still very vivid. It took a while to get it into people's minds that we should get back into electronic distribution."
The Mercury News's prime market is Silicon Valley, which has the nation's highest concentration of high-tech workers but a surprisingly low number of modems -- devices that enable personal computers to send and receive data over phone lines -- in homes. Only 17 percent of Silicon Valley homes have modems now.
The Mercury News project, which involves a revenue-sharing agreement with America On-Line, is not expected to be profitable soon.
"We don't know what the economics are, but we created a low-enough cost structure that it won't take very much to break even," Mr. Ingle said.
The chairman of the News in the Future project at M.I.T. will be Jerome B. Rubin, formerly a senior vice president of the Times Mirror Company, whose biggest papers include The Los Angeles Times and Newsday on Long Island. The project is intended to investigate ways to personalize electronic newspapers based on both wired and wireless technologies.
 M.I.T. researchers have already designed experimental personal electronic newspapers, which are tailored to an individual reader's interests. In such systems headlines and news articles could be selected for the reader on the basis of a profile each customer would program into the system. Some newspaper executives have criticized the concept of personalized news, saying that readers' eyes are often drawn to a headline or picture that pulls them into a story about which they may have had no prior interest. But Nicholas Negroponte, director of the M.I.T. laboratory, says there is no reason future systems cannot let readers customize the service or simply to browse, depending on their preference.
Other companies that have announced their sponsorship of the program include Advance Publications, Grupo Consolido, McCann-Erickson and Televisa.

Gamble That Inflation Stays Low

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Clinton Treasury is betting that the Clinton Presidency will succeed in creating a low-inflation environment over the next several years and that the President's successor will follow suit.
That is the gamble that the Treasury took this week when it announced that it would shift 45 percent of its longer-term borrowing to shorter- term maturities of from three years to three months. If the bet proves wrong and inflation does not stay low, taxpayers will be paying higher interest costs. 
 "Whether this turns out to be a good thing or a bad thing is whether they follow good economic policy or bad economic policy for the next several years," William Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said yesterday. "That is another way of saying that inflation stays low."
 
Debt Mix Shift Applauded
 The economist Henry Kaufman, who applauded the Treasury debt mix shift, added, "It is betting on your own economic policy."
But Mr. Kaufman also said that the shift, by helping to lower intermediate and long-term interest rates slightly, would assist the private sector, which he said should be a more important goal of the policy change.
"The Treasury should follow a policy that will be supportive of the economic recovery even if it is only in a marginal sense," Mr. Kaufman said. And, he said, borrowing more with short-term securities is a positive incentive for the Treasury.
"As the Treasury finances short term, its financing costs are more variable," he said. "As inflation goes up, interest costs will go up, so Treasury has an additional incentive in the fight against inflation."
Bringing the deficit under control, which has looked less likely in recent weeks because of the problems of President Clinton in getting his programs through Congress, is the kind of long-term repair the economy needs, analysts say. That would help foster confidence and help keep long-term interest rates coming down, making more investors believe that inflation will remain low.
Such a trend could lead to lower long-term interest rates and, at the same time, only small increases in short-term interest rates as the economy begins to pick up pace. In that case, it would be advisable to cut some long-term borrowing because long rates would be falling. And it would not be so risky to add to short-term borrowing because short-term interest rates would not likely rise enough to erase the savings gained by shifting from higher-interest-rate long-term borrowing to lower-interest-rate shorter-term borrowing.
But this blend of economic policies may also require that the economy grow at just a moderate pace, which would mean that the President's goal of creating millions of new jobs would be harder to attain.
There is another way to make the debt shift work, but that would be an even less desired condition for the Administration: a new recession that would bring both short- and long-term rates and inflation lower.
 
Move Seen Well Considered
 Analysts who do not support what the Treasury did on Wednesday -- which included a 40 percent reduction in the annual issuance of 30-year bonds; a shift to two, instead of four, 30-year auctions a year, and the elimination of the seven-year note -- do agree that the move was well considered. They say it was not just an all-out effort to cut borrowing costs and push interest rates lower by eliminating long-term borrowing. If this were the case, the Treasury could have eliminated the 30-year bond auction scheduled for next week and reduced the level of 10-year note borrowing.
"Given that they had made the bad decision to shorten the maturity of the debt, they went about it in a quite reasonable way." said Louis Crandall, the chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates.
 
Treasury Market
 Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as traders and investors awaited the Labor Department report on April employment, which is to be released this morning.
In the last 16 months, the price of the 30-year bond has rallied and the yield has fallen eight times in the week ahead of the employment report. This week became the ninth time as the yield on the long bond fell to 6.80 percent, from 6.92 percent last Friday.
Forecasters are expecting a moderate increase in nonfarm payroll jobs in the range of 157,000, according to Bloomberg Business News. But what is more important is the impression about the strength of the economy that the report leaves with traders and investors. A feeling that the economy has bounced back from the weather-related slowdown in March would make it harder for yields to break out of their current trading range and move to new lows.
In secondary trading, the price of the 30-year bond was down 6/32 as the yield rose to 6.80 percent, from 6.78 percent Wednesday, which leaves the bond little changed since the debt announcement. The price of the seven- year note fell 5/32 , to yield 5.51 percent. But despite the shift to shorter-term borrowing, prices of two-and three-year notes were up marginally and the discount rates on Treasury bills fell.

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
A Democratic firm merely flirts with Dan Quayle, and suddenly they're an item.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
A historically Democratic law firm in Washington courts former Vice President Dan Quayle, perhaps the nation's most famous unemployed lawyer and previously its most famed bar basher. What is wrong with this picture?
That is what many people have asked since Legal Times, a weekly publication covering law and lobbying in Washington, recently reported that Mr. Quayle had held talks with Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin & Kahn, another pea in the pod of major law firms in the capital. 
 The talks apparently came to naught, but not before surprising, intriguing, amusing, disgusting, or discomfiting plenty of people, including the firm's brass. Indeed, the firm's experience shows the perils of even flirting with former politicians who have aroused as much debate as Mr. Quayle.
Since being voted out of office, he has been pursuing the next phase of his life. He signed a $1 million contract to write his memoirs, he's giving speeches, and he may soon write a column for The Indianapolis Star, his family's newspaper. And continuing the work that first brought him to blows with lawyers, most famously in a speech to the American Bar Association, he will head a new "competitive center" at the Hudson Institute, a conservative study group in Indianapolis.
But apparently encouraged by former President Richard M. Nixon, who started his own return from political exile from a law firm, Mr. Quayle is at least considering private practice. It would clearly not be full time, nor presumably the conventional lawyerly lot of negotiating new deals and litigating busted ones; Mr. Quayle, after all, has never actually done either. Instead, his work would lie in what power lawyers call "rainmaking," i.e., bringing in business.
Enter Arent Fox. Its political tincture is Democratic, with one former Democratic Senator (John Culver of Iowa) and one former Democratic Congressman (Michael Barnes of Maryland) in its ranks. But when partisanship clashes with profit, or ideology with income, the latter invariably wins. The firm has always had its house Republicans, and since the most prominent of them -- J. Marshall Coleman, the former Virginia Attorney General -- left last August, it has sought a replacement.
So four Arent Fox partners, including Mr. Barnes and Mr. Culver, met with Mr. Quayle last month in the firm's downtown offices. The discussions were preliminary and exploratory -- "a question of 'what are you going to be doing in the future?' " as one partner described them -- and nothing much came of them. But law firms produce gossip in the same profusion as paper. When word of the talks leaked, the discomfort began.
Arent Fox is a firm under some economic stress, as evidenced by the fact that it promoted only 2 of 19 candidates eligible for partnership last year. Even so, the prospect of practicing law with Dan Quayle raised concerns, for reasons of temperament as well as politics. Arent Fox lawyers pride themselves on their industry; one senior partner, David Osnos, is forever invoking the adage most recently immortalized by John Houseman, about making money by earning it. How, many lawyers at the firm wondered, would Mr. Quayle fit into such an ethic?
Most lawyers in the firm learned of the dalliance when the head of the firm's general business group, Bill Charyk, met with 40 associates a few days after Mr. Quayle's visit. "I certainly hope they put a spell-check on his computer," one associate said on hearing the news. "Arent Fox Opens the Quayle-Hunting Season," Legal Times proclaimed a few days later, in an article filled with comments about the firm's shaky finances and complaints from anonymous associates.
Mr. Quayle has given no interviews since leaving office. His spokesman, Craig Whitney, would say only that the former Vice President "has had many discussions with many different people about things he may or may not do." But Mr. Quayle's former spokesman, David Beckwith, said he was "dumbfounded" to learn of the discussions.
"Practicing law, particularly making rain for a big-time Washington law firm, was never on his list of dream jobs," Mr. Beckwith said. "I think he would be far less bored working on something having to do with public policy." Around Arent Fox, however, on-the-record comments are much harder to come by. Mr. Culver did not return a telephone call. Mr. Barnes did, but was tight-lipped. "Our managing partner speaks for the firm on this sort of thing, not me," he said. And that managing partner, Rodney Page, reacted with audible annoyance when the subject was broached.
"I really can't comment on it at all," he said. "I don't think there's a story there. This was way overblown."
But will Mr. Quayle be joining Arent Fox? "Don't look for an announcement," Mr. Page said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Ties Deficit Cut to Talks Negotiations

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
President Clinton used a speech on international trade today to lobby for the passage of his deficit-reduction plan, saying that the United States will be in no position to press for open markets abroad if it does not address its own domestic problems first.
Mr. Clinton, who lost an important Congressional battle last month over a $19.5 billion package that he said would stimulate the economy and create jobs, pointed to a reduction in long-term mortgage interest rates as proof that his overall budget plan had been well received in the financial markets. As proposed, the deficit-reduction plan would cut the yearly deficit in half in four years through spending cuts and tax increases. 
 The President said reducing the deficit was the key to domestic economic revival. "This is the ultimate stimulus for the American economy if we can pass the budget that reduces the deficit and keep these rates down," he said in an address to the Export-Import Bank.

HEADLINE: Job Outlook Bleak at Big Law Firms

 BODY:
For the first time in decades, the nation's largest law firms grew hardly at all last year, according to a survey to be published this month.
The annual survey, by the legal magazine Of Counsel, found that growth at the nation's 500 largest firms was flatter than it had been since the 1950's and early 1960's. 
 Although the recession is over and legal business appears to be recovering from its effects, the firms are continuing to lay off lawyers and freeze hiring because there is no longer enough work to support the number of lawyers they employed in the booming 1980's.
"Corporations are more cost-conscious than ever," said Michael J. Crames, managing partner of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, a New York firm that the survey listed as one of the 10 large firms that lost the most lawyers. "They're trying more and more to undertake to work in-house to save money."
Last year the firm lost 50 lawyers, from 380 to 330.
 
Downward Trend Continues
 According to the survey, the firms collectively employed about 90,000 lawyers last year, roughly the same as the previous year, continuing a trend that many business experts thought had hit bottom in 1991, when the number of lawyers at the firms grew by less than 1 percent from the year before.
"This year it was such a minuscule increase that we didn't even bother coming up with a percentage for it," said Larry Smith, managing editor of the magazine, which has conducted the study for the last six years.
He said the survey suggested that no more than a dozen lawyers had been added to the pool of those working for the largest firms.
"We were stunned after we did the math," Mr. Smith said. "For the modern era of law firms, this kind of flat growth is unprecedented."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 To gather data for the survey, the magazine sent questionnaires to about 800 law firms. More than 500 firms participated, and 461 of those were large enough to be included. For the firms that declined to respond, the magazine used other published information, such as the Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory, to tally the number of lawyers employed.
The American Bar Association estimates that there are 800,000 lawyers working in the United States now. There are more than 42,000 law firms in the United States with more than one lawyer.
The study found that the nation's 67 largest firms, those that employ more than 300 lawyers, decreased by three-tenths of 1 percent, dropping from 31,132 to 31,048 lawyers in 1992. Eight of the 10 largest firms in the United States decreased, compared with six in 1991 and none in 1990.
Employing fewer lawyers does not necessarily mean that business is down. Bogle & Gates of Seattle, which dropped from 246 lawyers in 1991 to 214 last year, reported that 1992 was its best year in both revenue and profits.
"It actually proved to be the best adjustment we could have made," said Howard Booth, the firm's executive director. "Morale goes up when everybody's busy."

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 7.20 as Investors Await Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In what has become a familiar story this week, the stock market was stuck in a narrow trading range for much of the session yesterday, before turning downward in the last hour of trading.
Once again, many investors remained on the sidelines waiting for another economic portent; this time, it was today's Government report on unemployment. 
 Meanwhile, the stock market showed little reaction yesterday to the Treasury Department's plan, released on Wednesday afternoon, to shift much of the Government's borrowing away from longer-term notes and bonds. There were no sharp moves in either the Dow Jones industrial average or the broader-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to indicate a large-scale shifting of money between stocks and bonds.
Most major stock indexes were down yesterday in moderate trading. A notable exception was the American Stock Exchange market value index, made up mainly of the stocks of midsize companies, which set a record high for the third consecutive day. The index closed up 1.06 point, to 426.95.
 
 
Even Nasdaq Was Sluggish
 Even the usually vigorous Nasdaq composite index, made up mainly of smaller-capitalization and high-technology stocks, showed the degree of investors' caution. It closed down 3.22 points, to 680.04, compared with Wednesday's rise of 5.10 points. In recent sessions, the Nasdaq has tended to outperform the Dow and the S.& P. 500.
The Dow industrials slipped 7.20 points, to close at 3,441.90, after trading most of the day around 3,450. The New York Stock Exchange composite index was down a half point, to 245.22. And the S.& P. 500 closed down 1.26 point, to 443.26. Volume on the Big Board totaled 255.5 million shares, compared with Wednesday's 274.2 million shares.
The Dow Jones transportation average, meanwhile, gained 4.64 points, to 1,580.35. The index was lifted mainly by UAL, parent of United Airlines, which closed up 2 1/2 points, to 136, on no discernible news.
The Dow industrials were dragged down by Woolworth, which was down 2 points, to 29 3/8, , on disappointing April retail sales; and Procter & Gamble, which was down 1 1/8, to 48, on no discernible news
 
 
RJR Roiled on Price War
 The most active stock on the Big Board was RJR Nabisco, up 1/8, to 5 5/8, on unusually heavy volume of 7.2 million shares. Competitor B.A.T. Industries announced it would respond to price cuts from Philip Morris's Marlboro and RJR Nabisco's Winston cigarette brands with discounts on its Viceroy brand.
Humana, the second-most active stock on the Big Board, saw its shares rise 7/8, to 10, on heavy volume of six million shares. The rise might have been partly prompted by the remarks of a Salomon Brothers analyst, who called Humana her No. 1 pick in the health-care industry.

HEADLINE: China Steps Up Spending To Keep U.S. Trade Status

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
China has been on an American shopping spree in recent months, ordering more than $1 billion of airplanes, cars, telecommunications and oil equipment, fertilizer and more.
Driving the deals has been a June 4 deadline by which President Clinton must decide whether to extend China's most-favored-nation status, which offers low tariffs and other trade privileges comparable to those of other United States trading partners. If China is denied the low tariffs it now enjoys, those deals would collapse, and the Chinese are determined to show the value of their market to the United States. 
 During his election campaign, President Clinton said he would not approve the extension without receiving Chinese assurances on human rights policies and arms sales. And in Washington in recent days the debate has focused on these issues.
But many American companies are vigorously lobbying the White House and Congress for an extension of China's trading privileges, pointing out that that billions of dollars in exports are at stake, as well as thousands of jobs.
Many business leaders say that using trade privileges to address human rights and arms proliferation will do little to persuade the Chinese to make changes. And some executives argue that selling to China can help the United States realize its policy goals.
"It has long been recognized that the pen is mightier than the sword," said Randall L. Tobias, vice chairman of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. "The modern version of that is: the fax machine is mightier than the rifle. It is impossible for a society that has more open telecommunications to continue to be repressive."
 
 
Estimate of 150,000 Jobs
 Trade experts estimated that exports to China created about 150,000 jobs in the United States last year.
These are among the most recent negotiations between China and America:
*An $800 million agreement to buy 21 jetliners from Boeing, the largest foreign airplane order this year. China has agreed to buy or lease 215 airplanes worth a total of $9 billion in the next several years. Aerospace goods are the largest American export to China, accounting for $2.1 billion in sales last year.
*Orders for 4,600 vehicles each from General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler, worth a total of $160 million.
*The China National Petroleum Corporation ordered $200 million of oil drilling and exploration equipment from companies in Louisiana, Texas and Washington, and hired the Halliburton Company of Dallas to help with exploration and production.
*The Chinese Space and Aeronautics Administration is negotiating with Hughes Aerospace, a division of General Motors, for satellites that could cost up to $800 million.
*China's vice minister of trade is currently in the United States, shopping for wheat and phosphate fertilizers, while the president of China's National Cereals Corporation is on a buying mission, discussing grain deals with American companies and the Agriculture Department.
Clinton Administration trade officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, say they expect Mr. Clinton to set some conditions on renewal, which they hope the Chinese will accept. Congress would then have three months to override Mr. Clinton's decision.
But many American executives are nervous.
 
 
'People Will Lose Jobs'
 "President Clinton visited Seattle and promised that he was going to work hard to help keep aerospace jobs in America," said Lawrence W. Clarkson, vice president for planning and international development at Boeing. "Well, if he does not renew China's status or places unacceptable conditions on it, he will be doing the exact opposite of what he promised. We will lose orders and people will lose jobs."
A.T.& T. says it hopes to make billions of dollars through a joint agreement with the Chinese Government to provide the country with modern telecommunications. Company executives estimate that they can supply about half the 15 million telephone lines that China plans to install each year for the next several years. "We are talking about a business in China that is as big if not bigger than that in the United States," Mr. Tobias said.
"American companies are working the China trade issue more aggressively than ever before because the commercial stakes are so much higher this year," said Richard A. Brecher, director of business advisory services for the United States-China Business Council, a private association representing about 200 American businesses in China. "The pressure from the Chinese is not overt, but it's generally understood that all these big business deals will die overnight if their favorable status is revoked. Everything that we are selling, they can buy from someone else."
Also lobbying on behalf of China is Christopher Patten, Britain's Governor of Hong Kong, who met on Monday with President Clinton and other officials in Washington to press the case for continuing China's trade privileges.
 
Fastest-Growing Economy
 China has the world's fastest-growing economy, at 12 percent a year. While spending $7.47 billion in the United States last year, China exported more than three times as much -- $25.68 billion -- to the United States, mainly in consumer items like toys, clothing and footwear.
Orders from China last year, which were up 19 percent from 1991, were mainly for wheat, aircraft, fertilizer, cotton, wood, electric machinery, telephone and scientific equipment and chemicals.
Not every American company with Chinese connections takes issue with Mr. Clinton's views. Indeed, Levi Strauss & Company, the San Francisco-based apparel maker, announced Monday that it was ending most of its business in China, citing "the pervasive violation of human rights."
 
 
'I Have No Choice'
 But Levi Strauss is not a major player in China, buying less than 2 percent of its goods there. And whether other companies will follow Levi Strauss's lead is far from certain. Indeed, many other apparel companies, particularly those whose garments are made of silk or cashmere, simply cannot move their production out of China.
"I have no choice," said Gene Kuhl, president of Silk Club Inc., a New York company that contracts with Chinese factories for about 80 percent of the washable silk garments it makes. "At least 99 percent of the world's silk comes out of China. I'd have to become the Cotton Club to do what Levi's has done."
Another opponent of China is is the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which says that the Chinese export goods made with forced labor in its prisons. It also contends that the China imprisons union organizers and protest movement leaders.
"The factories and prisons are located right next to each other in many cases," said Burni Bond, director of research for the labor organization's international affairs division. "It's a philosophy of re-education through work, and it's simply not right." The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 forbids the importation of goods made with prison labor.
But William B. Turner, chairman of IMC Fertilizer Group of Northbrook, Ill., said that ending China's favorable trade status might force his company to cut its staff by 20 percent, or 600 to 700 workers.
"With its concentration on agriculture, China is an essential market for us, and we can't afford to lose it," Mr. Turner said. "Having traveled there for many years, I have come to realize that it's better to work within their system rather than applying pressure from the outside."

HEADLINE: Grumman Says It Will Close Electronics Plant in Suffolk

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., May 6

 BODY:
In another sign of hard times for the military industry on Long Island, the Grumman Corporation announced today that it was closing a major electronics plant in Suffolk County. The company also said it was shutting plants in Texas and Maryland as part of a long-term plan to cut costs and consolidate operations.
Grumman officials said most of the 839 employees of the Long Island plant, in the hamlet of Great River on the South Shore, would be transferred to factories at the company's headquarters in Bethpage, L.I., by the time the shutdown is completed in mid-1995. The jobs of 424 workers in Webster, Tex., and Salisbury, Md., however, will be phased out when those factories close in 1994, Grumman officials said. 
 Susan Vassallo, a spokeswoman for Grumman, said that as the workers from Great River are moved to Bethpage, the company will determine how many will keep their jobs. "As the work is phased into the Bethpage facility, the company will identify duplication of function," she said. "At that time, there will be some layoffs."
The announcement of the closings comes at a time of retrenchment for much of the military industry, which has been forced to scale back as the Federal Government reduces arms spending, closes bases and cancels projects. On Long Island, the cuts have affected small military contractors as well as aircraft manufacturing giants like Grumman, whose work force on the Island is now 10,500, down from 33,700 in 1987.
Ms. Vassallo said the closing of the 96-acre Great River factory, which produces radar, intercom and weapon-testing systems for the Army, was part of the company's effort to consolidate operations and remain competitive. Grumman plans to sell the plants in Great River and Maryland, she said, adding that the plant in Texas is leased.
"This consolidation really is part of our ongoing efforts to cut costs," Ms. Vassallo said.
James L. Larocca, executive director of the Long Island Association, the Island's leading business organization, said he thought that the plant closing was necessary for Grumman's survival.

Dollar Is Hurt by Concerns Over Jobs Report for April

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower against other leading currencies yesterday, hurt by growing pessimism that today's employment report for April would reveal more unsettling weakness in the American economy.
Money brokers said there was some dollar buying early in the day. But later on, many traders reduced their dollar holdings as they became concerned that the Labor Department's employment report would show anemic job creation. Such weakness would put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, thereby making dollar-dominated investments less attractive. 
 "The dollar gave up some of the ghost at the end of the day," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the New York branch of the Bank Leumi Trust Company. "It was really a day when everybody sat back and said, 'Let's see what happens with unemployment.' "
 
 
A Sensitive Barometer
 The Labor Department's report is among the most sensitive barometers of the economy's stamina. The April numbers come against a background of new weakness that has emerged in American industrial output, productivity, retail sales and overall growth following a strong showing late last year.
The dollar even fell against the German mark, which had also been weakening because of growing economic problems in Germany.
Yesterday, for example, the German Government reported a rise in its April unemployment rate and a large drop in March industrial orders; the mark fell against European currencies as a result.
Many traders said that if the American unemployment number was particularly weak they expected to see the dollar fall sharply against the Japanese yen, which has become one of the strongest currencies in recent months.
After a five-day holiday in Japan, the dollar closed in Tokyo at 110.19 yen, down 0.91 yen from last Friday. In New York, the dollar fetched 110.025 yen late yesterday afternoon, down from 110.55 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5699, from $1.5665 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound bought $1.5805, up from $1.5650 on Wednesday.

Copper Hits 5 1/2-Year Lows As Supplies Depress Market

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Copper prices fell to five-and-a-half-year lows yesterday, with the market depressed by increasing supplies of raw and scrap copper and weak demand from struggling economies around the world.
"It looks like copper is going to collapse," said Jim Steel, an analyst at Refco, a commodities brokerage firm. 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper for delivery in July dropped 3.4 cents, to 78.15 cents a pound, the lowest price since October 1987. Since January, the nearby contract in copper has shed 30 cents, or nearly a third of its value.
"A lot of traders are standing on the sidelines because they are afraid to buy and sell at these levels," said Andre DiMino, an analyst at R. F. Lafferty. "This is a very treacherous market."
 
China a Big Seller
China has become a big seller of copper, particularly on the dominant London Metal Exchange. Chinese stocks of copper are thought to be adequate for the next three to six months.
The demand for copper, a metal used heavily by industry, has dried up because of weakness in many nations' economies.
World output of copper continues to increase as mines step up productivity, and nowhere does demand appear to be growing, analysts said.
"U.S. demand, which accounts for 25 percent of world consumption, after appearing positive earlier in 1993, is now less than vigorous," Mr. Steel of Refco said.
In contrast, precious metals advanced, led by the resurgent gold market. Prices were lifted by the weak dollar, which has encouraged some investors to move to hard assets like gold. In addition, some investors reacted to the tensions in Bosnia by buying gold.
On the Comex, gold for June delivery rose $2.80, to $358.30 an ounce, and July silver gained 6 cents, to $4.375 an ounce. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, July platinum jumped $7.50, to $387.60 an ounce, while June palladium rose $4.05, to $120.75 an ounce.
Also on the New York Merc, energy futures prices ended mixed. June crude oil rose 1 cent, to $20.47 a barrel, after climbing earlier to $20.63. June heating oil firmed 0.18 cent at 55.91 cents a gallon and June unleaded gained 0.09 cent at 61.80 cents a gallon. June natural gas declined 5 cents, to $2.174 for a million British thermal units.

HEADLINE: No Change in Jobless Claims

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits was unchanged last week, the Government reported today.
The Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance held steady at 346,000. They had fallen by 10,000, from 356,000, during the week ended April 24. 
 Many economists had predicted that claims would change little last week. But the less volatile, four-week moving average of jobless claims fell. Analysts prefer the moving average because it more accurately reflects the labor situation.
The average dropped to 345,000 during the latest reporting period, down from 351,750 during the period ended April 24, and the lowest since the period ended Feb. 27, when it was 343,250.
The claims report was issued a day before the department was scheduled to release data on April employment. A consensus of economists called for the unemployment rate to remain at 7 percent for the third straight month, though nonfarm payrolls were expected to grow by 150,000.
Still, that pace of payroll growth would be less than half the monthly increases during previous recoveries. Payrolls had fallen by 22,000 in March.
The report also said 28,260 applications were filed under a Federal emergency unemployment program during the week ended April 24, down from 28,762 during the previous week.
Thirty-four states and territories reported decreases in regular claims during the week ended April 24, and 18 recorded increases. One reported no change.

Herbalife Cleanses Its Balance Sheet and Attracts New Interest

BYLINE: By Calvin Sims

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
HERBALIFE INTERNATIONAL INC., which nearly went bankrupt in the late 1980's after building a fervent following for its diet products and nutritional supplements, appears to have put the worst behind it.
The company has installed a new management team that has cleaned up its balance sheet, resolved its problems with regulators and charted a course for future growth that focuses mainly on international expansion. 
 As a result, Herbalife's sales are booming again, especially overseas, and earnings almost tripled last year. The company's stock closed yesterday at $11.875, up 12.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading. The 52-week low is $6.625 and the high for the year is $14.50. Herbalife has no debt and in January raised its dividend to 7 cents a share, from 4 cents.
"We are a much more mature company today than we were a few years ago," said Mallory Factor, a spokesman for Herbalife, which is based in Inglewood, Calif. "We now have to be cleaner than Caesar's wife on every aspect of what we do. Consumer confidence is riding on that."
Herbalife's problems began in the mid-1980's when many customers complained of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and dizziness after using the herbal products, which promise to reduce weight and cleanse the body.
Federal and state regulatory agencies started investigations into Herbalife's product claims and sales tactics, and the resulting negative publicity caused sales to dive.
In 1986, Herbalife agreed to pay $850,000 to settle a suit filed by the California Attorney General's office that charged the company with making false medical claims and running an illegal pyramid-style marketing scheme. The company agreed to change the way it represents its weight-loss products and to insure that its distributors do not depend on recruiting sales personnel, rather than selling products, to make money.
Herbalife has introduced several new products, which analysts say are crucial to gaining market share in an industry that thrives on newness. It has also expanded its distribution network, and currently has about 50,000 distributors worldwide. Foreign sales now account for 80 percent of its revenues, up from 68 percent in 1991.
"As long as regulators don't bear down on them for their product claims or selling techniques, they should do very well," said Aaron Lehmann, president of the Fulton Group, a securities research firm based in Greenwich, Conn. "Absent that, this company is a very cheap stock."
Mr. Lehmann, one of the few analysts who follow Herbalife, estimates that the company could generate revenue of $650 million and earn about $1.40 a share this year. In the first quarter of 1993, Herbalife reported net income of $8.7 million, or 32 cents a share, compared with $3.8 million, or 14 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
While Herbalife appears to have made a comeback, some analysts and nutritionists remain skeptical of the company's pills, powders and solutions. A number of product-liability lawsuits are working their way through the courts. Herbalife maintains that the suits have no merit and will have no effect on its bottom line.
In the 1980's, Herbalife sponsored cable television programs that featured testimonials. "In hindsight, some statements made on those cable programs probably should not have been made," Mr. Factor said. "Our products are very effective in helping people lose weight, and if you knock off 40 or 50 pounds that will help back pain or high-blood pressure. But we are very careful now about those kind of claims."

HEADLINE: U.S. at Odds With Asia Bank

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MANILA, May 6

 BODY:
The United States rejected Wednesday any immediate increase in the capital base of the Asian Development Bank, and the bank said poor nations could suffer.
The bank's chief economist, Satish Jha, said without a capital increase, future lending would be cut, affecting Asia's poorest countries. 
 But the chief United States delegate, Jeffrey Shafer, said at the bank's annual meeting that the United States believed the bank should concentrate on being thrifty and living within its existing resources.
"More consideration of the scale of lending and the adequacy of current resources is needed before a decision on a capital increase can be taken," he told delegates from the 53 member countries.
Mr. Shafer's rejection left the United States, the biggest shareholder, largely alone in resisting calls for more capital.
The bank's Japanese president, Kimimasa Tarumizu, asked for the bank's capital base to be at least doubled from the present $23 billion. He said on Tuesday at the opening session of the three-day annual meeting the capital increase was critical.
Washington, which has fallen behind in its payments to the bank, does not want to be bound by past lending growth and is reviewing its policy toward the World Bank and regional institutions like the Asian bank, a member of the United States delegation said.
Mr. Shafer said Washington wanted to see more emphasis on quality in bank lending, noting that more and more of the bank's projects were failing.

Case of the Vanished Audience
Amid the raft of recent closings, the one surprise is "The Song of Jacob Zulu," which shuts down Sunday on the eve of the Tony nominations (it seems certain to garner at least one, for best score) after a run of just over a month.
The show, an anti-apartheid drama by Tug Yourgrau and featuring the a cappella singing group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, received mixed reviews, but attendance figures were quite respectable, hovering around 75 percent throughout the run. In addition, the producers said this week, the show seemed to have found the core black audience that it had particularly sought. 
 "We advertised heavily in the black press, on black radio stations and we had a lot of contact with the black churches," said Albert Poland, the production's general manager. And as a result, he said, "the audience was 50 percent African-American, very unusual for a Broadway show."
The problem seems to have been twofold. First, the discount ticket program that initially drew people to the show never spawned enough word of mouth to spur full-price sales. That, Mr. Poland said, was a function of the economy, explaining that for the audience the show had created, an atypical audience with limited discretionary income, theater tickets just weren't a high priority. So while the seats were three-quarters filled, the weekly receipts never rose much above $170,000, less than half of the potential gross and just under the show's break-even point.
Second, just at the time when the producers were expecting advance sales to take off, they died. "It turned in a day," Mr. Poland said. The day was Tuesday, April 20.
"That morning I was sitting on top of the world," Mr. Poland said. "I thought we were going to have our first profitable week. We already had a $120,000 advance for the week, and if the daily wraps had just kept pace with the previous week, we would've been over our break-even, which was about $190,000. But we ended that day $17,000 down from the previous Tuesday." For the rest of the week, he said, the comparative declines continued.
By that time, the production's reserve fund, initially $250,000, had been nearly depleted by the need for supplemental advertising, and when Mr. Poland and the show's producing entity, Steppenwolf Theater Company of Chicago, looked ahead only a couple of weeks, they envisioned not being able to pay their bills.
"We could've hung on for a week, but it would've been irresponsible," said Stephen Eich, Steppenwolf's managing director. Asked why the audience suddenly vanished, Mr. Eich, obviously perplexed and disappointed, said everybody had a theory.
"People say the World Trade Center," he said, referring to the real-life terrorist scare that coincided with the opening of the show, which deals, in some ways sympathetically, with a young terrorist. "People say the red-hot headlines from South Africa that never seem to cease." And the fact that "Tommy," which opened the week their business went south, is blowing everyone away?
"I just don't know," Mr. Eich said.
 
A Role by Any Other Name
 The Tony Awards administration committee met yesterday afternoon to make the final clarifications on the eligibility of shows and performers, One bone of contention was whether "Tommy" deserves consideration for best score. Most of the show's music dates, of course, from 1969, when the Who recorded the famous album, and the argument put forth yesterday by Arthur Rubin, producer of "Ain't Broadway Grand," was that the music was not written to be show music.
However, the committee ruled the score eligible after Michael David, one of the producers, introduced a copy of a 1968 magazine interview in which Pete Townshend, the composer, said that "Tommy," which was called a rock opera at the time, was written with the theater in mind.
Deciding not to create a special category to accommodate non-traditional shows on Broadway, the committee agreed that "Fool Moon," the clown duet starring Bill Irwin and David Shiner, would remain exactly where it was put at the last meeting, in the best-play category, denying a request by the show's producers that "Fool Moon" be considered for a special Tony. It was also decided that Lynn Redgrave's one-woman show, "Shakespeare for My Father," would be eligible for best play and Ms. Redgrave for best actress and best playwright.
The committee acted on the requests of several individual producers who were jockeying for advantages. Among the changes: Ron Leibman, who plays Roy Cohn in "Angels in America," was moved from the category of featured actor in a play to leading actor, where his chief competition (Stephen Rea, Liam Neeson, Robert Klein) is likely to be stiffer, but where it won't include other actors in the same show. And Anthony Crivello, who plays Valentin in "Kiss of the Spider Woman," was moved from leading actor in a musical to featured actor.
Harvey Sabinson, president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, who presided over the meeting, said the producers of "Kiss" requested the change even though Mr. Crivello is billed above the title because the show revolves around two main characters, Molina, played by Brent Carver, and Aurora, played by Chita Rivera. It's also true, however, that conventional wisdom has Mr. Carver vying for the award in a dead heat with Martin Short from "The Goodbye Girl," and that, in such a visible role, Mr. Crivello stands a better chance in the lesser category.
 
Footlights
 *The Rasputin of contemporary musicals, "Annie Warbucks," rises again. Headed now, as previously rumored, for Off Broadway, the show is to open at the Variety Arts Theater on Aug. 9. Ben Sprecher, Bill Miller and Dennis J. Grimaldi, the producers, said yesterday that the show would cost $1 million to stage. That's the same amount the original "Annie" cost on Broadway in 1977.
*Debra Monk, who appeared most recentlyin the ill-fated "Redwood Curtain," is taking advantage of her unemployment to help out the Circle Repertory Company, which co-produced "Redwood" on Broadway. From Tuesday through Sunday she'll play opposite Ron Rifkin in Jon Robin Baitz's play "Three Hotels," now at Circle Rep downtown, filling a scheduling gap between Christine Lahti's departure and Mercedes Ruehl's arrival.
*Bigger than Madonna! For the five-day period ending Tuesday, the original-cast album of "The Goodbye Girl" was the largest-selling recording at the Tower Records store near Lincoln Center in Manhattan; more than 300 copies were sold, pushing the new Sting album out of the top slot. "I was amazed by it myself," said Roger Ringheiser, the store employee who keeps track of such things. However, to cite the show's opening song (which is not on the album), "This Is as Good as It Gets": at Tower in Greenwich Village, over the same period, "The Goodbye Girl" finished 23d.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING: NOTEBOOK;
Just Say Nah to Today's Mix of Parimutuel Taxes

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
One of the horse-racing advisers to the Governor said yesterday that the state should lower its taxes on bets as part of an overhaul of the parimutuel system "to revive the state's racing, wagering and breeding indutries."
The proposal was made in a report by Steven Crist, the racing writer, who was one of nine people named last year to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Advisory Commission on Racing in the 21st Century. The commission is expected to send its recommendations to Cuomo early in June. It has already indicated that it favors some sort of merger of the New York Racing Association and the Off-Track Betting Corporation. 
 In a briefing at Belmont Park yesterday on the economics of betting in the state, Crist said that he was proposing reforms in four areas: a cut in the parimutuel tax, or takeout, on each bet; a new allocation of the money taken out of bets, both on and off the track, returning more to the bettor; a change in the formula for "breakage," or rounding off the money paid out in bets, and eliminating or refining the state's withholding of income taxes from high, winning bets.
"The only way to bring in more revenue to both government and racing," Crist said, "is to increase the parimutuel handle wagered by the public, whose bets provide every last nickel of funding for these industries."
His key proposal would lower the tax on bets in order to return more to the bettor, who would presumably promptly put it back into the system in new bets. When the parimutuel system began in New York in 1940, the takeout was 10 percent, with 90 percent returned to the bettor. The tax today ranges from 17 percent for straight bets to 25 percent for more exotic bets, and the state's six regional OTB corporations impose an additional surcharge of up to 6 percent on winning bets.
The money subtracted from each winning bet at the track is now split this way: 8.5 percent to the racing association, 4.5 percent to the state, 3.5 percent to purses.
"If you bet $100 on racing," Crist said, "you pay $18 as the cost. On a football game, you pay $4.50. I am suggesting a cut of 15 to 20 percent in the takeout on racing bets. If the state has to take a hit to save the industry, it will have to take it. But the state shouldn't take all the burden. In the long run, everybody should gain. Every time the takeout goes down, attendance and handle go up. It's that simple."
Gerard J. McKeon, president of the N.Y.R.A., who attended the briefing, said he agreed in principle, and added: "I don't see many alternatives."
 
Fly So Free Wins
 Tommy Valando's Fly So Free gave a stirring performance when he rocketed seven furlongs in 1:21 flat and won the feature race at Belmont yesterday by three and a quarter lengths over Magesterian.
The 1990 juvenile champion, now 5 years old, took charge at the head of the stretch, powered into the clear under a precise ride by Julie Krone and came within three-fifths of a second of the track record.
Scotty Schulhofer, who trains the chestnut son of Time for a Change, said later that the Metropolitan Mile on May 31 was next, and added: "He ran a powerful race. I'm not concerned about Alydeed or anybody else. This was meant to get him ready, and he's ready."
 
Rockamundo in the Preakness
 Rockamundo will try to beat the odds by running in the Preakness a week from tomorrow, less than two weeks after corrective surgery to repair a breathing problem. The colt, who won the Arkansas Derby at 108-1, ran 17th in the Kentucky Derby and then underwent minor surgery at Churchill Downs this week to correct a displaced soft palate.
"A horse can be back in training in three days," his trainer, Ben Glass Jr., said. "If everything looks good, he'll run in the Preakness."
 
Acorn at Belmont
 Next marquee event at Belmont: the Acorn, first race in the Triple Tiara series for fillies. It'll be run tomorrow, with Georgia Hoffman's Sky Beauty and Ogden Mills Phipps's Educated Risk heading a tight field of six. The distance is one mile, and the purse $150,000.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Messy Presidency

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
For weeks, some of President Clinton's closest advisers have been telling him that he has taken on too many problems. They warn him that he has to cut back, simplify.
If a handful of hard-line rogues among the Bosnian Serbs insist on suicide and bring on U.S. military action, the warnings obviously will take on urgency. Save your mind, energies and political capital for just a couple of the big ones, he will be told -- the budget and the intervention. 
 That is important, practical and plain-spoken advice. What should worry the country is that Mr. Clinton might take it.
The President's effort to streamline his staff and make it more efficient is no big thing. Every important executive should routinely do that.
But the advice to streamline and limit Mr. Clinton's own job -- there we cut to the meaning and role of the Presidency itself.
Some Clinton people have a distinct weakness for what psychologists call "Magic Think" -- I want it to be, so it is. They wanted the President to be able to concentrate only on economics. They wanted the rest of the world to fade into the background until summoned for photo ops. Therefore, they assumed the world and nation would so arrange their affairs.
The Presidency just does not work that way. No President can remove himself from what is important to the world or his countrymen -- and their continuing consequences.
In Bosnia, bombings would be the beginning for Mr. Clinton, not the end. Though the Bosnian Serbs may have brought it on their own heads, it will be Mr. Clinton's responsibility to prevent the war from spreading through the Balkans. No, that's not fair.
Bombing or peace, Mr. Clinton should be appointing people he trusts to figure out how Bosnia happened.
The West quickly backed Croatian and Slovenian declarations of independence. That made the Muslims' decision for an independent Bosnia inevitable. But neither Europe nor the U.S. figured out that Serbs, fearing they would be isolated in parts of their own country, might slaughter and rape their enemies to prevent it -- or what Western Europe would do about it other than wait for America.
In the next few years a dozen other secessionist movements may demand independence in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. What will we do? The President has to figure that one out now, not when the bombing decisions come around.
The U.N. -- will it forever be drumming up armies to protect shaky new countries? Or would it make more sense to insist that before membership is granted the U.N. should set conditions for stability and exercise trusteeship until they are met?
And while he is thinking about such things -- not after, while -- he should tell us what he intends to do about the really big one: the spread of nuclear and missile technology.
Right there on the front page with Bosnia is a story about China, the world's weapon supermarket, breaking its promise not to sell missile technologies to Pakistan. Here comes North Korea, moving into nuclear weaponry. Is there anybody in the White House who thinks Iran is not moving to the same goal? And how can any President clean such things off his plate?
Meanwhile another people cannot be wiped from the agenda even temporarily -- Americans. What makes the Presidential job worth the upkeep is that it is he who often should be telling Americans what ought to be on their minds, even if it is not.
For instance: Racially we are on the march backward. Should he go even another 100 days without saying, watch out America, black segregation is back, and back where it can hurt most -- the campus?
The fact that it is by African-American decision does not make it less dangerous for them and other Americans. For just one example of a country dividing itself by religion, color or clan, kindly see above under Bosnia.
Can the President keep virtually ignoring the one problem that runs up the highest costs for health care and crime and so deeply damages our own self-respect -- addiction to narcotics, tobacco and liquor? Are we going to do anything about it if the President acts barely interested?
Americans need a President precisely because the job is not simple and limited. It is big, adventuresome and wide-ranging but sometimes downright messy, just like his country. No marks for neatness.

HEADLINE: Street-Vendor Vets Are Being Neglected

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is no question that the streets of New York City must be rid of the illegal vendors and their merchandise. I, too, commend the Mayor for his initiatives ("Smart Steps on Peddling," editorial, April 20). However, at the time the New York State Legislature struck down the longstanding Chapter 687, displacing approximately 176 vendors who are veterans, it was with the understanding that the Fifth Avenue Association and the City of New York would live up to their promises to provide assistance and economic opportunities to them. 
 It has been nearly two years, and the streets are still cluttered with illegal vendors and merchandise. Unfortunately, while the Fifth Avenue Association lived up to its promise to raise $400,000 and has fully supported a number of initiatives, most have yet to be implemented.
I stand by my decision to support the repeal of this law and will continue to do so until all promises made are met.

HEADLINE: New York's Transit Fare Collection Lags

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your April 26 report ("A Fare Card for Transit Is Lagging") that all automated fare collection equipment for New York City buses will be delayed due to "the need to redesign, retest and retool a new fare box" is shocking. Such a system already operates in Washington, D.C. Moreover, I have recently spent two weeks in Copenhagen, where one can buy various types of transit tickets usable on buses and trains. These tickets are electronically programmed. The machines into which they are inserted automatically deduct the applicable fare. Why must the New York commuting public wait for such innovations when they already exist? 
 In a city so dependent on tourism and the revenue derived therefrom, it is surprising that New York City's bus system is not more "tourist friendly." Fare boxes now in use do not accept dollar bills as do those in other cities. Day after day, I see tourists frustrated because they must scrounge around for tokens or proper change.
Almost every recent article of yours concerning the transit system discusses the preservation of the present fare and the possibility of future increases. The M.T.A. ought to study the work and ideas of the late Nobel award-winning economist George Stigler about "elasticity of pricing" with respect to rapid transit fares. If the M.T.A. would provide civilized transit service to increase patronage, it would reduce the spiral of declining ridership and increasing fares.

HEADLINE: Clinton Unveils Financing Plan For Campaigns

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Vowing to "change the way Washington works," President Clinton today proposed a bill that offers public subsidies for television commercials for Congressional candidates who limit their spending and seeks to reduce the influence of lobbyists and political action committees.
Under pressure from Congressional Democrats, who feared a campaign reform bill that would endanger their prospects for re-election, Mr. Clinton abandoned the pledge made in his Presidential campaign: to reduce to $1,000 from $5,000 the amount a political action committee can give to a candidate. 
 The bill proposed today keeps the $5,000 limit for House candidates and lowers the limit for Senate candidates to $2,500.
 
Sewing Up Loopholes
 But the bill calls for many new rules to tighten the campaign finance system, including eliminating the loopholes wealthy givers have used to evade contribution limits to Presidential candidates, funneling their money instead through political parties.
The bill would provide federally financed vouchers for television commercials and postage and printing for candidates who adhere to voluntary spending limits. White House officials estimated that candidates, receiving vouchers that match small donations they collect, would draw $75 million each year in public money.
The proposal would also forbid lobbyists from contributing to or raising money for anyone they have lobbied in the previous 12 months, a provision that some experts said raises Constitutional questions involving free speech.
 
No Change Until 1996
 The proposed legislation would not take effect until 1996, allowing all incumbent House members and one-third of the incumbent Senators to campaign in 1994 under the existing rules.
Today's announcement came after two months of haggling between the White House and other Democrats, particularly in the House, where members seek re-election every two years and do not want to make it too easy for challengers to knock them out of office.
Flanked by House and Senate Democratic leaders at the South Lawn of the White House, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that campaign finance was "a tough issue" and that "I favor a smaller PAC limit." But he said he believed the compromise represented "the most comprehensive reform of the political system in the history of this country."
Sounding less like the insider he has become and more like Ross Perot, who has made campaign reform a theme, Mr. Clinton declared, "This plan will change the way Washington works, the way campaigns are financed, the way that politics is played."
Indeed, the announcement brought a cascade of reaction from people who are immersed in the Washington political culture. Some lobbyists said the bill was too harsh; many Washington critics said it did not go far enough.
Sentiments on Capitol Hill will be best gauged next week, when the Senate is expected to take up the proposal. The House, whose leaders are more nervous about campaign finance legislation, is waiting for reaction from the Senate before it acts. Despite Republican opposition, prospects appear far brighter than last year, when President George Bush vetoed a campaign finance bill drafted by the Democrats that in some areas was weaker than the one proposed today.
 
Republicans Pounce
 There were no Republicans at today's announcement, and Republican leaders wasted no time in attacking the plan for not curbing political action committees more and for using public money.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader who had vowed to stage a filibuster against the bill even before it was introduced, said today: "Despite the friendly 'reform' label, it's nothing new or bold. It's a partisan package designed to protect the Democrat Congressional majority forever."
But Democrats who favor the proposal said they hoped the opponents would succumb to a public groundswell for improving the political system.
"There are cynics who will oppose it, who question our motivation," said Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, as Mr. Clinton stood nearby. "They cannot believe that incumbents would propose legislation to make election contests more fair. What the cynics ignore is the effect the current campaign finance system has on our system of Government. The American people no longer have confidence in the political process."
 
Anticipating Likely Objections
 Proponents said the biggest fight would be over the public financing. Anticipating the likely Republican objections, the President and Democratic leaders emphasized that the vouchers for broadcasting would not come from the general Treasury but would be financed by repealing the tax deductibility of lobbying expenses. Michael Waldman, the White House special assistant who headed the Administration team that worked on the proposal, said that provision would raise about $170 million a year.
To insure that the costs are covered, Mr. Waldman said, the bill also calls for raising the voluntary checkoff on tax returns for political campaigns to $5 from $1.
Fred Wertheimer, the president of Common Cause, a group that has lobbied for years to change the system, expressed concern that many specifics must still be worked out. Yet he praised Mr. Clinton, saying that he had "opened the door to fundamental change in the way our campaigns are financed."
Others who have pressed for changing the political system contended that the proposal's limits on spending and political action committees were not strict enough. They also said they were worried that big givers would pour even larger sums into the political parties' funds for building expenses, which are exempted from the proposal.
"In the 1992 election, the American public made a bold statement about gridlock and change in Washington," said Representative Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat. "What the public got with this package does not meet their true test of reform."
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who seized on campaign finance reform by refusing to accept donations of more than $100 when he ran for the Democratic Presidential nomination last year, said: "It's just another Washington hustle. It's not going to change the corrupting influence of money on national politics."
Reaction was just as intense from business leaders who argue that restricting political action committees will not solve the problem. Steven F. Stockmeyer, executive vice president of the National Association of Business Political Action Committees, said the bill would only help incumbents who "refuse to solicit PAC's but vigorously seek less accountable gifts from wealthy interested individuals."
David Wilhelm, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who helped draft the provision that would limit the "soft money" big donors funnel to candidates through political parties, disputed the contention that donors would find a way to skirt those restrictions. The plan, he said, "ends the dependency on big money and special interests," adding that the Democratic Party "will suffer financial losses of more than 40 percent of our budget under the reforms proposed by the President."
White House officials were still drafting elements of the package on the eve of Mr. Clinton's announcement, and much is still unresolved.
For example, Mr. Clinton had pledged to prohibit bundling, the process by which one entity groups together contributions and gives them to a candidate in one bunch to demonstrate its clout. That provision came under heavy attack from Emily's List, a political action committee for female candidates, which argued that it should be exempted because it was not tied to a specific interest group.
The proposal today does not address the bundling issue because while the White House and Senate Democrats contended that groups like Emily's List should not get an exemption, House Democrats argued the other way.
"That's a hot issue up here," Mr. Clinton said, adding that "my own personal view is that the law should be the same for everyone." He said a compromise might be achieved in which Emily's List could have its contributors send identical envelopes to candidates.
The bill would also give the Federal Election Commission more authority to fine candidates who do not comply with election law. And it would require that broadcasters make commercial time available to candidates at the lowest rate available. The White House did not spell out how these provisions would work.
Another area where uncertainties remain is on restricting lobbyists. Initially, the White House intended to ban all political donations by lobbyists, but it diluted the proposal after warnings from lawyers that such a provision could be unconstitutional.
Daniel J. Swillinger, a lawyer here for Republican candidates, said he still believed the provision would violate the First Amendment rights to free speech and to petition the Government. "In reality," he said, "it would simply mean that a lobbyist would ask another corporate or association executive to make the contribution."
 
 
 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE: CLINTON'S PROPOSALS

 
Spending Limits
 
Proposed:
Voluntary spending limits on Congressional campaigns.
Senate limits would vary, from $1.2 million to $5.5 million for general elections, depending on the state's population. In the primaries, the limits would be 67 percent of the general election limit, up to $2.7 million.
House spending limits would be $600,000 in the two-year election period, but candidates could spend another 10 percent for fund-raising costs. In addition, the limits would be indexed for inflation from 1992. And candidates who have won a contested primary (margin of victory less than 20 percent) could spend another $150,000.
 
Current: There are no spending limits in Congressional campaigns.
 
Public financing
 
Proposed: House candidates who adhered to the spending limits would get vouchers to pay for television air time, postage and printing. In the House, candidates could get vouchers amounting to up to one-third of their spending limit, on a dollar-for-dollar matching basis against donations they receive of $200 or less. In the Senate, candidates could receive vouchers worth up to one-quarter of their spending limit.
 
Current: Congressional candidates get no public funds in any form.
 
Soft money
 
Proposed: Elimination of, the big, unrestricted contributions that wealthy donors, corporations and unions funnel through the political parties to help Presidential campaigns. The parties would still be able to accept large donations for funds that pay for their building or non-administrative office costs.
 
Current: Wealthy donors can know back candidates indirectly with large donations to parties whose is largely unrestricted.
 
Individual donations:
 
Proposed: Individuals would be allowed to give Federal candidates $60,000 per two-year election period. Within that limit, individuals each year can donate up to $25,000 to candidates, $20,000 to the national party committees and another $20,000 for grass roots political activities in the states.
 
Current: Individuals can give $30,000 each year to Federal candidates.
 
Political Action Committees
 
Proposed: House candidates could receive no more than one-third of their donations from political action committees. Senate candidates would collect up to 2O percent of their money from PAC's.
 The limit on how much a PAC can donate to a Presidential candidate would be lowered to $1,000 from $5,000.

Current: No caps on the amount candidates can receive from PAC's.
 
Lobbyists
 
Proposed: Registered lobbyists, or those whose activities must be reported under the the lobbying bill that passed the Senate Thursday, may not contribute or solicit money for any member of Congress or the President or Vice President if they have lobbied the lawmaker or, in cases involving the President and Vice President, the Executive Branch, in the previous 12 months.
 
Current: no special restrictions on lobbyists giving money.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Unemployment Surges To Worst Among Industrial States

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Dimming hopes for a brighter, more prosperous economy in the New York region, unemployment jumped sharply in New Jersey and rose in New York City last month, according to the Federal Government.
Joblessness in New Jersey rose to the worst among the nation's largest industrial states, according to the report, which was released yesterday. The state's unemployment rate climbed to 9.1 percent in April from 8.3 percent in March. That deterioration followed two months of mounting unemployment since January, when 7.4 percent of the state's job seekers were out of work, the Government said. 
 According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment in April rose to 9.8 percent in New York City from 9.6 percent in March. It had dropped notably during the first three months of the year, inspiring some hopes for a steady recovery.
 
From Robust to Ravaged
 Nationwide, the unemployment rate was 7 percent for the third straight month. [Page 37.] That was also the rate for New York State and the March rate for Connecticut, whose April figures have not been released.
But experts said the worst news for the region was in New Jersey, a state that had been one of the most robust during the 1980's. It is now being buffeted by deep and stubborn economic troubles that show few signs of abating.
"The recession is not over for New Jersey," said Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. In his view, the state's severe and continuing unemployment is undermining consumer spending, home sales and other sources of economic revival.
Other economic analysts say New Jersey is being hurt by an array of problems equalled in few other states. It is amply endowed with banks, insurance companies and other financial service concerns that expanded rapidly in the 1980's, but have retrenched even faster over the last four years, shedding thousands of workers.
More than most other Northeast states, New Jersey also retains a huge base of manufacturers, including chemical and pharmaceutical companies, auto plants and hundreds of metal bending factories, most of which are being badly hurt by the recession.
According to yesterday's report, New Jersey manufacturers have cut 200,000 jobs since 1989, a worse cut than in any other part of the state's economy and two-thirds of the total job loss since 1989.
Yet another drag on the state, the experts said, is its close proximity and economic lifeline to New York City, where more than 250,000 New Jersey residents commute to work.
"We are seeing a serious spillover of New York City's problems into New Jersey," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York regional commissioner of the statistics bureau.
Because of the surge in unemployment in New Jersey, and the slight increase in New York City, he said: "the recovery, at least in jobs, is not in sight."
"We are having great difficulty pulling ourselves out of a quagmire," he added.
In New York State, unemployment dropped in April, to 7 percent from 7.3 percent in March. The improvement reflected scattered areas of economic vigor largely confined to the cities and counties outside New York City.
 
Worst for Big States
 As is routine, the data released yesterday gave separate figures for only 11 of the largest industrialized states, with the release of unemployment rates for the other states to lag by two weeks. Connecticut, not included in the report yesterday, has sustained rates of unemployment roughly the same as the nation, despite deep cuts by the state's defense contractors and other severe problems.
Eclipsing California, New Jersey now has the worst unemployment rate among the largest and most populous states.
"There is just no engine to drive us out of this," said Mr. Seneca. Unlike many other states, which expect construction, home sales, manufacturing and other pockets of economic strength to pull them out of recession, "we have no players," he said.
With its slight increase in April to an unemployment rate of 9.8 percent, New York City and its workers may take some solace in the fact that the rate had exceeded 13 percent in January and was over 11 percent during most of the prior six months.
 
Rate Can Be Misleading
 Experts say the unemployment rate, although the most widely used gauge of employment, is sometimes misleading because it does not fully account for people who have stopped looking for jobs. Nor does it account for the degree to which the economy is creating more jobs but at a rate too slow for a growing work force.
But by all measures, the data released yesterday were a grim portrait of employment in New Jersey.
It said the number of people employed in the state had dropped steadily each month since January, with a decline of 64,000, to 3.6 million in April. During the same four months, the number of unemployed workers rose by 68,000, to 358,000 in April.
In contrast, the number of employed people in New York City has increased slightly since January, with a gain of 37,000, to 2.9 million in April. The number of unemployed workers in the city fell sharply since January to 317,000 in April, a drop of 30,000, the report said.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
UNITY WITH EUROPE IS SEEN BY CLINTON ON PLAN FOR BOSNIA

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Despite the apparent lack of progress in a week of diplomatic consultations, President Clinton said today that he expected to produce "a common approach" with Europe soon on a strategy to bring the Bosnian Serbs to the peace table.
"There's still some disagreement around the edges about what the overall specific tactical steps should be," Mr. Clinton told reporters after a meeting at the White House with representatives of the European Community. "But I think there's a lot more agreement than you think, and I think in the next few days we'll see a common approach emerging." 
 The President declined to detail the emerging consensus between Washington and its allies. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton might have been a bit more optimistic than was justified by the results of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's consultations with the Western European allies and the Russians during the last week.
 
Persuading Moscow and London
 Nevertheless, one senior official said, while "not everybody is with us yet, there is at least a sense of movement, especially by the British and the Russians, toward where we want to go" -- which is a lifting of the international arms embargo on the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government, perhaps combined with air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.
Douglas Hogg, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Britain, said in an interview with the BBC on Thursday that while Britain's objections to lifting the arms embargo "have not been diminished," London is nevertheless anxious to maintain a "united front" with the allies. He also said Britain could see "more merits" in air strikes, without lifting the arms embargo.
The Administration is discussing this as a compromise option -- bombing the Serbs for several days to see if that alone is enough to get them to endorse the so-called Vance-Owen peace plan, without taking the potentially escalatory step of lifting the embargo.
 
Christopher to Brief Clinton
 Mr. Clinton has scheduled a meeting at the White House on Saturday with Mr. Christopher and his top national security aides, to hear from Mr. Christopher about exactly where the allies stand, what type of military strategy might be forged from their disparate positions and how then to go about selling it at home and abroad.
"We are the only ones with a strategy, and everyone is looking to us to lead in a policy sense," a senior Administration official said. "That doesn't mean they will follow everything we suggest, but no one else is doing it and there is a strong desire out there for us to put something together."
Mr. Clinton's struggle to come up with an effective policy on Bosnia comes at a time when public opinion polls indicate that Americans' approval of the way he is handling economic and foreign policy issues has dropped. Ross Perot harshly criticized President Clinton in an interview to be published on Sunday in U.S. News & World Report, suggesting that the President might "get a little war going" in Bosnia to divert attention from broken promises at home. White House officials dismissed such a suggestion as nonsense.
But for the first time, the President began to make the public case for lifting the arms embargo on the Muslims, something Mr. Christopher has been trying to sell to the European allies for the past week.
Mr. Clinton said the imposition of the arms embargo on Bosnia "by the United Nations before actually this country was even created and recognized had the unintended consequence of giving the Serbs an insurmountable military advantage, which they have pressed with ruthless efficiency."
Lifting the embargo now, he said, is "certainly one of the options that we have urged that be considered, and I think it's certainly one of the options that's still on the table. I think we've got to keep the heat on."
 
Belgrade's Embargo
 Another option under discussion, first proposed by the Russians, is to try to build on the announcement by the Presidents of Serbia and the Yugoslav federation of an embargo on all trade with the Bosnian Serbs, except for food and medicine. The announcement came after the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament defied their warnings and rejected the Vance-Owen plan.
If carried out, a cutoff of shipments of oil and weapons from Serbia to Bosnia would inevitably deplete the Bosnian Serbs' reserves. One idea now being floated inside the Administration is to have the United Nations endorse that cutoff and to put observers on the Serbia-Bosnia border. But this option is not likely to be pursued, American officials say, because United Nations observers on the Bosnian border would be exposed to great danger.
American officials said there would have to be a five-step process before any military action can be taken: first the Administration decides what it wants to do, then it consults Congress, then another attempt is made to sell it to the allies, then approval is sought from the United Nations, while Mr. Clinton would make the case to the American people.
 
10-14 Days for Military Action
 The general sense among American officials is that it would probably take 10 days to two weeks before any military action could be organized, and there is no indication of recent deployments of American planes, troops or ships. The top item on Mr. Clinton's agenda today was the announcement of his campaign-finance reform program.
American officials said they hoped that "some action" could be taken before the May 15-16 referendum that was called by the Bosnian Serb parliament on whether to accept the peace plan.
As he left Rome today, Mr. Christopher said "some military action" could be taken immediately and justified under existing United Nations resolutions on Bosnia, like Security Council Resolution 770, which authorizes all necessary means to provide relief aid. However, for "greater military action we would much more likely require the explicit authorization of the United Nations," Mr. Christopher said.
Should air strikes be mounted against Bosnian Serb targets, Mr. Clinton said he "would have a very specific, clearly defined strategy to pursue and very clear tactical objectives."
 
Falling Grade on Foreign Policy
 How the American public would receive all this is unclear. In the latest CBS News Poll, less than half the public approved of the way Mr. Clinton was handling foreign policy.
In the nationwide telephone poll of 1,233 adults, which was conducted May 4-6 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, 45 percent of respondents said they approved of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy record, and 35 percent disapproved. In a New York Times/CBS News poll taken in late March, 53 percent approved and 24 percent disapproved.
Public opinion of Mr. Clinton's economic policies has also declined. In the latest CBS News Poll, 38 percent of respondents said they approved and 50 percent disapproved of the way Mr. Clinton was handling the economy. In the March poll, 47 percent approved of his handling of the economy and 37 percent disapproved.
His overall job approval rating declined to 49 percent in the latest poll, down from 55 percent in March.
Asked for his reaction, Mr. Clinton said, "The only thing that matters is the polls that come around on election day."
 
 
 
THE ADMINISTRATION ON BOSNIA
 "If the Serbs persist in violating the terms of the current cease-fire agreement, the United States should take the lead in seeking U.N. Security Council authorization for air strikes against those who are attacking the relief effort. Air and naval forces adequate to carry out these operations should be visibly in position."
 Gov. Clinton - July 26, 1992
 
"I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or nor we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on 'ethnic cleansing.' We can't get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can."
 Gov. Clinton - Oct. 11, 1992
 
"We found, when we consulted with our allies, that if we would try to lift the arms embargo, they would probably abandon their humanitarian efforts. And we have to make a calculus there as to what is most helpful in that situation."
 Secretary Christopher - Feb. 28, 1993
 
""The hatred between all three groups -- the Bosnians and the Serbs and the Croatians -- is almost unbelievable. It's almost terrifying, and it's centuries old. That really is a problem from hell. And I think that the United States is doing all we can to try to deal with that problem."
 Secretary Christopher - March 28, 1993
 
"If you take action, if the united States takes action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met. We must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear. The United States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a war."
 President Clinton - April 23, 1993 News Conference:
 
"The time has come for the international community to unite and to act quickly and decisively. America has made its position clear and is ready to do its part, but Europe must be willing to act with us."
 President Clinton, on Thursday

HEADLINE: Dow Ends 4.71 Lower But Is Higher for Week

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market, still stymied by a torpid economy, yesterday briefly broke out of the narrow trading range it has hugged for the previous four sessions.
The market fell in the early afternoon before recovering somewhat to close with modest losses. 
 Most major indexes were down slightly, with the exception of the Nasdaq composite index, which was up moderately.
Investors seemed hesitant to trade, reacting mainly to short-term news, like the latest economic figures or movements in bond prices.
 
Jobs Data Have Little Impact
 Early yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate remained at 7 percent in April, a figure most analysts had expected.
Stock prices showed little reaction to the employment report. But stocks followed bond prices down in the early afternoon, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling as much as 19 points. The Dow closed down 4.71 points, to 3,437.19. For the week, the Dow gained 9.64 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.95 point, to 442.31, while the New York Stock Exchange's composite index lost 0.54 point, to 244.68. Big Board volume totaled 223.6 million shares, compared with Thursday's volume of 255.5 million shares. Losing stocks outnumbered winners, 981 to 858.
Among other indicators, the Nasdaq composite index closed up 1.40, to 681.44. But the American Stock Exchange market value index closed down for the first time in four sessions with a decline of 0.89, to 426.06.
The three most active stocks had almost identical trading volumes but differing degrees of price movement. Royal Dutch Petroleum, the multinational oil company, was the most active stock. It was down 3/8, to 89 7/8, on news that it planned to advance development of some North Sea oil projects.
Philip Morris, the tobacco company and the second-most-active stock, was up 1 7/8, to 51, on reports that its chief rival, RJR Nabisco, was retreating from a cigarette price war. But RJR, up 1/8, to 5 3/4, denied that it was retreating.
Cisco Systems, a maker of computer networking equipment and the third-most-active stock, was up 3 1/2, to 48 3/4, on higher first-quarter earnings. All three stocks had volume of around 6.3 million shares.
 
Gold Prices Fall
 Gold, considered a haven in times of international crisis, continued to drop, even though President Clinton sought to convince European allies yesterday of the need for more insistent intervention in Bosnia. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery declined 70 cents, to $356.70 an ounce.
Most gold stocks also declined modestly. Newmont Mining, which sold a large stake in itself to the financier George Soros, lost 7/8, to 49.
The Dow was dragged down by Allied Signal, Exxon and J. P. Morgan. Allied was down 1 3/8, to 62 7/8,; Exxon 1/2, to 64 1/8, and Morgan 1, to 66 5/8 -- all on no discernible news. The Dow was lifted somewhat by Philip Morris.
Stocks rose in Tokyo yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 189.33 points at 20,811.36.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Flat For April

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate remained stuck at 7 percent in April for the third consecutive month, the Government said yesterday. The report provided new evidence that the economic expansion is still sluggish and that the job market is recovering at a painfully slow pace.
Indeed, the job market deteriorated in some states. In New Jersey, the jobless rate jumped from 8.3 percent in March to 9.1 percent -- higher than that of California or any other large state. 
 Unemployment edged up in two other large states, Michigan and Massachusetts, as well. In New York, however, unemployment slipped to 7 percent, the lowest level in two years, from 7.3 percent.
 
 
119,000 New Jobs
 Across the nation, businesses added a modest 119,000 jobs to their payrolls last month -- about the same pace, on average, as during the last seven months -- after shedding 9,000 in March. Employees worked more hours as well, a sign of gradual improvement in the job market.
Still, the total number of jobs in the economy remains more than a million shy of the pre-recession peak of 110 million. The recent job gains have merely kept up with population growth, too anemic to pull discouraged workers back into the work force or reduce the number of part-time workers who want full-time jobs. Last month, 8.9 million Americans were out of work, the same as in the previous two months.
"Businesses are hesitating to make commitments to permanent employees because of all the uncertainties in the economic and political outlook," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, chief executive of Manpower Inc., the nation's largest temporary help concern. "From what we see, this situation isn't likely to change substantially in the next several months."
 
'Bad News' for Clinton
 While the Labor Department report eased fears that the economy was slipping back into recession, the absence of signs of more robust job growth keeps pressure on the Clinton Administration to make good on its campaign promise to create jobs.
 "It's bad news for the White House," said Ted Van Dyck, a longtime adviser to the Democrats. "President Clinton is exactly in the same position that George Bush was a year ago: that is, with a flat current economy, for which he's blamed, but pointing to improvement in months ahead, for which he can't yet take credit."
The Administration's top economist, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers, called the unemployment report "neutral to positive."
"We've created more jobs between the end of December and the end of April -- 561,000 -- than was created in the previous 20 months," she said, adding that she did not expect job growth to pick up enough to bring the jobless rate down in the next quarter.
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, blamed the President's budget proposals for "chilling effects" on job creation.
"If President Clinton wants to do something dramatic about unemployment," Mr. Dole said in a statement, "he should make a major policy speech announcing that he's junking his massive tax-and-spend agenda."
The sprawling service sector, which employs four out of five workers, created 198,000 jobs last month. Expansion came in business services (about a third of business service employment consists of temporary workers), health care, entertainment and financial services.
 
 
Fewer Government Jobs
 But Civil Service jobs shrank, bringing the decline in Federal Government jobs to 60,000 for the year. And construction jobs -- which were hit hard by blizzards and floods in March -- dropped another 10,000 as April rains delayed many projects.
Worse, factories shed 65,000 workers in April after a loss of 24,000 in March. The widespread decline more or less wiped out gains last fall and winter. The transportation equipment, processed food, lumber and clothing sectors were hit hardest.
"The 65,000 jobs lost in manufacturing reflects further downsizing due to weak first-quarter profits, sluggish exports, and fear of higher taxes and health-care costs," said Jerry Jasinowksi, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. With uncertainty about how the Clinton economic program will affect business costs, he said, a common refrain among manufacturers has become, "I'm not cutting back on capital spending, but I'm sure as heck not going to hire anyone."
There were a couple of bright spots that hinted that the job losses will not be repeated next month. The number of factory hours worked rebounded from a sharp drop in March that was probably a result of bad weather, and overtime reached a new high. Indeed, despite the drop in the number of jobs, factory employees worked more total hours in April than in March.
 
 
Effect of Automation
 But the reluctance to add new hands in manufacturing likely runs deeper than caution over the foot-dragging expansion and fears about the Clinton Administration's economic program.
Take the case of the Western lumber business, which accounted for some of April's job losses.
"We've bought tens of millions of dollars of automated state-of-the-art sawmill technology in the last 18 months," said John Purcell, a vice president of the Weyerhaeuser Company who is in charge of its Western lumber business, explaining how the industry was responding to a shrinking supply of logs from Federal lands. "The equipment gets more lumber out of each log, but the byproduct is that automating the process requires fewer workers."
Two years ago, he said, Weyerhaeuser had nine Western mills, with 200 or 250 workers each, that turned out 1.1 billion feet of lumber. The company can now produce 1.1 billion feet with seven mills.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Treasury Issues Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Treasury market got little help yesterday in its search for direction from the April employment report.
The monthly figures, which showed the jobless rate at 7 percent for a third consecutive month, failed to change the market's perception of a sluggish but growing economy. Instead, prices of long-term securities declined modestly on worries that the Treasury's refunding auction next week might saturate the market for bonds and notes. 
 The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond fell 18/32 of a point, or $5.63 for each $1,000 in face amount. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.84 percent, from 6.80 on Thursday.
 
 
Short-Term Prices Mixed
 Prices of short-term securities were mixed, which analysts said was because of traders who sold longer-term bonds to buy shorter maturities before the Treasury auction.
The Treasury plans to sell $16 billion of 3-year notes on Tuesday, $10.75 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday and $8.25 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday.
In addition, traders were buying 10-year notes and selling 7-year notes yesterday in response to the Treasury's announcement on Wednesday that it would overhaul its debt management, in part by shifting some longer-term borrowing to shorter terms and by eliminating seven-year notes. Traders dumped the notes yesterday.
At first glance, the unemployment news seemed positive for the bond market, which tends to rise as the economy slows down because of the increased likelihood that the Federal Reserve will ease interest rates. Lower rates tend to raise the value of existing securities.
 But other figures in the report seemed positive for the economy. For example, factory overtime hours rose, pushing weekly overtime to a 25-year high. This is often viewed as a prelude to more hiring.
None of the trends in the latest employment survey would compel the Fed to change its wait-and-see policy on interest rates, said Daniel Seto, an economist for Nikko Securities Company International.
Dana Johnson, head of market analysis for First Chicago Capital Markets in Chicago, said: "I would say there was almost no reaction. It was a really bland report, very mixed."
The 30-year bond fell more sharply than other bonds amid political and economic uncertainties, including the prospects for the President's economic stimulus package and the possibility of United States involvement in Bosnia.
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities rose 1/32 point, while intermediate maturities were unchanged to 6/32 point lower, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a face value of $1,000.
 
 
Bond Index Falls
 The Lehman Brothers' daily Treasury bond index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.60, to 1,300.71.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 2.92 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 2.87 percent. Yields on six-month bills remained at 3.04 percent as the discount held at 2.96 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 3.21 percent; the discount rate edged up a basis point to 3.10 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 101 1/2, down 1/8 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity rose to 5.85 percent from 5.84 percent.
