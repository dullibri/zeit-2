HEADLINE: Growth Plus Grace on the Audubon Site

 BODY:
The old movie house and ballroom in Washington Heights where Malcolm X was murdered 25 years ago is shabby and empty. Yet it still whispers of memories and grandeur.
To many New Yorkers, the Audubon Theater and Ballroom is of great historic and emotional significance. To many preservationists, it is of great architectural significance. To Columbia University and to New York City and State, it is of great economic significance. Not surprisingly, those three perspectives have sparked a controversy. 
Columbia and public agencies have been working for years on a $25 million plan to lease the city-owned site and build a big biomedical facility, the first phase of a four-block research park. Now, with deadlines for city approval approaching, opposition threatens the project. Its loss would cost the neighborhood and city a much-needed economic boost. But losing the 78-year-old building would hurt, too. Fortunately, the Dinkins administration has come up with a compromise. It calls for saving part of the old building and turning it into a museum dedicated to Malcolm X. Columbia would then proceed with its proposal, which includes a $500,000 scholarship for black medical students, a job training program for lab technicians and land for a community center. The university had also planned to affix some of the Audubon's terra cotta facade to the new building and provide space for a memorial to Malcolm X. Columbia says conscientiously that it is willing to work with the city but rightly resists paying for a public museum. That's the city's responsibility. So far the city has not determined costs or who should pay them. Those are such big gaps that it's hard to know whether the proposal will work. But a just compromise is surely worth pursuing. It would insure this vital boost to the city's economy and development while recognizing a distinctive building and an important figure.

HEADLINE: Only Washington Can Break Mideast Stalemate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As long as the Middle East diplomatic stalemate continues, it is child's play to generate new cycles of violence - whether the provocation is murder by a deranged Israeli or landings on Israel's beaches by a deviant Palestine Liberation Organization group (front page, May 31).
What is the United States waiting for? It is not likely that Yasir Arafat's relatively moderate posture at the head of the P.L.O. can survive another year with nothing to show for willingness to renounce terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist. Nor can President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt continue to play the moderate Arab broker in the face of the Iraqi challenge. And if projected migration figures for Soviet Jews materialize, the specter of a solution that forces West Bank Palestinians into Jordan or the Sinai no longer sounds far-fetched. 
The United States should take some of the pressure off by reclassifying migrating Soviet Jews as political refugees. Then, we should make it clear that, while we do not intend to impose any particular solution on the Mideast conflict, we insist that the parties talk, that Israel implement its own peace plan. Without that, we should state that we feel no obligation to support an illusory peace process with our increasingly scarce aid dollars and diplomatic attention.
Nothing will happen unless we act. What presumably keeps us from doing so is some perceived lack of Congressional support and Main Street support, plus the notion that overt pressure would be counterproductive. I suggest the facts are otherwise.
Rank-and-file support for Israel's policies - on Capitol Hill and in the American Jewish community - has been waning rapidly. The Likud Government would balk at overt pressure, but a truly independent foreign policy for Israel is unrealistic. We could expect considerable short-term discomfort, but a genuine concern for Israel's future does not translate into continuing unconditional support for deeply flawed and self-destructive policies.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Why the Flag-Waving?

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Do you wonder why the ordinarily reasonable George Bush is wrapping himself in a ''flag amendment'' to lead an assault on the Bill of Rights?
Are you puzzled by the President's arts flip-flop, as he now backs away from the public funding of obscene or sacrilegious art?
These questions have a common answer: The 1990 midterm election campaign is under way.
The Republican goal is to make inroads into the moderate middle with centrist domestic policies and nice-guy treatment of collapsing Communists, while holding the growling right by punching its supposed hot buttons of superpatriotism and antipornism. 
The Democratic goal is simply to re-elect incumbents to Congress. To this uninspiring end, the party will raid the Treasury to fund mass franked mailings to constituents; its philosophy is to summitize on the budget deficit until after the election and hope for the invigorating boost of a major recession.
These are unworthy goals and demeaning strategies. Should we throw up our hands and say ''I never vote, it only encourages them''?
No; now is the time for Democrats to get mad at their leaders for hiding in the Hill bunker (doesn't anybody here want to start to run for President?) and for G.O.P. voters to refuse to be manipulated by the White House politics of cultural resentment.
I'll do my bit from the right, beginning with a brief diatribe against the abandonment of conservative principle in the unprecedented, unconscionable and wholly unnecessary attack on the Bill of Rights.
The central tenet of conservatism is that ''unless it is necessary to change, it is necessary not to change.'' The country is not under intolerable siege or danger of overthrow; absolutely no need exists to amend our First Amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech, assembly and religion.
Flag-burners, by infuriating most of us, seek repression; but by fooling with the Bill of Rights, we would play into their hands. The way to frustrate those who test the strength of our Constitution is to ignore them, to tune them out, not to make prime-time political martyrs out of them.
Equally important, conservatives aware of the Founders' prohibition of the establishment of an official religion reject the application of the word ''desecration'' to our nation's symbol.
Although we may express religious belief in political settings - from an opening prayer in Congress to ''In God We Trust'' on our coins - in this democracy, nothing political can be consecrated, ''made sacred.''
Should we respect the flag? Always. Should we worship the flag? Never. We salute the flag but we reserve worship for God.
Any attempt to make the nation's flag sacred - to endow this secular symbol with the holiness required for ''desecration'' - not only undermines our political freedom but belittles our worship of the Creator.
If Representative Lynn Martin of Illinois thinks a flag issue will help her unseat Senator Paul Simon, she may discover many principled conservatives turning to the Democrat for his support of the Bill of Rights.
The campaign-year inclination to treat the American eagle as the Golden Calf is closely related to the controversy over the use of public money to support sacrilegious or borderline-obscene works of art.
At first, the President reacted to the outrage of conservatives at the taxpayer support of the Mapplethorpe and Serrano works by disapproving ''censorship.'' That allied Mr. Bush with the cultural-political left.
Censorship is not the issue; funding is. Artists are free to express themselves in outrageous ways, but the Government is not obligated to buy their works. Freedom of expression is a right, but payment for it is not an entitlement.
Mr. Bush's political advisers warned him this was a cultural resentment button on a par with flagburning. With an eye to the 1990 campaigns, the President swung around; we'll see new accountability in the way taxpayer money goes to the arts.
I happen to believe the arts and the Feds should never be bedfellows, but that's my libertarian self-indulgence. Today's focus is on why Mr. Bush veered from his middle-road instincts: in this case, he is moving only to palliate the antipornists.
He should cut out all this flag-waving, antiporn posturing; that's not why most righties vote Republican. And his macho-bluenose pose will never fool the hard right; they know he's no first-term Reagan.
O.K., now what about you Democrats? As the 1990 campaign begins, are you satisfied with the abuse of franking and the absence of frankness on the left?

HEADLINE: AIDS Travels New York-Puerto Rico 'Air Bridge'

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
For half a century, millions of Puerto Ricans have crossed back and forth over the ''air bridge'' linking New York and San Juan. These days, the air bridge also joins New York and its southernmost ''suburb'' in the devastating epidemic of AIDS.
AIDS is inflicting a heavy toll throughout America, but nowhere is it heavier than among Puerto Ricans. It continues to grow fastest among intravenous drug users; it is these addicts, their sex partners and their children who make up the vast majority of Puerto Ricans with AIDS.
Today, the island has the nation's highest per capita rate of new cases, more than three times the national average. On the mainland, research shows that AIDS is striking Puerto Ricans harder than other Hispanic people, blacks or non-Hispanic whites. 
 
Tracing the Epidemic
''We need help,'' said Fernando R., one of five members of a Puerto Rican family infected with the disease. ''AIDS is killing a lot of people.''
Some Puerto Ricans believe AIDS was imported by those returning from the mainland - those they call ''New Yoricans,'' and gay tourists. Epidemiologists say it is impossible to trace. But whatever its origin, the Puerto Rican AIDS epidemic is overwhelmingly caused by intravenous drug use and is now being exchanged back and forth across the air bridge in a growing cycle of disease.
Air travel ''made it one epidemic,'' said Dr. Nicholas A. Rango, director of the New York State Health Department's AIDS Institute.
Today, the air bridge carries the medical and societal casualties of AIDS. Patients come to the states desperate for medical treatment they cannot get on the island. Those in terminal stages return home to die. Grieving relatives arrive for funerals. Orphaned children are dispatched to grandmothers across the water.
''That's the pattern. They get infected in New York and come back home to die with their families, or they get infected here and go there for treatment,'' said Dr. Gaspar Encarnacion, a doctor in San Juan who saw his first AIDS case in 1981 and now sees an average of 35 patients a day. There are deathbed reunions. ''The mothers always come,'' said Dr. Gerald H. Friedland of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. One woman flew in to comfort her son at the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. Two days later, he slipped into a coma, and she maintained a bedside vigil for months.
This movement is rooted in Puerto Rico's poverty and in its curious status as a stepchild of the United States - a status that has hindered the development of AIDS services in Puerto Rico but allows the island's residents to travel to New York for what they cannot get back home.
AIDS services are not ideal on the mainland, but health experts say conditions on the island are worse. Many obstacles - political, cultural, economic and religious - have thwarted efforts to improve AIDS treatment in Puerto Rico, the experts say.
Most Puerto Ricans with AIDS are poor and must rely on limited public health care. But Medicaid, the Federal insurance program for the indigent, is virtually unavailable unless one leaves the island; while the Federal Government reimburses half of Medicaid bills in the states, it allocates $79 million for all health care in Puerto Rico.
Some Puerto Ricans move to the mainland; others claim residency while visiting friends or relatives.
 
'Not Entitled to Medicaid'
''As a Puerto Rican you're an American citizen, but you're not entitled to Medicaid here,'' said Dr. Jaime Rivera Dueno, director of the AIDS Institute in San Juan. ''But you can get on a plane to the states and qualify there.''
Advocates for AIDS patients in Puerto Rico say that sometimes there is not even any aspirin in hospital pharmacies or clean sheets for beds. Many patients languish for days, even weeks, in emergency rooms, if they get that far. Some die in the streets.
The most disturbing gap, the experts say, is that potentially life-prolonging drugs like AZT and pentamidine, though widely used on the mainland, remain largely unavailable in Puerto Rico. They are simply far too expensive; local officials estimate AZT alone would cost $60 million of the $79 million in Federal aid for health care.
''Most of our clients aren't informed, so they don't ask about AZT,'' said Jose Toro Alfonso, director of the AIDS Foundation, a nonprofit agency in San Juan. ''And we don't tell them, since we cannot get it for them,''
 
A Scourge
Five Siblings Ravaged by Disease
One who has traveled the air bridge is 32-year-old Fernando R., who belongs to one of the most AIDS-ravaged families in America.
Fernando R., soft spoken and a neat dresser, works in a restaurant in a quiet valley town nestled below Puerto Rico's dark mountain rain forests. He recently returned there after 14 years in New York City and agreed to be interviewed on the condition that his last name be withheld, to protect his job and relatives.
Fernando R. is one of seven children. Their father was a police officer, their mother a school worker. They were born on the island, but he and several others moved to the mainland, and the family exchanged visits. #2 Die, 3 Suffer All grew up to use illegal drugs. The two eldest brothers were killed in drug-related violence a few years ago. The remaining five children, because they sometimes shared needles among one another, became trapped in the AIDS epidemic. Two brothers died of AIDS last year. Another brother now lies in an AIDS hospice no longer able to speak.
And the survivors, Fernando R. and a sister, are both infected.
As a reformed addict, Fernando R. testified at a hearing in the Bronx last December on a Federal bill for AIDS disaster relief. Now that bill is making headway in Congress, and could bring $24 million to Puerto Rico. But Fernando R. has an immediate personal need. The supply of AZT he obtained in the Bronx is running out in Puerto Rico. Despite monthly visits to the island's leading AIDS clinic, he has been unable to get the prescription refilled.
''My mother and father are always going to the hospital'' to visit their sick children, Fernando R. said. He does not want to be next.
 
The Crossing
From Mainland To Island and Back
At a San Juan methadone clinic, a questionnaire for infected addicts has a line for ''country last visited.'' The most popular destination listed: the Bronx.
As American citizens, Puerto Ricans travel to the mainland free of immigration barriers. Flights take about three hours, at off-season fares as low as $100. Almost as many Puerto Ricans live in the states, about 2.5 million, as on the island, whose population is 3.5 million. Those on the mainland are concentrated in the Northeast, with 1.5 million in the New York region. About 30 percent on each side visit the other at least once a year, studies indicate.
Several blocks from the centuries-old Spanish fortifications and pricey tourist boutiques of Old San Juan sits an abandoned building of scaling concrete. A pet horse is tethered outside. Inside, addicts inject speedballs, a heroin-cocaine mixture. Scrawled on the wall is notice of the $1 entry fee for ''chutin'' - phonetic Spanish for the New York street slang of ''shooting'' drugs. The entire scene, says Hector Colon, an addiction researcher in San Juan, ''seems intimately related to the migration experience.''
''The Bronx and Puerto Rico are really extensions of each other,'' said Dr. Friedland of Montefiore. ''It's a state of mind.''
On the island, the AIDS epidemic continues to grow, just as it does among Puerto Ricans in New York. So far, health officials in Puerto Rico have recorded 4,200 full-fledged cases. Some AIDS experts estimate the true number is as much as double that, since doctors sometimes decline to report cases because of the stigma, and still others are never diagnosed at all.
The island's official numbers are bad enough. With 2,603 known AIDS deaths, the disease has become one of the leading causes of death among those aged 20 to 45. In New York City, AIDS is the No. 1 killer of Hispanic people aged 1 to 4 and 25 to 44.
For the year ending March 31, Puerto Rico had 47 new cases per 100,000 population. According to Federal records, the next highest was New York State at 39. The national average was 15. Among metropolitan regions, San Juan's rate of 87 was second only to San Francisco's 115; New York City was third, at 69.
 
A Singular Problem
New research shows that the umbrella Hispanic label has camouflaged stark contrasts between Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic people.
In New York City, Puerto Ricans are the most severely affected racial or ethnic group, Dr. Barbara S. Menendez of Lehman College reports in this month's Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. She found male AIDS mortality highest among Puerto Rican migrants, at 362 per 100,000 population, compared to 217 for other Hispanics, 267 for blacks and 182 for non-Hispanic whites. Her study covered men only.
A study last year by Dr. Richard M. Selik and Dr. Kenneth G. Castro found that native Mexican in the United States had an AIDS rate identical to Whites. But the AIDS of native Puerto Ricans on the mainland was seven times higher.
Also dramatically different were the causes of AIDS. Among other Hispanic people, homosexuals were the leading group. But for Puerto Ricans, it was drug abusers. On the island, three of four AIDS cases originate with drug abuse. Puerto Ricans inject more often than than other drug abusers, research shows, and are more likely to use ''shooting galleries,'' where needles are often rented or shared. Adding to the risk, studies indicate few Puerto Ricans use condoms, and a significant number engage in heterosexual anal intercourse, which spreads the virus.
More ominous than the numbers to date are the estimates of how many more are infected. Puerto Rico's official AIDS commission says upwards of 40,000 people carry the virus. Some health experts estimate several times that. Preliminary samples of pregnant poor women in San Juan show 1 in 10 infected - identical to the rate at a South Bronx hospital.
 
The Barriers
Homosexuality And Other Taboos
Frank Chaulon is one of Puerto Rico's most vocal advocates for people with AIDS.
''People are dying without asking for help,'' said Mr. Chaulon, who ran a San Juan program that taught addicts to clean their needles. ''In our culture if you speak out, you're impolite. Our national emblem should be a lamb. Gays are a big minority here, some of the most talented people, but they're are dying in silence. The drug users -sometimes I have have 17 dying in one weekend. The general population is saying, 'Oh, they are dying, oh, good.' ''
While a majority of AIDS victims are drug users or their sex partners, many are gay people. Homosexuality is repressed as a taboo, and gay or not, having AIDS carries with it an unmistakeable stigma and frequent discrimination. Physicians in New York tell of Puerto Rican patients driven to the mainland by their families' rejection. Some homosexuals with AIDS even falsely admit to drug abuse.
''There are no homosexuals in Puerto Rico - we're all macho males,'' laughed Toro Alfonso of the AIDS Foundation. Donald E. Babb, the foundation's chairman and an editor at The San Juan Star, said: ''In places like New York, you already had a gay movement. In Puerto Rico, you never had that.''
 
Political Infighting
The Roman Catholic Church has been at the forefront in providing care, but its opposition to condoms has hampered prevention. One prelate proclaimed it better to die of AIDS than to use condoms, and the island's health minister opposed advertising them ''as a medical man and as a Christian.''
At the same time, the fight against AIDS has been fragmented by infighting among Puerto Rico's political parties and feuding between health officials from San Juan and the commonwealth government.
''AIDS appears to have been co-opted by the party politicans, and its controversies turned into themes which can be bickered about,'' Dr. Ineke Cunningham, a University of Puerto Rico sociologist, wrote in a British journal.
Tourism is Puerto Rico's prime industry, and some have worried about AIDS blighting the image of an idyllic paradise. The official response to one television report on AIDS came not from health experts but the tourism agency.
''The biggest problem is denial that the problem exists,'' said Mr. Babb of the AIDS Foundation.
Increasingly, however, AIDS is impossible to ignore.
'As we enter the 1990's,'' said Mr. Babb, a native Puerto Rican whose brother died of AIDS in the States, ''AIDS is winning the battle for people's lives in Puerto Rico.''

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up 0.3% in May

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Prices at the producer level rose by three-tenths of 1 percent in May as a sharp upturn in the cost of food was largely offset by another hefty decline in the cost of energy, the Government reported today.
Although the increase followed three straight declines in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, analysts said they were generally encouraged about the May result. They said it confirmed the view that the inflation rate had stabilized at a moderate level after a large early-winter burst.
Excluding the erratic food and energy components, the finished-goods index edged up a modest two-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month. 
 
Drop for Companion Indexes
Inflation at the both the intermediate and crude stages of production, as measured by companion indexes, eased slightly, the first time they both declined in the same month since August.
''These latest figures are positive,'' said Ron Schreibman, a vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade group whose members pay the prices compiled by the three indexes. ''They point toward a continuing reversal of the inflationary trend we experienced last fall and into the winter.''
Gordon Richards, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, concurred. He found in today's data a return by the producer price index to its ''underlying rate, now that food and energy prices no longer are creating a somewhat artificial decline.'' #1 Percent Energy Decline Energy fell 1 percent last month, a substantial decline although considerably smaller than the 3 percent average drop for February through April. World oil prices have been soft in recent months.
The stock market shrugged off the report as in line with expectations. Bond prices rose in active trading as credit market participants shifted out of short-term securities and into bonds. [Pages D6 and D13.] In a rare back-to-back sequence, today's report on inflation at the producer level will be followed Friday by publication of the Consumer Price Index, which, unlike the index for producer prices, includes services and imported goods.
If that report is similarly reassuring, many analysts expect the Federal Reserve to move closer to a decision to ease monetary policy, probably sometime this summer. The economy, as reflected in such indicators as employment, housing and retail sales, is thought to be growing at a very slow pace and may need the stimulus of easier credit in the near future.
Over the last year, according to today's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the producer price index has risen 3.1 percent - exactly half the 12-month advance up to May 1989 - and various analysts believe it could continue to decelerate.
One of them is Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist for ASB Capital Management, a Washington money manager. He predicted the index would rise at a rate of 2 1/2 to 3 percent for the second half of this year and would move still lower in 1991. The Federal Reserve's policy of keeping short-term interest rates relatively high, Mr. Carpenter contended, has been forcing American manufacturers to cut their cost structures and this pressure is now spreading to other parts of the economy.
Consumer foods climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in May, today's report showed, reversing a decline of that amount in April. Price increases accelerated for fish, dairy products, pasta and processed turkeys, and turned up after a decline the preceding month for shortening, cooking oils and processed chicken.
 
Pork Rises, Eggs Decline
Pork prices rose by 5 percent for the second straight month, but egg prices plunged 22 percent and fresh fruits fell 8 percent.
Heating oil, meanwhile, fell 6 percent and gasoline by 2 percent.
Consumer goods other than food and energy, however, rose five-tenths of 1 percent, more than in April or March, as prices accelerated for tobacco products, newspapers, furniture, footwear and household glassware. Capital equipment was unchanged in price last month after edging up two-tenths of 1 percent in April.
Among goods at the intermediate stage of production, such as a bag of flour or bolt of cloth, the overall decline in prices was one-tenth of 1 percent, with energy causing much of the decline. The increases were paced by foods and an upturn in materials for nondurable manufacturing.
Prices for crude goods, such as wheat or raw cotton, also edged down one-tenth of 1 percent, but in this stage energy materials turned up in price while foodstuffs dropped more than in April.
Yet another index, one for the net output of total manufacturing industries, climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in May, the same amount as in April. Unlike the other data, this index is not adjusted to compensate for seasonal fluctuations.

HEADLINE: Savings Debate Gets Partisan Tone

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
In a new sign that the 10-month-old savings and loan bailout could finally be turning into a partisan issue, House Democrats today disputed the Bush Administration's contention that the slumping real estate market was responsible for the escalating costs of the rescue effort and charged that mismanagement by the Administration was at the root instead.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the House Banking Committee today that his latest estimates of the cost of the bailout - as high as $130 billion - could go even higher if the slumping real estate market did not turn around.
The $130 billion estimate does not include interest payments on the money borrowed to finance the program. With those costs included, the General Accounting Office has said the total could be $325 billion to $500 billion. 
''If the real estate market continues to go down, then I'll be here six months from now telling you that the cost will go up,'' Mr. Brady said.
 
Aggravating the Crisis
Administration officials have said that the real estate slump aggravates the savings crisis in two ways. It hurts the savings industry, threatening to bring down more institutions that have large numbers of real estate loans, and it makes it harder for the Government to sell its growing stockpile of property from seized institutions.
Mr. Brady said the Administration was in the midst of calculating how much money the Resolution Trust Corporation would need. The agency supervising the bailout will probably run out of money by the end of the year or early next year, he said, adding that most of the additional money would have to come from the Treasury and not through additional borrowing by the Resolution Funding Corporation, which is the financing arm of Resolution Trust.
''We are dealing with a moving target, made greatly more expensive by a weakening real estate market and constantly changing economic conditions,'' Mr. Brady said. ''It is not susceptible to easy answers or simple solutions.''
Mr. Brady's explanation of the rising costs did little to satisfy the Democrats, who said the expenses were rising because Resolution Trust had been slow in selling its huge portfolio of properties taken from seized savings and loan associations.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, called the bailout effort the second savings and loan crisis, saying there had been delay and confusion since the President signed the law last year establishing the rescue program.
''The minute the bill was signed, there was an abdication of responsibility,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''Unlike the first crisis, in this one there is not plenty of blame to go around. It has not been given the attention, the magnitude, the force.''
Representative Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, who is chairman of a study group on the bailout, told Mr. Brady: ''There is an appearance to many of us that the R.T.C. is floundering and the oversight board isn't doing what it can. It's simply not moving the assets.''
 
More Prosecutions Urged
The Democrats repeatedly asked why the Justice Department had prosecuted only a small fraction of the 17,000 or so referrals from bank regulators of possible crimes committed by industry executives.
Mr. Brady said the Administration was committed to prosecuting the cases, but their complex nature made quick resolution difficult. ''A white-collar crime is a lot harder to prosecute than someone who walks into a bank and has his picture taken by six cameras,'' he said.
Democratic leaders have been reluctant to make an issue of the savings and loan crisis, largely because the reputations of a number of prominent Democrats have been clouded by accusations of influence-peddling and misconduct.
Representative Jim Wright of Texas, the former Speaker of the House, and Representative Tony Coelho of California, a leader of House Democrats, were forced from office last year in part because of questions about their dealings with savings and loan officials. Fernand J. St Germain, the Rhode Island Democrat who had been chairman of the House Banking Committee, was defeated in the 1988 elections, largely because of questions about gifts from savings industry lobbyists.
In addition, there are four Democrats in the ''Keating Five,'' the Senators who are being investigated by an ethics panel over accusations that they put pressure on bank regulators who were examining a campaign contributor's failing savings and loan.
The hearing was the first opportunity that House Democrats have had to confront Mr. Brady since he substantially raised estimates of the bailout's cost.
Several members of the committee said that the latest estimates of the number of collapsing savings institutions suggested that the industry should be consolidated with commercial banks.
Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that as many as 1,700 of the nation's 2,500 savings institutions might ultimately collapse. The Treasury Department had earlier estimated that 1,000 insitutions might need to be bailed out.

HEADLINE: Congress Voices Concern Over Trade Pact With Mexico

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Members of Congress today warned the Bush Administration that ratification of a free trade agreement between the United States and Mexico could be held up by concerns that the wages of American workers might suffer. Lawmakers also said that curbing the flow of illegal drugs should be part of the negotiations.
The Congressional reaction came in response to the plan announced on Monday for the two nations to move toward a free trade pact.
During hearings of the House Ways and Means Committee's trade subcommittee, most members spoke in favorable terms about the concept of freer trade with Mexico, but their questions and comments quickly showed how specific constituent interests would bear on eventual votes. 
Representative Donald J. Pease, an Ohio Democrat, expressed concern that blue-collar workers in Mansfield, Ashland, Lorain and other industrial towns he represents could see their wages fall.
 
Wages Under $1 an Hour
''It seems to me inevitable that wages in Mexico will level up and wages in the U.S. will level down and that the relatively well-paid industrial worker in my district is bound to suffer,'' the Ohio lawmaker complained.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said in a recent policy statement that 400,000 Mexican workers are now employed at wages under $1 an hour, producing goods entirely for the American market.
Overall manufacturing wages in Mexico average $1.90 an hour compared with $14.50 an hour in the United States, according to figures from both governments.
Representative Frank J. Guarini, a New Jersey Democrat, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat from New York City, insisted that any trade agreement take up drug issues as well.
Mr. Rangel said that 50 percent of the cocaine that enters the United States comes from Mexico. He reported that shipments have more than doubled from 15 metric tons to more than 38 tons since 1988.
The United States Trade Representative, Carla A. Hills, told the panel that while the Bush Administration does not yet have a position on the inclusion of drugs as one of the negotiating issues, ''we'll consider that.''
Still she emphasized that the economic gains of freer trade should help ease the drug problem.
''I think that two areas where we will benefit from the free trade agreement in the drugs area are the creation of jobs and opportunities,'' she said.
Should drugs become part of the negotiations, Mexico is likely to insist that labor mobility be discussed as well.
 
An Engine for Growth
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has said that his country wants the free trade agreement as an engine for growth so that the economy can export goods not jobs.
He told an American business group in Washington on Monday that the agreement should produce ''a lesser and more orderly flow of workers'' to the United States.
On the question of the wage differences between the two countries, the President's trade chief said ''it was not necessarily the fact'' that lower Mexican wages would depress American wages.
Later, before the same panel, Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, commented on the likely impact. He said that ''drawing low-wage Mexican labor into our operations helps reduce costs and creates room to pay high U.S. wages for the remaining tasks.''
Mrs. Hills said she intended to consult closely with Congress, labor, business and other interest groups before giving the final green light to a process that could eventually create a North American free trade zone embracing 350 million people. Formal negotiations between the two governments could start around the middle of next year. Both governments hope to conclude the pact within two years.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Is Kravis Playing A Waiting Game?

BYLINE: By Anise C. Wallace

 BODY:
IN the big-money game being played by RJR Nabisco Inc. and its bondholders, Henry Kravis put an important card on the table this week when it was learned that he had raised $1.7 billion from his partners to invest in RJR Nabisco.
Mr. Kravis, whose buyout firm, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, took RJR private in 1989 for $25 billion, the largest leveraged buyout in history, had told his partners that they could earn 25 to 30 percent by restructuring the debt of the company.
Now, holders of the company's ''junk bonds'' are speculating that he will spend some or all of that money with them. As a result, some RJR bonds surged more than $70 for every $1,000 in face value Wednesday, and trading was brisk again yesterday, although prices closed mostly unchanged from the day before. 
But a handful of market participants say Mr. Kravis may not invest the $1.7 billion at all and instead sit back and hope that speculators, cheered by reports of the cash at hand, drive the prices of the company's bonds higher.
''You can't come out and say they're manipulating the market, but if they balance it right, they'll have to do nothing,'' said Dirk Van Doren, a junk bond analyst who follows RJR Nabisco for McCarthy Crisanti Maffei in Montpelier, Vt. ''They have shown their hand to say this is what we can do.''
Some other investors agree, pointing out that as long as the bond prices rise, Mr. Kravis has no need to buy back the debt or propose an exchange offer. ''Why fuel the fire when the fire is burning brightly,'' said Barbara L. Kenworthy, a mutual fund manager at the Dreyfus Corporation in New York.
But sooner or later, under the rules of the financing of the RJR deal, Mr. Kravis must play a card. In April 1991, the interest rate on $6 billion in junk bonds that were issued in the buyout must be reset so that, in the opinion of the company's two investment bankers, they will trade at their par value, that is, at 100 cents to the dollar, excluding the interest that has accrued. (These bonds pay interest not in cash but in more securities.) Since the RJR bonds have been trading at less than their face value in the distressed market for junk bonds, this is likely to mean that the interest rate will have to be set higher, something that would cost Mr. Kravis and his investors more money.
One issue, for instance, the senior converting debentures due in 2009, was quoted at $90.75 for every $100 of face value yesterday. With accrued interest, their value is $120.50. If their interest rate were to be reset to yield a price of $100 plus accrued interest, they would trade at about $135.50, said Derek A. Jones, a vice president at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ''They've got a way to go,'' he said.
Many investors are now speculating that Mr. Kravis will take some steps to shore up the prices of the bonds in the meantime. Among his options are to buy back the bonds directly in the open market, to make an exchange offer to the holders for new securities or equity in the company, to inject more equity into RJR, or to do a combination of things.
Without taking some action on the reset problem, say analysts, RJR will be unable to borrow more cash either in the junk bond market or from commercial banks, which already hold more than $6 billion in RJR debt used for the buyout. Neither group now is likely to refinance a $1.2 billion bank loan that comes due next February, Mr. Jones said. ''They can't do that as long as the reset is hanging over them,'' he said. ''The banks really control this.''
Because Mr. Kravis and his companies may have to use junk bonds for cash in the future, some fund managers in the junk bond market hope that he is willing to help the bondholders. ''He likes this well,'' said Rebecca H. Garner, vice president of Associated Capital Investors in Little Rock, Ark.
Earlier this year, at a conference in Arizona, Mr. Kravis angered many junk bond investors when he suggested that they were selling RJR bonds in panic. Solving the reset problem, Ms. Garner said, could buy Mr. Kravis some ''cheap good will.''

HEADLINE: No Sanctions On India Trade

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today, as expected, that it would not impose economic sanctions on India for trade barriers the United States deems offensive.
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, termed India's barriers to investment by Americans and other foreigners and its exclusion of American insurance companies an unreasonable burden on United States commerce. 
But she said retaliation was inappropriate at this time because of global free-trade talks that are continuing. Mrs. Hills said the Administration would try to resolve its dispute with India during the discussions.
The talks, being held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are scheduled to end later this year. India is considered a critical participant in the discussions, known as the Uruguay Round, because of its influence over other developing countries.
The White House had to decide by Saturday to decide whether to increase tariffs on Indian imports or impose other retaliatory trade sanctions because of India's refusal to negotiate the dispute.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Higher in Active Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Bond prices rose in active, volatile trading yesterday, as market participants shifted out of short-term securities and into bonds after figures on producer prices were released.
The numbers, which showed that prices at the wholesale level rose by three-tenths of a percent in May, were basically in line with projections by analysts. As a result, hopes that the Federal Reserve Board might move to ease monetary policy soon were all but snuffed out.
''After the weakness in the retail sales figures, there were some people who thought the Fed might ease early,'' a government bond trader said. 
 
No Surprising Weakness
''But the producer price number didn't show any surprising weakness, and as a consequence the market's perception has shifted,'' the trader added. ''Unless the consumer price numbers on Friday are way down, the market seems to be of the conviction that the Fed won't move between now and the end of the quarter.''
Joe Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc., said the producer price figures ''were just what the market expected, but were not what the market was hoping for.''
Nevertheless, on a year-over-year basis, the price of finished goods through May have only risen by 3.1 percent, Mr. Liro said.
''That is a very reassuring performance,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, most of the problems we have with inflation are on the service side of the economy, a side we will see in the consumer price figures.''
Most analysts are projecting that consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths to three-tenths of a percent last month. The figures are expected to be released today.
Although the producer price figures were a disappointment, a big drop in gold prices and a steep decline in the commodities included in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures prices helped to increase market psychology yesterday.
 
Market Vulnerability Seen
Still, some of the traders said the recent run-up in prices, which had occurred without a sign from the Fed that it was about to ease monetary policy, might have gone too far.
''The market is vulnerable to bad news at these levels,'' another trader said. ''If we get a bad consumer price number, we could have a pronounced selloff.''
Testifying before Congress yesterday, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, gave no indication of the course of monetary policy, but he did say that interest rates could fall ''significantly'' should a credible Federal budget package be passed.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks had little noticeable effect on prices in the credit markets.
With the Fed apparently still on hold, most of yesterday's price gains were recorded among longer maturities.
A decision by the central bank to ease monetary policy by lowering its target for the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market would have more of an impact on short-term interest rates that tend to fluctuate relative to the funds rate than on long-term interest rates. 2020 Bonds Fall to 8.34% By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 104 15/32, up by 13/ 32, to yield 8.34 percent, down from a yield of 8.37 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 25/32, up by 5/32, to yield 8.29 percent. And 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/2, up by 1/32, to yield 8.21 percent. Treasury bill rates dipped slightly. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.65 percent in late trading, down by a basis point, or hundredth of a point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late-offered rate of 7.55 percent.
 
Dow Unit's Debentures
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Dow Capital B.V., an offshore financing subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Corporation, offered $200 million in 20-year debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by Salomon Brothers Inc.
The 9.20 percent debentures, which mature on June 1, 2010, were priced at 100, 85 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent debentures at pricing.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
New York State Offering
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, New York State's Metropolitan Transportation Authority priced a $299 million issue of Transit and Commuter Facilities Service bonds through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company.
The issue consists of serial bonds from 1992 to 2002, and three term bonds that mature in 2008, 2016 and 2019.
Coupons on the serial bonds range from 6.40 percent in 1992 to 7.50 percent in 2002.
The 7 3/8 percent term bonds of 2008 were priced to yield 7.524 percent; the 7 1/2 percent term bonds of 2016 were priced to yield 7.724 percent, and the 6 percent bonds of 2019 were priced to yield 7.571 percent.
Investment bankers familiar with the transaction said that demand for the issue was strong from retail and institutional accounts, and that the issue was oversubscribed.
The bonds are rated A by Moody's and BBB-plus by Standard & Poor's.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve said yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week that ended on June 4.

Cable TV Rate Found Rising Twice as Fast as Price Index

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
A Government study of the cable television industry released yesterday showed that rates for the lowest-priced basic cable service last year rose more than twice as fast as the Consumer Price Index. The report is expected to add to the momentum for cable re-regulation under way in the House and the Senate.
''This report should remove any lingering doubt for the need to move forward with legislation, and I intend to do so,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House panel that commissioned the report. ''America's cable consumers want action.'' 
The lowest-priced service refers to the broadcast networks and any other services that the cable operators may choose to include.
 
Response From Industry
The National Cable Television Association, an industry organization, said in a statement yesterday that the average revenues for each cable subscriber had risen by about 5 percent last year, or by about the same rate as inflation. It added that the rate of cable increases for the basic services had leveled off in 1989, from a total increase of about 29 percent for the two previous years.
A subscriber's monthly bill often includes pay services like Home Box Office, as well the broadcast signals and advertiser-supported services like ESPN and Cable News Network.
Since the industry was deregulated in 1984, cable operators have generally raised the prices of those basic services faster than the price of the pay services. Thus an average subscriber bill that included pay services would rise less rapidly than the prices for basic cable services.
But the cable reregulation bill in the Senate and the draft legislation in the House focus on some form of controlling the price of the most basic cable services rather than the pay services.
 
Seeking More Data
The initial report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, covered 1987 and 1988. The new data also look at 1984 to 1989 and show that the rates for the lowest-priced basic cable service rose by 68 percent, while the Consumer Price Index rose by a total of 23.7 percent in the period.
After the first G.A.O. report, ''The industry contended that price increases were only a result of a pent-up need for additional revenues,'' Mr. Markey said. ''In order to get a better profile, we went back to 1984,'' he added. ''We found a consistent pattern that showed that consumers were being charged double what they pay for all other consumer goods.''
The study showed that during 1989 the monthly rates for the least expensive basic cable service rose to $15.95 per subscriber, from $14.50.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Slow Growth Projected for Spending

BYLINE: By Randall Rothenberg

 BODY:
A LEADING advertising industry forecaster predicted yesterday that growth in advertising spending in the United States would continue at a sluggish pace through 1990, dragged down primarily by a recession in local ad spending.
But the analyst, Robert J. Coen of McCann-Erickson, pointed to signs of underlying strength and projected a healthy rebound next year.
Advertisers will spend $130.44 billion in the United States this year, an increase of only 5.3 percent over the $123.9 billion they spent in 1989, said Mr. Coen, a senior vice president and director of forecasting at McCann.
The growth rate represents a slight improvement over last year, when advertising spending rose only 5 percent over 1988. But Mr. Coen's projection was almost a full percentage point lower than the forecast he had made in December. 
By contrast, ad spending rose an average of 10 percent a year from 1983 to 1988.
Mr. Coen's gaze into advertising's crystal ball has become a semiannual fixture in the ad industry. Yesterday, the rumpled 66-year-old executive addressed a hall full of securities analysts and journalists at the University Club in New York, a far cry from the ''no more than 10 people'' who he said had attended his first effort at public prognostication 17 years ago.
Mr. Coen saw little but gloom for media dependent on local advertising. Newspapers showed an increase of only 2.7 percent in retail advertising revenue in the first quarter of 1990, almost two percentage points below the growth rate in the period last year. And local television advertising showed serious declines in several important categories, with automobile dealers reducing their spending by 21 percent and department stores by 13 percent from the first quarter of last year.
''It's just a desperate retail market in many parts of the United States,'' Mr. Coen said. He said he expected total local advertising spending to increase only 4.7 percent this year, to $57.54 billion - far less than the 6.2 percent increase he projected for the year only six months ago.
For national advertising, Mr. Coen painted a brighter picture, predicting that it would increase by 5.7 percent over last year, to $72.89 billion.
Ad spending on network television, he noted, has been healthy, up 14 percent in the first three months of 1990.
Mr. Coen attributed the growth partly to a leveling off in the use of 15-second commercials, which accounted for 31 percent of all network commercials during a sample week in April, down from 35 percent of the total in a sample week in April 1989. Thirty-second commercials, which accounted for 61 percent of the total last year, made up 66 percent of the mix in this year's sampling.
The increase in 30-second commercials means fewer total spots are available for national advertisers to reach a mass audience, thus allowing the networks to charge more for the smaller supply.
Cable television and national syndicated television advertising continued their strong growth, up 18 percent and 32 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of this year, Mr. Coen said.
The national advertising outlook was not rosy for all media. Magazine ad pages were down 4 percent in January, February and March, and revenues rose only 1 percent. But Mr. Coen pointed out that two large categories - cigarette companies, which lowered their spending by 26 percent, and automobile makers, which cut magazine budgets by 7 percent - accounted for most of the problem.
Other product categories are maintaining strong ad spending, the McCann executive said, lending support to a generally optimistic forecast for the ad industry. He noted, for example, that food advertisers had increased their network television spending by 18 percent and their magazine spending by 11 percent in the first quarter of 1990 compared with the 1989 quarter.
''If you look at these numbers, you'd never think we're in an advertising recession,'' Mr. Coen said, taking issue with recent articles about the ad industry's slump.
For these reasons, Mr. Coen said he expected domestic ad spending to increase 7.5 percent in 1991, to $140 billion. Overseas, advertising spending will grow 5.1 percent this year, to $133.8 billion, he predicted. But that spending, too, should rise 7.5 percent next year, to $144 billion, he said.
The McCann executive's promising projections were supported by at least one analyst present. ''Ad spending in leading media is very healthy,'' said Alan J. Gottesman of Paine Webber. ''I'm more optimistic than Bob.''

HEADLINE: Rohatyn Proposes a Bailout Tax

 BODY:
Felix G. Rohatyn, the Wall Street investment banker, yesterday proposed a 5 percent surcharge on Federal income taxes to pay for the bailout of the savings and loan industry.
The surcharge would raise $25 billion to $35 billion a year for three or four years, roughly covering the estimated $100 billion to $130 billion cost of the bailout, he said in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. If the cost of the bailout turns out to be much greater, the surcharge should be extended, he said. 
Mr. Rohatyn, who played a major role in restoring New York City's financial health in the 1970's, said the surcharge was a better solution than the Administration's current approach of borrowing the billions of dollars needed to reimburse depositors of failed savings and loan associations.
''Borrowing the money will turn a $130 billion problem into a $500 billion drain - or much more -over the next 20 to 30 years, leaving it to our children to pay off our own stupidity,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. The difference in the figures reflects the interest the Government will have to pay on the borrowed money.
Mr. Rohatyn, who is still chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York as well as a partner at the Lazard Freres & Company investment firm, agreed with many economists that the bailout was essentially a transfer payment from the bank accounts of lenders and taxpayers to the bank accounts of depositors.
Such transfers do not shrink the pool of money available to borrowers. They are ''not neutral, however, from a regional point of view,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. Since most of the failed savings and loans are in the Southwest and West, there will be an ''economic drain from the Northern and central parts of the country,'' he argued.

HEADLINE: Chamorro to Cut Army by a Third, With Sandinista General's Assent

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, June 15

 BODY:
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua announced today that she had ordered a one-third reduction in the size of the Nicaraguan Army, the biggest force in Central America and the most powerful political weapon in the arsenal of the opposition Sandinista Front.
She said the reduction, from 61,000 soldiers to 41,000, was to be completed by Aug. 3, a hundred days after her inauguration on April 25.
Mrs. Chamorro also said she had ordered the creation of an all-volunteer army, and that all draftees were to be discharged by Dec. 7.
 
Army Chief Backs Reductions
''I want a sacred Nicaragua, which instead of burying its sons in a war between brothers will forever bury its arms so that the cannons will never roar again,'' Mrs. Chamorro said in a speech. ''I will never rest until this dream is a reality.'' 
Her audience included the army Chief of Staff, Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, who was Defense Minister in the Sandinista Government that governed Nicaragua for a decade. In response to questions after the President's announcement, General Ortega endorsed her proposals.
General Ortega, who will remain in his post, said the army had already been cut by about a third since the year began, when it numbered almost 97,000 soldiers. He said more cuts would help the budget and lead to a more professional armed forces. General Ortega is the brother of Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the former President and Sandinista leader.
''The quality of the E.P.S., its efficiency, its professionalism won't be lost,'' he said, using the initials for Ejercito Popular Sandinista, or Sandinista People's Army, the force's formal name. ''On the contrary, they're going to be improved.''
Mrs. Chamorro announced the plan before flying here for the opening of a regional summit meeting in Antigua, Guatemala, near Guatemala City. The Presidents of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica are also to take part in the three-day meeting, and the Panamanian President will attend as an observer.
Sandinista resistance to Mrs. Chamorro had already manifested itself in a strike last month by Sandinista-dominated civil servants' unions, who forced the Government to make sizable concessions on wages. Many people speculated that the reversal would lead Mrs. Chamorro to move slowly on her previously announced plan to cut the military for fear of provoking another confrontation.
President Chamorro's plan is a vital step in resolving a paradox that has often seemed to overwhelm her seven-week administration: how to promote national reconciliation in Nicaragua while erasing the vestiges of Sandinista power.
The Nicaraguan contra rebels had refused to lay down their American-supplied weapons until the Nicaraguan Army was demobilized. But the Sandinistas, who were defeated by Mrs. Chamorro's opposition coalition in elections in February, insisted that the rebels be disarmed before they agreed to any reduction in the army.
 
Deal to Disarm Contras
The stalemate, which threatened to lead to renewed warfare, was broken late last month when Mrs. Chamorro concluded days of bargaining by agreeing to give the rebels an isolated, Massachusetts-sized tract in the sparsely settled southeastern corner of the country in exchange for their demobilization. She said today that more than 14,000 rebels had demobilized.
About 2,000 are still to hand in their guns. But rebel leaders have promised to bring a definitive end to a decade of civil war, which claimed more than 30,000 lives, by surrendering all their remaining heavy weapons before the end of the month.
The rebels' demobilization paved the way for Mrs. Chamorro to order cuts in the army, which has a large pro-Sandinista majority in the ranks and officer corps.
Despite the cuts, Nicaragua will retain a much larger army than either of its two neighbors. While Costa Rica makes do with a police force, Honduras's poorly trained armed forces number less than 25,000 and are considered no match for even a slimmed-down Nicaraguan force. El Salvador maintains a 57,000-member military, but it is engaged in a bitter civil war with leftist rebels and has vowed to reduce the army to about 15,000 when a peace treaty is signed.
 
Hint of Future Military Cuts
Mrs. Chamorro's plan appears similar to one drawn up by General Ortega, the architect of the Sandinista military. But aides to the President indicated that she had advanced the schedule for the reductions.
In her announcement, the President hinted that she would order further cuts, possibly even the elimination of the army, sometime in the future.
''A Central America in peace, in democracy, where all conflicts are resolved by the way of dialogue, doesn't need armies,'' she said.
Discussion at the regional summit meeting is expected to focus on demilitarization and establishing a common market to invigorate the economies of the area.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is to arrive from Washington on Sunday for the final day of the meeting.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Growth in California Makes State a Testing Ground

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 15

 BODY:
The vibrant prosperity of California has drawn and rewarded many waves of migrants, both American and foreign, but some see a gloomy alternative prospect if more is not done to absorb the state's fast-growing Hispanic work force.
Over the next 30 years, one vision goes, the Hispanic population will swell while the white baby boom generation retires. Failed by the schools and stuck in low-paying jobs, Hispanic youths will become frustrated and angry. Unable to find skilled labor, industry will flee and California's economy will crumble.
By the turn of the century most Latinos will live in squalid towns without paved roads or electricity and stagger under heavy taxes to support Social Security and other old-age benefits for retired whites, who will retreat into walled villages. 
While this outcome may be unlikely, it is not beyond the realm of possibility, says Prof. David Hayes-Bautista, a sociologist at the University of California at Los Angeles who fleshed out this pessimistic vision.
The increasingly insistent question is whether government, business, the schools and the Hispanic people themselves take the steps needed to educate Hispanic young people and integrate them into the American economy.
 
Mainly of Mexican Origin
Professor Hayes-Bautista says the Hispanic population here, mainly of Mexican origin, has many strengths, including strong family ties and a strong work ethic, that could help it rise from the underclass.
And Hispanic political aspirations got a powerful lift on June 4 when a Federal district judge ruled that the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors had to redraw their district lines to give Hispanic voters a larger voice.
But Professor Hayes-Bautista and others agree that much needs to be done. California, especially Southern California, is emerging as an early proving ground for the American multiracial future, the place where the theory that the Hispanic population will bear the burden of supporting an aging white population will get its first test.
''It is urgent that the state take an immediate and active role, morally and economically,'' said John Vasconcellos, chairman of the State Assembly's Ways and Means Committee, who oversees budget legislation and represents the San Jose area, now about one-third Hispanic. ''If not, we will end up without the capacity to sustain our economy.''
Similar trends are evolving in other states with large Hispanic populations, including Texas, Illinois and New York, where about 9 percent of the population is of Hispanic descent, mainly Puerto Rican. An exception is Florida, where Hispanic residents also make up about 9 percent of that state's population. But most of them are well-educated and affluent Cubans and South Americans.
Depending on immigration trends, the Hispanic population is variously projected to make up 35 to 45 percent of the population of California by the year 2030, up from 21 percent in 1985.
If this happens, Professor Hayes-Bautista estimates that Hispanic children will account for half of all the children in the state, while whites will make up nearly 60 percent of the elderly population. Thus, the number of dependent young and old people would rise from 499 for every 1,000 workers in 1985 to 602 for every 1,000 workers by the year 2030. And, if current trends persist, those workers will be increasingly confined to low-income jobs.
High Dropout Rate And White Flight This demographic transition is already well under way here. Cheap immigrant labor and services have temporarily buoyed the local economy. But nearly two of every five Hispanic youths drop out of high school in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where Hispanic students make up 62 percent of the enrollment.
The heavily Hispanic suburbs of Los Angeles, including Cudahy, Bell Gardens, Huntington Park, Lynwood, Southgate, Maywood and South El Monte, have absorbed a wave of newcomers from Mexico and Central America and are among the poorest in the country.
At the same time, the number of whites who have left Los Angeles County in the last decade, amid considerable resentment against the immigrants, is estimated at nearly half a million. Today only 15 percent of the public school students here are white.
While previous waves of immigrants from Europe and Asia have generally assimilated quickly, this American passage has been more problematic for the Hispanic newcomers. Their sheer numbers and their promixity to their homeland set Hispanic immigrants apart from other immigrant groups. Hispanic leaders like Sergio Munoz, editor of La Opinion in Los Angeles, the nation's largest Spanish language daily newspaper, say this contributes to the difficulty in assimilation.
The barrio here has spread far beyond its core on the East Side of Los Angeles. Once staid working-class neighborhoods that had been inhabited mostly by whites are now alive with the sights, sounds and smells of Latin America. There is still a J. C. Penney and a F. W. Woolworth store on Pacific Avenue in Huntington Park, but across the street is the Pescado Mojado (wet fish) Restaurant and Azteca Joyeria (jewelry), and La Casa del Video is nearby.
Families Struggle To Share the Dream In the modest bungalows behind the main streets, Mexican and Central American families struggle for a place in the American dream. Parents work long hours as gardeners or maids, or at sewing machines in sweat shops, and often watch their children join gangs and drop out of school. They are unsure if their troubles are rooted in their own failings or those of the system.
Rodolfo and Elvia Mendieta of Huntington Park, who came from Mexico City 14 years ago, are determined that their sons, Rudy, who is 10 years old, and Michael, 9, will receive good educations. But Mr. Mendieta, a supermarket worker who serves as president of the parents council at their children's school, deplores what he calls the Hispanic families' tradition of resignation to larger forces; few parents show up at parent meetings.
Juan Garcia, a 17-year-old from El Salvador who dropped out of 11th grade five months ago, called school ''a waste of time.'' And Andy Mendoza, 16, a native-born son of Mexican immigrants who wants to be an electrical engineer, said getting ahead is tough because whites ''think of us as low people.''
In Professor Hayes-Bautista's recent book, ''The Burden of Support: Young Latinos in an Aging Society'' (Stanford University Press, 1988), which he wrote with Werner O. Schink and Jorge Chapa, he says, ''Anglos must realize that their future economic well-being hinges on the productivity of a largely non-Anglo work force.''
Some see a broader danger. Juan F. Lara, director of the Latino Teacher Project at the Tomas Rivera Center, a research organization affiliated with the Claremont Graduate School, said the problem threatens not only ''a group of people who are not supporting the economy,'' but also ''the esthetic soul of a state.''
''What is threatened here is intellectual life, the arts, museums, symphonies,'' he said. ''How can you talk about preserving open space and establishing museums with a large undereducated underclass?''
There are few signs that California, driven in recent years by resistance to taxes and government spending, has begun to address these issues.
Once among the nation's leaders in public education, California has dropped to 48th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia in per capita spending on public schools. Los Angeles, for example, spends $3,500 a year for each student, less than half the amount spent in New York City. Even as Hispanic enrollments have grown, the number of certified bilingual teachers in Los Angeles has dropped - to 1,522 last year from 1,895 in 1985.
For the Children, A Critical Question Still, the prospects of Hispanic youths seem far brighter than those for blacks. Only minutes from the black precincts of South Central Los Angeles, the barrios - for all their poverty -hum with small businesses. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 66 percent of Mexican-American youths 20 to 24 years of age hold jobs, as against 54 percent of black youths. They earn 21 percent more than blacks, and there is a vibrant underground economy.
While the immigrant generation, which comes mainly from rural areas and speaks little English, is stuck in menial jobs, the critical question is whether their children and grandchildren have good prospects for joining the middle class.
Some have high ambitions. Zoila Gomez, a 17-year-old senior at Huntington Park High School, emigrated three years ago from El Salvador. She lives with her mother, who speaks no English and works in a clothing factory. Miss Gomez works after school at a Burger King to save money for college. But she says many of her classmates lack ambition. ''They just like to have fun and don't study or work hard to be someone,'' she said.
Many Hispanic youths here drop out in despair at their bleak job prospects. ''My friend graduated and he can't do nothing - so what's the point?'' said Juan Garcia, a Salvadoran who has worked part time at a McDonald's restaurant in Inglewood since dropping out of high school. ''White kids have opportunity because they've got parents who can pay for college.''
Many Mexican-American leaders, like Leticia Quezada, say the schools have failed to adapt. ''The system is designed to educate middle-class families of the 40's and 50's when mom stayed home and where it was assumed they were high school graduates who could help their children with school work, bake cookies and get involved with the P.T.A.,'' said Ms. Quezada, a Mexican-born woman who was elected in 1987 as the first Hispanic board member of the Los Angeles Unified School District.
Making Education A State Priority The troubles of Martha Casian, who migrated here from Mexico in 1968 and had three sons, illustrate the problem. One of her sons, Antonio, died last year at the age of 15 in what the police called a gang- and drug-related incident. Another son, Raul, 17, is in a juvenile detention camp for violating parole on possession of cocaine. Both sons dropped out of school. Her youngest, Oscar, 14, is still in school.
''Not the teachers, not the principal, not the police, no one ever told me my sons were not going to school,'' said Mrs. Casian, who has been hired as a community representative working with parents to keep their children in school.
Guadalupe Simpson, principal of Nimitz Junior High School in Huntington Park, says the frustrations are enormous. ''The parents are not aware of how to deal with the system,'' she said. ''They don't understand middle-class values. Education is not a priority. But it's also the low expectations of teachers, starting in elementary shcool. And we don't really get the support we need. California and the nation don't have education as a priority.''
Others say the picture is not as bleak as it seems.
Kevin F. McCarthy of the Rand Corporation, citing 1980 census data, contends that Hispanic school enrollment for second-generation students approaches that of the California norm and that the alarming dropout figures are largely a function of new immigration. ''I do not agree with the notion of a permanent underclass,'' he said. ''That is much too pessimistic.''
But few Hispanic leaders share that view, and their arguments are beginning to impress the business establishment. Already having difficulty finding qualified employees, business leaders have made education a top legislative priority.
For his part, Professor Hayes-Bautista has another, more optimistic vision. A recent survey he took suggests that Californians are becoming more sensitive to Hispanic needs. He hopes substantial investments are made over the next 15 to 20 years as Hispanic and white leaders join to pass a health insurance program that provides both for maternal and child health and geriatric care.
By the year 2030, his optimistic vision goes, American economic policy will have brought economic stability to Latin America, and California will have emerged as the paradigm of the ''happy fusion'' of diverse cultural elements.

HEADLINE: BUSH AIDE OPPOSES SANCTIONS ON IRAQ

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
While strongly criticizing the Iraqi Government for its human rights record and foreign policy, a senior Bush Administration official urged Congress today to resist growing sentiment among legislators to apply economic sanctions against the Government of President Saddam Hussein.
The official, John H. Kelly, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, said sanctions would worsen the American trade deficit without furthering United States interests in the Middle East.
''It would be the American farmer and the American exporter who would, in effect, be punished,'' he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''The Iraqis would be able to purchase the same kinds of goods and products elsewhere on the world market.'' 
But Mr. Kelly faced sharp skepticism from Republican and Democratic members, who suggested that sanctions were necessary to demonstrate Washington's displeasure with Iraq's use of poison gas and torture against its citizens and with its threats to attack Israel with chemical weapons.
 
'To Send a Message'
''I think some type of sanctions are necessary to send a message,'' said Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas. ''It would hurt wheat sales in Kansas, that's true. But sometimes we have to stand up and be counted.''
She said ''it just makes me weep to think we are not doing more'' to protest Iraqi human rights violations.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who also testified before the committee, said, ''America should not subsidize a terrorist nation.'' Mr. D'Amato has introduced a bill, which appears to be gaining support in the Senate, that would impose trade sanctions on Iraq and end all grants, loans, credits, guarantees and insurance to it.
Iraq, which has the second-largest oil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia, is an important American trading partner. The United States buys an average of 447,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day, amounting to about $2 billion a year. Last year, the United States exported $1 billion in agricultural products, including rice, wheat and meat to Iraq. Iraq recently requested a $500 million payment guarantee from the Commodity Credit Corporation, an Agriculture Department agency that guarantees loan payments, enabling foreign purchasers of American products to obtain bank financing.

HEADLINE: Iranian Accord With Amoco Lifts a Barrier to U.S. Trade

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, June 15

 BODY:
Iran removed one of the biggest obstacles to a renewal of trade with the United States today by agreeing to pay an American oil company $600 million for installations seized in the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Two claims totaling $600 million were awarded to the oil conglomerate, Amoco, said an official of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. It was the biggest settlement in the arbitration body's nine years of activity. 
 
Total of $1.8 Billion in Claims
The Iranian Government recently suggested that a settlement of financial disputes with the United States might lead to the release of six American hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite militants in Lebanon.
Last month, the settlement of a much smaller claims package was announced shortly after the release of two American hostages, Robert Polhill and Frank H. Reed.
The Amoco settlement was among more than $1.8 billion in oil company claims stemming from the Islamic revolution in Iran led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
United States-Iranian ties were severed over the capture and detention of employees at the United States Embassy in Teheran for 444 days by Iranian militants.
At issue in the settlement today were two claims filed by Amoco subsidiaries against the National Iranian Oil Co., said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with tribunal policy.
The Amoco Iran Oil Co. is receiving $540 million in compensation for the seizure of four Persian Gulf drilling fields and an oil terminal on Kharg Island, the site of Iran's most important oil shipping facility.
The Amoco International Finance Corporation is to receive $60 million for the expropriation of a petrochemical processing plant on Kharg Island, the official said.
 
Iran Seeks to Improve Ties
Iran derives 90 percent of its foreign currency earnings from oil exports, and President Hashemi Rafsanjani has been making efforts recently to improve and expand trade with the West.
But he has faced strong opposition from Islamic militants who want nothing to do with the United States.
Until today, a $116 million award made in 1986 to Sedco, an oil-platform builder, had been the biggest single settlement by the tribunal since it was created in 1981, officials said.
The tribunal was set up as part of the 1980 Algiers agreement that helped win the freedom of the American hostages.
The panel has three American judges, three Iranians and three third-nation members. So far it has settled $3.2 billion in government-to-government and private claims.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe: Moscow Journal From Black (or Red) Market to White

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 15

 BODY:
While all about the Kremlin Mikhail S. Gorbachev's planners and worriers puzzle about the fallen Soviet economy as if it were Humpty Dumpty, Gennadi M. Poleshuk has quietly sold this city government on creating an oasis of capitalism called the white market.
He has convinced the city of Moscow to put its blessing on his plan to create a commodities exchange, and he is enlisting all manner of barterers and twilight entrepreneurs to come in out of the black market to this aboveboard counterpart.
''This happened all over the world several thousand years ago,'' he said of the idea of a commodities exchange, a convenient trading place to speed and organize supply and demand. ''We have to do it here all over again.'' 
While Mr. Gorbachev and the alarmed Congress hesitate daily in groping for some grand plan to re-energize the economy, uncounted individuals like Mr. Poleshuk, a joint-venture entrepreneur in the wily world of Moscow construction, are moving forward on their own and trying to bypass the Kremlin's gridlocked central-planning process with touches of de facto capitalism.
In this case, the new insurgent Mayor of Moscow, Gavriil K. Popov, is avidly encouraging their efforts, promising real estate and technical help to the commodities market since he has long been one of the nation's leading free-market economists.
 
Visited New York Exchange
After four months of study, a mouth-watering visit to the New York Stock Exchange and promises of help from the new insurgent city government, Mr. Poleshuk has begun enlisting the hundreds of colleagues he knows from the ''dark alley'' reality of the Soviet economy.
This is exemplified by his friend with a truckload of timber who must now grope informally among his business acquaintances until he finds the man with the truckload of cement or wiring that he urgently needs for some enterprise. Commodity swaps like this, and variations that lately include some deal-sweetening hard currency or reliable promises of needed future commodities, are increasingly the case among the hardier Soviet entrepreneurs.
It is all uncontrolled and unofficial, but it is the real way of life being used as a way around both the plummeting ruble and the drifting Government in these hard times.
''Most Soviet people think the exchange is a place where the sharks of the Stock Exchange gather to make plans to buy politicians and dictate to them to rob the working people,'' said Mr. Poleshuk, who obviously enjoys playing the party heretic. Will He Make It? Those watching throughout the world with the great cliche on their lips - Will Gorbachev make it? -might just as well ask whether no-less-driven individuals like Mr. Poleshuk will make it. He is part of Mr. Gorbachev's unsought cadre of entrepreneurial dreamers and schemers who can no longer wait for the giant rusty mechanism of central planning to catch up with the outside world.
A commodities market is one of the most ambitious plans to be broached. There is no predicting how well it might operate in the current vacuum of worn-out socialism. But Mr. Poleshuk said that at a minimum it would be fairer and more thorough than the current black market of trading and would begin introducing common values and a reliable rate of exchange between dollar and ruble to help prod the Kremlin toward the convertible ruble and a full place in the world market.
Mr. Poleshuk said various business-minded circles around the country were already far enough ahead of the Kremlin economists to be talking of creating an association of commodity exchanges in a dozen cities within the next 18 months. In contrast, Kremlin planners, facing the new problem of angry public opposition, talk of setting up a centrally regulated but somehow more open market within five years.
''We will have an island of the free market,'' Mr. Poleshuk said of his project, noting that the last commodity exchanges in this nation were abandoned in 1925 along with Lenin's experimental plan for retaining limited free-market conveniences. ''Those were state-regulated, but we are forming our own exchange as a share-holding association,'' he said, describing his plan for organization and regulations by the traders themselves.
 
Training With Western Help
He hopes to have a fledgling exchange operating by this fall, expecting, he says, three billion rubles worth of exchanges in the first year, about $200 million at the present black-market rate of the ruble.
He is recruiting a staff of 30 to 40 workers who are to be trained with the benefit of Western help. But he is still searching for a critical key -fast, reliable communications equipment to collect trading orders and replace the present primitive broker method of surreptitious, serendipitous gossip.
''Now the exchanges take place in dark alleys,'' said Mr. Poleshuk, who hopes for involvement by both Western and Eastern foreign businesses, and so has hired an American management consultant, Danielle S. Downing, who is fluent in Russian and Chinese.
''I am a pragmatist,'' Mr. Poleshuk said in explaining how he has evolved from being a young believing member of the Communist Party to a rampant capitalist. ''We are not reinventing the wheel. We are finally trying to get it spinning fast as possible.''

HEADLINE: Detroit Basketball Celebration Turns Violent

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 15

 BODY:
Basketball fans' spontaneous celebrations of the Detroit Pistons' league championship degenerated early today into violence, vandalism, looting and eight deaths.
In the wake of the Pistons' title-clinching victory in Portland, Ore., on Thursday night, scores were injured by gunfire, stabbings and fighting; 35 were arrested; numerous instances of looting were reported; cars were overturned, and police and emergency vehicles were damaged.
The authorities were not sure how many of the casualties could be directly attributed to the celebrations. But the night was clearly an extraordinarily violent one for an already violent city. 
 
Four Killed by Car
In the most lethal incident, which the police described as a hit-and-run, a man from Warren, Mich., drove his car into a group of people who had gathered to celebrate on an East Side street. Four people were killed, three of them children, and one was injured.
Elsewhere, two other pedestrians, one of them a 4-year-old boy, were killed by cars during street celebrations; a 21-year-old reveler died in a fall from the roof of an apartment building, and a 19-year-old man was killed when someone fired into a parking lot jammed with celebrators.
The outbreaks of violence began soon after the nationally televised game ended about midnight, Detroit time, when throngs of pedestrians and motorists took to the city's streets, shouting ''Pistons!'' and ''We're No. 1!''
What followed was reminiscent of the riot that broke out here after the 1984 World Series, won by the Detroit Tigers, when bottles were thrown, the police were attacked and stores were destroyed. Unlike this morning's mayhem, however, that violence was not accompanied by any deaths.
 
Pride in Detroit's Teams
Partly because Detroit's image has been shaped for more than a decade by economic ruin, its sport teams have been regarded by residents as a special source of pride and self-respect. Joy in this pride mixed early today with the violence that is part of the daily fabric of urban life here: for the last few years, more than 600 people have been murdered annually in Detroit and thousands more injured in shootings, one of the highest rates of violent crime in the nation.
So to some extent there was a banality in what happened this morning, and it was apparent today. By dawn, there was little evidence of the mayhem except for some broken glass and brisk activity at the county morgue. Under an intense sun and powder-blue skies, the city was filling up with spectators for the Detroit Grand Prix automobile race, which is to be run on downtown streets during the weekend.
Few people walking city streets seemed to be aware that there had been any disturbance at all. In fact, a party atmosphere was building again, as concessionaires blew up balloons and sold hot dogs.

HEADLINE: A Boost for Both Countries

 BODY:
Remove trade barriers between the U.S. and Mexico: it's a good idea that the United States has long favored. Now President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico accepts the idea. By agreeing, Congress can bring more jobs and cheaper consumer goods to both countries. 
Yet opposition groups are already lobbying Congress. Organized labor and manufacturers of textiles and steel will oppose an agreement. So will politicians who regard all bilateral trade pacts as violations of Washington's commitment to nondiscriminatory trade rules.
Some of the criticism is valid, but none is overwhelming. The benefits of free trade far outweigh the costs. Mexico and the U.S. are on the right track.
Free trade would help Mexico by attracting U.S. capital, thereby creating desperately needed jobs. And Mexican consumers would enjoy a broader array of high-quality imports. These benefits would do little to discourage the flow of illegal immigrants to the North, as President Salinas contends. But everyday life would be less harsh.
The U.S. will also gain from freer trade. Employment would rise in high-tech export industries, and low-cost Mexican textile, steel and oil products would pour into U.S. markets.
There would also be losers in both countries. In Mexico, inefficient manufacturers will learn to compete or wither. In the U.S., textile and steel workers will be forced to scramble for new jobs at lower wages. But the job loss prospect is exaggerated. U.S. tariffs and quotas would eventually be eliminated as part of ongoing negotiations among the U.S. and its major trading partners. And this country can afford to provide its jobless with generous assistance.
Also exaggerated is organized labor's cry that freer trade would induce U.S. employers to abandon this country in order to exploit cheap Mexican wages and unsafe working conditions. The only U.S. wages that will suffer are those earned by workers in protected industries. These wage premiums are borne by American consumers. Otherwise, high U.S. wages reflect high productivity and are unthreatened by investment in Mexico.
Organized labor has a stronger case when it calls for stricter labor standards in Mexico. With the two economies increasingly interwined, it is appropriate to insist that Mexican employers provide safe, humane conditions.
Bilateral trade pacts can victimize innocent trading partners. If the U.S. grants tariff reductions only to Mexico, Brazil won't have an equal chance to sell its textiles. That's why universal trade rules are preferable. Still, Mexico is special. The common border justifies a bilateral relationship like the one negotiated last year with Canada.
Special interests are already hammering Congress to reject free trade with Mexico. Caving in would hurt both countries.

HEADLINE: Praising Mandela, Dinkins Shakes Fragile Coalition

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
For David N. Dinkins, political tempests over the approaching visit of Nelson Mandela have proved again just how hard it is to hold together the tiles of the city that the Mayor never tires of calling a gorgeous mosaic.
By yesterday, before it had even begun, an occasion that the Mayor has promoted as a celebration of freedom had brought to his doorstep bitter debate on topics from the security of Israel to Puerto Rican nationalism to the tactics of the Irish Republican Army.
To Mr. Dinkins and millions of others, Mr. Mandela is a commanding figure of decency and dignity, who spent almost three decades imprisoned by the white Government of South Africa and who, since his release this year, has held talks with his former jailers aimed at finding a peaceful end to apartheid.
But for all his gray hair and lawyer's training, Mr. Mandela is also a revolutionary who refused upon his release to renounce armed struggle by the African National Congress, and who has expressed solidarity with other causes and figures, including Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
Welcoming that revolutionary is ''probably the greatest thing that will happen to me'' as New York's first black mayor, Mr. Dinkins has said. But in communicating that joy to his own delicate coalition, Mr. Dinkins - whose political rise was distinctly evolutionary - has angered some of those with whom his relations have been touchy.
Yesterday, in an exasperated outburst, Mr. Dinkins half apologized and half defended himself as reporters peppered him with questions about why he had called three Puerto Rican nationalists who shot five Congressmen in 1954 ''assassins.'' He had made the comment on the fly in a City Hall corridor on Thursday, when a reporter asked him about a report that the nationalists, now pardoned and living in Puerto Rico, were to be among those celebrating with Mr. Mandela at a rally in Harlem next week. ''I don't want to confuse in people's minds the wonder which is Nelson Mandela with any other involvement,'' he said then.
Yesterday, he issued a statement repeating that he did not condone the nationalists' attack on the House of Representatives chamber but could ''identify with and appreciate their yearning for economic justice and political freedom.''
But later, when he elaborated at a news conference, questions from Hispanic reporters came so fast and with so little ceremony that he finally said: ''I don't care if tomorrow's headlines say 'Dinkins walked out of press conference.' I don't care. But I am not going to have you interrupt while one of your colleagues is putting a question. If you don't respect me, at least respect the dignity of this office.''
The Mayor said he saw no parallel between the fight against apartheid, which he called slavery, and an attack on the Congress of the United States. He said American blacks, with their legacy of slavery, had not used such tactics.
This colloquy came just minutes after Mr. Dinkins signed a City Council bill naming a street corner outside the Federal jail in lower Manhattan for Joseph Doherty, an Irish Republican Army member who was convicted in the death of a British soldier in Northern Ireland. He has been held since escaping and entering this country illegally in 1983, although a Federal judge ruled that he was a political offender.
But Mr. Dinkins rejected comparisons with the Puerto Rican case, saying Mr. Doherty was ''acting as a soldier, killing another soldier in a war situation.''
 
'Sad and Unfortunate'
The Mayor's day began on a more conciliatory note, as Councilman Noach Dear and Assemblyman Dov Hikind of Brooklyn, who had threatened to protest Mr. Mandela's visit becuase he had likened the Palestinian cause to the anti-apartheid movement, said they would ''bend over'' in the name of unity and welcome him despite some differences.
Last week, after the protest threats, Mr. Dinkins broke his characteristic reserve, warning that demonstrations would be ''sad and unfortunate and tactically very, very unwise, because this man is an international symbol of freedom and especially so seen by persons of color.''
Mr. Dear seized on that and said Mr. Dinkins was seeking to stifle dissent, comparing it to calls for Jews to remain silent during World War II. But after Mr. Mandela assured American Jewish leaders at a meeting in Switzerland last weekend that he supported Israel's right to exist, and after Mr. Dear apologized to the Mayor for his Holocaust reference, Mr. Dinkins met with him and Mr. Hikind at Gracie Mansion.
The two later said they would protest only if P.L.O. representatives were invited to join in the celebration. But Rabbi Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale said he planned to hold a prayer vigil outside the Mayor's house on Tuesday, the evening before Mr. Mandela is to arrive.
 
'Fighters for Freedom
By day's end, things seemed a bit calmer.
Ruben Franco, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, said the Mayor's comments lacked sensitivity and a sense of history. Early in Mr. Dinkins's term, he faced criticism for not having appointed enough Hispanic commissioners.
''He doesn't recognize that to many people in Puerto Rico, these are fighters for freedom and justice, for liberation, just as is Nelson Mandela, who himself advocated bearing arms.''
But Mr. Franco said Mr. Dinkins's remarks should not overshadow his other efforts to help the Hispanic community.
Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi of Queens, who helped arrange the meeting between the Mayor and Mr. Hikind and Mr. Dear, said that ''since the Mayor has defined his own role in terms of bringing together the various national and ethnic and racial groups in a city that has the greatest diversity of people in the world, he has to be judged by how he succeeds.''
''So he is held to a higher standard,'' Mr. Hevesi said. ''That may be unfair. On the other hand, to this point, in my opinion, he has exceeded whatever standards people judging him might apply.''

HEADLINE: Florio Battling For Fiscal Plan In Radio Appeal

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 15

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio began an unusual radio campaign today to win the hearts and minds of middle-class voters in New Jersey as political pressures mounted for a crucial vote in the Legislature next week on his plans to raise taxes and drastically change the way state spends money on schoolchildren.
With some Democrats wavering, the state's largest teachers' union staged protests today against the Governor's school aid plan at 20 sites around the state, hoping to deal the new Democratic Governor his first legislative defeat after a string of victories.
The Governor's aides, however, cut a deal with an important Bergen County legislator Tuesday night; it would grant his and other Bergen districts millions of dollars in more aid. Later, administration officials said that that may have secured the victory. 
''Now I can support this thing,'' said Senator Gabriel M. Ambrosio, a Democrat from Lyndhurst, who said that at a dinner with Mr. Florio's two senior aides, Douglas C. Berman and Steven P. Perskie, he was satisfied with the Governor's plan. ''I can recommend it. It deals with my district in a fair and equitable way.''
 
Cigarettes Would Rise 23 Cents
The Legislature is considering two sets of proposals. The first, a $12 billion budget for the 1991 fiscal year, would require $1.3 billion in new sales taxes, including increased taxes on alcohol, paper products, soaps and janitorial services, and a new tax on cigarettes that would drive up the price of a pack by 23 cents. Under the state constitution, those bills have to be passed into law by midnight June 30.
The second package includes a new formula for school aid and a $1.2 billion rise in the income tax. The income tax increases, aimed mainly at upper-income New Jerseyans, would provide property tax rebates for middle-income and poor homeowners and renters. They would also finance a new system of school aid, which would shift state funds from more affluent to less affluent districts over five years.
Mr. Florio has said that his new fiscal policies are designed to aid ''the middle class,'' but politicians say it is probably unclear to most voters who, if anybody, is to benefit.
To explain Mr. Florio's policies as a boon to people of moderate incomes, Jon Shure, the Governor's director of communications, announced that the Democratic State Committee had spent $89,000 to broadcast a week of commercials on local radio stations.
''For too long, middle-class taxpayers have paid the freight,'' Mr. Florio says in one message. ''The Democrats and I are fighting to change that.''
Although radio commercials are a mainstay of electoral campaigns in New Jersey, they are rarely used for budget battles. The Republicans, however, took out advertisements in 7 newspapers last month denouncing Mr. Florio for raising taxes and announced plans for a $5,000 radio campaign.
Mr. Florio's opposition also comes from the usually pro-Democratic New Jersey Education Association, a union that staged demonstrations today at courthouses, legislators' offices and other public sites around the state.
Under the Florio school plan the state would shift more than $800 million in teachers' pension costs to local school districts, a move the union says would force many districts to raise property taxes or curtail programs. Mr. Florio says the change will help narrow the gap between what poor and rich districts spend on education.
In Hackensack, about 250 teachers, bearing placards with messages like ''Don't Punish Good Schools'' and ''Florio: Empty Promises,'' rallied outside the Bergen County Courthouse today.
Perhaps the most troubling resistance for Florio this week came from seven disaffected Democratic legislators from Bergen County, which would be hard hit by a combination of new taxes and cuts in school aid.
In a deal worked out with Senator Ambrosio on Tuesday, 12 school districts in Mr. Ambrosio's district, including Lyndhurst, North Arlington, Rutherford and Ridgefield, would receive a total of $6 million in additional school aid. Also, the administration agreed to provide an additional $20 million in municipal aid to densely populated communities with high costs of living.
An afternoon and evening of negotiations with Mr. Ambrosio was completed at Lorenzo's Cafe, a restaurant and bar where politicians are known to gather, and which one top Florio described, shortly after Mr. Ambrosio's departure, as the birthplace of many important public policy initiatives in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Show Modest Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose by two-tenths of 1 percent in May, the second straight month of modest inflation after a first-quarter surge that is now clearly seen to have been an aberration.
The moderation has been most evident in food, energy, shelter and clothing, the items that jumped most sharply early in the year largely as a result of very cold weather.
The latest inflation report, which followed by just one day another moderate report from the Labor Department on prices that American producers received for their goods last month, was also in line with expectations and was similarly reassuring.
Economists said it seemed increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve would be able by midsummer to spur the economy by easing credit, a luxury it has not enjoyed since just before Christmas. 'Two-Thirds of the Way' 
''We're probably two-thirds of the way to where we need to be to prove to the Fed that inflation is really calming down'' enough, said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the Pittsburgh National Bank.
At the same time, however, the dominant belief among economists and other analysts was that the improvement had about ended and that price increases had stabilized at a rate of perhaps just under 5 percent a year.
''We've probably bottomed out so far as the the low point in the Consumer Price Index is concerned,'' said Patrick C. Jackman, a Labor Department official. He pointed to firming prices for such items as meat, gasoline and tobacco products as likely to nudge the consumer inflation rate higher in coming months, with perhaps only clothing prices moving significantly lower.
The cost of health care continued to rise, climbing eight-tenths of 1 percent for the fourth straight month, resulting in a spurt of 9 percent over the last year. Over all, inflation in services has risen at an unsettling 5.6 percent annual rate over the last six months, up from 4.8 percent for the six months through November.
The Fed, which has a stated goal of reducing inflation from current levels, not just containing it, is considered in no hurry to cut interest rates so long as the economy continues to move ahead, however slowly. The latest official report on the nation's economic growth showed the gross national product rising at a sluggish 1.3 percent rate in the first quarter, and many economists believe that the second quarter could be still lower.
Both the stock and bond markets took the price report in stride, although bond prices did slump after the Fed reported that industrial production rose by six-tenths of 1 percent in May.
The consumer price report today showed that, excluding food and energy, which are subject to wide price swings, the index rose three-tenths of 1 percent, slightly higher than in April but well under a jump of seven-tenths in March. Restaurant Meals Rise Food prices at grocery stores moved down in May by two-tenths of 1 percent as declines for fresh fruits and vegetables and for dairy products were not entirely offset by increases for cereal, meat and poultry. But restaurant meals and alcoholic beverages moved up smartly and pushed the overall food and beverage component up by one-tenth of 1 percent.
Housing, the most heavily weighted item, rose two-tenths of 1 percent as fuels declined by less than in April and charges rose for cable television, trash collection, home furnishings and maintenance.
Transportation costs fell two-tenths of 1 percent as gasoline prices rose by less than normal for May, resulting in a 1.6 percent decline after seasonal adjustment, and finance charges also subsided. However, airline fares and public transportation continued to rise, and the price of used cars increased for the first time since November.
Clothing prices moved down by five-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting larger than usual cuts on women's and girls' wear, but the broader apparel and maintenance category moved down somewhat less than this after soaring in February and March and being about unchanged in April.
Entertainment rose by two-tenths of 1 percent and ''other'' goods and services jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent, the latter reflecting big increases for legal and financial services and for tuitions at business and technical schools.
Before rounding, the price index covering all urban consumers rose 0.1549187 percent, a rate that if maintained and compounded for 12 months would mean inflation of 1.9 percent a year. This was the second straight month in which the index came close to being reported as one-tenth of 1 percent instead of two-tenths.
 
Drop for New York Area
Among the five metropolitan areas for which price data are reported monthly, New York posted a drop of one-tenth of 1 percent. Consumer prices in Chicago were unchanged, while San Francisco, Philadelphia and Los Angeles had increases of one-tenth, two-tenths and three-tenths, respectively.
The price index now stands at 129.2, which means that a group of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-84 base period now costs $12.92.
A companion index, covering all urban wage earners and clerical workers, rose one-tenth of 1 percent in May. This index, often used as the standard for contractual price escalators, now stands 4.1 percent higher than a year ago.

HEADLINE: Import Fall Narrows Trade Gap

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
As a softer economy cut demand for imports, the trade deficit fell 17 percent in April, to $6.94 billion, the Commerce Department reported today. It was the second-lowest level in more than six years.
Declines of about $1 billion each in purchases of foreign cars and oil contributed to a 6.2 percent drop in total imports, to $39.25 billion.
Exports, which had posted a new monthly record in March, fell back by a lesser 3.5 percent in April, to $32.31 billion, chiefly reflecting weaker sales of telecommunications equipment, computers and aircraft engines. But exports are still at their second-highest monthly level. 
 
Viewed as Good News
Substantially lower than many economists had projected, the April imbalance continues a pattern of improvement in place since 1987 and was generally viewed as good news for the economy.
''We're almost in the position that Japan was in five years ago,'' said Kenneth T. Mayland, chief economist of the Society National Bank of Cleveland. ''Our exports are really roaring.''
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said, ''I cannot be more pleased with the latest report.'' While cautioning against the volatility of monthly trade numbers, he added that he was ''as confident as I can be'' that this year's deficit will fall to the low 90 billions, compared with $109 billion in 1989 and $118.5 billion in 1988.
 
Declines in Sales Cited
But much of the improvement in the trade report reflected the weaker economy, which has curbed the appetite for foreign as well as domestic products. ''Auto sales are down sharply and retail sales have fallen for three months running,'' said Kathleen B. Cooper, chief economist for the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.
Earlier this year, the consensus had been that the trade deficit might not improve this year and could even worsen.
Many economists now agree with Mr. Mosbacher that the deficit will again decline. The sluggish consumer spending - shrinking demand for foreign cars, television sets and other products - along with better-than-expected exports of manufactured goods, responding to productivity growth and changes in exchange rates, account for the revised view.
It was thanks almost exclusively to export expansion that the overall output of goods and services managed a small annual rate of gain of 1.3 percent in the first quarter's gross national product.
The persistent strength of exports into the second quarter, said James Annable, chief economist of the First National Bank of Chicago, suggested that the economy would continue to grow in the range of 1 to 2 percent.
The trade figures were welcome news for the Administration, which has been worried that the economy would slip into a recession this election year. In recent months, from President Bush on down, officials have been letting the Federal Reserve Board know they want easier money.
 
'Credit Crunch' Seen
Mr. Mosbacher stepped up the pressure on Thursday when he told a Senate Banking Committee hearing that the economy was experiencing a ''credit crunch.''
''We get business people in every day in Commerce and particularly those middle and smaller business people who say there is a terrible problem getting any kind of loans and credits,'' he said.
The Federal Reserve and most bankers say there is no ''credit crunch.'' The Banking Committee intends to hold a hearing next week to address the issue.
The April trade gap compared with $8.37 billion in March and was the smallest since the $6.10 billion deficit of last February, itself the smallest since the $5.7 billion shortfall in December 1983. 20 Percent Decline in Oil Much of the improvement in April came from a 20 percent drop in oil imports, to $3.75 billion, reflecting both a fall in the volume of shipments and the price. The 226 million barrels imported in April were 35 million barrels less than in March. The average price in April was $16.57, against $18.18 in March.
Oil could skew the trade numbers in the future. ''We're unlikely to get anywhere near that kind of improvement in coming months,'' said Richard E. Rippe, senior vice president and chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds.
But economists also took heart from the fact that the non-petroleum trade deficit was falling faster than the overall deficit, which was seen as another sign of the strength in exports of manufactured goods.
Over the first four months of this year, the trade deficit, on an annualized basis excluding petroleum, dropped to $39.6 billion from $62.1 billion in the comparable 1989 period and $89.7 billion in 1988, according to Commerce Department calculations.
 
Gap With Japan Wider
More than half the total trade deficit in April was with Japan. The imbalance widened by 10 percent, to nearly $4 billion, mainly because of falling exports. Both Tokyo and Washington continue to argue over measures that Japan has promised to take to open its markets.
With the European Community, the United States in recent months has actually been running a surplus. This widened in April by more than 30 percent, to $1.4 billion, chiefly reflecting a drop in imports.
The trade accounts with the nation's largest trading partner, Canada, were nearly in balance. A March deficit of $30 million was pared to $8.3 million.
With China, the deficit widened from $581 million to $614 million. China recently won an extension by the Bush Administration of most-favored-nation trade status, giving it the lowest available tariffs.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
'Junk Bond' Funds Seem to Glimmer

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
''Junk Bond'' funds, after a bruising first quarter, seem to be on the mend. And with high-yield, high-risk funds making money in the last couple of months, instead of losing it, more investors are buying fund shares than redeeming them.
Is this a good idea? Has the junk market as a whole hit bottom, so that investors can now buy low and share in its recovery, or will there be more situations similar to that involving Donald Trump's casinos, with junk bonds plunging after a missed interest payment? Market professionals can make a persuasive case that there are indeed opportunities in junk, and yields are attractive -13 to 15 percent, even in the better funds. Still, independent financial advisers are cautious. 
Kenneth T. Urbaszewski, senior vice president of Kemper Financial Services and co-manager of the Kemper High Yield Fund, which was ranked No. 1 of 94 fixed-income funds by Lipper Analytical Services for all of the 1980's, said, ''The prices are low, the yields high - this market should appeal to everyone.''
He would put up to a quarter of a portfolio into high-yield funds, depending on risk tolerance. ''The market is very attractive versus stocks,'' he said. He said the Dow Jones industrial average would have to reach 3,400 to match the return on junk funds.
In March 1989, Mr. Urbaszewski, whose fund has a 4.5 percent ''load,'' or up-front fee, had a third of his funds in cash, which helped over the next year, he said. ''Now we think the opposite - we think the market is attractive, and we are trying to minimize cash.''
''The worst scenario I can imagine is the return would be the same as on a Treasury,'' he said, which would happen if 10 percent of the bonds in a junk portfolio defaulted. Last year defaults in the overall market were 4 percent, but a portfolio manager's goal is to avoid the issues likely to default.
Mr. Urbaszewski, who forecasts a 15 percent total return - income plus capital appreciation -over the next 12 years, said: ''We don't buy the highest-yielding bonds. We look at the expected total return.'' He holds 160 bonds of 101 issuers, and relies on a staff of eight credit analysts to scrutinize the bonds. The junk market is thinly traded and transaction costs are high, he noted. One way to keep total return up is to minimize turnover.
Mark Vaselkiv, vice president of T. Rowe Price Associates, the Baltimore-based manager of no-load mutual funds, and an analyst in its high-yield department, also sees ''a compelling investment opportunity for aggressive investors.''
Even conservative investors could put 20 percent of their bond portfolios into high-yield funds, he suggested, to leaven an 80 percent Treasury portfolio yielding 8 to 8.5 percent. Then they will have an overall yield above 9 percent.
''It's a risky market,'' Mr. Vaselkiv acknowledged, ''but it seems to have turned with Drexel out of the picture. We're starting to see buyers who were traditional equity players.'' The T. Rowe Price High-Yield Fund had a total return of 2 percent in May in contrast to a negative 5 percent total return in the first quarter, and a $10 million positive cash flow in May after an outflow in the first quarter, results that were in line with the overall industry.
The Investment Company Institute reports sales of high-yield funds in the first four months of this year totaled $2 billion, just over half the $3.9 billion total in the 1989 period.
''For an investor who can afford to lose - who has discretionary funds to invest - there probably are opportunities,'' said Tim Kochis, who is in charge of executive financial counseling for Deloitte & Touche, ''but it's not where you put any really important capital.''
He worries that some middle-class people whose money is not discretionary are attracted by the high yields for their retirement funds, for example, and ''unwittingly exposing themselves to risk.''
''I'm very concerned about the junk bond market,'' said Joel S. Isaacson, who is in charge of personal financial planning for Weber Lipshie & Company, certified public accountants. He predicted many defaults. ''These bonds have not been through a real recession.''
But for people ''looking to bottom-fish'' in the junk bond market, Mr. Isaacson said, ''funds are probably the only way to go,'' to get the diversification and professional management that are imperative in a risky market.
Steven E. Norwitz, vice president of T. Rowe Price, suggested several criteria for selecting a fund: how widely diversified its portfolio is, both by issuers and by industry; whether at least 80 percent of its bonds make cash payments, as opposed to payment-in-kind or zero-coupon bonds, and how experienced its management is.
To be avoided are the high-yield funds that Forbes magazine calls cannibal funds, which eat into principal to pay dividends. Investors should look at the total-return figures, not just yield.

HEADLINE: Jump in Industrial Output Seen as Temporary

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Industrial production jumped by six-tenths of 1 percent in May, the Federal Reserve reported today, but analysts said the sharp increase was mainly because of a temporary buildup in automobile inventories.
''I think it was somewhat of a fluke,'' said Paul Getman, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ''Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial production was up by two-tenths of 1 percent. That is more in line with the underlying fundamentals.'' 
The Fed also reported that the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities - which usually moves in tandem with industrial production - rose by three-tenths of 1 percentage point, to 83.6 percent in May. The operating rate measures not only output but also changes in productivity.
 
Labor Contracts Cited
Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington economic forecasting firm, contended that the building of auto inventories was related to concern over the expiration of the labor contracts of the Big Three auto makers in September.
David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York dealer in government securities, noted that the auto makers reported a drop in output in the first 10 days of June. ''So industrial production is showing only temporary strength and will probably tilt in a weaker direction in coming months as auto makers, in particular, have to scale back production more in line with demands,'' he said.
Two Government reports earlier this week pointed to slowing consumer demand as the job market weakens and wages fall. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, has been a driving force for the economy for much of the last eight years.
Falling consumer spending, combined with tighter credit curbs in many parts of the country, ''could threaten to push the economy over the edge into a recession in the second half of the year,'' Mr. Jones said.
In addition to auto production, Mr. Evans said some of the increased output was because of exports, which analysts have credited for helping sustain recent economic growth.
The Commerce Department reported today that exports helped shrink the United States trade deficit so far this year to an annual rate of $92.16 billion, compared with a deficit for all of 1989 of $108.99 billion.
Industrial production has risen each month since January except for April, when it was unchanged. The April figure was revised upward from a previously reported drop of four-tenths of 1 percent.
Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods rose by eight-tenths of 1 percent in May after slipping by two-tenths in April.
Output of durable goods - big-ticket items expected to last at least three years - jumped by 1.3 percent after a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier. Manufacturing of nondurable goods such as food and clothing was up by two-tenths following a four-tenths increase in April. Mine Output Steady Output at mines was unchanged in May after an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in April. Utility production was down 1.1 percent following a rise of seven-tenths.
The operating rate at durable goods factories rose by eight-tenths of 1 percentage point, to 82 percent, while the rate at plants making nondurable goods inched downward by one-tenth of a point, to 84.3 percent.
The operating rate at mines was unchanged at 88.9 percent, while it dropped a full percentage point, to 84.9 percent, at utilities.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Mixed Abroad, Dips In U.S. After Data's Release

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar lost ground in domestic trading yesterday and finished mixed in Europe in volatile action after the release of several economic reports.
Gold prices advanced but were unable to make up for Thursday's $5-an-ounce selloff.
The Government reported that the nation's trade deficit fell sharply to $6.94 billion in April and that consumer inflation held to a modest two-tenths of a percent gain in May. Both reports were in line with expectations. 
But a Federal Reserve report showing a six-tenths of a percent rebound in May's industrial production took the market by surprise.
''This was the first time in several weeks that an economic number was reported actually stronger than the market had expected,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at MMS International in Chicago.
The dollar rallied at first, in both Europe and the United States, on the notion that the Fed would not be inclined to reduce interest rates to stimulate production. Lower rates make dollar-denominated securities less attractive.
But a bout of profit taking swept European markets and carried through to domestic trading.
Activity was ''very heavy and very choppy,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
Rumors circulated in the market that West Germany's Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan are prepared to intervene in coming days to support their local currencies - at the expense of the dollar.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 154.52 yen, up 0.99 yen from Thursday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted lower at 154.10 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 153.90 yen, down from 154.20 yen on Thursday.
In London the pound fell to $1.7060, from $1.7080 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.7090 to buy one pound, more expensive than Thursday's $1.7080.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6885 West German marks, down from 1.6948; 1.4330 Swiss francs, down from 1.4355; 5.6806 French francs, down from 5.7015; 1,239.00 Italian lire, down from 1,244.50, and 1.1709 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1713.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $349.50 an ounce, up $2.70 from late Thursday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $348.50 an ounce, up $2.65 an ounce.
Silver prices were unchanged to higher. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery settled at $4.811 an ounce, up from Thursday's $4.770.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
LITHUANIA LEADERS URGE SUSPENDING INDEPENDENCE BID

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 16

 BODY:
The government of Lithuania endorsed a proposal today that it suspend the republic's declaration of independence, provided that the Gorbachev Government end economic sanctions and begin negotiating a compromise settlement of the sovereignty crisis.
The action by the executive branch of the Lithuanian government was in the form of a recommendation to its Parliament that it act favorably on the compromise proposal when it takes up the issue next week.
The council thus moved forward the negotiating plan devised this week in informal talks at the Kremlin between leaders of the central Government and Lithuania. A moratorium on the March 11 declaration of independence by the Lithuanian Parliament has been demanded by the Kremlin as the price for suspending its economic embargo and beginning formal negotiations. 
 
Lengthy Debate Predicted
The Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, predicted a lengthy debate on the measure. There was no immediate estimate available of the mood of the republic's Parliament, although its approval might seem likely for a plan already endorsed by the Lithuanian leadership.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev endorsed the general terms of the negotiating plan in an effort to end the three-month crisis that has increased his troubles with nationalist movements and ethnic groups around the nation. The crisis has also impeded his efforts to win United States trade concessions that could help the floundering Soviet economy.
 
End of Embargo Urged First
The economic embargo ordered by Mr. Gorbachev to deal with what he denounced as an unconstitutional action has led to the closing of most Lithuanian factories and the making idle of tens of thousands of workers.
At the same time, Lithuanian leaders have stressed that the republic's resolve for independence has only grown during the embargo.
In its announcement, the Lithuanian council stressed that it was recommending that while the Parliament not delay in declaring a temporary moratorium, it should not take effect until the Soviet embargo on fuel and other needed commodities actually has ended.
 
Independence Is Upheld
''A moratorium only means that for the duration of negotiations the use of the rights stemming from the independence act is postponed,'' the council asserted in a statement, drawing a distinction between independence in principle and the series of laws to enact an end to Moscow ties. ''The status of Lithuania as an independent state does not change.''
If the republic's Parliament agrees, it would temporarily suspend laws that attempt to exempt Lithuanian men from the Soviet military draft and expropriate property claimed by the Soviet Government, among other actions. Moscow claims such laws are illegal.
But Lithuania and the two other Baltic republics, Estonia and Latvia, hold that Moscow's rule has lacked legitimacy ever since it annexed the republics 50 years ago as part of a secret pact between Stalin and Hitler.
 
Described as a Beginning
There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin to today's Lithuanian council announcement, but Tass, the Government press agency, described it as ''an important decision'' that could mean ''the beginning of the solution'' to the drawn-out standoff between Vilnius and Moscow.
The Lithuanian executive's action was expected, since Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene had spoken of increased hope between the two sides when she headed home after the Kremlin talks this week.
The Soviet Prime Minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, had spoken in a similar tone and announced a token increase in fuel to a fertilizer factory in Lithuania as a good faith gesture to encourage eventual negotiations. A spokesman for the Lithuanian Parliament reported today that the pipeline to the Azotas fertilizer plant had indeed been reopened.
The next critical step will be the deliberations in the Lithuanian Parliament, which will provide the republic's final word on the negotiating proposal.
 
Fast Action Is Urged
At the same time, Lithuanian leaders indicated that they expected the Kremlin to be acting fast to end the embargo. Their statement emphasized that the permanence of the mutual concessions - the independence moratorium and renewal of Moscow trade - ultimately was subject to the opening of formal negotiations and their success.
''The breaking off of negotiations automatically brings an end to the moratorium,'' the republic council cautioned.
The form and substance of eventual negotiations toward a compromise agreement are not yet clear. President Gorbachev met last week with the leaders of the Baltic republics, inviting negotiations toward a treaty to help in his promised change of the nature of the Soviet Union so that all 15 republics might be treated as ''sovereign states.''
The crisis over the republics' unrest deepened considerably for Mr. Gorbachev last week when the Parliament of the Russian republic, the nation's heartland, led now by Mr. Gorbachev's chief anatagonist, Boris N. Yeltsin, adopted a sovereignty resolution that Soviet law should be considered secondary to Russian law.

HEADLINE: After Weeping for Mandela, Many Prepare to Savor Visit

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON

 BODY:
For 30 years Willard Johnson fought an often thankless battle in Boston, protesting racial inequities in a country most Americans knew little about. He helped organize some of the earliest demonstrations against South Africa's system of racial separation and was even arrested for it once.
Now Dr. Johnson, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is waiting to see the face and hear the voice of Nelson Mandela, who inspired him and many others long before Mr. Mandela was released in February after 27 years in prison.
''I hope I get a chance to meet him,'' Dr. Johnson, who heads TransAfrica, the largest American anti-apartheid group, said last week. ''I'll be trembling.'' 
Hundreds of miles away, in the shadow of the Atlanta church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached and near the tomb where he is buried, Kathryn Byrd, owner of the Lady Byrd Beauty Shop, was making plans for June 27, the day when Mr. Mandela is scheduled to visit Atlanta and pass by her shop.
 
'I See Myself'
Mrs. Byrd knew little about Mr. Mandela before he was released, but she plans to put a ''closed'' sign in her shop window and stand with her grandchildren on the hood of her Chevrolet Blazer to get a glimpse of him.
''I'm going to take pictures if I can get close enough,'' Mrs. Byrd said. ''When I see him, I see myself.'' All across the country, blacks who wept and cheered as Mr. Mandela walked free four months ago are anticipating the arrival this week of a man who they say has taken on greater symbolism for them than any civil rights leader since Dr. King.
Mr. Mandela, a lawyer and leader of the African National Congress and its movement to end apartheid in South Africa, was arrested and convicted of sabotage and treason in the early 1960's. Over the years he became the world's most notable political prisoner, the subject of songs and plays and an international campaign to free him. He walked free only after the Pretoria government agreed to legalize the long-banned A.N.C. and to work toward dismantling apartheid.
His 12-day tour of eight American cities, which begins Wednesday in New York City, is bringing together people of every race who are moved by his unwavering stand for his cause, people who only recently learned of him and those who have spent most of their lives fighting to gain his release.
Many of them are planning their schedules around his arrival, sprucing up the schools and parks he is scheduled to visit, learning anti-apartheid hymns, writing poems, practicing rap shows and searching for other ways to show respect and admiration.
''For once, something constructive and positive is coming that the little people, the common people, can identify with,'' said the Rev. J. Alfred Smith Sr., pastor of Allen Temple Baptist Church in Oakland, Calif., Mr. Mandela's final stop.
In Boston, residents of a housing project named after Mr. Mandela will welcome him with waves and cheers and banners as his motorcade passes. People as diverse as shop owners and Dr. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, will turn out to greet him at Dr. King's grave in Atlanta. And at a sold-out Tiger Stadium in Detroit, a 1,000-voice choir will sing the anti-apartheid anthem in Mr. Mandela's native tongue.
''We want to give him goose bumps,'' said the Rev. Jim Holley, pastor of the Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit. ''We want him to know he's not alone, that we're with him. Whatever the Pope means to Catholics, that's what Mandela means to us.''
To David N. Dinkins, the first black Mayor of New York City, the South African serves as an inspiration to black Americans.
''How can we fail to do well,'' Mr. Dinkins said, ''when they have done such remarkable things against such tremendous odds and oppression while the world stood silent.''
As the borough president of Manhattan five years ago, Mr. Dinkins pushed for the city's first law mandating sanctions against South Africa, and last Thursday as Mayor he introduced a bill expanding the city's policy of sanctions. ''I have been one of the many soldiers in this battle for awhile,'' he said. ''I've always had this feeling. Now I'm in the position to do something about it.''
 
'His Cause Is Our Cause'
Dorothy Clements, who owns the Auburn Avenue Rib Shack in Atlanta, said she hoped Mr. Mandela would have time to stop by for some ribs. She'll have a banner up pointing him in her direction in case he does.
''He reminds me of the civil rights movement,'' Mrs. Clements said. ''We've sort of forgotten how to do it. We don't have anybody who can get the adrenaline going like he does. I hope this will bring black Americans together if just for one day. His cause is our cause.''
The excitement over his visit has caused something of a tug-of-war over his itinerary in Boston. Blacks in Roxbury, which four years ago sought to secede from the city and change its name to Mandela, Mass., say the big rally in his honor on Saturday should be in their neighborhood instead of downtown at the Esplanade.
''Why should we have to watch him on TV and see these other people singing Mandela songs when they didn't even know him?'' asked Georgette Watson, who runs an anti-crime group in Roxbury.
But organizers say holding the event downtown will help bring out as many people as possible. ''The Esplanade wasn't good enough for some but it was a compromise,'' said Themba Vilakazi, a black South African who heads Free South Africa, an anti-apartheid group, and is coordinating Mr. Mandela's visit to Boston. ''We want as broad a coalition in this fight as we can get.''
Roxbury residents will get the morning with Mr. Mandela, who will pass the worn brownstones and storefronts by motorcade and will meet with community leaders and students at Madison Park High School.
 
Soul Searching Among Blacks
That day, Carol Palmer, a resident of the Mandela Apartments in Roxbury, will be out early with her three children to wave to Mr. Mandela. ''I can't wait for the 23d to get here,'' Mrs. Palmer said. ''I'm just so proud of the man.''
She plans to give each of her children a banner to hold up for him. ''They've been asking so many questions,'' Mrs. Palmer said. ''They want to know why this man was in jail for so long.''
The visit, which also includes stops in Washington, Miami and Los Angeles, is prompting a soul searching among blacks who appear uncertain of precisely what Mr. Mandela can do for them but who express hope that somehow he might help foster changes in this country.
Dr. Charlotte Hutton, a resident at a Boston hospital, remembers the moment Mr. Mandela was released and the physicians in the emergency room stopped in front of a television screen in the lobby to watch him. Now she hopes he can do more than inspire. ''I'm hoping for a watershed effect in this country, that we will somehow feel some unifying presence because he's here,'' Dr. Hutton said.
John Evans, a window washer in Roxbury, said that Mr. Mandela had already made his life a little easier. ''Every day it's a struggle,'' Mr. Evans said. ''The struggle is parallel. But if he can sit in jail for 27 years, I know I can try to keep doing my job.''
While black Americans are embracing Mr. Mandela as they would a long lost relative, his unflagging struggle for equal rights has a resonance for supporters of all races.
''It's hard for me to really relate to some of this as an Italian,'' said Charles Laquidara, a Boston disk jockey who led a boycott of Shell Oil in 1988, when he asked listeners to cut up their Shell charge cards because its parent company had dealings in South Africa.
''All I know is that what's going on in South Africa shouldn't be happening,'' said Mr. Laquidara, who plans to use his show to welcome Mr. Mandela. ''I look at Mandela and see a man they tried to break and couldn't.''
Older blacks, remembering the days in this country when they had to drink from separate water fountains, say they hope Mr. Mandela can put younger blacks in touch with their heritage.
''It's amazing how short memories are,'' said Dr. Joseph Reed, the chairman of the medical department at Morehouse Medical School in Atlanta who as a boy was bused 36 miles past six white schools to get to a segregated school in St. Petersburg, Fla.
''My kids drove themselves to a private prep school,'' Dr. Reed said. ''If it does nothing more than cause a reawakening, it will have been worth it.''
The Rev. Joseph L. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta, delights in the fact that for the first time Americans have had the chance to see in Mr. Mandela a positive image of an African man.
''The only examples of African manhood known to most Americans are Tarzan and Idi Amin,'' Mr. Lowery said.
 
'Waiting for the Signal'
It is an image that civil rights leaders say could especially encourage inner-city youths lacking in hope. ''Now we have the physical manifestations as we can touch and feel the people who have been involved in the struggle and they can feel us,'' Mrs. King said at a news conference on the visit. ''For the children who will be here and who will get a chance to just get a glimpse of this man, maybe, and who will hear some of his words, it's very important.''
In the coming days, millions of people, black and white, are expected to turn out to glimpse him. Most will be too far away for him to see their faces. But Don Muhammad, a prominent black minister in Roxbury, knows just what he'll say if he gets the chance. ''If it's just for a moment,'' Mr. Muhammad said, ''we're going to say, 'We love you, brother. Keep up the good fight.' ''

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANTIGUA, Guatemala, June 16

 BODY:
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's three-week-old Cabinet was exasperated, ready to give up.
At a meeting on May 11, one member after another recounted a daunting list of problems. Some complained that there was barely enough money on hand to buy pencils; others that their ministries contained members of the opposition Sandinista Front who were undermining almost every decision. With rare unity, the Cabinet agreed, the country was ungovernable. 
And then things got worse. Flexing their well-developed political muscles, the Sandinistas made good on their promise ''to rule from below'' and organized a nationwide civil-service strike that brought the country to a halt for six days in mid-May. Nicaragua seemed on the verge of anarchy.
But on Friday, her 50th full day in office Mrs. Chamorro flew here for her first regional summit meeting buoyed by a series of political victories that have helped to dispel the gloom that had begun to settle over Nicaragua and undermine her Government.
 
'Over the Hump'
While Mrs. Chamorro must still navigate many political and economic shoals, including a crumbling economy, rampant inflation, and an entrenched and hostile bureaucracy, she has begun to create a working administration.
''She's gotten over the hump,'' said a Western diplomat who is a friend of the Chamorro Government. ''It's been a zigzag path, but she's gotten around the corner. There's an unusual genius here.''
The President's first success came late last month, when she persuaded 16,000 contra rebels to fulfill their pledge to surrender their arms to United Nations troops and end their 10-year war against the Sandinistas.
In return, Mrs. Chamorro set aside a reserve for the rebels in the sparsely settled southeastern corner of the country. She also earmarked an estimated $47 million of the $300 million aid package recently approved by the United States Congress to smooth the contras' return to civilian life.
 
Large Political Dividends
Former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra accused the Government of giving away the store. But it appears that the demobilization will cost her remarkably little and will earn large political dividends. It has already paved the way for the announcement on Friday, with Sandinista assent, of a one-third cut in the 60,000-member army, whose officers and rank-and-file are mostly Sandinistas.
In addition, she ordered the armed forces to collect thousands of weapons distributed to civilian supporters immediately after the Feb. 25 Sandinista electoral defeat. That should provide another lift to the demilitarization and reconciliation program.
Mrs. Chamorro has learned to give with one hand while taking away with the other. She settled the civil service strike by agreeing to double wages and suspend a decree that gave her Government wide powers to dismiss workers.
 
Sandinistas Try to Make Point
Sandinista unions and many political observers saw the concessions as an opposition victory. ''This Government has had to recognize that we are a belligerent force,'' Jose Angel Bermudez, secretary general of the pro-Sandinista national employees union, said after the strike. ''From this point on, it will have to take our position into account.''
In retrospect, reports of a Government defeat seem premature. The salary increases were eaten up by inflation in the ensuing weeks. And the Government-controlled legislature returned some of the power Mrs. Chamorro conceded by passing a bill giving the President greater freedom to reorganize the bureaucracy.
''On the whole, she's risen to the challenges,'' a European diplomat said. ''She started by relying too much on decrees. But she's begun to learn how to pull other handles.''
 
Lingering Tensions
Amid signs of conflict within Sandinista ranks, the President's 14-party coalition has begun to come together. For the moment at least, the fighting within the coalition has declined, even though there are lingering tensions over the fact that Mrs. Chamorro's inner circle is composed entirely of personal friends, with none of the established coalition parties represented.
But the Sandinistas remain a potent, well-organized political opposition. The reductions in the army will be much less severe than Mrs. Chamorro had led many to expect. The vast majority of those due to be discharged will come from the reserves and the militia, a Chamorro adviser acknowledged.
In addition, Mrs. Chamorro still must create a loyal and competent government bureaucracy. Except for the most senior officials, the vast majority of civil servants are Sandinistas. They have the power to sabotage much of her program. But any attempt to replace them undoubtedly will provoke further labor strife and set back efforts to foster reconciliation. And her economic program, which includes sharp price increases on many essentials, will begin to bite in the coming months.
That leaves Mrs. Chamorro caught in a bind that has bedeviled her administration from the first moments that it took power: how to reconcile a divided society while moving a subsidized economy into private hands, all the while trying to lessen the influence of the strongest opposition party.
''There are dark days ahead,'' a European diplomat said. ''The belt-tightening inevitably has an effect on popularity until, with a little luck, you get through to better days.''

HEADLINE: Capital Residents Ready To Move On After Barry

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
As the long-running drama of Marion S. Barry Jr. sputters on in court, residents of the nation's capital are increasingly tuning out, wearily grateful that the Mayor's titillating but troubling saga will soon be off the air.
''It's time to move on,'' said Heather Taylor as she stopped to discuss the Mayor's legal and political troubles at the corner of H and 23d Streets Northwest, where doctors, scholars and economists carry attache cases from one appointment to the next.
At the H Street Connection, a video store in a northeastern neighborhood where the old scars of the 1968 riots have given way to the low-slung brick mini-malls of urban renewal, Mansour Mbaye, the 30-year-old Senegalese-born manager, said, . ''He should have gone a long time ago.'' 
In words, in silence and in sighs, these attitudes found echoes all along the four-mile length of H Street, from the brisk, button-down world of Foggy Bottom town houses near the Potomac River to the drug-sodden projects along the Anacostia River.
 
'I'm Sad for My City'
''It's sad, isn't it?'' said Stan Feldman, 63, a wine importer who is a native Washingtonian, as he walked through Chinatown. ''It's sad that a Mayor has to give up. Mr. Barry, like so many other people, had become addicted. I'm sad for him. I'm sad for my city. He has done some good.'' But then, after a pause, he said, ''He should move on.''
A journey along H Street this week found that the residents of the national capital, the residents of the drug capital and the just plain residents were tuning back into the rhythms of their own lives.
''Sorry, I'm not from North America and I'm 10 minutes late,'' said one woman, tapping her watch for emphasis as she rushed away from the World Bank building. ''No comment,'' said an elderly black man, leaning on a street sign near a weed-filled lot at H and 12th Northeast.
''Watch your camera, man. This is drug country,'' said an admitted addict, as he stood near the housing projects at H and 20th Streets Northeast.
 
Weariness Over Ordeal
It wasn't that no one had anything to say about Mr. Barry. But those who did often sounded wearied by the six-year marathon of accusation and denial, pursuit and capture, confession and contrition. And the remarks of those who didn't were reminders that for some, Washington is a way station, not a home, and that local government is a matter of little moment.
''Barry?'' said one young man quizzically as he stood near the intricately colored Chinese arch that marks the center of Chinatown at H and Ninth Streets Northwest.
''Mayor Barry,'' his questioner replied. ''Mayor Barry?'' he asked, shaking his head. Then he said: ''I'm sorry. I just came here a week ago.'' Mr. Barry's trial, resulting from a Federal sting operation in which prosecutors say Mr. Barry was videotaped smoking crack, has generated a broad spectrum of reactions. And that spectrum is reflected in the broad range of neighborhoods along H Street.
 
Relief and Regret
In the racially mixed but predominantly white professional areas, there was relief at the Mayor's decision not to seek re-election and regret that a once-promising career had turned sour. Heading east, where the majority white world shades to majority black, there is some anger at the Mayor, but more people turn their anger toward his prosecutors.
Pat Petrisin, a 63-year-old retired secretary interviewed near George Washington University, said she was thrilled by the Mayor's announcement that he would not seek a fourth term.
James Kee, 45, a professor of management at the university, said Mr. Barry had made the right decision but added that the Mayor had left some positive achievements, particularly that he ''brought a lot of pride to the black community in terms of its ability of govern the city.''
Gary Hennen, 46, a doctor who like Mr. Kee lives in Washington's suburbs but works downtown, said: ''I think he's probably guilty and realizes that he's going to be found guilty. I've always thought that he's been in over his head. First politics got out of control, then his life got out of control.''
 
'He's a Good Man'
Colleen Wright, 28, a student at a beauty academy near H and 12th Streets Northeast, said: ''I'm really disappointed that he decided not to run. I believe he's a good man. There are some things you should overlook. I voted for him every time, and I'd vote for him again.''
A few blocks away, at H and Fourth Streets Northeast, WOL radio was fielding call after call from listeners accusing Federal prosecutors of hounding Mayor Barry and expressing hope that he would prevail at his trial.
Just off H Street, in a neighborhood of row houses whose black owners are beginning to join the exodus to the suburbs, an older woman sat on her porch looking at the newspaper headlines and shaking her head.
''I still think he ought to have waited till all the facts were in before he announced'' his decision not to run again, said the woman, who identified herself only as a retired data processor.

HEADLINE: More States Trying to Curb Teen-Age Pregnancies

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Fearing the high long-term costs of adolescent pregnancies, more than two-thirds of the states have taken steps to reduce their incidence and enhance the lives of teen-age mothers and their children, according to a new study by the National Governors' Association.
State officials and experts on adolescent pregnancy said in interviews that these programs resulted in a reduction in the frequency of such pregnancies, in healthier mothers and babies and in more job opportunities for the young mothers, as well as fewer repeat pregnancies and school dropouts.
''Teen pregnancy is a bellwether statistic,'' said Jeffrey J. Koshel, who directed the governors' association's study, released earlier this month. ''It sounds an alarm. The results are not confined just to our school system or welfare system or criminal justice system. It raises questions about what to do with unemployed, undereducated adults and women who give birth at 16 and stay on welfare for 10 years.'' 
The study found that the number of states with coordinated efforts to reduce adolescent pregnancies more than doubled, to 17 from 7, while the number of states with individual agencies working on the problem increased to 27 from 20. Of the 37 states that increased programs since 1985, 6 added supervision or resources for localities, 3 others formed study groups to plan initiatives and 11 started programs to address some aspect of adolescent pregnancy and parenthood.
 
Programs Criticized as Too Small
But some experts say the expanded programs, although ambitious, still fail to reach most of those in need. Dr. Karen Pittman, director of the Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention and Youth Development Division of the Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy and research group, said, ''The problem isn't that we don't know what to do, but that we don't do it broadly enough to make a real difference.''
Many special health, education and training programs are limited to communities where there is a high incidence of adolescent pregnancy. In New York State, 24 communities, including eight in New York City, are served by a coordinated adolescent pregnancy program; in California, 32 communities are served. Some states, including California, are now considering making these programs available to virtually all pregnant teen-agers.
The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit policy group concerned with reproductive health that does frequent population studies, reported that the number of births to women younger than 20 increased from 1 million in 1973 to 1.2 million in 1980, and then declined to 1 million in 1985, the last year for which statistics were available.
The birth rate for females under 20 is 113.2 per 1,000, the institute reported, ranging from 16.6 per 1,000 for 14-year-olds to 166.2 per 1,000 for 18- and 19-year-olds.
 
More Unwed Teen-Age Mothers
Sixty percent of teen-age births are to unwed mothers, up from 15.4 percent in 1960, 30.5 percent in 1970 and 48 percent in 1980.
''The automatic reflex to marry is not there any more,'' said Dr. Pittman, a sociologist. This has a lot to do with changing attitudes toward marriage, she said, as well as with the inadequacy of the earnings of the fathers, who are often high school dropouts who cannot find jobs that provide sufficient income to support a family.
California led the states in spending for family planning services other than Medicaid in 1987 with $27 million, followed by New York with $23.2 million and Texas with $20 million.
Forty states require or support some form of sex education in local public schools, while 15 states support school-based clinics that provide an array of preventive health services from physical examinations to family planning counseling.
Fifteen states have developed employment and training programs intended to keep pregnant adolescents in school.
In Texas, a $1 million Teen Parent Initiative in El Paso County has resulted in ''better school retention, healthier babies, and a reduction in repeat pregnancies,'' said Liz Silbernagel, who coordinates the program.
In New York State, where there were 57,000 births to adolescents last year, a four-year-old program with a budget of $7 million a year coordinates the activities of the state and localities. The program operates in 24 areas, including Harlem, the Lower East Side, Washington Heights, Jamaica, Bushwick-Williamsburg, East New York, Fort Greene-Red Hook, and the South Bronx in New York City.
A state study of the eight communities in the first group in the program found that although the statewide rate of adolescent pregnancies had increased by four percent to 87 per 1,000 between 1986 and 1988, the rate in those communities had decreased by seven percent, to 102 per 1,000.
In California, where there were 58,000 births to adolescent mothers last year, an $8.8 million a year Adolescent Family Life Program established in 1985 serves 5,500 teen-age mothers annually in 32 communities. The program teams a caseworker with those providing services like nutrition, counseling, child care and transportation.
''The program has improved the outcome for adolescent mothers,'' said Vivian R. Gammon, the state's Assistant Secretary of Health and Welfare in charge of the program. ''It's increased the birth weight of their babies, improved the nutrition of mothers and babies, and helped the mothers stay in school and find jobs.''
She added that the state's goal ''is to provide this kind of service to all teens'' who qualify for Medicare.

N.A.A.C.P. Seeks Dormitory Space For Urban Poor

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
An influx of students from Washington and Lee University into low-income neighborhoods is creating friction with black residents, who charge that the movement has driven up rents to a point where some families can no longer afford to live here.
In response, the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has called on the college to open its dormitories to residents who cannot afford to live elsewhere in Lexington.
''The students come in and jack the rents up because they can afford to pay it; poor people can't,'' said Shirley Wells, a former Lexington resident who now lives in the rent-subsidized Valley View Apartments, about a mile north of the city. 
Charles Wohlrab, Lexington's housing coordinator, said that the student influx had been on the rise for five years. Frank Parsons, the college's capital planning coordinator, said that students started moving into the area in the 1950's, but added that the college did not have exact figures before this year.
 
Historically Low-Income
By the college's figures, 137 of 1,665 undergraduates at Washington and Lee, where tuition is $10,100 a year, now live in the low-income neighborhoods near the campus. Lexington has about 6,800 residents, almost half of them students. Living on campus costs about $170 a month, compared with $200 to $250 a month off campus.
The heavily black section of Lexington, which has about 500 residents overall, has been home for generations to some of the city's less affluent residents, many of them cooks, custodians and other service employees of the college and neighboring Virginia Military Institute, whose students are required to live on campus.
Officials at Washington and Lee, say rising rents are a function of the marketplace and beyond their control.
''It's all market-driven,'' said Brian Shaw, a spokesman for the college. ''If people want to live in town, they've got to pay.''
 
Robert E. Lee Himself
Mr. Shaw also said that Robert E. Lee himself, who was Washington and Lee's president after the Civil War until his death in 1870, encouraged students to live in the surrounding community to ''broaden their educations.''
J. B. Harris, president of the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter, said: ''Washington and Lee has available dormitory space. What do they do with the unused rooms? Why don't they rent that out to people in the community?''
Mr. Parsons responded, ''I don't think the suggestion is a very practical one.'' For one thing, he added, low-income residents might not like the students' noisy life style.
Mr. Parsons, who said that the college's dormitories are between 85 and 90 percent full, added that some of the off-campus houses now rented to students were empty and deteriorating before they moved in and were brought up to date by landlords. He also said that students who live off campus benefit the city's economy.
But Mr. Parsons conceded that the student migration into low-income neighborhoods had caused problems, both in housing costs and in community relations. Permanent residents sometimes complain of loud student parties and student-generated litter.
Lexington has received a $700,000 Federal grant to pay for housing rehabilitation in the neighborhood, said Mr. Wohlrab, the housing coordinator. The city also is working with banks on a plan to buy vacant houses in the neighborhood and save them for sale to low-income residents, he said.
''We don't want to displace minorities,'' said Lexington's Mayor, H. E. Derrick. ''We don't want to displace low- and moderate-income families. Something ultimately has got to be done.''

A Short Course In Farm Advice Follows Storms

DATELINE: WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.

 BODY:
Because it is a land-grant college, Purdue University found itself last week dispensing advice on how to save and plant crops after devastating floods and tornadoes ripped through Indiana in the last month.
One responsibility of a land-grant college is to serve the public that finances it. So for two days, Purdue's Cooperative Extension Service, which supervises the state's county agents, held television question-and-answer sessions for the agents to help them instruct farmers on dealing with storm damage. 
The setting for the teleconferencing was the campus's Potter Engineering Center, where more than 20 farm experts from the university were in touch with 31 sites in the state through the Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication Systems.
''We're here to provide information, knowledge and help people make decisions,'' said Dave Petritz, the coordinator of the programs.
 
Corn and Soybeans
Chris Hurt, a professor of agricultural economics, said Indiana's farmers, particularly those who grow corn or soybeans in the southern part of the state, might have sustained losses of up to $250 million. Corn and soybeans are each $1 billion crops here.
Phyllis Van Osdol, price-support specialist for the Agriculture Conservation Stabilization Service, said more than $26 million in damage to farm structures had also been reported.
A little less than 50 percent of the corn in southern Indiana has yet to be planted, said Ralph Gann, a state statistician. Tuesday was the last optimal day to plant corn.
Mr. Petritz said the advantage of the teleconference approach was that it provided a way to reach county agents, who in turn could assist many more farmers. He said the programs were open to anyone, but were designed specifically for agents.
''They are our eyes and ears out there,'' Mr. Petritz said. There is a county agent in each of the state's 92 counties.
 
Emotional Concerns Considered
One of the first presentations in Tuesday's program dealt with how the agents should handle people who were suffering emotionally. ''It's easier to deal with the facts of an issue than the emotional side,'' said George Denton, head of child development and family studies at Purdue. ''How do we fix the feelings, the grief, the despondency the farmers are feeling?''
His answer: ''Not very much you can say. Listening may be one of the best things you can do.''
Gerry Nelson, a county agent from Ox County, called the teleconference studios to say that prison crews were being used to help in the cleanup but that additional help was needed.

HEADLINE: SOUND;
DAT Decks Stand Ready for Shipment

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL

 BODY:
The free market, as an economic principle, has been gaining new friends in many places lately. But nowhere are unbridled enterprise and competition more evident than at the Consumer Electronics Show held in Chicago every June.
Despite the magnitude of the home electronics industry - it annually grosses $44 billion at retail in the United States alone - it has remained free of cartels and other clubby arrangements to fix prices, nip trade rivalries and squelch new ideas. As could be seen at the Chicago exhibition earlier this month, small companies - especially in audio - compete on basically equal terms with giant corporations. The better mousetrap still prevails. In audio, it's still the sound that counts. At least that's true in the more critical segment of the trade, where musical interest takes precedence over merchandising. 
Granted, lots of sound equipment is sold these days as a mere commodity - an item for chain stores. And many of the larger manufacturers, dazzled by dollar volume, aim their efforts at this relatively mindless portion of the market. Yet, in striking contrast to those mass-market products, there were plenty of components to be heard in Chicago that address a more discriminating audience and bespeak a musical dedication on the part of engineers eager to link art and science. Those engineers are true practitioners of what John Updike, himself a poet, calls ''the humanistic poetry of invention and technology.''
Most of the new stereo equipment shown at Chicago will not reach the stores until summer's end. This column will report on individual items as they become available.
Despite the staggering diversity of the more than 1,400 exhibits that sprawled over McCormick Place - Chicago's vast lakefront exhibition center - a single topic dominated the audio shoptalk: the imminence of DAT (Digital Audio Tape). Three days before the show opened on June 2, the Japanese Government, through its Ministry of International Trade and Industry, announced a sudden policy change: Henceforth Japan would permit the export of DAT decks to the United States.
Until now, Japan - the only country so far to make DAT equipment for home use - had held off sending it to this country for fear of offending the American record industry, which has powerful friends in Congress. The record makers worried about DAT's ability to make perfect copies of any recording - indistinguishable from the original. They felt that such undetectable copying would lead to organized piracy of copyrighted material.
However, a recent technical development allayed their apprehensions. A digital copy lock was developed that prevents further copies from being made from the first DAT copy. The record industry is satisfied that this will forestall large-scale piracy (which involves making multiple copies from copies) while allowing private users to make single DAT copies of recorded material.
It is this development that made the American record industry acquiesce to DAT and, in turn, persuaded the Japanese Government to authorize the shipment of DAT decks to the United States. It is expected that the import of DAT equipment will be ratified in the United States Congress through a bill - now under consideration - requiring all DAT decks sold in this country to be fitted with such a device.
Now that the Japanese export barrier has finally fallen, the first DAT decks designed for home use are likely to appear in American audio shops by midsummer. At the Chicago show, Sony announced that DAT is ready and waiting at the dock. Technics and Denon said that their own DAT designs would follow soon. Only Sony has set a price: $950 for its Model DTC-75ES.
Similar pricing expected from competing brands may initially confine DAT's appeal to the more avid and affluent audiophiles. But in the long run, with gradually declining prices, DAT's unmatched sonic quality is bound to win many enthusiastic adherents. There is little doubt that the announcements made in Chicago this month will precipitate the most radical advance in home recording since audio cassettes made their first appearance in the mid-1960's.

Fact That Outperforms Fiction

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby

 BODY:
The corporate nose has never been tweaked, or its leg pulled, to such serious and delirious effect as it is in Michael Moore's instant classic, ROGER AND ME (1989, Warner, $89.95). The brilliant feature-length documentary is now available on a videocassette that looks almost as mint-fresh as the movie.
In ''Roger and Me,'' Mr. Moore examines the idiocies of mankind as reflected in the economic crisis that befell his hometown of Flint, Mich., when General Motors began shutting down plants and laying off workers by the thousands. According to Mr. Moore, G.M.'s only thought was to open plants in Mexico, where the help is cheaper. 
The film makes no pretense of being unbiased. Though his manner is hayseed, Mr. Moore is an exceptionally sophisticated, witty and angry polemicist. The movie is as funny as it is bitter.
Form is given the film by Mr. Moore's Don Quixote-like attempts to track down Roger Smith, the G.M. chairman, in order to chat about G.M.'s community responsibilities.
''Roger and Me'' loses nothing in the film-to-video transfer. If anything it seems even more furious and more healthily impertinent to all things Establishment. Part of this is the new context. The movie looks especially rude when seen in a space recently vacated by commercials on behalf of America's most powerful corporations.
The video release of ''Roger and Me'' should also spur interest in the vast collection of first-rate documentaries already available in cassette form. Fiction would be hard put to match some of the real-life characters to be seen in this fact-cinema collection.
GATES OF HEAVEN (1980, RCA/Columbia, $79.95), by Errol Morris, who later went on to make THE THIN BLUE LINE (1988, HBO, $39.95), is a most revealing portrait of American manners as they relate to a California pet cemetery. Examined are the people who run the cemetery, who patronize it and who scoff at it (including a man who runs a business that recycles dead animals for profit).
Barbara Kopple's Oscar-winning HARLAN COUNTY, U.S.A. (1976, RCA/Columbia, $59.95) examines a strike by coal miners in eastern Kentucky. It took place in the early 70's but is as bitter as any labor action in the 1930's. Albert and David Maysles' GREY GARDENS (1976, Maysles Films, 250 West 54th Street, New York, N.Y. 10019, $79.95) is a disturbing portrait of gentle folk gone to seed in East Hampton: Edith Bouvier Beale (around 80) and her daughter Edie (about 50), the aunt and first cousin of Jacqueline Onassis.
BURDEN OF DREAMS (1982, Flower Films, $59.95), by Les Blank and Maureen Gosling, is a riveting picture of the making of a movie, Werner Herzog's ''Fitzcarraldo,'' in the jungles of Peru. After ''Burden of Dreams'' rent about any Les Blank film you can find. He's a master of movies about the American idiom. Go now.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
BLUEPRINT AN AIRPORT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
Few airports are architectural masterworks, but most are barely even tolerable as public environments. Harsh, cold, unrelentingly grim, they are designed more for the convenience of their tenants, the airlines, than for the pleasure of their users, the passengers. How often is it that people linger at airports longer than they have to, as they once did at train stations? Great train stations are celebrations of the ceremony of arrival and departure; airports are machines for shuffling people around.
And most airports aren't even very good at doing that. A case in point is the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, ne Idlewild, built in stages since the mid-1950's and both an esthetic horror and an operational nightmare. Most of the airlines operating out of Kennedy have their own buildings, strung out along a looping roadway, and the airport is not so much a unified facility as it is a set of competing duchies. The terminals suffer from the same disease as airport buildings everywhere else - the Pan Am building, to cite perhaps the worst, has all the pleasure of a subway station - but to move from one of them to any other is worse still, given the hopeless congestion that clogs the airport constantly. 
What seemed like an innovative design when the airport was new has now turned out to be something of a disaster. Kennedy's unpleasantness is no secret: its share of international passengers boarding flights in the United States fell from 37 percent in 1983 to 32 percent in 1988, the last year for which exact figures are available, and is believed to be dropping further all the time. While some of that decline is due to the increasing number of flights abroad now available from other cities, plenty of it is due to Kennedy's fast-sinking reputation among international air travelers.
Kennedy was once the premier air gateway to North America: now it is really no more than a very busy, very difficult entrance to a very busy, very difficult city. It was with some hope of restoring the airport's role as a symbolic gateway to this country that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the airport's operator, commissioned a master plan in 1984 for the airport's expansion from the architects Pei Cobb Freed & Partners (then known as I. M. Pei & Partners).
What Henry Cobb, the partner in charge of the project, produced was a remarkable scheme that would have transformed the airport completely, made its unworkable layout coherent, and given New York its most important architectural entry since the completion of Grand Central Terminal in 1913. The plan, which was part of a $3.2 billion overhaul of the entire airport, was about to start construction when it was abruptly abandoned by the Port Authority earlier this year, ostensibly as a result of its cost. The project's cancellation - which the Port Authority prefers to describe as an indefinite postponement - is a story in which architecture, politics and the bizarre economics of the airline industry became intricately intertwined. The losers are the people of New York, who almost got both a workable airport and a noble public building - and now will have neither.
Mr. Cobb's design was based on the realization that there was nowhere for Kennedy to expand except inward, toward the center of the loop around which its terminals are strung. He proposed a vast central terminal that would contain no actual gates, but would serve as an arrival, departure and transfer point for most travelers and visitors, connected to the other terminals by means of a people-mover system. The older terminals would be somewhat expanded and upgraded, and would surround the central building like oversize satellites.
It was a daring design, since it effectively turned the airport inside out. The different airline terminals, which now make a chaotic splatter along the loop road, would have been rendered secondary to a vast structure of granite, glass and metal that at its center would have contained a domed, skylighted arrival hall, 140 feet across and 115 feet high. The hall would have been a space of both majesty and drama, Soanian in spirit, and perhaps the closest our age has come to the grand and uplifting public space of the great railway terminals.
But also like the great train stations of an earlier age, the central building at Kennedy would have been much more than an architectural monument. It would have been a kind of machine - ''the heart this airport needs to pump people around,'' in Mr. Cobb's words. The vast building would have been the central transfer point for an elaborate automated system that would have moved passengers to and from the various terminals, and it would have contained hotels, restaurants and shops, as well as expanded customs facilities, parking garages and bus platforms.
All this was to be bound up in a structure that would have been fairly nondescript on the outside, distinguished more by a sleekness and cleanness of detail than by anything else, with the finesse that is more or less assumed in buildings from the Pei Cobb Freed office. But behind this discreet facade was to have been a remarkably complex, brilliantly interwoven system of roadways, walkways, and people-mover routes, all surrounding the majestic space that would have been the architectural reward at the building's core.
The drawings and models suggest a building of remarkable refinement for a public project, particularly for one commissioned by an agency whose architectural output has tended to be more along the lines of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan. Here at Kennedy, public architecture would have achieved an impressive degree of grandeur. Perhaps more impressive still would have been the message this design sent that grandeur need not be inconsistent with efficiency: that it is possible to make the public realm more coherent at the same time that it is being made more noble.
The project was officially put aside because of finances. While the central terminal building itself would not have been terribly expensive (roughly $450 million of the $3.2 billion cost of the Kennedy master plan, well within original budget guidelines), the overall plan, with its complicated people-mover system, proved more than the Port Authority wanted to handle at a time when New York's economy is so troubled.
The Port Authority plans a limited, scaled-down set of improvements instead, without the central terminal at all. Its executives argue that they cannot spend the vast amounts of money the larger project would require without help from the airlines, which in today's deregulated, market-driven economy, balked at committing their money to the central-terminal project, especially given Kennedy's decline.
But of course Kennedy's decline was the very reason the project was initiated in the first place. The Cobb building was designed to turn the airport around, to render an unworkable place functional and to confer some dignity on the experience of arriving in the United States and in New York City. That last goal would seem to be a particularly frivolous luxury so far as the Port Authority and the airlines are concerned - after all, what traveler could be so audacious, or so foolish, as to think of anything connected with the process of arriving in New York City in terms of dignity, pleasure or excitement anymore?
It's worth saying something about the relative views of the Port Authority and the airlines here, since it was the reluctance of the airlines that really did this project in. Since deregulation, airlines have shown little interest in long-range planning; they are hesitant to plan 30 days ahead, let alone 30 years. And the stronger airlines have become more and more powerful, less an airport's tenants than its masters, and less willing to cooperate with each other than they were in an earlier, gentler era.
Paradoxically, in the current environment, the absurd layout of Kennedy makes perfect sense for the airlines: this Balkanized airport allows them to preside over fiefs of their own, and it makes transfer from one airline to another hopelessly difficult. Surely one of the reasons the airlines pulled back from the master plan was that the present state of affairs at the airport suits their purposes just fine. But if it isn't the business of the airlines to demonstrate vision, that is the business of the Port Authority, a public agency that was created to do precisely what the private sector couldn't do on its own. While it is true that the Port Authority is charged with fiscal restraint, it's equally true that its mandate is to transcend politics and make the best long-term decisions for the future of the New York region. Kennedy Airport is not only an architectural horror; its slipping market share is damaging the economy of New York City. This project seemed to offer a fair chance of reversing the airport's sad decline and, more important still, of giving this mess of an airport some sense of order - and through it, to have conferred on New York City the noble gateway it deserves.
 
CLIPPED WINGS
Amid all the architectural chaos of Kennedy Airport, there have been some attempts to create terminals of serious design. The most famous is the TWA Terminal, the swooping concrete structure of 1962 designed by Eero Saarinen. Alas, while that building's sensuous form, intended to evoke the spirit of movement and flight, remains, it is now but a shadow of its former self. The dramatic building proved unworkable both for the high-volume passenger needs of an age of jumbo jets and for the needs of handicapped passengers. And it has been so unsympathetically altered by TWA that it is difficult now to see what it is in Saarinen's majestic, earnest shapes that so stirred the spirit a generation ago. The kindest thing that could be done to this building, given how unfunctional it is today, would be to strip off all the additions and restore it as a museum of airport architecture.
The second-best terminal at Kennedy went up a decade later, in 1972, and that is perhaps why it always worked better. It was designed by I. M. Pei & Partners and is also under the control of TWA, which located its domestic flights there after taking the building over from National Airlines, which commissioned it. There is a grand and serene order to this glass and travertine building: a cool, self-assured modernist temple to flight.

HEADLINE: They're Drilling in the Oil Patch Again

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Tex.

 BODY:
Lord, they ask here in West Texas, let there be one more boom. Oil boom, of course. Then, again, no one here is exactly sure whether West Texas or the rest of the nation could actually produce one more boom. The oil people are asking themselves whether the nation has conceded too much power over oil prices to the Persian Gulf or whether too much of their old boom-time rigs and labor has simply disappeared.
Still, some of the region's prayers are now being answered, as is clear from the smiling face of Jack N. Blair when he talks about his new oil well. His so-called ''rank wildcat'' - a well drilled on the basis of ambiguous geologic data, on distances from existing wells and on a successful wildcatter's intuition - is gushing 500 barrels of crude a day. ''The major oil companies would not have drilled this prospect; it's a low-relief structure that is not easy to identify,'' he said with undisguised glee.
Nor is Mr. Blair alone in bringing new energy and renewed economic life out of the ground on this ancient seabed, known as the Permian Basin, which is one of the richest oil fields in the world. 
The number of drilling rigs in operation here has increased by about 25 percent, to 123, during the last year. Nationally the rig count is up to 940, and analysts expect the number to hit 1,000 before 1990 has ended.
 
A Glum Mood
 But ''undisguised glee'' is not the correct phrase to describe the general mood in Midland, a city of 95,000 and the economic center of the area. ''We're surviving,'' is the way L. Decker Dawson, president of the Midland-based Dawson Geophysical Company, which does seismic testing, puts it.
The long, lean years of depressed prices in the 1980's have caused experts in the American oil business, some 25 percent of which is generated in West Texas, to believe that the country's capacity to produce another boom or respond fully to another cutoff of imports has been seriously weakened. It is crucial, they say, that several factors be successfully combined if the nation is to regain a substantial measure of that capacity. More favorable prices and an expanded labor pool are two, but new and improved equipment, new technology, a more coherent national energy policy - these are regarded as essential as well.
In 1979, when the the collapse of Iran's oil industry sent prices soaring, there appeared to be no limit to oil prosperity. Within the three years, the number of rigs in operation in the United States soared to 4,500 from about 2,000, and the price-per-barrel topped $30. But during those heady times, many operators jumped into risky deals that depended on anticipated prices of $40 or $50 a barrel. Nirvana never came. The price peaked in 1981 and began to slide in 1982, when it fell to as low as $10, and those deals, along with a good many businesses, collapsed. By 1986, the number of rigs in operation dropped to 700 before starting slowly to rise again.
Now, prices appear to have stabilized at about $18, which has fired up the resurgence in drilling.
In fact, the drilling boom of the early 80's only temporarily reversed a long-term decline in domestic production. Since then, the nation has grown increasingly dependent on foreign oil. The United States now imports about eight million barrels a day, or about 48 percent of the 16.5 million barrels being consumed. And the increase in exploration that has been occurring during the past year has not significantly changed that trend.
Yet vast amounts of oil are still believed to lie here beneath the parched Texas ground and in other regions of the country.
Getting enough oil up and out to increase American production dramatically is another matter. For one thing, it is being found in smaller and smaller pools, and, for another, any large-scale increase would require workers and rigs and materials that are simply no longer available. Oil workers discouraged by long periods of unemployment have drifted off to other parts of the country, since there are few blue-collar jobs outside the oil industry here. Indeed, unemployment in the Midland area is a modest 5.1 percent. ''The people who are still here are working,'' said William Kerr, a Midland attorney. ''The surplus labor has departed.''
Similarly, many professionals have left the field. The work is very specialized. ''People were forced to go into other fields to find work,'' Mr. Dawson said. The Society of Exploration Geophysicists, for example, has seen its membership shrink 25 percent, from a peak of 20,000.
Idled drilling rigs have been cannibalized for parts by drilling contractors who could not afford to buy new parts. And drilling pipe, which has a relatively short operating life, could quickly become a critical bottleneck during a new oil boom, since little new pipe has been produced for years.
 
Danger on the Rigs
 ''I've got 15 rigs operating now out of a fleet of 56, compared to an average of eight in fiscal 1989,'' said Joe G. Roper, president of TMBR-Sharp Drilling Inc. in Midland. ''But if I got an order for 10 more rigs tomorrow, I could not staff them. It would take years to do that.'' Drilling is inherently dangerous, involving heavy, fast moving equipment. If inexperienced people were put to work on the rigs, he said, accidents would be inevitable, which could elevate insurance rates. ''You have to take it up real slow,'' he said. The reduction in capacity is not restricted to the Permian Basin. C. Paul Hilliard, chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of America said, ''A lot of service and supply companies died in 1986 and 1987,'' when the price of oil bottomed out at $10. In Lafayette, La., where his Badger Oil and Gas Ltd. is located, there were once as many as 1,029 companies serving and supplying oil explorers. By 1987, the number was down to 372.
Oilmen have gotten little guidance from the Federal Government over the last decade. Officials in Washington do now say, however, that they recognize the dangers of increased dependence on imports. ''It is not acceptable to have substantial disinvestment in oil and gas,'' Linda Stuntz, deputy under secretary for policy, planning and analysis at the Department of Energy, said in an interview. She said the department is preparing an energy strategy which is to be submitted to President Bush before the end of the year.
But as Jack Blair is demonstrating, there is still oil to be found and money to be made in the oil patch.
At 500 barrels and $18 a barrel, his well is producing $9,000 in revenue each day it operates. That means the approximate $900,000 cost of drilling it will be recovered in a little over three months. After that it will produce a steady stream of income for Mr. Blair, who has a 25 percent interest, and his major partners, the Moncrief family of Ft. Worth.
 
Born Into the Business
 He is, in fact, a classic Texas wildcatter, with an expansive manner and instinctive approach to drilling, the entrepeneur who learned the oil business by growing up in it. He does not, like some, put longhorns on his Cadillac. His Fleetwood is equipped with a sophisticated radar detector so that he can drive fast enough to cover the long distances common here without running afoul of the police.
''I was born into the business up north in Electra'' near the Oklahoma border, he said. ''My father was a driller and oil producer.'' Now two of his sons work with him, one as a land man, or leasing agent, and another as a field supervisor.
The original idea for his new well, designated the No. 1 Weatherby, came from an independent geologist, George Ulmo. His track record with Mr. Blair is good. ''I've dug the last four deals he brought me and three of them produced. I like that,'' Mr. Blair said.
After persuading his investors to sign up for the deal, Mr. Blair arranged for Mr. Roper's company to drill the hole and for such things as drilling mud to lubricate the drill and flush out rock chips. Most of the contractors are people he has been doing business with for more than 30 years. Indeed, TMBR-Sharp is an equity investor in the well, which is why the drilling cost is lower than the $1.2 million industry standard.
''We tend to use old friends who have stuck with us,'' Mr. Blair said. ''I had some trouble paying bills for awhile and they said, 'Pay us when you can.' ''
In times past the well would have been a gusher spewing out-of-control for days, because of the intense pressure of the gas associated with the oil. With modern technology the underground pressure is containable, and the only indication is a gauge on top of the wellhead: The oil is emerging from the ground now at an unusually high 700 pounds per square inch of pressure. Mr. Blair , who is 64 years old and has operated as an independent wildcatter here since 1987, said he survived the depression of the late 80's because he had relied largely on equity investors, not borrowed money. ''I've had the same investors for years; they're good oil people. We never stopped working.'' But he had to shrink his business, closing offices in Oklahoma, southern and eastern Texas. And he had to sell his airplane, a twin-engined Merlin. ''The first thing an oil man does when he makes some money is buy a ranch and an airplane,'' Mr. Blair said. ''A few more wells like this and I'll be looking at them again.''
Indeed, he is now busy drilling another well near No. l Weatherby to gauge the size of the field, which is down more than 12,000 feet. He estimates that each well will produce 600,000 to 700,000 barrels of recoverable oil, but at this point he not sure how many wells the field will support.
 
Expansion Unlikely
 Historically, independent oil companies run by wildcatters have drilled 80 percent of the wells in the United States and produce about 41 percent of all the crude oil in the lower 48 states. They have for the most part found the smaller fields, whereas the major oil companies have focused on massive projects like Alaska and those off the seacoasts.
But there appears to be no great optimism that there will be enough expansion any time soon or enough massive projects in the works to lessen United States dependence on world markets. Too many of the dominating players in those markets are in the Middle East, where reserves are abundant and production can be adjusted quickly. ''There is no doubt that producers in the United States are price-takers, not price-makers,'' said John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
Most forecasters, in fact, believe the United States will rely more on imports rather than less, that American production will steadily decline at least over the next five years even as consumption increases.
But as supplies tighten, prices are expected to rise, with some industry leaders such as Lodwrick M. Cook of Arco predicting $25 a barrel oil by the mid-90's.
An increase in oil prices could, in turn, begin to accelerate the drilling resurgence and reduce dependence on imports. ''If prices went up four or five dollars a barrel, it might stop or slow down the decline in domestic production,'' Mr. Lichtblau said.
A key factor in whether the United States can fully revitalize its oil industry is whether needed capital will be available. Locally owned banks collapsed at the end of the boom and the out-of-state institutions that took them over have greatly tightened lending standards.
 
Little Interest in Loans
 Samuel J. Atkins, whose North Carolina-based bank took over the remains of the First National Bank of Midland, said it is interested in increasing its energy loans to operators who have collateral in the form of producing properties. But many oilmen, who saw debt-laden competitors dragged into bankruptcy, say they are not interested in loans. ''I could care less if all the banks in the United States close their energy loan departments,'' said Mr. Hilliard of the wildcatter's association.
Midland oilmen say investors will return as economic conditions stabilize and operators like Mr. Blair demonstrate they still have, as the expression goes here, ''a good nose for oil.'' Another key is new or newly applied technology. Some oil explorers are borrowing techniques developed for offshore operations to recover oil from fields once thought to be exhausted. In addition to drilling vertically through the earth, they are drilling horizontally in an effort to tap fissures in the ground. Or more precisely, the drillers are boring down vertically from 6 to 10,000 feet, then a below-ground motor bends the bit, a little at a time. Gradually, degree by degree, the bit turns until it is horizontal. And then it can go on for up to a mile.
Thomas A. Sullivan, an offical of the Oryx Energy Company in Dallas, the nation's largest independent exploration company, said horizontal drilling is possible when drilling through a series of verticle geologic structures. ''You can tap more of them by drilling horizontally,'' he said.
Horizontal drilling appears to have revived the Pearsall field in southern Texas. This area was first drilled in the 30's, and many of the remaining wells were only producing a few barrels of oil a day. Oryx is now producing 12,000 barrels a day from 25 horizontal wells, according to Mr. Sullivan. Other companies have reported successes as well, and other regions, including formations in the Permian Basin, are being evaluated.
Horizontal drilling was developed for offshore fields because the enormous cost of establishing platforms in the open sea required that many wells be drilled from a common place.
The consensus here is that the old Texas ''elephant fields'' - those with 20 million to 100 million barrels or more of reserves - have largely been found. In fact, most of the major oil companies have moved or are planning to move their exploration operations out of the basin to concentrate on exploration in coastal waters and foreign locations.
That does not mean that they are giving up on the region. They expect existing wells to continue producing well into the next century, and, to help make that happen, they are injecting water and gas back into the ground. The injected materials penetrate the porous rocks containing the oil and force it toward well bottoms.
''The casing in some of these wells will corrode away before they are exhausted,'' said Richard Masterson, a geologist.
It does seem clear that all these factors, the persistent entrepreneurial spirit of the Texas wildcatter, the effective workings of supply and demand on price structures, new technology, new government policy - all will be needed if the nation's capacity to drill for the oil it has and wants.
The Lord, in other words, will need some help.
 
NOT TO THE RIG BORN
H. H. (TRIPP) WOMMACK 3d is the new-style, unswashbuckling, Texas oilman.
 He did not grow up in the oil fields in the mode of the classic West Texan wildcatter. He hails from the east - eastern Texas, that is - is still boyish looking and came to the oilfields only after earning a law degree.
But he has acquired six million barrels of oil reserves in the region - buying wells from operators in financial trouble.
''We do not buy from voluntary or willing sellers,'' he said. ''We buy from distressed individuals who have to sell.''
Mr. Wommack's company, Southwest Royalties Inc., operates more than 700 wells and has a nonoperating interest in an additional 4,000. Mr. Wommack said the slump in the oil patch provided his company with a one-time opportunity to buy producing properties. He does some drilling as well, but almost always in locations adjacent to producing properties.
The approach seems to be working. Southwest Royalties has grown from three people in 1983 to 58 now. With oil prices firming and drilling beginning to increase, he expects distress sales to cease within a year. Then he will have to drill more, and says: ''There are some places here where it is hard to drill a dry hole.''
 
HIGH HOPES FOR NATURAL GAS
Some wildcatters are hoping a revised Clean Air Act, now being considered by Congress, will produce increased demand and higher prices for natural gas.
Natural gas burns much more cleanly than other fossil fuels like gasoline, diesel and coal. So gas is increasingly favored by electric power plants that can switch fuels.
Natural gas can also power cars and trucks designed for gasoline, with modest modification, although the strong, large fuel tanks required can intrude on trunk space. If the new air pollution law mandates alternatives to gasoline in areas with particularly dirty air, natural gas may be one of the alternates.
''Oil consumption is not rising but the Clean Air Act may help in the gas market,'' said C. Paul Hilliard, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
According to the American Petroleum Institute, the number of gas wells successfully drilled has been steadily rising in recent years andthe total is roughly equal to the number of oil wells complete.
As recently as 1985, three times as many oil wells were brought in as natural gas.

A New Game at Trump's Tables
 
Donald J. Trump had better hope he can bargain better than he can run a casino. He failed on Friday to pay about $40 million due on ''junk bonds'' and another $30 million on bank loans that financed his purchase of Trump's Castle Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. In 1987, he called it ''one of the most successful hotel-casinos in the world.'' By Friday, it was a money-loser subject to being taken from Mr. Trump's control. But he might just wriggle free of his problems for the time being. He has 10 days of grace after missing his payments. And the bankers were said to be close to reaching an agreement with him. In return for a stake in his properties, they would give him more time and money while he tries to sell off some possessions. Mr. Trump must be well aware that the bankers have every reason to keep him afloat. Even the bondholders are better secured than some of the bankers. And who's to blame Mr. Trump for a few delays in sending a check? After all, he's celebrating his 44th birthday late, too. He marked the actual date on Thursday by having lunch at his Plaza Hotel with his wife, Ivana. The real bash waited for Saturday, at Trump's Castle. 
 
Boeing's Burgeoning Backlog
 
How to reduce the trade deficit: Figure out a way for Boeing to work off its entire, $80 billion-plus backlog this year. Boeing jets are one American product that foreigners can't get enough of. Korea Air Lines agreed last week to buy 23 long-range 747-400's for almost $5 billion, but delivery won't begin until 1994. The company recently announced sales to China and Japan totaling more than $5 billion. Peter L. Aseritis, an analyst at First Boston, calls Boeing ''far and away America's largest industrial exporter.'' Mr. Aseritis worries that the stock - up almost 50 percent last year and 50 percent so far this year - is outrunning its immediate earnings prospects. But the unanticipated size of the Korean and Chinese orders has prompted him to raise his estimate of Boeing's year-end backlog by $10 billion, to a total of $100 billion.
 
Time-Warner Adjusts Sights
 
TV-Cable Week cost $45 million before it closed. Picture Week, $30 million. Time Warner's latest new magazine, Entertainment Weekly, has cost about $40 million so far. It remains open, but with a new direction and, last week, a new managing editor. Jeff A. Jarvis, who favored tough reviews and highbrow subjects - one cover featured books about Vietnam - quit last week. His replacement, James W. Seymore, has been the executive editor of People magazine, a wildly successful Time Warner publication. The new formula at Entertainment Weekly is already evident: More celebrities. The more obvious, the better. Madonna, for instance. But with advertising off for most magazines, some analysts still wonder whether Entertainment Weekly will have a long run.
 
S.&L.-Based Indictment
 
As Don R. Dixon once explained in a California bankruptcy court, he did indeed spend funds from the Vernon Savings and Loan Association on a Ferrari. But it was no luxury car. ''It was a family Ferrari,'' he said, with four seats and an automatic transmission. Now the Government also wants him to explain how Vernon's deposits paid for political contributions, the rent on a California beach house and companions for Vernon executives and their guests. Mr. Dixon, Vernon's principal owner, was indicted by a Federal grand jury last week on 38 criminal charges. Examiners have said that the rescue of his failed Texas savings institution will probably cost taxpayers $1.3 billion.
 
In Brief
 
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company has dispatched an ambulance for RJR Holdings Inc. and its sickly bonds. The Kohlberg, Kravis medics raised $1.7 billion for an emergencycash infusion. As news of the planned treatment came out on Thursday, the company's ''junk bonds'' revived, with two issues each gaining $7 per $100 of face value. Operations and asset sales have been going fine at RJR - the largest leveraged buyout in history - but the junk bond market has been ailing.

THE ECONOMY
 
Big Board - 24-Hour Day . . .
 
The city that never sleeps might have a stock exchange that doesn't either. The New York Stock Exchange has decided to hustle to keep from losing more business to Tokyo and London. A plan announced by John J. Phelan Jr., the exchange's chairman, would bring about 24-hour trading over several years and in several stages. Later this year, two brief trading sessions will be added after the normal hours. The next phases would involve stock auctions during the night, then rudimentary night trading, then continuous all-night action. The subplot here might be titled ''The Twilight of the Specialists.'' The specialists - princely floor traders who now handle every transaction - might be reduced to quaint figures showing up for six-and-a-half hours a day while computers conduct the exchange's business for the other 17 1/2. The specialists were among those blamed for the chaos when the market crashed in 1987.
 
. . . And Trading Halts Too?
 
When the game gets tough, the New York Stock Exchange might well call a time-out. A panel it created after stocks plunged last October recommended trading halts timed in proportion to the market's volatility. After a 50-point rise or fall, index arbitrage would be virtually banned; 100 points, and all trading of stocks, futures and options would cease for an hour; 400 points, and the markets would close for the day. Several Wall Street executives said the restrictions would probably prevent another crash. But some said that investors would simply switch their trades to foreign exchanges - even as the New York market is planning to stay open at night to recapture the trading it has already lost.
 
Cheaper by the West
 
''City of spires and masts,'' Walt Whitman called New York more than a century ago. ''The countless masts, the white shore-steamers, the lighters, the ferry-boats, the black sea-steamers well-model'd.'' These days, Whitman might be more in awe of Los Angeles, which overtook New York last year as the nation's busiest port. Los Angeles handled cargo worth $55 billion; New York, $49 billion. New York's port has suffered from high handling costs, a lack of manufacturing exports, growth along the Pacific Rim and traffic that delays trucks heading to the ships. Even cargo bound for the Eastern United States often bypasses New York. Asian shippers can find it cheaper to unload their goods onto trains in Los Angeles than to go through the Panama Canal and New York.
 
The Trouble With Trade
 
The nation's trade deficit shrank to $6.9 billion in April from $8.4 billion the month before - but for the wrong reasons. The figures probably say more about the weakness of America's economy than the competitiveness of its producers. Exports fell 3.5 percent to $32.3 billion, but imports fell even more, 6.2 percent to $39.3 billion. Lincoln F. Anderson, an economist at Bear, Stearns, called the lower exports ''disappointing'' but said that the dollar's weakness against European currencies might improve exports in the coming months.
 
Inflation Watch
 
Inflation is back down below the irksome levels of the first quarter. Producer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent and consumer prices two-tenths of 1 percent in May - in line with expectations but still pleasing to most economists. Though the figures reflect a slowing economy, said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company, a healthy six-tenths of 1 percent rise in industrial production last month is likely to keep the Federal Reserve from easing interest rates. ''For manufacturing, the worst is over,'' he said. ''If the Fed can hang on, and the economy doesn't cave in, the Fed's strategy of bringing inflation down ought to work.''

A Federal appeals court threw out the Securities and Exchange Commission's ''one share one vote'' rule that has kept companies from countering hostile takeovers by issuing shares with extra voting rights.

INTERNATIONAL
 
Bush and Salinas Reverse Roles
 
The United States has long urged Mexico to join in a free-trade market ''from the Yukon to the Yucatan.'' Mexico, fearful of economic domination, has long resisted. But last week, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari called on President Bush to say that a trade agreement was the only way to compete with economic blocs coalescing in Europe and the Far East. President Bush responded coolly, endorsing the concept but initiating no talks. Prof. Robert A. Pastor of Emory University, a former director of Latin American affairs for the National Security Council, called it another of the ironic reversals so frequent in the history of relations between Mexico and the United States. ''The U.S. and Mexican presidents have exchanged roles,'' he said. ''Now it's the Mexican President who's eager to move rapidly, and the U.S. President who's dragging his feet.'' To help overcome likely opposition from Democrats and organized labor, Professor Pastor recommends that President Bush quickly appoint a prominent Democrat to negotiate a pact. Otherwise, he said, the foes of free trade in Mexico might regain their sway.
 
In Brief
 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev got a strong lesson in democracy last week. The Soviet Parliament soundly rejected his plan to triple bread prices this summer. But the lawmakers - and lawmakers they now are - did give Mr. Gorbachev authority to break up Government monopolies and stimulate private enterprise.

Losing Steam at the Close

 BODY:
The dollar fizzled as the week ended. It closed slightly lower against the German mark, after managing to trade at times above the key level of 1.70 marks to the dollar. Dealers said the dollar still appeared to be locked in a fairly narrow band of trading, despite the release of a slew of economic indicators in the United States. The reason: The dealers were doubtful that the latest batch of data would spur a change in the Federal Reserve's credit stance. On Friday, a large dollar sale in Europe, rumored to be by West Germany's Bundesbank, slowed whatever momentum the currency had gained from the positive economic data released early in the day. At the close of trading, the dollar finished the week lower against all major currencies.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
A Program That Harnesses Other Software's Strengths

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
It has been less than a month since the Microsoft Corporation introduced Windows 3.0, a major upgrade of its software ''environment'' that overlays the DOS operating system with a quilt of windows, graphical symbols and English-language command menus. Even as Windows 3.0 is being hailed as a breakthrough for office personal computers, however, the Hewlett-Packard Company has come up with something that promises to be even better.
Hewlett-Packard's New Wave 3.0 is another upgraded environment; it wraps around Windows 3.0 just as Windows 3.0 wraps around DOS. It is far more than just another graphical slipcover, however. New Wave has features that Windows does not, including automated ''agents'' that can be created to perform office tasks, extensive help features and computer-based training lessons, and a remarkable facility for getting many different software applications to work together as if they had been built that way. 
''New Wave is going to make the executive's life so much easier,'' said Jim Hammons, vice president of the Sierra Group, a computer industry research company in Tempe, Ariz.
If New Wave can gain wide acceptance, the day may come when executives can send compound documents containing text, spreadsheet tables, charts and graphics, voice annotations and even full-motion video to any other machine on the network, whether the other machines are PC's, minicomputers or mainframes, and whether they run DOS and Windows, or the OS/2 or Unix operating systems. Hewlett-Packard officials said the company is committed to developing OS/2 and Unix versions of New Wave.
''New Wave is an integration tool,'' said John C. McCarthy, director of professional systems research at Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. ''Instead of trying to find or develop one program to handle all of the tasks in an office, with New Wave you can link the best features of what are essentially stand-alone programs from different companies, like Lotus 1-2-3 and Ami Professional, and harness them to meet your needs.''
Because New Wave requires Windows, it inherits all the advantages that Windows has over DOS. These include ease of use, a consistent user interface, adherence to industry standards, better management of the computer's memory, better network support and the ability to have different programs running at the same time in separate windows on the computer screen. New Wave's equipment requirements are similar to those of Windows 3.0 - a fast 80286 or 80386 processor, a hard disk and several megabytes of random access memory.
Like Windows, New Wave can work with virtually any DOS application and any Windows application. But just as Windows 3.0 users must have Windows 3.0 applications in order to take full advantage of the Windows system, New Wave users will want to buy New Wave-specific versions of their favorite programs. So far, only a handful of New Wave or Windows programs are available.
New Wave, which will cost $195 when it becomes available in August, provides a somewhat better graphical interface than Windows 3.0. With Windows the user still has to have some grasp of the way DOS handles computer files; with New Wave, DOS seems to disappear entirely. Gone are the odious DOS directories, paths and file types. On a deeper level, New Wave is significant because it uses a programming technique called object orientation. Object orientation allows software developers to re-use parts of programs that are valuable and to add new programs and features incrementally. Using objects as building blocks, software can be developed relatively easily, quickly and inexpensively; it can be fixed and upgraded more easily, and it can be re-used, said Christopher M. Stone, president of the Object Management Group, an international consortium of 70 computer makers, software developers and corporate computer users.
An object, in the computer sense, is a combination of executable computer code and a set of data. In a conventional computer system, the two are separate. For example, in Windows there might be an icon representing a word processing program, and a separate icon for a document that was created with the application. The document is really just a text file that is essentially lifeless without the application. To the New Wave user, the document is an object that contains not just the data, but also a dynamic hook to the application that created it. When the user clicks the mouse on the document icon, New Wave automatically begins the application.
Windows and Apple Macintosh computers can do that but only in a limited way, by looking for something called a file extension and matching the extension with the application that created it. But they can do it only with a single application. In the era of multiple media, business documents are increasingly composed of parts from several applications. A monthly sales report might include text from a word processor, a table from a spreadsheet, a list of names from a data base, a chart from a graphics program and so forth. With object orientation, the action of the creating application or multiple applications is bound to the data. No matter where the document object goes on the network, it will have a link back to its applications. This shields a user from the tedium of loading applications, exiting a program and loading another.
The ''agent'' function allows the user to perform an operation once, record it and then activate the agent whenever it is needed. For example, an executive might want the agent to gather and assemble the sales report described above and send it automatically to a list of senior officers by electronic mail. New Wave also allows the creation of ''hot links'' among objects, so that if the sales figures in the spreadsheet are changed, those changes will be reflected automatically in the chart in the sales report. As long as all objects adhere to common standards, it makes no difference which brand of hardware or software is used. As a result, parts of many different applications can be cut, pasted, swapped and linked to one another. Such flexibility is impossible under most systems.
Other companies have announced their intention to develop programs with similar abilities. The Digital Equipment Corporation's All-in-1 is closest to reality, but it runs only on Digital machines. The International Business Machines Corporation calls its system Office Vision, and it is still just a vision. Microsoft huffs that it will someday add New Wave-like features directly to Windows.
New Wave, meanwhile, has been endorsed by scores of hardware and software companies, giving it a good chance of emerging as a standard. But that will depend on Hewlett-Packard's marketing.
''If they really want to establish this as a standard, they have to sell it,'' said Mr. McCarthy of Forrester Research. ''It's great technology. The question is, can they effectively market it?''

HEADLINE: Switchbacks Make a Lively Ride for a New I.B.M. Line

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The market for the AS/400 family of minicomputers introduced by the International Business Machines Corporation two years ago hasn't exactly developed in a straight line.
The original target market was small companies ready to upgrade their existing systems. The response was enthusiastic - for a while. But many small companies have decided to make do with what they have or turn instead to a slew of less expensive alternatives, including powerful personal computers that offer many of the same features as the AS/400.
While sales at the lower end of the new midrange line have stalled, however, the more expensive models have found unexpected popularity among bigger companies. Some have even gone so far as to use the AS/400 to join the sweeping industry trend away from stand-alone mainframe systems - including, of course, those made by I.B.M. 
Big I.B.M. customers like Georgia-Pacific, Pepperidge Farms, Arco Chemical and Playboy have all jettisoned their aging mainframes in favor of high-end AS/400 machines. Others, including Harley-Davidson, are in the process of making the switch. And in still another twist, the AS/400 is now competing on the high end with a new family of computers - the Risc System/6000 - that is cheaper to buy and use, and much more easily linked to non-I.B.M. machines, a very appealing feature to big customers. The maker of the new system? Why, I.B.M., of course. The spectacle of its products snatching business from one another - particularly from mainframes, the traditional source of the company's profitability - is just the latest example of I.B.M.'s difficulties in trying to be all things to all customers.
But the marketing surprises wrought by the AS/400 also underscore the dramatic technological changes buffeting the computer industry as a whole. The fast pace of change can turn long-range strategy into sand, even for a company the size of I.B.M.
For the AS/400, that has meant a roller-coaster ride for sales and earnings as one marketing surprise has run into another. Last year's strong results turned into a disappointing first quarter in 1990, for example.
Overall, the AS/400 ''continues to be extremely successful,'' said David Andrews, an AS/400 consultant and an industry analyst at ADM Inc. in Cheshire, Conn. Overseas markets, notably Europe, have been particularly strong. ''But,'' Mr. Andrews added, ''its success is not what I.B.M. originally thought it would be.''
For its part, I.B.M. appears unflustered. Whether it misjudged the American market or not, the company expresses confidence that the line will do well, given its strong capabilities in the business marketplace.
''When you look at the business market, customers don't care'' about technical issues, said Bob E. Dies, assistant general manager for the AS/400. ''They want a business solution; they don't want headaches.''
What's more, I.B.M. says it is not convinced that it misjudged the market all that badly. Business on the low end will pick up as more companies need the kind of solutions that the AS/400 offers, the company argues. And I.B.M. executives, including Mark J. Ryan, director of marketing support for the AS/400 line, play down the extent to which the AS/400 has cut into mainframe sales.
When the AS/400 was introduced with great fanfare in April 1988, I.B.M. touted it as a natural upgrade for the more than 350,000 System/3X minicomputers users worldwide. For years, the company's System/3X had ruled the sleepy domain of small businesses, performing the basic applications for payroll and general ledger, manufacturing and distribution.
When it introduced the AS/400, I.B.M. ran television and print ads targeted directly at the 3X user. The ads, featuring Alan Alda, portrayed the AS/400 as the perfect system for a small business to grow up with. Because so many 3X customers were waiting to upgrade, the introduction of the AS/400 was one of the most successful ever for I.B.M. The company does not break out figures for its product lines, but researchers at ADM estimate that the line generated more than $5 billion in revenue in less than six months.
By the end of 1989, the explosive market for the AS/400 began to slow as fewer 3X users traded up. At the same time, though, large American companies were developing increasing interest in the AS/400.
Some were interested simply in downsizing from mainframes and running the same software programs more economically on smaller machines. Others saw the AS/400 as the vehicle for creating so-called distributed computing networks. These networks spread computing power to sophisticated desktop machines - work stations or personal computers - that can store and retrieve files from specially designed server computers like the AS/400. These machines, known as file servers, are the rage right now because the network approach is cheaper than mainframes yet offers more flexibility and responsiveness in handling commercial applications.
''During 1989, the smaller models of the AS/400 didn't come close to meeting I.B.M.'s expectations,'' said ADM's Mr. Andrews. ''The year was a disaster in terms of unit sales. On the other hand, it was a great year in terms of revenue and profit because sales of the large models blew through the roof.''
According to ADM, I.B.M.'s Application Business System product line, which includes the AS/400, had revenues of $13 billion last year and profits of more than $1 billion. This year, that is expected to grow to $15 billion in sales and $1.5 billion in profits.
But while sales of the AS/400 have remained strong in Europe, the rate of growth has sharply slowed this year in the United States, indicating possible softness not only on the low end but also on the high end.
And ''the AS/400 stood out as one of the weak performers on I.B.M.'s list during the first quarter,'' said Stephen Cohen, an analyst who follows the computer maker for the Soundview Financial Group. (I.B.M. is forecasting a return to strong growth in the second quarter.) Despite all the surprises, many industry analysts say the AS/400 family is assured of a lasting future. The unanswered question is whether the mid-range line will thrive or merely survive.
So far, only a little more than 15 percent of System/3X users have traded up. Increasingly, 3X users are attracted to other alternatives. For example, powerful personal computers, with a wide range of application software, are now selling for a fraction of the cost of the AS/400 line, which ranges in price from $19,000 to $1 million. And PC network companies such as Novell Inc. and the 3Com Corporation have grown rapidly by developing markets for PC networks that don't require minicomputers.
That means a lot is riding on how well the AS/400 performs on the high end. But it is in just that niche that the AS/400 must do battle with the Risc System/6000, which also can function as a network file server.
What makes the RS/6000 particularly attractive is that it runs I.B.M.'s version of the Unix operating system, called AIX. That allows it to communicate easily with machines made by other companies. By contrast, the AS/400 is designed to communicate only with other I.B.M. machines, limiting its flexibility for big customers.
Nonetheless, the AS/400 has several powerful selling points of its own. Each AS/400 has its own built-in database program, which is important to companies that need to connect dozens of offices.
''The attraction for us is in terms of our distributors and dealers,'' said Richard L. Kolbe, director of management information systems for Harley-Davidson, the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker which is in the process of shifting from I.B.M. mainframes to the AS/400. ''We didn't make the decision on the basis of cost savings.''
The AS/400 makes more software applications available to Harley, Mr. Kolbe said, and it ''handshakes nicely with the PS/2 personal computer in a network.''
In the face of the challenges to its mainframes, I.B.M. has switched its marketing strategy for the giant machines. Conceding that mainframes may have outlived their usefulness as a stand-alone system, company executives say they are ideally suited to function as the file-server for networks.
But mainframes may be wrong even for that task, say a growing number of computer managers. They are too costly to purchase, they say, and they require extensive support personnel.
''We saw an opportunity to reduce our operating costs in the data center,'' said Paul Pavloff, senior director for information resources at Georgia-Pacific's building products division. The division has purchased 25 AS/400 machines and is preparing to discard its last I.B.M. mainframe system. (See box.) Is I.B.M. coping well with all the twists and turns that the AS/400 has taken? Mr. Pavloff thinks that the computer maker is catching on and will soon learn to market the AS/400 to large as well as small customers.
''I don't think that I.B.M. ever truly understood what we were doing with their computers,'' he said. ''We opened their eyes.''
 
Decentralizing The Data Center
The building products division of the Georgia-Pacific Corporation is one of a growing number of big I.B.M. customers to dramatically transform the way they are using the company's computers.
The Atlanta-based division has spent the past two years dismantling its mainframe data center and distributing computer power throughout the company, bringing it closer to actual users.
To make the shift, the division now has about 25 of the most powerful AS/400 computers at its headquarters and hundreds of personal computers - and some leftover I.B.M. System/3X minicomputers - in the field. The result is a network that links the division and corporate headquarters to the company's mills and other businesses around the country.
The network controls everything from order entry and invoicing to financial consolidation and electronic mail. By dismantling the corporate data center, the division has been able to eliminate operations personnel and technical support workers.
''The concept is to distribute and simplify the environment,'' said Paul Pavloff, the division's senior director for information resources. ''We believe it represents a better cost structure.'' The shift is a big one for I.B.M. customers like Georgia-Pacific, which traditionally have used so-called hierarchical computer systems. Under this structure, desktop terminals share the computing power of a mainframe.
By abandoning its mainframes, Mr. Pavloff said, Georgia-Pacific is trying ''to duplicate in the I.B.M. environment what companies like Digital now have - a peer-to-peer network computing environment.''
While this shift was once considered a radical departure, it is becoming more and more popular. Indeed, Mr. Pavloff says he regularly gets calls from other companies asking how he convinced his management to move toward network computing.
''Centralized data centers are not real popular in decentralized companies,'' he said. ''The users always feel that the costs are too high and they have no control.''

Incentives for Improving Health Care

BYLINE: By G. ROBERT O'BRIEN; G. Robert O'Brien is president of Cigna Employee Benefits Companies.

 BODY:
I believe that business and government - working together - can maintain or improve the quality of the country's health care system, while making it more accessible to many uninsured Americans. And, most important, America could very substantially reduce the cost of universal health care coverage.
First, employers can make the health care system more cost-effective without sacrificing quality by expanding the use of improved management techniques. To do this, participants in the delivery of health care - employers, insurers, doctors and hospitals - are turning to integrated managed care programs to attack cost inflation and improve efficiency. 
These programs deliver quality care at lower cost by using a network of selected doctors, hospitals and other providers that are under contract and agree to meet standards of quality and cost. At the heart of the provider network is a primary care physician, who does what general practitioners of traditional family medicine were trained to do: diagnose and direct treatment and build strong relationships with patients and families.
A second major step would be to improve the efficiency of Medicare and Medicaid. America's Medicaid program for poor citizens is grossly underfunded. And a recent Congressional Budget Office report forecasts a 31-fold increase during the next 30 years in Medicare expenditures - a jump from $101 billion this year to more than $3 trillion in the year 2020.
Medicare and Medicaid have employed utilization review techniques for a number of years. So why not take the next step and adopt the financial incentives and case management techniques that work in the private sector?
Government should also offer tax and other incentives, for example, to encourage employers to provide health and retirement benefits. Insurers could change underwriting and rating practices - as the industry recently proposed - to make health insurance more affordable for the small employer. Programs that make affordable health plans more readily available to small employers and uninsured workers are critical. We can make our health care system more accessible to those now having difficulty - using the genius of competition and free-market incentives, not coercive government controls.
Until we build a stronger public-private partnership, Corporate America must continue to attack health care cost escalation vigorously and imaginatively. If recent history - both home and abroad - has taught us anything at all, it is that large, bureaucratically organized, carefully planned ''solutions'' to economic problems, like health care, do not work very well.

HEADLINE: The Reverse LBO Survives, but in a Downsized Model

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
The tumult in the equities market and the wreckage of the 1980's ''junk bond'' market has brought many of the nation's financial wizards back down closer to earth. Their leveraged buyouts are no longer flying as high as they were - and selling them back to the public is much harder than it was.
In their heyday, the leveraged buyers reaped the rewards of taking companies private with borrowed money, restructuring them and then cashing in by rapidly selling the indebted companies back to the public.
But the market's appetite for debt-laden companies has largely evaporated, and many of the specialists who have acquired large hunks of corporate America are either very quietly testing the breeze or just waiting for a more receptive climate. According to IDD Information Services of New York City, the number of reverse LBO's coming to market has fallen sharply over the past three years. In 1987, there were 45, with a total value of $2.5 billion. Last year, there were 10, worth $746 million. The pace has picked up recently, but the average reverse LBO is much smaller these days - the 13 deals done so far this year have raised just $709 million - and most analysts expect that trend to continue. 
''The equity market is not receptive to these leveraged companies right now,'' said Frank V. Colombo, a senior vice president and director of high-yield research at Dillon Read & Company.
Some LBO's are doing well and have no need to refinance, he said. For them, attempting to get money out of the existing equity market now would probably mean throwing away possible income. The price at which the stock would sell would probably fall below the company's valuation.
As for the buyout companies that are in trouble, Mr. Colombo said, and most analysts agree, they could not raise money in the equity markets if they wanted to.
''Back in the boom times, it was possible to borrow carloads of money and pay enormous prices for assets with the confidence that those assets would appreciate because someone else could borrow even more to pay to buy them,'' said James Grant, publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a market newsletter.
''The bottom line is that too much money was paid to take some of these companies private and you can't replace all of that with equity,'' added Joseph F. Stivaletti, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company. ''If in the eyes of the investment community that company is not worth as much as was paid for it a few years ago, you're stuck.''
Indeed, there is now often a gulf between the public valuation of these companies and the kind of returns the insiders want on their investment.
Perhaps the most dramatic recent example of a reverse LBO plan that backfired was an offering by TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. It had to be scrapped because potential outside investors were far from pleased with the terms.
Reginald F. Lewis, chairman and chief executive, had acquired TLC Beatrice Foods, an international food company, in a 1987 LBO for about $1 billion. At the time, his record was sparkling from the resale of the McCall Pattern Company, which he had bought in 1984 for $24.5 million - all but $1 million of it borrowed - and sold two years later for $63 million.
After reducing much of the Beatrice acquisition debt by selling off most of the company's non-European divisions, Mr. Lewis moved last fall to sell some stock to the public. He wanted to raise $180 million for creditors and insiders - owners of the privately held stock - who would sell some of their shares. The company offered 18.5 million new shares for $9 to $10.50 each, or nearly 30 times earnings per share.
But critics contended that the company's cash flow was questionable and that the offering was structured to eventually give Mr. Lewis $250 million - at the same time leaving him with 93 percent of the voting stock and the public with shares that were of dubious value. Barron's, for one, argued that it was an attempt to replace junk bonds with overpriced junk stocks while enriching the insiders.
Many LBO's have not even been able stir enough interest to even approach the market, because of their distressed financial condition.
In fact, some have ended up filing for bankruptcy protection. Wall Street just cannot sell such issues. Investors know that in bankruptcy filings, equity investors are the last to be paid.
Even the more highly regarded buyouts are falling short of the wild promises of old.
Safeway Inc., a grocery chain taken private in a $5.65 billion buyout by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company in 1986, failed to sell a 10 percent stake two months ago for as fancy a price as KKR and had hoped. The buyout firm sold 10 million shares to the public at $11.25 a share, getting about $112 million. But both Kohlberg, Kravis and the underwriters, Goldman Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley & Company, had expected a price in the range of $13 to $16 a share - reaching for 30 times earnings.
Robert Natale, editor of Standard & Poor's Emerging & Special Situations newsletter, pointed to the Safeway deal as an excellent indicator of the stock market's lack of appetite for highly leveraged companies. It was widely regarded as a well-structured deal, and the small size of the offering indicated that Kohlberg was looking to put a high valuation on the rest of its Safeway holding and test the waters for reverse deals.
Mr. Coffee's complicated life is also illustrative. The kitchen appliance company was taken private by North American Systems in a $72 million LBO in 1987. It then sought to retire a bridge loan used to help finance the buyout and privately sold about $36 million in junk bonds with 16.5 percent coupons. Then income plummeted as interest expense soared, and it defaulted on the bonds.
So it sold 118,000 shares of preferred stock and 347,222 common stock warrants - much of it to the institutions holding the junk bonds - to help it out of default. In February, it exchanged most of the preferred shares and warrants for common stock, and then tried to sell four million shares in the public market for $11 each. It eventually did sell them - at $10, raising $27 million after expenses - but that hardly solved its problems.
Before the offering, Mr. Coffee had been saddled with about $72 million in long-term debt, representing 83 percent of its capitalization. This debt still above 50 percent of its capitalization, and the proceeds from the public offering will would go mostly to repurchasing the junk bonds. Insiders, who sold one million of the four million shares, had purchased their shares for about $7.63 each. The $10 sale price, then, represented a profit of 31 percent. Not bad for the insiders. But it's far from clear how the company will come out in the end.
Among the many LBO's still on the sidelines waiting for better prices is Warnaco Inc., an apparel manufacturer taken private in 1986 in a $464 million LBO led by Linda Wachner and the investment firm of Adler & Shaykin. Miss Wachner had hoped to take the company public in 1988, but has been delayed by troubles in the markets and in retailing. Still, Warnaco is meeting its debt obligations, and recently raised cash by selling its sportswear division - to a group that included management.
''If the window opens up in the public market, we're going to be there,'' said Miss Wachner. ''But now is not the time to offer these assets to the public because whatever they're worth today will not compare to what they will be worth when retailing is out of intensive care.''
For companies that cannot wait for the market to improve, a ray of hope is the private sale of securities to institutional buyers. These buyers pay enough to help out - but end up owning at least a portion of the companies. For example, last month Caldor's, a discount retailer straining under takeover debt, placed $300 million of securities with 50 institutions. They, in turn, obtained rights to acquire about 12 percent of its equity.
 
THOSE WHO GAIN
Not everyone is suffering miserably with the passing of leveraged buyouts from high favor.
For example, Geneva Steel, a former USX unit, was acquired by its management three years ago for $44 million. Last March, that same management tried to raise $136 million in an initial public offering of stock the company hoped to sell for $14 to $16 a share. The offering had to be scaled back and the company's shares went public at $10 each, raising only $77.5 million.
But the offering was structured so that it would bring spectacular returns to the private stockholders who sold 4.5 million of their shares. According to documents the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, these insiders had paid themselves special dividends in the years since the buyout.
Moreover, they orginally paid an average of 7 1/2 cents per share for their stock - or $864,390 for the 11.7 million shares they purchased. So in selling the 4.5 million shares to the public at $10 each, for a total of $45 million, they had a 133-fold gain.
The proceeds from the 3.25 million shares the company itself sold raised just $32.5 million; funds to be used to improve its antiquated facilities in the difficult and cyclical steel business.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Is Poland Getting Bad Advice?

BYLINE: By AMITAI ETZIONI; Amitai Etzioni, university professor at George Washington University, is author of ''The Moral Dimension.''

 BODY:
Poland is the only country in Eastern Europe that is attempting to rush from a command-and-control economy to a free-market economy. All the other countries have chosen a gradual transition. My prediction is that Poland will not make it. I base my prediction on sociological, psychological and political factors as well as economics. This broader perspective is a long way from American neoclassical economic theory, on which the ''jump now'' advice to Poland is based.
Jump-now economics assumes that Poles are good people held down by bad institutions and that if the institutional overlay of controls is scraped away, their innate qualities of entrepreneurship and industriousness will assert themselves. Thus subsidies have already been slashed, the zloty is now convertible, industries are being privatized, bankruptcies are permissible, prices are being freed to respond to the market, and so on. 
Massive inflation and unemployment have followed these changes. Neo-classical economists call them the short-term costs of adjusting. Soon, champions of the jump predict, the market incentives will work. People will find they must work harder; managers will have to be more innovative, and so on throughout the economy. This, in turn, will increase production, bring prices down, and show the world the merits of the free market.
Neo-classical economists assume people will respond quickly to the changing conditions in which they find themselves. But people respond slowly and partially. In Poland, people have deeply ingrained habits of working inefficiently, of using time at work to shop for goods or produce illicitly on the side. Even in the United States we have a hard time taking a 50-year-old steelworker and turning him into a computer programmer. Imagine the difficulty of taking thousands of Polish Communist Party bureaucrats and making them into productive workers. At best, it will take years.
Poles are enamored of the ''American'' way of life - as depicted on television - but by this they mean a high standard of living, not what is necessary to achieve it. When a McDonald's restaurant opened in Yugoslavia, which is more Westernized than Poland, 40 percent of the workers quit within the first few weeks, saying the work was too hard.
Then there is the infrastructure problem. Poland has little of the financial and communication services a modern economy requires. It has a banking system that is used to dealing almost completely in cash and is only beginning to develop a checking system. Almost everything else is backward, from the telephone systems to the ports. True, bottlenecks are an effective way to spur development, but there are so many bottlenecks in Poland that it may take a decade or more just to develop a semi-modern infrastructure.
The recommendation to jump into capitalism can generate the most dangerous form of sociological dynamite - crashed expectations. Polish hopes were out of kilter to begin with, building on the simplistic assumption that political freedoms can insure economic success. They were based on the faulty assumption that Poland can quickly reach a Western standard of living. These misconceptions are further fanned by the promise of the fruits of capitalism once Government interventions and controls are slashed.
But the brute fact is that whatever Poles do with their $1,920 per capita economy, even if they somehow double it - a feat that took the United States a generation to do in its best days - they will still be a long way from Americans' $18,543 per capita income. We need to do all that we can to moderate the Polish people's expectations so they will steel themselves for the long haul ahead.
Massive Western aid could delay the sociological explosion somewhat, especially if it is aimed at providing massive amounts of consumer goods. This would create the illusion that the transition is working quickly. But unless we are willing to shore up the resulting heightened expectations with still larger amounts of aid, grants, loans and credits, all we shall achieve is a delay in Poland's day of reckoning. The Poles will eventually have to scale down their expectations to levels they can provide, and those will be quite meager for a long time.
The specifics are impossible to foretell, but the main predictions stand out: No country can jump from Communism into capitalism. Poland will have to slow down its transition to a market economy. If it does not, frustrations will increase. Discontent already has some people in Poland urging that Lech Walesa become a dictator. We can only help the Poles if we stop fanning their dangerously unrealistic expectations.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Where's The Cash, Mr. Trump?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Is Donald a deadbeat?
Donald J. Trump's failure to come up with a measly $30 million to pay bondholders at Trump's Castle, which he bought five years ago on amazingly generous, less-than-no-money-down, credit terms, is far from the final chapter of the Trump saga. But the Trump aura will never be the same. 
The money was not paid because squabbling bankers, although willing to advance the cash to Mr. Trump, were unable to agree whether to accept the terms that Mr. Trump had offered. The bond payment was supposed to be made Friday, but there is an automatic 10-day grace period.
''It's the old story,'' said one person close to the negotiations. ''Borrow $2,000 and they'll foreclose in a minute. But borrow $2 billion and you've got them over a barrel.''
Just how big a barrel remains to be seen. In your run-of-the-mill default, the banks have a senior position to any ''junk bond'' holders, and often escape relatively unscathed. But at Trump's Castle, it was the banks that put up the money for Mr. Trump's downpayment and for working capital, while the junk-bond buyers got the first mortgage. If it all falls apart, the bondholders own the casino and hotel. So the banks seem to be unusually ill-secured, at least in that part of the Trump empire. To keep alive hopes of getting their money back, they may need to pour in more cash.
Mr. Trump has the legal right to walk away from the Trump's Castle bonds, leaving the creditors to fight over that casino. But he hasguaranteed other Trump's Castle debts to banks, among them a $50 million mortgage loan from New Jersey's Midlantic Bank and another loan for about $30 million from New York's Manufacturers Hanover. If the Castle goes down, it could start an avalanche.
The banks and Mr. Trump each seemed to recognize the weakness of the other's position, and to be determined to exploit it. Those who have played the game of ''chicken'' - in which two cars speed toward each other and the loser is the one that swerves to avoid a collision - would have been right at home in the negotiations.
So far, Mr. Trump's problems haven't affected the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 73.51 points, to 2,935.89 last week. Bulls seem to be banking on their recollections that credit problems do not always mean bad news for equities. It was eight years ago that Mexico's debt problems burst onto the front pages. The Federal Reserve Board reacted by aggressively easing credit, and the great bull market of the 1980's began. As consumers grow less willing to spend, the Bush Administration is starting to step up the pressure for the Fed to try that course again. ''The credit crunch is not only affecting real estate, but a lot of small and middle-size businesses,'' complained Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
For Mr. Trump, Fed easing might not help that much. Bankers may not be fast learners, but they do catch on. For him, the era of easy credit is unlikely to ever return.

gold Is Not the Safe Haven It Used to Be

BYLINE: By FlOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Gold is supposed to be a safe haven in times of turmoil. But those who fled to it last winter as Communist regimes dissolved in Eastern Europe have suffered since. Last week, gold traded as low as $341 per ounce in London, a four-year low.
The big losers from a falling gold market are the world's two big producers, South Africa and the Soviet Union, both of which need the cash now. There were reports of Soviet selling this month, but when prices bounced off the bottom, there was also speculation of Soviet buying. Given the Soviet Union's perilous economic state, such purchases are unlikely to continue.
As much as a quarter of South African production is now uneconomic, according to Jordan Estra of Oppenheimer & Company in New York. But it remains to be seen whether South Africa will cut off that production, throwing black miners out of work and depriving its economy of needed foreign exchange. If it doesn't, gold's woes are more likely to continue.

HEADLINE: A Capital Offense; Reagan's America

BYLINE: By Kevin P. Phillips; Kevin P. Phillips, a Republican political analyst, is the publisher of The American Political Report. This article is adapted from his new book, ''The Politics of Rich and Poor: Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath,'' published by Random House.

 BODY:
The 1980's were the triumph of Upper America - an ostentatious celebration of wealth, the political ascendancy of the rich and a glorification of capitalism, free markets and finance. Not only did the concentration of wealth quietly intensify, but the sums involved took a megaleap. The definition of who's rich - and who's no longer rich - changed as radically during the Reagan era as it did during the great nouveaux-riches eras of the late 19th century and the 1920's, periods whose excesses preceded the great reformist upheavals of the Progressive era and the New Deal.
But while money, greed and luxury became the stuff of popular culture, few people asked why such great wealth had concentrated at the top and whether this was the result of public policy. Political leaders, even those who professed to care about the armies of homeless sleeping on grates and other sad evidence of a polarized economy, had little to say about the Republican Party's historical role: to revitalize capitalism but also to tilt power, Government largess, more wealth and income toward the richest portion of the population.
The public, however, understood and worried about this Republican bias, if we can trust late 80's opinion polls; nevertheless, the Democrats largely shunned the issue in the '88 election, a reluctance their predecessors also displayed during previous Republican booms of the Gilded Age of the late 19th century and the Roaring Twenties. 
As the decade ended, too many stretch limousines in Manhattan, too many yacht jams off Newport Beach and too many fur coats in Aspen foreshadowed a significant shift of mood. Only for so long would strung-out $35,000-a-year families enjoy magazine articles about the hundred most successful businessmen in Dallas. Class structures may be weak in the United States, but populist sentiments run high. The political pendulum has swung in the past, and may be ready to swing again.
Indeed, money politics - be it avarice of financiers or the question of who will pay for the binges of the 80's - is shaping up as a prime theme for the 1990's. As we shall see, there is a historical cycle to such shifts: Whenever Republicans are in power long enough to transform economic policy from a middle-class orientation to capitalist overdrive, the rich get so far ahead that a popular reaction inevitably follows, with the Democrats usually tagging along, rather than leading.
But this time, the nature of the reaction against excess is likely to be different. The previous gilded ages occurred when America was on the economic rise in the world. The 1980's, on the other hand, turned into an era of paper entrepreneurialism, reflecting a nation consuming, rearranging and borrowing more than it built. For the next generation of populists who would like to rearrange American wealth, the bad news is that a large amount of it has already been redistributed - to Japan, West Germany and to the other countries that took Reagan-era I.O.U.'s and credit slips.S
SOCIETY MATRONS, WALL STREET ARBITRAGEURS, PALM Beach real-estate agents and other money-conscious Americans picking up USA Today on May 22, 1987, must have been at first bewildered and then amused by the top story. In describing a Harris survey of the attitudes of upper-bracket citizens, the article summed up the typical respondent as ''rich. Very. He's part of the thinnest economic upper crust: households with incomes of more than $100,000 a year.''
A surprising number of 1980's polls and commentaries contributed to this naive perception - that ''rich'' somehow started at $50,000 or $100,000 a year, and that gradations above that were somehow less important. The truth is that the critical concentration of wealth in the United States was developing at higher levels - decamillionaires, centimillionaires, half-billionaires and billionaires. Garden-variety American millionaires had become so common that there were about 1.5 million of them by 1989.
In fact, even families with what seemed like good incomes - $50,000 a year, say, in Wichita, Kan., or $90,000 a year in New York City (almost enough to qualify as ''rich,'' according to USA Today) - found it hard to make ends meet because of the combined burden of Federal income and Social Security taxes, plus the soaring costs of state taxes, housing, health care and children's education. What few understood was that real economic status and leisure-class purchasing power had moved higher up the ladder, to groups whose emergence and relative affluence Middle America could scarcely comprehend.
No parallel upsurge of riches had been seen since the late 19th century, the era of the Vanderbilts, Morgans and Rockefellers. It was the truly wealthy, more than anyone else, who flourished under Reagan. Calculations in a Brookings Institution study found that the share of national income going to the wealthiest 1 percent rose from 8.1 percent in 1981 to 14.7 percent in 1986. Between 1981 and 1989, the net worth of the Forbes 400 richest Americans nearly tripled. At the same time, the division between them and the rest of the country became a yawning gap. In 1980, corporate chief executive officers, for example, made roughly 40 times the income of average factory workers. By 1989, C.E.O.'s were making 93 times as much. Finance alone built few billion-dollar fortunes in the 1980's relative to service industries like real estate and communications, but it is hard to overstate Wall Street's role during the decade, partly because Federal monetary and fiscal policies favored financial assets and because deregulation promoted new debt techniques and corporate restructuring.
Selling stock to retail clients, investment management firms or mutual funds paid well; repackaging, remortgaging or dismantling a Fortune 500 company paid magnificently. In 1981, analysts estimate, the financial community's dozen biggest earners made $5 million to $20 million a year. In 1988, despite the stock-market collapse the October before, these earnings were $50 million to $200 million.
The redistribution of American wealth raised questions not just about polarization, but also about trivialization. Less and less wealth was going to people who produced something. Services were ascendant - from fast food to legal advice, investment vehicles to data bases. It is one thing for new technologies to reduce demand for obsolescent professions, enabling society to concentrate more resources in emerging sectors like health and leisure. But the distortion lies in the disproportionate rewards to society's economic, legal and cultural manipulators - from lawyers and financial advisers to advertising executives, merchandisers, media magnates and entertainers. A related boom and distortion occurred in nonfinancial assets - art and homes, in particular. Art and antiques appreciated fourfold in the Reagan era, to the principal benefit of the richest 200,000 or 300,000 families. Similar if lesser explosions in art prices took place in the Gilded Age and in the 1920's. While the top one-half of 1 percent of Americans rolled in money, the luxuries they craved - from Picassos and 18th-century English furniture to Malibu beach houses - soared in markets virtually auxiliary to those in finance.
Meanwhile, everyone knew there was pain in society's lower ranks, from laid-off steelworkers to foreclosed farmers. A disproportionate number of female, black, Hispanic and young Americans lost ground in the 1980's, despite the progress of upscale minorities in each category. According to one study, for example, the inflation-adjusted income for families with children headed by an adult under 30 collapsed by roughly one-fourth between 1973 and 1986.
Even on an overall basis, median family and household incomes showed only small inflation-adjusted gains between 1980 and 1988. Middle America was quietly hurting too.
While corporate presidents and chairmen feasted in the 1980's, as many as 1.5 million midlevel management jobs are estimated to have been lost during those years. Blue-collar America paid a larger price, but suburbia, where fathers rushed to catch the 8:10 train to the city, was counting its casualties, too. ''Middle managers have become insecure,'' observed Peter F. Drucker in September 1988, ''and they feel unbelievably hurt. They feel like slaves on an auction block.''
AMERICAN TRANSITIONS OF THE MAGNITUDE OF the capitalist blow-out of the 1980's have usually coincided with a whole new range of national economic attitudes. Evolving government policies - from tax cuts to high interest rates - seem distinct, but they are actually linked. Whether in the late 19th century, the 1920's or the 1980's, the country has witnessed, ensemble, conservative politics, a reduced role for government, entrepreneurialism and admiration of business, corporate restructuring and mergers, tax reduction, declining inflation, pain in states that rely on commodities like oil and wheat, rising inequality and concentration of wealth, and a buildup of debt and speculation. The scope of these trends has been impressive - and so has their repetition, though the two heydays of the 20th century have involved increasingly more paper manipulation and less of the raw vigor typical of the late 19th-century railroad and factory expansion.
Federal policy from 1981 to 1988 enormously affected investment, speculation and the creation and distribution of wealth and income, just as in the past.
The reduction or elimination of Federal income taxes was a goal in previous capitalist heydays. But it was a personal preoccupation for Ronald Reagan, whose antipathy toward income taxes dated back to his high-earning Hollywood days, when a top tax bracket of 91 percent in the late 40's made it foolish to work beyond a certain point. Under him, the top personal tax bracket would drop from 70 percent to 28 percent in only seven years. For the first time since the era of Franklin D. Roosevelt, tax policy was fundamentally rearranging its class loyalties.
Reaganite theorists reminded the country that the Harding-Coolidge income tax cuts - from a top rate of 73 percent in 1920 to 25 percent in 1925 - helped create the boom of the 20's. Back then, just as in the 80's, the prime beneficiaries were the top 5 percent of Americans, people who rode the cutting edge of the new technology of autos, radios and the like, emerging service industries, including new practices like advertising and consumer finance, a booming stock market and unprecedented real-estate development. Disposable income soared for the rich and with it, conspicuous consumption and financial speculation. After the 1929 crash and the advent of the New Deal, tax rates rose again; the top rate reached 79 percent by 1936 and 91 percent right after the war. In 1964, the rate fell in two stages, to 77 percent and then to 70 percent.
Under Reagan, Federal budget policy, like tax changes, became a factor in the realignment of wealth, especially after the 1981-82 recession sent the deficit soaring. The slack was made up by money borrowed at home and abroad at high cost. The first effect lay in who received more Government funds. Republican constituencies - military producers and installations, agribusiness, bondholders and the elderly - clearly benefited, while decreases in social programs hurt Democratic interests and constituencies: the poor, big cities, subsidized housing, education. Equally to the point, the huge payments of high-interest charges on the growing national debt enriched the wealthy, who bought the bonds that kept Government afloat.
Prosperous individuals and financial institutions were beneficiaries of Government policies in other ways. Starting in the Carter years, Congress began to deregulate the financial industry; but the leap came in the early 1980's, when deposit and loan interest ceilings were removed. To attract deposits, financial institutions raised their interest rates, which rose and even exceeded record postwar levels. The small saver profited, but the much larger gain, predictably, went to the wealthy. (The benefits of high interest were intensified, of course, by the declining maximum tax rate on dividend and interest income. The explosion of after-tax unearned income for the top 1 percent of Americans was just that - an explosion.) The savings and loan crisis now weighing on American taxpayers also had roots in deregulation. Before 1982, federally chartered S. & L.'s were required to place almost all their loans in home mortgages, a relatively safe and stable class of assets. But in 1982, after soaring interest rates turned millions of low-interest mortgages into undesirable assets, a new law allowed S. & L.'s to invest their funds a lot more freely - 100 percent in commercial real-estate ventures if they so desired. Like banks in the 1920's, many thrifts proceeded to gamble with their deposits, and by 1988, many had lost. Gamblers and speculators enriched themselves even as they stuck other Americans with the tab.
Reagan's permissiveness toward mergers, antitrust enforcement and new forms of speculative finance was likewise typical of Republican go-go conservatism. Unnerving parallels were made between the Wall Street raiders of the 1980's - Ivan Boesky and T. Boone Pickens - and the takeover pools of the 1920's, when high-powered operators would combine to ''boom'' a particular stock. For a small group of Americans at the top, the pickings were enormous.
An egregious misperception of late 20th-century politics is to associate only Democrats with extremes of debt. Before 1933, conservatives - Federalists, Whigs and Republicans alike - sponsored Government indebtedness and used high-interest payments to redistribute wealth upward. In the 1920's, individual, consumer and corporate debt kept setting record levels, aided by new techniques like installment purchases and margin debt for purchasing securities. In addition, Republican eras were noted for a huge expansion of private debt.
In the kindred 80's, total private and public debt grew from $4.2 trillion to more than $10 trillion. And just as they had 60 years earlier, new varieties of debt became came an art form.
Government fiscal strategists were equally loose. In part to avoid the deficit-reduction mandates of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, they allowed Federal credit programs, including student and housing loans, to balloon from $300 billion in 1984 to $500 billion in 1989.
In contrast to previous capitalist blowouts, the fast-and-loose Federal debt strategies of the 80's did not simply rearrange assets within the country but served to transfer large amounts of the nation's wealth overseas as well. America's share of global wealth expanded in the Gilded Age and again in the 1920's. The late 1980's, however, marked a significant downward movement: one calculation, by the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun, had Japan overtaking the United States, with estimated comparative assets of $43.7 trillion in 1987, versus $36.2 trillion for the United States.
The United States was losing relative(Continued on Page 40) purchasing power on a grand scale. There might be more wealthy Americans than ever before, but foreigners commanded greater resources. On the 1989 Forbes list of the world's billionaires, excluding royalty, eight of the top 25 were Japanese, 10 were European and four were American. Dollar millionaires, once the envy of the world, were becoming an outdated elite.
This shift partly reflected the ebb of America's postwar preeminence. Yet the same Reagan policies that moved riches internally also accelerated the shift of world wealth, beginning with the budget deficits of the early 1980's but intensifying after the ensuing devaluation of the dollar from 1985 to 1988.
If the devalued dollar made the Japanese, French and Germans relatively richer, it also increased their purchasing power in the United States, turning the country into a bargain basement for overseas buyers. This is the explanation for the surging foreign acquisition of properties, from Fortune 500 companies to Rockefeller Center in Manhattan and a large share of the office buildings in downtown Los Angeles.
The dollar's decline also pushed per capita gross national product and comparative wages in the United States below those of a number of Western European nations. The economist Lester C. Thurow summed up the predicament: ''When it comes to wealth, we can argue about domestic purchasing power. But, in terms of international purchasing power, the United States is now only the ninth wealthiest country in the world in terms of per capita G.N.P. We have been surpassed by Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, West Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Japan.''
Not everyone looked askance at foreign wealth and investment. American cities and states welcomed it. From the textile towns of South Carolina to the rolling hills of Ohio, foreigners were helping declining regions to reverse their fate. Yet as Warren Buffett, the investor, said: ''We are much like a wealthy family that annually sells acreage so that it can sustain a life style unwarranted by its current output. Until the plantation is gone, it's all pleasure and no pain. In the end, however, the family will have traded the life of an owner for the life of a tenant farmer.''
Nowhere was Japanese investment more invasive than in Hawaii, where real-estate moguls from Tokyo pronounced the property they were grabbing up as ''almost free.'' An economist at a Hawaiian bank warned that the state was ''a kind of test lab for what's facing the whole country.'' Indeed, in 1988, broader foreign ambitions were apparent. The author Daniel Burstein quoted Masaaki Kurokawa, then head of Japan's Nomura Securities International, who raised with American dinner guests the possibility of turning California into a joint United States-Japanese economic community.
Public concern over America's international weakness had been a factor in Ronald Reagan's election back in 1980. Voters had wanted a more aggressive leader than Jimmy Carter. For various reasons, the great things promised were not delivered. Reagan could re-create a sense of military prowess with his attacks on Grenada and Libya. But in the global economy he took a country that had been the world's biggest creditor in 1980 and turned it into the world's largest debtor. Despite opinion polls documenting public concern about this erosion, surprisingly little was made of the issue in the 1988 Presidential campaign, possibly because the Democrats could not develop a coherent domestic and international alternative.
MUCH OF THE NEW emphasis in the 1980's on tax reduction and the aggressive accumulation of wealth reflected the Republican Party's long record of support for unabashed capitalism. It was no fluke that three important Republican supremacies coincided with and helped generate the Gilded Age, the Roaring Twenties and the Reagan-Bush years.
Part of the reason survival-of-the-fittest periods are so relentless, however, rests on the performance of the Democrats as history's second-most enthusiastic capitalist party. They do not interfere with capitalist momentum, but wait for excesses and the inevitable popular reaction.
In the United States, elections arguably play a more important cultural and economic role than in other lands. Because we lack a hereditary aristocracy or Establishment, our leadership elites and the alignment of wealth are more the product of political cycles than they are elsewhere. Capitalism is maneuvered more easily in the United States, pushed in new regional and sectoral directions. As a result, the genius of American politics - failing only in the Civil War - has been to manage through ballot boxes the problems that less fluid societies resolve with barricades and with party structures geared to class warfare.
Because we are a mobile society, Americans tolerate one of the largest disparities in the industrial world between top and bottom incomes, as people from the middle move to the top, and vice versa. Opportunity has counted more than equality. But if circulating elites are a reality, electoral politics is an important traffic controller. From the time of Thomas Jefferson, the nation has undulated in 28- to 36-year waves as each watershed election puts a new dominant region, culture, ideology or economic interest (or combination) into the White House, changing the country's direction. But after a decade or two, the new forces lose touch with the public, excessively empower their own elites and become a target for a new round of populist reform. Only the United States among major nations reveals such recurrent electoral behavior over two centuries.
The Republicans rode such a wave into office in 1968, as a middle-class, anti-elite correction, successfully squelching the social permissiveness and disorder of the 60's. Significantly, each Republican coalition - from Lincoln's to Nixon's - began by emphasizing national themes and unity symbols, while subordinating commercial and financial interests.
But it is the second stage - dynamic capitalism, market economics and the concentration of wealth - that the Republican Party is all about. When Republicans are in power long enough, they ultimately find themselves embracing limited government, less regulation of business, reduced taxation, disinflation and high real interest rates. Over America's first two centuries, these policies shaped the three periods that would incubate the biggest growth of American millionaires (or, by the 1980's, billionaires). History suggests that it takes a decade or more for the Republican Party to shift from broad middle-class nationalism into capitalist overdrive, and the lapse of 12 years between the first Nixon inauguration in 1969 and the first Reagan inauguration repeats this transformation. Nixon, like the previous Republican nationalist presidents Lincoln and William McKinley, was altogether middle class, as was his ''new majority'' Republicanism. He had no interest in unbridled capitalism during his 1969-74 presidency.
In fact, many of the new adherents recruited for the Republican coalition in 1968 and 1972 were wooed with the party's populist attacks on inflation, big government, social engineering and the Liberal Establishment. Many Republican voters of that era embraced outsider and anti-elite values, and like similar participants in previous Republican national coalitions, they would become uneasy in the 1980's as Reagan or Bush Republicanism embraced Beverly Hills or Yale culture and the economics of leveraged buyouts, not of Main Street. Besides this uneasiness, reflected in opinion polls, a second sign that a conservative cycle is moving toward its climax has been the extent to which Democratic politics has been cooperative: when wealth is in fashion, Democrats go along. The solitary Democratic President of the Gilded Age, Grover Cleveland, was a conservative with close Wall Street connections. In the 20's, the Democratic Presidential nominees in both 1920 (James Cox, an Ohio publisher) and 1924 (John W. Davis, a corporate lawyer) were in the Cleveland mold. Even Alfred E. Smith, who ran in 1928, would eventually oppose Roosevelt and the New Deal. In the 20's, Congressional Democrats competed with Republicans to cut upper-bracket and corporate taxes.
Fifty years later, Jimmy Carter, the only Democratic President to interrupt the long Republican hegemony after 1968, was accused by the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. of an ''eccentric effort to carry the Democratic Party back to Grover Cleveland.'' Despite his support for substantial new Federal regulation, Carter clearly deviated from his party's larger post-New Deal norm. He built foundations that would become conservative architecture under Reagan: economic deregulation; capital gains tax reduction and the tight-money policies of the Federal Reserve. (The Fed's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, was a Carter appointee.) Congressional Democrats even echoed their policies of the 1920's by colluding in the bipartisan tax-bracket changes of 1981 and 1986.
Thus, the Democrats could hardly criticize Reagan's tax reductions. For the most part, they laid little groundwork for an election-year critique in 1988, leaving the issue to Jesse Jackson, whose appeal was limited by his race and third-world rhetoric, and to noncandidates like Mario M. Cuomo. Michael S. Dukakis was obviously uncomfortable with populist politics. Though several consultants and economists urged him to pick up the theme of economic inequality, Dukakis made competence, not ideology, his initial campaign issue. Only in late October, with his campaign crumbling, did the Democratic candidate reluctantly convert to a more traditional party line. It came too late.
Republican strategists could hardly believe their luck. Said Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, after the election: ''The way to win a Presidential race against the Republicans is to develop the class-warfare issue, as Dukakis did at the end - to divide up the haves and have-nots and to try to reinvigorate the New Deal coalition and to attack.''
On the surface, this was a missed Democratic opportunity. But the lesson of history is that the party of Cleveland, Carter and Dukakis has rarely rushed its anti-elite corrective role. There would be no rush again in 1988 - nor, indeed, in 1989.
early in his presidency, George Bush replaced the Coolidge portrait hung by Ronald Reagan in the White House with one of Theodore Roosevelt, reflecting Bush's belief in T. R.'s commitment to conservation, patrician reform and somewhat greater regulatory involvement.
Yet there has not been toomuch evidence of a kinder, gentler America beyond softer, more conciliatory rhetoric. The budget remained unkind to any major expansion of domestic programs, and Bush's main tax objective was a reduction in the capital gains rate, a shift that critics said would continue to concentrate benefits among the top 1 percent of Americans.
By spring 1990, Washington politicians confronted the most serious debt- and credit-related problems since the bank failures, collapsed stock prices, farm foreclosures and European war debt defaults of the Great Depression. From the S. & L. bailout to junk bonds, from soaring bankruptcies and shaky real-estate markets to Japanese influence in the bond market, Federal policy makers were forced to realize that a crucial task - and peril - of the 1990's would involve cleaning up after the previous decade's credit-card parties and speculative distortions.
In May, the facade of successful deficit reduction crumbled as Administration officials confessed that bailing out insolvent savings and loans could cost as much as a half-trillion dollars. As it became clear that taxes would have to rise and social programs would suffer further reductions - financially troubled states were already cutting food allotments for poor women and children - even the Democrats who had previously collaborated with Republican economics began to argue that the rich who had made so much money in the 80's should bear a larger share of the new burdens of the 90's.
Some Republicans shared this disquiet. The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Russell, Kan., insisted in late 1989 that if the White House wanted to cut capital gains taxes for the prosperous, it should also raise the minimum wage for the poor. Last month, the House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel of Peoria, Ill., was reported to favor an increase in the tax rate for the top 1 percent of Americans, from 28 percent to 33 percent. The second-ranking G.O.P. leader in the House, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, suggested in April that conservatives, too, had to develop some ideas for economic redistribution.''
Meanwhile, opinion poll after opinion poll has shown lopsided voter support for raising the income tax rate for people making more than $80,000, $100,000 or $200,000. By last year, the popular culture was rejecting the greed and glitz of ''Dynasty'' and ''Dallas,'' and even the editor of Soap Opera Digestsaid that rich is out. The relevant culture of the 1990's, by contrast, seemed ready to reflect a new anti-Wall Street, anti-corporate and anti-greed mentality set forth in books (and coming movies) like ''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' ''Liar's Poker'' and ''Barbarians at the Gate.''
Nor was the changing mood apparent only in the United States. Kindred psychologies and political analyses could also be seen in other countries like Britain, Japan and Canada, where 1980's financial and real-estate booms likewise concentrated wealth in the hands of the rich and increased economic inequity. A headline last month in the Financial Times of London could have been written in the United States: ''The Rich Get Nervous.''
Whether the populist reactions that followed past boom periods recur in the 90's no one can know. But there could be no doubt that the last decade ended as it had begun: with a rising imperative for a new political and economic philosophy, and growing odds that the 1990's will be a very different chapter than the 1980's in the annals of American wealth and power.

It would be facile to say that the Paris fall showings were a mess. It would be more candid, though, to describe the mise en scene as an eclectic melange. The collections were full of clothes that were, by turns, scrambles of rearranged themes from the past, reruns of 1960's affectations, lifts from theatrical turns, references to L. L. Bean and other such sporty territories, quick tours of costumery from formerly Iron Curtain countries and contented continuations of status quo style.
What this mix signaled was not so much indecision as stalling. Designers in Paris, like those in New York and Milan, are marking time since they sense that now is not the moment to launch a major style upheaval. Consumers would probably not accept it; certainly the wavering fashion economy could not handle it. Better to just stroke and tweak old ideas. Of course, because this fashion collage was assembled in Paris, it was brilliantly done. The collections, as a whole, sparkled with wit. Details and accessories were amusing and inventive.
There were enough ideas to copy to keep the rest of the world's fashion markets supplied for more than one season. And as wild as some of the styles seemed, they - or parts of them - were actually not so extreme that fashionable women would not find them wearable. Provided, that is, that they could afford them. 
Silhouettes were much as they have been, smaller in the shoulder and shaping gently to the body. Almost all skirts were short-short (though, of course, those shipped to American stores will be sent at around knee-length). Like their counterparts in New York, several designers are experimenting with skirt fullness, not always successfully. Jackets were important and usually longer in line, often reaching to the finger tips. Colors, blasts of them, were often used together in one outfit, almost obscuring the neutrals of gray and brown and definitely eclipsing black. Fabrics were mixed together, and tweed was often combined with velvet for day wear. Bodysuits and leggings were at the base of many styles. Boots staged a comeback, including the 60's over-the-knee styles. Hair styles, wigs and headbands were more 60's touches.
Stretch fibers that give all manner of fabric mobility is the most modern idea in today's fashion, and there was lots of it in Paris.
Christian Lacroix's collection best summed up the current mood of Paris. Although Lacroix, in his 1987 couture show, launched the pouf silhouette that and made him famous, his ready-to-wear efforts have subsequently been disappointing. Buyers and the press have consistently found them to be too diffuse and confusing. This time, though, everyone raved. The designer was genuinely amazed by the reception. ''I honestly don't understand it,'' he said, rolling his large brown eyes and raising his expressive brows. ''I don't even like this collection because it is nothing new. I made what I have always made because I wanted it to be easy.'' (Lacroix had been ill for months with back problems.) What made this fall's Lacroix collection so successful was that the general cycle of fashion has caught up with what he has always attempted. That is to mix and mash patterns, textures and unexpected items of clothing together with panache. Then he loads on piles of amusing and inventively designed accessories.
Emanuel Ungaro is the other master of the mix. He is also a master craftsman. As a result, you can take apart any Ungaro outfit and each item will stand by itself as fascinating fashion.
Yves Saint Laurent was hospitalized during collection week, and, of course, his absence showed. His presentation, though filled with very nice, if familiar, fashions for Saint Laurent devotees, lacked the usual flickers of imaginative pairings and the fire of his unexpected accessorizing. Jean-Paul Gaultier is also a great ''mixer upper'' of style. But his genre of design is not for the ladies who lunch. He aims his work at the sharp avant-garde young women who want to dare and be damned if they are not noticed. His clothes - as always, beautifully and knowledgeably executed - tossed together most of the current fashion icons. There were tailored men's-wear suits, sequins, hand-painted ''message'' T-shirts, Norwegian patterned sweaters, sexy theatrical stuff, thick working mens' boots and shoes, hardy outerwear and more than a few just plain outrageous revelations of nudity. The latter Gaultier manifests in body or tailored men's pants suits that, viola!, were practically bare behind. All this frolicking around somewhat camouflages the fact that he is not adventuring into new territory.
The other master showman of Paris's pret-a-porter is Thierry Mugler. Retailers report that when they got to his showroom to place orders, there were the usual sexy suits he always produces. His presentation was something else. It was a professionally staged cabaret performance with some of the world's most famous fashion models outfitted to look more gorgeous and leggy than the best of Las Vegas. They were wearing 60's style wigs, fishnet tights and marvelously imaginative costumes glittering with masses of rhinestones or Day-Glo colors. But none of this is new for Mugler.
In standing still, Mugler had several, disparate confreres. They ranged from the inventor of sexy sweaters and sportswear, Sonia Rykiel, to those makers of elegant style, the suave Messrs. Valentino and Givenchy, to, oddly enough, the out-of-town mavericks, Italy's Romeo Gigli and Japan's Issey Miyake.
Gigli, who recently electrified the Paris scene, showed more of the same. There were the plain, clinging jersey dresses, the pants suits with swallowtail jackets and stovepiped trousers, the cocoon capes and the wrapped dressings of rich embroidered fabrics. There was no forward movement whatsoever. (The designer has since said he may only show a collection once a year, because once is enough. He may be right.) Miyake kept on his abstract way, suggesting that clothes should be moveable sculptures. He continued to use the interesting Japanese-developed synthetic fabrics that allow him to create these inventions, and out came new versions of clothes that jut out, cave in and sway as the wearer walks.
Perhaps because of this holding pattern, some of the most interesting collections in Paris were those that were, above all, classic. The work of Claude Montana, Hermes, Gianfranco Ferre for Dior and one strain of Karl Lagerfeld's opus for the house of Chanel were deeply satisfying. Montana, who has made some of the most forward style statements over the years, chose this time to present a peerless rendition of his dashing classics. There were the gray-flannel suits, the jackets nipped at the waist and curved precisely over the hips. Little flicks of silver ornaments were placed to point up the seaming. There were swashbuckling short coats with face-framing cape collars, their peplums swinging out from sashed waists. All in all, it was a quietly spectacular showing. Some said Montana mounted this show as a reaction to the trouncing he received last winter, when he attempted his first couture collection for the venerable house of Lanvin. The house of Hermes has been quietly edging up into the realm of important clothing design for the last few seasons, while simultaneously the avarice for their luxurious accessories has been rapidly increasing around the world. Under the direction of Claude Brouet, previously a respected French fashion editor, Hermes's collections are getting to be first-rate. And in a season when sybaritic classicism looked refreshing, so did the firm's impeccably made jackets, coats and jodphurs, not to wear on the horse but on the streets. Its bodysuit, printed with a scarf pattern, was a knockout. After a rocky beginning, the Milanese designer Gianfranco Ferre has begun establishing a strong, if strict, dramatic look for Dior. There, classicism also reigned. The house's legendary workmanship and the luxurious materials contributed to Ferre's retelling of themes, such as shapely jacketed suits, parkas over blousons and narrow pants and dramatic evening blouses with swooshing skirts.
Nowhere near in luxe of fabrication, and workmanship, but nevertheless of the same attitude, is the work of the Austrian Helmut Lang, who shows in Paris. A favorite of young fashion aficionados and editors, his clothes are minimal to the nth degree. His severely simple stretch bodysuits in navy and black, or his short sashed coats over same, are elegant in a sporty way.
Now to look at the work of Karl Lagerfeld, the most prolific designer on the world scene. Lagerfeld designs the Fendi collections in Italy and also makes one in Paris under his own label. Both are often filled with interesting trends and ideas. But it is his work for the house of Chanel that interests fashion followers the most.
For fall, he has flung out, as usual, ideas upon ideas. He has ''Chaneled up'' versions of the current trends, including 60's influences, outdoor gear such as parkas, bodysuits, mixes of colors of fabrics, colors, etc. There were enough accessory suggestions to keep that end of the market supplied with inspiration for some time. Maybe it all looked like too much on the runway. Lagerfeld was criticized by some reviewers, who suggested that he had finally made Chanel ''vulgar.'' But the truth is that Lagerfeld has been ''vulgarizing'' the Chanel image since he took over its design direction in 1983. Since then, the success of Chanel has been stupendous. Other old-name Paris houses naturally hope to imitate the Chanel resuscitation. The latest moves in that direction have come from Lanvin. Its first failure was with Claude Montana's premiere couture collection. (But the July showing may prove different.) When it came to the fall ready-to-wear collection, a talented young designer, Eric Bergere, was given the job. Then, according to Bergere's friends, an English fashion stylist was elevated over him as a supervisor and changed everything he had in mind. Whatever transpired, the collection was a mistake. Additionally, the clothes were badly made. By now, it must be clear to whomever tries a Chanel-like renaissance, there is only one Karl Lagerfeld.
In the end, what the fall ready-to-wear collections in Paris proved is that many looks are valid today. Not every one, but many. Perhaps the most modern thinking is not to expect the day when one major shift will influence fashion everywhere. this one Fashion: European Report BY CARRIE DONOVAN PHOTOGRAPHS BY DAN LECCA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Paris Mixing It All Up Scrambled 'Ouevre's' Clothes made from wild melanges of fabrics, patterns, ethnic inspirations and 1960's influences dominated the Paris collections for fall.

GORBACHEV
Heretic in the Kremlin.
By Dusko Doder and Louise Branson.
450 pp. New York:
Viking. $24.95.
The face of Mikhail S. Gorbachev has become so familiar that we feel we know him better than we really do. And notwithstanding his wild popularity among Americans demonstrated just two weeks ago, he is in truth a puzzling and enigmatic figure, and is becoming more so as his troubles deepen.
We don't really know, to start with, how it came about that a man raised in the service of the Communist Party turned out to be such a radical reformer. Nor do we fully know if he started out with the intention of making controlled changes in the Soviet system in order to save it from stagnation, only to discover that he had set in motion an avalanche of unintended consequences and found himself presiding over the decline of the party and the disintegration of the Soviet empire, perhaps of the Soviet Union itself. 
On the personal level, we cannot be sure whether, in grappling with such intractable problems as the collapse of the economy, the drive toward independence of the Baltic and other national republics, the violence of nationality groups in the south and the polarization of Soviet politics, he is a master politician playing a shrewd tactical game, or is - as his critics and even some of his associates now say - a stubborn, stiff-necked, arrogant man. (I find myself thinking of something Dean G. Acheson once said when he was Secretary of State and I was working for him. We were driving through the streets of Rome, I believe it was, when we passed a statue of George Washington. ''Sometimes,'' Acheson observed, ''it is only in retrospect and in the light of how things work out that you can distinguish stubbornness from determination.'') To take the enigma of Mr. Gorbachev one step further: it is not clear whether his present efforts to gather autocratic authority into his hands reflect a personal taste for power, or a reluctant acceptance of the necessity for strong authoritarian leadership to effect a transition to a market economy and self-government under the rule of law. Nor whether even with these enhanced powers, his vacillations and delays reflect a personal indecisiveness, an understandable drain on his phenomenal stamina or our underestimation of the complex resistance he is encountering.
These are among the questions that come to mind in reading ''Gorbachev: Heretic in the Kremlin,'' by two respected journalists, Dusko Doder, the former Moscow bureau chief for The Washington Post, and Louise Branson, the former Moscow correspondent for The Sunday Times of London. The book is a narrative interpretation, written for a popular audience. As conscientious reporters with unusual access to many of the responsible actors, Mr. Doder and Ms. Branson convey a sense of the excitement attending the most intriguing political drama of our time. They cover events in considerable detail from Mr. Gorbachev's rise to power in March 1985 to the end of 1988. Their reporting is somewhat more sketchy for the period before 1985, and from 1989 to the early months of this year. (For Mr. Gorbachev's early life and career, readers will find Zhores A. Medvedev's 1986 biography more comprehensive and analytical.) The narrative jumps about a bit, and it does not pretend to provide final answers to the questions surrounding Mr. Gorbachev, but it is a useful reminder for general readers of the roller-coaster volatility of the tumultuous events of the last five years.
Mr. Doder and Ms. Branson have wrestled hard and, in the end, vainly with the problem of explaining how a man who saw himself as a committed Communist (''I am a communist, a convinced communist'') could come to see the Communist Party as an obstacle to be overcome. They note that as a law student, Mr. Gorbachev read such Western and non-Marxist thinkers as Rousseau, Aquinas, Hobbes, Machiavelli and Mill. They point out that he confided in friends his realization that in his native village the Stalinist system had not worked as pictured in the official propaganda, particularly in agriculture. And they explain that the experiences of his youth, including the arrest of his grandfather and the training in religious and traditional Russian values that he received from his mother and grandmother had taken him far from the fundamentalist dogma of the party. As a result, when he inaugurated his reforms, he perceived himself as working within the system, and saw no contradiction between the party and democratization.
The book portrays Mr. Gorbachev as an empiricist, not an intellectual - a man with an interest in ideas as tools and a deep faith in rationality, convinced that people would act reasonably if the facts were explained to them. Thus he was unprepared for the resistance he encountered from the party apparatus and from the ingrained conservatism of the population. Neither was he ready for the irrational, extreme behavior among some sectors of the nationalist minorities, for which he has shown little insight.
Through his glasnost campaign, to which he turned in his second year as General Secretary, Mr. Gorbachev hoped to make allies of the intelligentsia and to develop a revolution from below against the old-line apparatus. But the social forces he unleashed, the authors say, took on a life of their own, sweeping his revolution out of his control and creating ''the central paradox of Gorbachev's rule - the more he sought to disperse power, the more he found it necessary to concentrate power in his own hands.'' Beset by economic problems for which he had no answers, by breakaway republics, by ethnic violence, by a discredited and disintegrating Communist Party, by a polarization between conservative oppositionists and disorganized radical reformers who had in common only a mistrust of the new President, ''Gorbachev apparently came to the conclusion that the only way to succeed would be to revert to the classical 'revolution-from-above' tactics.''
The decade ahead, write Mr. Doder and Ms. Branson, will be one of turmoil and crisis though perhaps no more so, they say, than other periods of adversity that the country has surmounted in the past. But even if Mr. Gorbachev should not survive politically, they add, he will have left ''his personal imprint on the age,'' and his rule will have constituted a transitional period between authoritarianism and democracy. However, given the many complex and uncertain variables involved, the range of possible outcomes would also appear to include not only the ultimate realization of Mr. Gorbachev's reforms, but a decline into chaos and civil violence, or a conservative, nationalist and perhaps militaristic regime intent upon resurrecting the order of the past.
Even under the best of circumstances, there will be troubles ahead for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. But there should be no doubt that it would be in the best interests of the world, the United States included, that the reform process in the Soviet Union should continue and, however long it may take, should succeed. There are some among us who believe they would rejoice to see the reform efforts collapse, but they seriously underestimate the dangerous consequences that would follow. They would, before long, come to ask themselves whether we had been sufficiently responsive to the opportunities we now have to support, at least marginally, this historic transformation.
 
NEW FACE AT THE TOP
 It is difficult to know what exactly transpired during the twenty-four-hour period following Chernenko's death. The Kremlin chooses its leaders in total secrecy. But from public pronouncements and private disclosures it is clear that Gorbachev's election was no straightforward matter. It was, in fact, a close call. . . .
The crucial role at the plenum was played by Gromyko, the senior Politburo member who had come to symbolize in the eyes of the party the continuity of more than four decades of Soviet history. Gromyko's vote of confidence carried great weight with the three-hundred-member Central Committee, whose average age was sixty-six and who were temperamentally more favorably disposed toward the familiar Grishin. Gromyko spoke without notes, an indication of the haste and uncertainties surrounding the proceedings. He was both eloquent and unusually emotional, trying to reassure the Old Guard that Gorbachev was tough and shrewd and that they should not be deceived by his youth.
''Comrades,'' one Central Committee member later quoted Gromyko as saying, ''this man has a nice smile but he's got iron teeth.''

WHAT WENT WRONG, WHAT TO DO

BYLINE: By CORY DEAN

 BODY:
PERIL AND PROMISE: A Commentary on America. By John Chancellor. (Harper & Row, $17.95.) As John Chancellor, the television commentator, looks at the United States, he sees a country facing a complex and competitive world with great power but failing confidence. This loss of faith results, he writes, from ''years of hopes raised and hopes dashed'' - defeat in the ''moral blunder'' of Vietnam, the Arab oil embargo, Watergate, the hostage crisis, inflation and the ''wanton mismanagement of the nation's finances.'' The result of this moral, political and financial battering, he writes, was the Reaganism of the 1980's and its greed, its emphasis on short-term profits, its falling savings and rising debt, and the feeling that we will be even worse off in the future. But this country is still No. 1, he writes. It can remain No. 1, and there is no reason why it shouldn't be. Mr. Chancellor offers several remedies, like all-year schooling, compulsory national service, Congressional campaign reform, a Government ''technology policy'' to aid research and development, a means test for Social Security. None are new; even his most startling idea, the abolition of Presidential primaries and the return of the nominating process to the convention floor, has been proposed before. But they are interesting ideas, and it is disappointing that Mr. Chancellor did not devote more time to them. People who have been paying attention to current events may find little to engage them. But the book seems to be aimed at the people who aren't paying attention. It is written in such simple language and assumes so little knowledge on the part of the reader that some may find it off-putting. On the other hand, if it's true that 24 million Americans cannot find their own country on a map, many people need such a user-friendly book. If they can be induced to read it, they will find it valuable and interesting.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL

BYLINE: THOMAS GEORGE

 BODY:
Braxton Banks missed the 1989 Notre Dame football season because of a leg injury. Banks, a running back, toiled last March over a delicate decision: whether to return for his final season at Notre Dame and earn his degree in English, or enter the National Football League draft in April and lose his Notre Dame fscholarship and eligibility.
Banks opted for the draft, as did Brad Gaines, a Vanderbilt running back. Both were among 20 college juniors who were not drafted. Now most have no degree, no school, no football.
''He labored with his decision extensively, up to the last minute, and it was probably the most difficult decision of his life,'' Priscilla Banks, Braxton's mother, said of her son, who is pondering his next move. ''Our phone bill during that period was $275. He was one semester from graduating with an English degree. You hate to see the hurt in that kid's eyes.'' 
 
Shocked at Result
Gaines said he was shocked when he failed to be among the 331 college players selected through 12 draft rounds. He remains near Vanderbilt at his home outside of Nashville, training and waiting, hopeful that a pro team will call.
''I had led the Southeastern Conference in receptions with 70 last year,'' Gaines said, ''and even though I wasn't sure this was the route I wanted to go, I was confident I would at least be drafted. I've just been lifting and staying in shape. I'd like to have known what I know now. Sure, I'd like to go back to school. I'm 12 hours short of a degree in health promotion.''
When the N.F.L decided to make it easier for college juniors to enter the draft, a record 38 did, all understanding that to enter the draft, they must forfeit their athletic scholarships and college careers. Such well-known juniors as Jeff George, an Illinois quarterback, and Andre Ware, the Houston quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner, strode confidently into the draft, certain they would be among the top selections. Eighteen juniors were drafted. Twenty were not. For several juniors, the move was a high-roll risk from the start.
Chris Mongeau was ineligible for college play because he had played a year of semipro football and had signed with an agent.
Mongeau spent a year in a Maine preparatory school and the following 1988-89 year as a center at American-International. When his grandmother, great-grandmother and great-grandfather all died in May 1989, he withdrew from school and played one season for the semipro New England Crusaders.
Three N.F.L. teams expressed interest in Mongeau while he was a Crusader. Thus, in April, he decided to enter the draft.
 
Tryout With Cowboys
''But not too many teams,'' Mongeau said, ''were interested on draft day.'' Mongeau opted for a May tryout with the Dallas Cowboys.
''I just got back from the Cowboys tryout,'' he said. ''There were 500 of us boys there. Not one made it.''
Mongeau, who is 6 feet 3 inches and 300 pounds, returned to his home in South Hadley, Mass., to train and work as a bouncer at an exotic dance club. Soon that job became too dangerous, he said.
He thought he had found a new job last weekend, working at a dock near his home. But when he arrived at the dock last Monday at 5 A.M., he was told the position had been filled. That afternoon, his girlfriend broke up with him.
''It seemed like nothing was going right,'' said Mongeau, who is 21 years old. ''But now I've got another invitation to a camp, the Houston Oilers', and the Jets and the New England Patriots have contacted my agent. I'm confident I can play in the N.F.L., and I'll go any route to get there.''
 
New Plan Weighed
Dick Schultz, executive director of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, wants college juniors to be free to test their N.F.L. market value, if they choose, by going through the draft, without risking loss of their college eligibility.
Among the groups looking into that option is the Knight Foundation Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, a 22-member group that includes college presidents, business executives and congressmen. The commission's chief goal is to explore ways to reform college athletics.
''When a kid first enters the draft, he's not too worried, and then it's hard for him to accept he's not one of the superstars,'' said Roger Valdiserri, associate athletic director at Notre Dame and executive assistant of the Knight Commission. ''These poor kids should be able to come back, even though a lot of them didn't listen to how slim their chances were.''
Dave Cawood, assistant executive director of the N.C.A.A., said: ''As good as the concept is, there's a lot of work to be done on it. Hopefully, we can have it in place by '91. But '92 is more practical. There is unfortunately nothing that can be done to assist these 20 individuals. No one has the authority to vacate the rules. It is unfortunate, but honest.''
 
Advice From Many
The juniors with a year of eligibility remaining were inundated with conflicting advice.
Some agents and family members urged them to enter quickly, stressing that this might be the last time for rookies to gain big contract dollars because a rookie wage scale, which was among the measures the N.F.L. club owners considered at their meeting in Dallas in May, might be in place in 1992. They were told that an injury during senior year might result in no pro opportunity at all.
Club executives and college coaches strongly advised a return to school. They said the roster limit of 80 signed players would limit an athlete's chances of even gaining a summer tryout. They said George, Ware and Barry Sanders were exceptions.
George, the first player selected in the draft, signed a six-year, $15 million contract with the Indianapolis Colts. Ware was drafted No. 7 by the Detroit Lions. Sanders was rookie of the year this season and an All-Pro running back with the Detroit Lions. In all, 8 juniors were selected in the first round, 3 in the second, and 15 by the fifth.
In the pro baseball draft, a junior does not have to declare for the draft. He is simply drafted at large and can decide to remain in college. In the pro basketball and football drafts, a junior must declare for the draft.
''The athlete has a chance, only through his university, to ask that his case be heard for eligibility and the possibility, as remote as it is, is there that it will be restored,'' said Janet Justus, the N.C.A.A.'s director of eligibilty. ''The basic priniciple of amateurism for the N.C.A.A. states that if you sign with an agent, receive money or enter the draft, you are a professional. The line has been drawn for a very long time. No player could have entered the draft without knowing this, because they signed an affidavit that said so.''
 
Limbo Situation a Concern
There is a move afoot, however, to re-draw the line. But Pat Dye, the Auburn football coach, shares the belief in the N.F.L. that the change might not be beneficial.
''I think it would be a drastic mistake,'' Dye said. ''The kid's in limbo for six months and he's thinking about his pro career instead of going to class. That would do more to damage pro football than the N.C.A.A. or the N.F.L. could do.''
Meanwhile, the 20 undrafted athletes look for other ways to continue pursuing their football careers.
One option they hope to explore is the World League of American Football, a league sponsored by the N.F.L. and scheduled to open next spring. The league, considered a stepping stone to the N.F.L., will use 700 players on 12 teams: 6 teams in the United States, 4 in Europe and 1 each in Canada and Mexico.
 
A Stark Reminder
''The 700 players will be seniors out of college, players under contract in the N.F.L. who need extra work, and all those guys the N.F.L. misses that later become pro bowlers,'' said Tex Schramm, the new league's president. ''I've always been a strong believer that young men should complete their four years and graduate before pro football. It takes painful experiences like this group of 20 to remind us.
''Everybody predicted this was going to happen. As far as trying out for our league, at their age, a year away from football shouldn't hurt them. But for some reason, they weren't drafted. A lot of it comes down to ability.''
Not all the juniors faced the same either-or situation when entering the draft. Some, like Anthony Burnett, a former U.C.L.A. defensive back, and Octavius Gould, a former Minnesota running back, were already academically ineligible and had missed the entire 1989 season.
John Mefford, a former Carson-Newman defensive tackle, has given up on his pro football dreams. He earned a degree in management last May and is interviewing with corporations. For the moment, he is home in La Follette, Tenn., working part-time for his brother.
Jeff Klemp, a former linebacker at Kansas, has traveled as roundabout a route as any of his peers. After graduating from high school in Kansas, Klemp attended a preparatory school in Boston and a spent a summer at Columbia University before joining the Kansas football team as a walk-on last fall.
 
Wants Career as Punter
''I wanted to punt, and everywhere I've been they've tried to make me everything else,'' Klemp said. ''I'm one semester short of getting a degree in economics, but being a pro punter is what I want. I'm probably one of the best punters around if I get a look. Not too many people in the pros can punt as high as I can.''
Klemp is back home in Leavenworth, Kan., working at construction jobs from 6:45 A.M. to 7 P.M. At 5:30 A.M., he's at the local high school kicking footballs, and after work, too, until about 8:30.
''If I had been at a school where I had been able to punt right away, I never would have been in the draft this year in the first place,'' Klemp said. ''I've got another punting camp coming up and I'm gonna be ready for a tryout somewhere to make the N.F.L. and to stay.''

HEADLINE: TYSON WINS IN 1st ROUND

BYLINE: By PHIL BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., June 16

 BODY:
Mike Tyson, in his first bout since losing his heavyweight title, detonated a right hand on the chin of Henry Tillman and knocked him out at 2:47 of the first round of a scheduled 10-round bout tonight at Caesars Palace.
Until that point, the overeager Tyson had been unable to get the big punches in as Tillman ran and grabbed.
But once he nailed Tillman with the right hand, the fight was over.
Tillman fell backward to the canvas. He pushed the mouthpiece out with his tongue and, with a dazed expression, took the 10-count from the referee, Richard Steele, while on his back. 
 
Convincing Knockout
The convincing knockout gave Tyson some solace in his comeback after the shocking loss of his heavyweight title this past February to James (Buster) Douglas in a 10th-round knockout.
Tyson, who weighed 217 pounds, is now 38-1 with 34 knockouts. Tillman, who weighed 215 pounds, dropped to 20-5 with 14 knockouts.
George Foreman, the former heavyweight champion, moved ever closer to a showdown bout against Tyson, or possibly a world-title shot, when he knocked out Adilson Rodrigues of San Paulo, Brazil, at 2:39 of the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout earlier tonight. #89-Degree Night Foreman, who worked economically in the 89-degree evening heat, exploded a three-punch combination late in the second round to get Rodrigues in big trouble. Foreman started with a jab, followed with a straight right hand then dropped the 29-year-old Rodrigues with a left hook.
Rodrigues fell onto the seat of his trunks and rolled onto his side. With his right hand, he grasped the lowest strand of the ring ropes, trying to get himself erect as the referee, Carlos Padilla, counted.
Rodrigues was unable to regain his feet and Padilla counted him out.
 
Foreman Jolts Rodrigues
Foreman, who weighed 263 pounds, stalked the circling Rodrigues in the climactic round, jolting him with uppercuts to the body and head before he landed the conclusive final combination.
Foreman had lost the first round on the scorecard of two of the three judges.
For Foreman, who says he is 41 years old, it was his 22d consecutive victory since he returned to the ring in March 1987 after a 10-year absence from boxing.
Foreman earned $1 million for his demolition of Rodrigues. Rodrigues reportedly received $175,000.
Foreman is now 67-2 with 63 knockouts. Rodrigues dropped to 36-4 with 26 knockouts.
The Foreman and Tyson bouts were designed as a prelude to a card that again would co-feature both fighters in separate bouts.
That event was predicated on both men winning tonight and was scheduled for Sept. 8 at Caesars Palace. The plan was for Tyson to box Alex Stewart and Foreman to meet a top-10 opponent.
Originally, Francesco Damiani of Italy had been designated as Foreman's opponent for the September match. But earlier today, Seth Abraham of Home Box Office, which televised tonight's bouts and has the live rights to the Sept. 8 card, said that Damiani was no longer in the picture.
 
W.B.O. Champion
Abraham said that because Damiani holds the heavyweight title of the fledgling World Boxing Organization, HBO was reluctant to have him as Foreman's opponent.
''We spent $22 million for a series that unified the heavyweight title,'' said Abraham, ''and it just doesn't make sense to me to create a situation that would encourage 'another' champion.''
Abraham also said that he sensed Tyson's promoter, Don King, and Tyson himself would be uneasy about a future Tyson-Foreman bout in which Foreman held a world title, even one as devalued as the W.B.O.'s.
''I believe Don wants the fighters to have parity when they meet,'' said Abraham.
Because of those considerations, Abraham said, Foreman's next opponent was expected to be selected from a group that included fighters like Michael Dokes, Tim Witherspoon, and Jose Ribalta.
But Bob Arum, Foreman's promoter, said Damiani could still be Foreman's next opponent.
Were Foreman and Tyson to win their back-to-back HBO co-features, then both men were expected to fight each other later this year, or sometime next year, in a bout that would likely be the biggest grossing match in the history of boxing.

HEADLINE: The Rental Market Loosens Up a Bit

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
ACROSS the New York region, there is good news for renters. There are many more apartments and houses available for rent; rents on market-rate units are either stable or falling, and landlords are courting tenants with aggressive promotions.
In contrast to the mid-80's, when it seemed that any living unit could be rented for more than the year before, now rents, like selling prices, are on the negotiating table.
To be sure, New York and its suburbs remain among the most expensive rental markets in the nation. The region's shortage of low-income housing remains acute, businesses are limiting their expansion because homes and apartments are too expensive for their employees, and rents continue to rise for most tenants, although at a slower rate. 
But in an area where finding a decent place to rent has almost always been a daunting task, basic economic shifts appear to have made it slightly easier. Thousands of co-ops, condominiums and houses, all of them unregulated and most of them unsalable in a weak resale market, have been brought onto the rental market, heightening the competition for tenants.
In New York City, where rent increases on most apartments are limited by rent-stabilization laws, owners of the more expensive units say they often are unable to charge the maximum increases allowed by the guidelines because their tenants will move out and others are hard to find. Regulated apartments with below-market rents, however, continue to be scarce.
''There are no screaming bargains out there, but at the moment, renting appears to be the right thing to do,'' said Jeff Aron son, a financial analyst on Wall Street who last month rented a two-bedroom apartment on West End Avenue in Manhattan after selling a nearby one-bedroom co-op he had bought in 1986.
His reasons reflect the crosscurrents of psychology and economics that are reshaping the New York area housing market. Although he and his wife, Shari, a bank executive, could have bought another apartment, Mr. Aronson said they did not think the value of New York City co-ops and condominiums would increase over the next two years, and might decline.
''By renting, we don't face the financial risk,'' he said, adding that he was convinced the money necessary for a down payment on a home could be invested more profitably elsewhere. In selling his apartment, Mr. Aronson did well in a weak resale market. He said he profited from the sale. But many homeowners are unwilling to accept the prices they now would get for their houses, co-ops or condominiums, so they have put them on the market as rentals.
IN one reflection of the shift, Manhattan real estate executives say their rental listings, which had been dominated by apartments owned by large landlords and management companies, now contain an equal number of properties owned by small investors and individuals.
Indeed, the ''rent-to-buy'' option, allowing rent to be counted toward a down payment on a later purchase, is emerging as the marketing tool of the 90's. In contrast to the real estate slowdown of the late 70's and early 80's - when the problems resulted from soaring interest rates and many determined sellers turned to second mortgages or other forms of creative financing to sell their homes - hundreds of homeowners are now trying to rent out their properties temporarily, until the resale market recovers.
For some, the decision may prove wise, partly because Federal tax deductions are almost always bigger for those who rent out than for those who live in their homes. Some owners are also able to depreciate their properties, and claim tax reductions, when they rent them out.
But the landlords, small and large alike, are confronting another new reality: an economic slowdown that has reduced demand for some types of rental housing. With corporations cutting back on recruitment, and demographic shifts bringing fewer college graduates and other young apartment-seekers to city and suburbs alike, apartments that might have been snapped up in hours during the mid-80's now go begging.
''The overall trend is a decline in rents,'' said Nancy Packes, president of the Feathered Nest, a Manhattan brokerage. In an analysis of over 6,000 transactions, she found rents had declined steadily since 1987 on several types of apartments.
In one category, rent-stabilized, one-bedroom apartments in buildings without doormen on the East Side, she said, average rents fell from $1,400 a month in December 1987 to $1,100 in May. In another - market rate two-bedroom apartments with doormen on the West Side - the average rent fell from $2,750 in December 1987 to $2,400 in May.
Hardest hit by the change are people who invested in homes, principally condominiums, at the height of the region's real estate boom in the mid-80's. Many hoped to rent them out and sell later at a profit, but have so far been sorely disappointed.
''People are between a rock and hard place,'' said Arthur Baer, a Manhattan lawyer who represents several co-op boards and real estate investors who became an investor himself in 1985 when he bought a one-bedroom condominium on East 79th Street, intending to rent it out.
Things went smoothly at first, Mr. Baer said, when a tenant signed on for a one-year lease at $1,750 a month. When that tenant left, the market was softer; his second tenant paid $1,650 a month and ''skipped out in the middle of the night'' midway through his lease, Mr. Baer said.
That was in 1987, and things have gotten worse. He said two other short-term tenants moved in, paying successively lower rents, and the apartment is now leased at $1,500 a month. Meanwhile, Mr. Baer said, his taxes and other expenses on the condominium have risen and he is losing $700 a month on the investment even while it is rented. His hopes for an eventual profit await a sale when the market recovers.
Although the case is extreme, it reflects the pressures faced by landlords across New York City and its suburbs. But for those looking for a rental, options are expanding:
* In Morris County, N.J., the owners of Knoll Gardens, a complex of 1,108 garden apartments in Lake Hiawatha, are offering four-day trips to Orlando, Fla., or Myrtle Beach, S.C., to those who sign leases on some apartments that have been slow to rent. The rents range from $630 a month for a one bedroom to $845 a month for a two bedroom.
* The ''rent-to-buy'' option has become commonplace. The approach has many variations, often allowing tenants to apply part or all of their rent to a pre-established sale price.
* In New York City, one of the biggest burdens of people seeking a rental - brokers' fees that typically amount to 15 percent of the first year's rent - are no longer an inevitable expense. Increasingly, brokers say, landlords are picking up part or all of the fee themselves to attract tenants.
* The boards of co-ops, which in most cases have imposed strict rules that discourage shareholders from subletting, are under pressure to liberalize the rules. Although many have resisted the change, some now are allowing more rental tenants in their buildings to avoid defaults by people who must move and cannot sell their apartments.
* Some developers and sponsors who have converted rental buildings to co-ops and condominiums and who have apartments they have been unable to sell are under pressure from their banks to put the vacancies on the market as rentals.
The changes in the rental market appear to be having the biggest impact on the most expensive properties.
''There is market resistance,'' said Richard LeFrak, president of the Lefrak Organization, which owns hundreds of New York City apartment buildings and ranks among its biggest landlords. ''The more expensive the property,'' he added, ''the thinner the market gets.''
Like other large landlords who operate buildings under New York City's rent- stabilization rules, Mr. LeFrak is all but assured of rent increases on most of his apartments because the guidelines have kept rents low and his tenants would not be able to find better deals.
More than 70 percent of New York City's 1.9 million apartments are covered by rent stabilization or rent control, according to a 1987 survey conducted by Michael A. Stegman, chairman of the City and Regional Planning Department at the University of North Carolina. The survey - the most exhaustive analysis available of New York City housing - is done every three years. The 1990 update has not been completed.
Current guidelines permit 5.5 percent increases on the renewal of one-year leases or 9 percent on two-year renewals. When a rent-stabilized unit is vacated, landlords can increase the rent 12 percent for a new tenant. Rent-stabilization rules also govern many buildings in Westchester and on Long Island. Other rent regulations limit increases in Fort Lee, Weehawken and other New Jersey communities.
Despite the regulations, however, landlords are unable to raise rents to the allowable limit in some cases, particularly on expensive apartments that have recently come under rent guidelines, or on apartments that have changed tenants frequently. Rents on these apartments may have risen to a point where better deals can be found elsewhere.
SOME tenants are negotiating for something less than the maximum increase. ''Rent stabilization notwithstanding, we are dealing with supply and demand,'' Mr. LeFrak said.
Other real estate executives say one of the biggest changes in the market has been the rapid increase in the number of apartments put on the market by individual owners and investors. They are not covered by the rent guidelines, and since they tend to be higher-priced apartments with high turnover rates, they are plentiful among the listings in classified advertisements and at brokerages.
David Tannenbaum, manager of the Greenwich Village office of Sopher Real Estate, said about half of his current inventory of 2,000 apartments for rent are owned by small investors or individuals. Rents have decreased in the last two years, he said, from an average of $1,100 to $900 a month for studios; $1,500 to $1,350 for one-bedrooms and $2,000 to $1,800 for two-bedrooms.
Some of the investor-owned apartments represent good rental bargains because they are often newer or in better condition than rent-stabilized units. Many are also being offered with some form of option to buy.
For those who do not intend to buy, Mr. Tannenbaum said, stabilized apartments are preferable because they offer protection to tenants against being forced to move if the apartment is sold. Usually, he added, investor-owned apartments are on the market as rentals only because their owners are waiting until they can be sold at a profit. Their rental tenants can be compelled to move at the end of their leases.
Still, unless the resale market for co-ops, condominiums and homes becomes more robust soon, executives said, they expect to see more rentals put on the market by individual owners and investors. One reason is that Federal tax laws, which eliminated many of the benefits for real estate investment with the revisions of 1986, retain some benefits for individuals who rent out their property.
One of the benefits comes from the deductions that people can claim as landlords that they could not claim as owner occupants. Since operating a rental property is a business expense, the cost of improvements, insurance, utilities, security and other services can be deducted for tax purposes.
Another benefit for some small landlords comes through rules covering depreciation. Although the benefits have been sharply reduced for those whose household income is over $100,000, people whose earnings fall below the limit can depreciate the full cost of their homes, including improvements, over a schedule of 27.5 years.
For most people making under $100,000 a year, that means they can divide the amount they paid for their home by 27.5, and deduct that much from the taxable income each year. As a result of the combined tax benefits, people who rent out their homes may be saving hundreds of dollars each month. And while the savings by themselves are rarely enough to make the investment in a co-op, condominium or house profitable, they are an incentive that has led many to rent out their properties temporarily in hopes that the resale market will improve.
''When things are not selling, the rental market is a savior,'' said Geri Sheehan, a broker who specializes in rentals for Murphy Realty in Fort Lee. Nonetheless, she added, most investors who rent out their property are not receiving enough in rent to cover all their costs.
Brokers in the region have begun new promotions aimed at helping frustrated sellers rent out their homes. One such is M. J. Raynes, with offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn, which has listings for rentals that give tenants a ''right of first refusal,'' meaning they are given the first option to buy their apartments at the same price that someone offers their landlords.
Roberta Faulstick, manager of the firm's offices in Greenwich Village, Brooklyn Heights and the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, said 20 percent of her listings for apartments were on the market as either resales or rentals, whichever would give the owner an acceptable return.
Judith Miles, a Manhattan lawyer who has been renting apartments in Brooklyn Heights for more than 20 years, said she encountered new options when she looked for a bigger apartment in April. One was an offer of an attractive rent in a co-op that had what she was looking for, she said. But she said passed it by because the owners insisted on reserving the right to sell it after a year.
Ms. Miles, who said she has no intention of buying soon, settled on a large six-room rent-stabilized apartment. Since then, she said, she has been reminded of how eager landlords are to find tenants because brokers have called her about the same apartments that are still vacant two months later. ''There are a lot of apartments that have been on the market for a long time,'' she said. ''My phone has been ringing off the wall.''

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Rent Guidelines;
Gathering Data for a Board's Judgment

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A CURIOUS thing happened this year on the way to the annual hearings of the New York City's Rent Guidelines Board. The board met May 9 and proposed new guidelines, doing so before it had in hand the cost study that is supposed to play the key role in formulating the guidelines.
Last week the study came in. It suggests that the proposed guidelines may be too low by a fair margin. So now the board may be in the position of adopting a guideline higher than the one it proposed, or finding valid reasons why other standards justify holding to its position.
At the least, the situation throws into question the wisdom of proposing guidelines in the absence of more complete information. In May the board acted primarily on the basis on hastily assembled rent information from the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, and on preliminary cost data brought forward by its staff. 
The procedural system is peculiar. The board has decided that its procedures are governed by the city's Administrative Procedures Act of 1988, a precursor to the City Charter revision of 1989.
The act requires that when any city agency drafts a new rule, it has to give 30-days' notice before the rule is adopted. Thus the Rent Guidelines Board must have a publicly announced proposal before it can hold a public hearing.
When this procedure was followed last year, the cost study was already available. The final guidelines were lower than the initial proposal.
This year the public hearings will take place on Wednesday and Thursday at Police Plaza auditorium, near the Municipal Building. The final guidelines will be adopted at a meeting June 25. All meetings are open to the public, and although people are not called upon to speak, demonstrative behavior by the audience makes the scene stormy.
The problem this year came in the Board of Estimate. It was not exactly brisk in agreeing to award the contract for the cost study. Approval came on April 18, not in time to complete the work for the May meeting.
Approval also came on a 7-to-4 vote, and only after Mayor David N. Dinkins had acceded to Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman's insistence that he call upon the guidelines board to end the surcharge it has permitted in the last few years on apartments renting for under $325 a month. Ms. Holtzman said the surcharge unfairly burdens those least able to pay. Direct intrusion by a Mayor into the setting of rent guidelines is a departure.
The Rent Guidelines Board has nine members. Two represent tenants and two represent owners. Five, including the chairman, are ''public'' members. Mayor Dinkins's appointee as chairman was Aston L. Glaves, director of Project Find, a nonprofit organization that operates low-income housing. One of the other public members, Janice S. Robinson, an assistant dean at Rutgers Law School, made the guidelines proposal May 9. It was supported by Mr. Glaves and Ellen Gesmer, a lawyer who was appointed on the eve of the hearing. The two other public members - Victor Marrero, a lawyer, and Agustin Rivera, an educator - abstained.
The proposal was for a 3 percent increase on a one-year lease and 5 percent on a two-year lease, the lowest two-year guideline ever. The allowable vacancy increase, applicable when one tenant moves out and another moves in, was proposed at 5 percent, the lowest figure since 1983.
ON May 23 the Rent Stabilization Association filed a lawsuit trying to annul Ms. Gesmer's appointment. The suit says that she lacks the five years of experience in either finance, economics or housing that the stabilization law requires of public members.
Now comes the report from the consultant, Speedwell Inc. of Duxbury, Mass. It finds that the price index of operating costs rose 10.9 percent between April 1989 and April 1990. This was the largest rise in the index in the last nine years. It went up 6.7 percent last year. Last year's guideline allowed a 5.5 percent increase on a one-year lease and 9 percent on a two-year lease.
The steep rise in the index this year was a result of large jumps in heavily weighted categories. In the taxes, fees and permits category, for example, the index went up 12 percent, mostly because of assessment increases. This was less than the 17 percent rise last year, but with an ''expenditure weight'' of 22 percent, it is the most heavily weighted of all expense categories.
The index for fuel costs rose 20.9 percent, compared with a decline in the preceding year. That was mainly because fuel prices rose last winter during the peak season for fuel use. There was also a large rise in the utilities price index - up 20.8 percent. That seems to have been caused primarily by a rise in water and sewer rates, a principal component of the utilities price index.
Next to taxes, the most heavily weighted indexes are for fuel, utilities, labor costs and contractor services. The latter two went up 5 percent and 6 percent, respectively.
How all this information is used is a matter of judgment. Other factors besides the price index are used in establishing guidelines. For example, when investments competitive with real estate pay higher returns, guidelines officials must consider whether they want to keep housing competitive.
Tenant groups have long argued that using an index of prices and costs to set rent guidelines is invalid and that a building's income and expense data should be used instead. Owners oppose ''opening the books'' to accountants representing tenants. But in the last week even income and expense data have become available.
The staff of the Rent Guidelines Board analyzed income and expense data from 500 buildings that were submitted to the Finance Department for assessment purposes. By law the department cannot make these figures public for individual buildings, but it can provide summary statistics.
There is an enormous range in the fraction of the rent dollar that buildings pay for operating costs, from 16 cents of every dollar to more than 100 cents when properties, for whatever reason, are absorbing losses.
But on average the data showed that 72 cents out of each rent dollar collected for all regulated apartments (and 65 cents for each dollar of gross rent collected, which includes rent from nonresidential space) went for operating expenses.
WHEN the data are adjusted to remove income from rent-controlled units and certain unrelated costs, the figure for stabilized units alone is estimated at 61 cents for each rental dollar. The staff says this ratio is higher than earlier studies that were based on registered rents, rather than collected rents, have indicated.
The Institute of Real Estate Management of the National Association of Realtors, based in Chicago, keeps national data on average operating costs of multifamily buildings. In 1988, they accounted for 46 percent of collected rents in the Northeast, 54 percent in the Midwest and 51 percent in the Far West, the association said.
In New York City, when the stabilization of unregulated postwar apartments began in 1969, the average was calculated at 55 cents on the dollar, or 55 percent. The ratio rose substantially in the 70's but has subsided since. The current 61 percent calculation is the proper one to use for comparability, the guidelines board's staff says, because it is based on information about building income and expenses similar to that used in 1969.
The rent money left over after the payment of operating costs and taxes goes for debt service and return on capital investment. In principle, the lower the ratio of operating costs to total rent, the larger the debt the building can support and the greater its value to a buyer.
As for New York City rent levels, the income data showed that average collected rents were $453 a month. The averages ranged from $594 a month in Manhattan to $360 a month in the Bronx. When data from the city's housing and vacancy survey were applied to adjust the figures so they would show rents in stabilized apartments only (excluding rent-controlled units), the average worked out to $483 a month.
At the May 9 meeting, the subject of average rents was a matter of great interest to board members. Data from the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal told them that the average registered rent citywide last year was $523 ($677 in Manhattan; $481 in Staten Island; $471 in Queens; $421 in Brooklyn and $403 in the Bronx).
At the public hearings this week, owner and tenant representatives can be expected to dwell on the issue of how average rents and costs have changed.

HEADLINE: Hardy Leaders Arrange Far-Flung Vacations

BYLINE: By RUTH ROBINSON

 BODY:
THE usual kind of touristy vacation does not satisfy Bill and Joanne Russell, of Fairfield. They say they would rather explore out-of-the-way places, preferably on foot or on skis, and share the experience with like-minded members of the Appalachian Mountain Club.
''It's really fun to have the camaraderie of a group, not just two people,'' said Mr. Russell, who has his own financial services business. ''It's wonderful to have a gang together,'' concurred his wife, a yacht-charter broker. 
Last March, the Russells enjoyed a week of cross-country skiing in untracked powder from a remote hut in the Shrine Pass area of the Colorado Rockies. Now, the couple and their friends are ready to hike, from July 7 to 21, in the Canton Valais of southwestern Switzerland, a French-speaking region that sees few tourists. For next summer, they plan a cruise of the Greek Islands and the Turkish coast with an archeological guide.
Two other club members, Barry and Ella May Wulff, of North Windham, both biologists, took a group hiking in New Zealand in January. They are paying their second visit to Iceland from July 1 to 15, and they have scheduled a trip to Patagonia from Dec. 30 to Jan 16.
''My husband has a great desire to see the entire world,'' Mrs. Wulff said. ''And this is a way of doing it.'' Along with the hiking, she said, their trips place strong emphasis on the natural history of the areas they visit.
 
Free Trips for Leaders
The Wulffs and Russells, members of the Connecticut Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club, organize major excursions for the Boston-based organization. The club has 37,500 members, including 4,744 in Connecticut.
The leaders are usually compensated with a free trip, but Mr. Russell said a lot of work is involved, especially for those who lead two or three trips annually, as he and his wife do. Responsibility for the group's welfare and enjoyment can weigh heavily, he said.
Sue Hardy, of Manchester, who has been leading major excursions since 1978, said: ''It takes a certain mentality to lead and to participate. You have to realize people in the group don't want to make a lot of nit-picky decisions. If they wanted to bother, they'd go on their own.''
The 16-member Easter week trip to Bryce and Zion National Parks that Mrs. Hardy led with her son David worked out well, she said. But an Australian hiking trip planned for June 22 to July 14 was canceled, she said, because too few people were ready to pay nonrefundable deposits for the air fare.
Mrs. Hardy and other trip leaders said they sense that the current economic situation is curtailing foreign travel for many.
 
Close Supervision
The Russells said they limit their long-distance backpack trips to 12 people, to reduce the impact on the environment. They take as many as 16 ski touring, they said, and consider 24 a manageable number on hotel trips. When cruising, they usually charter three yachts, each sleeping six.
Mr. Russell said the leaders are closely supervised by the Appalachian Mountain Club's major excursions committee, of which he and his wife are longtime members. Proposals for major excursions, defined as trips that last more than one week or take participants more than 500 miles from home, must be submitted at least eight months before the departure date. First-time leaders, like Leona Klerer, of Stamford, are required to be present at the committee meeting when their trip is being considered.
Ms. Klerer will be off to Yosemite National Park in California from July 29 to Aug. 11 with her co-leader, Judith Dortz, and 14 companions. She said she prepared herself by organizing many weekend trips and a five-day hiking excursion in Vermont for the club's Connecticut Chapter and by attending mountain leadership school in Pinkham Notch, N.H.
''I find satisfaction in leading and helping and directing people,'' said Ms. Klerer, a teacher of remedial reading. Her group will hike at elevations of 7,000 to 10,000 feet, she said, staying overnight at high camps run by a concessionaire in the national park.
The Yosemite trip costs $1,550 per person, including air fare, land transportation in California, accommodations and most meals. Such trips tend to be less expensive for participants than commercial tours, since leaders are not out to make a profit and rooms are booked in rustic mountain huts or modest inns rather than fancy hotels. Most leaders work through a travel agent or wholesaler. For trips to underdeveloped countries, the leaders usually seek aid from an experienced outfitter, like Himalayan Travel, of Greenwich.
 
Alpine Skiing
Guy and Susan Wallis, of Manchester, are using a European wholesaler for two downhill ski trips to the French Alps - Feb. 15 to 24 at Trois Vallees and March 1 to 10 at Avoriaz. They said they are getting better rates than they could line up themselves.
The cost for the March trip is estimated at $1,200 for seven nights in apartments in Avoriaz, one night in Geneva, air fare from New York, transfers in France and lift tickets. Mr. Wallis, a mechanical engineer, said he expects 30 to 35 skiers each week.
Jack Randall, of East Lyme, said he expects 24 participants for his Hawaiian Holiday from Jan. 14 to Feb. 1, at a cost of $2,300 for virtually everything except lunches. Plans call for a week each on the islands of Kauai and Hawaii, with the travelers staying in condominiums near the beach. Some participants will hike energetically, while others laze on the beach.
Rob and Connie Funk, of Manchester, have scheduled a particularly ambitious trek and wildlife safari in Tanzania from Feb. 12 to March 3, with the option of a seven-day extension to climb Mount Kilimanjaro from the Shira Plateau, rather than the typical tourist route.
Mr. Funk, who is in finance purchasing with Pratt & Whitney, and his wife, an educational consultant, both travel extensively on business. But they said they still enjoy planning club trips. ''One of the major attractions of the A.M.C. is the compatible people and the real group experience.'' said Mr. Funk.
The cost of the trip, arranged through Overseas Adventure Travel, in Cambridge, Mass., is high by club standards, around $3,225 plus airfare with an additional $2,000 for the ascent of Kilimanjaro. But the Funks said they are offering experiences not readily available on commercial tours, including an opportunity to experience the culture of the Masai tribe on a five-day trek through crater highlands of the Great Rift Valley.
Information on the Appalachian Mountain Club can be obtained from club headquarters, 5 Joy Street, Boston, Mass. 02108. The phone number is (617) 523-0636.

HEADLINE: Defense Workers Lobby to Save Jobs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
WORKERS and executives from UNC Naval Products, faced with the possible shutdown of the company's Montville plant, brought their case to Congress on Tuesday.
They told members of a House subcommittee that preserving UNC and its work force was in the best interest of the country but that time was running out.
UNC was one of two suppliers of nuclear reactors for the Navy's submarine fleet until March, when the Department of Energy decided to cut costs by giving all future marine reactor work to a single contractor, UNC's competitor, Babcox & Wilcox, of Lynchburg, Va.
Shortly after testifying before the House subcommittee on economic stabilization, the company's president, Bruce Andrews, said UNC has already reduced employment by 25 percent. ''We'll be down to 550 by the end of this year,'' he said, ''and down to 100 by the end of '91.'' 
 
Slim Chance of Retooling
Other defense contractors face sharp reductions in orders for planes, tanks and ships. New weapons systems, like the B-2 bomber, also may not survive Congressional scrutiny.
UNC Naval Products may be the first business in the nation faced with outright shutdown because of military cost-cutting measures. Unless the Bush Administration reverses its policy barring UNC from trading with foreign countries, chances are slim that the company can retool and generate other forms of business to keep going.
''The issue, we feel, is one of timing,'' Mr. Andrews told the subcommittee. ''Things have to happen rather rapidly in order to preserve the company.'' He referred to UNC's employees as ''veterans of the cold war.''
Mr. Andrews and an assistant were joined by eight longtime UNC employees, all of whom have been notified that they will be laid off within two years. The group flew to Washington for a day of testimony and private meetings with lawmakers and their aides.
They testified before the House subcommittee, which was considering legislation intended to help workers affected by Pentagon cutbacks get job training and other forms of assistance and to help companies switch into civilian lines of production.
 
Moral Obligation to Help
''This highly trained work force deserves more than 'Thank you, we don't want you anymore, goodbye,' '' said William LaChapelle, a 25-year veteran of UNC and founder of the S.O.S. Committee, set up by employees to lobby on behalf of the company. The Government, he said, has a moral obligation to help UNC.
The subcommittee's chairwoman, Representative Mary Rose Oakar, a Democrat of Ohio, agreed.
''We need to keep that industrial base alive in this country,'' she said. ''We don't want this company to fold.''
But the Bush Administration, which was not represented at Tuesday's hearing, has looked skeptically upon bills designed to convert defense industries. The Administration appears to have adopted a more free-market approach to the problem.
Also on the UNC group's agenda was a proposal by Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat from Bozrah that would allow the company to sell its highly classified reactors to such close allies as Great Britain and Canada.
Representative Gejdenson argues that close United States allies can be trusted with the reactor technology. In addition to keeping UNC in business, a change in export policy would also give the Navy continued access to a second supplier, should one be needed, without forcing the Navy to maintain business at a level sufficient to sustain two companies.
 
22,000 Signatures Gathered
The purpose of the ban on exports, Mr. Andrews said, is to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear fuels that could be used to manufacture weapons.
The UNC workers, who have been with their company an average of 15 years, have gathered 22,000 signatures from southeastern Connecticut and elsewhere in support of their cause.
''We wish we could save some jobs,'' said Bernie McKenna, who has been with UNC for nine years. ''We saw 50 of our friends go out the front door last Friday,'' he said, referring to the most recent round of layoffs at the plant, which now has just over 800 employees.
Mr. McKenna said he was told on April 12, his 36th birthday, that he would be out of work at the end of August.
More than half of the roughly 400 workers who have already lost their jobs are still trying to find work in the area that would pay them a salary equal to the $13 per hour they received at UNC.
For Don Wood, a 30-year UNC employee, the idea of training for another job or moving out of state to stay in the defense business is out of the question.
''What are we retraining for?'' Mr. Wood said. ''You take a person like me. I don't want to go back to college. I'm ready to retire.''

HEADLINE: To Cut Costs, State Curbs Car Phones

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
CAR phones, once a symbol of power and success, are becoming a symbol of budget excess, at least for state officials.
The state is removing the phones from the cars of about 20 officials in an attempt to cut its $100,000 annual bill for car phones.
As a result of an order to cut costs issued earlier this year to all state agencies by Gov. William A. O'Neill, the Office of Policy and Management made each official with a car phone reapply for one and justify its need. 
''We made a determination as to what was absolutely necessary for public health and safety, said Dan Colarusso, executive director of information and technology in the Office of Policy and Management. ''And for those that did not fall into that category, we have issued a directive to discontinue service.''
Those who lost their car phones, effective last Friday, included some of Connecticut's top officials.
Among them were the president of the University of Connecticut, John T. Casteen 3d; the Education Commissioner, Gerald N. Tirozzi; the Human Resources Commissioner, Elliot A. Ginsberg; the Economic Development Commissioner, Stephen B. Heintz; the Banking Commissioner, Howard Brown, and the Housing Commissioner, John F. Papandrea.
Commissioner J. William Burns of the Transportation Department is giving up one of the three phones assigned to him.
Several deputy commissioners also lost phones, as did the presidents of Central Connecticut State University in New Britain and Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven.
Earlier, the State Comptroller, J. Edward Caldwell, and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management Anthony V. Milano, had turned in their car phones.
The State Treasurer, Francisco L. Borges, and Attorney General Clarine Nardi Riddle will keep theirs. Governor O'Neill, Lieut. Gov. Joseph J. Fauliso and Secretary of the State Julia H. Tashjian never had them.
Mr. Colarusso said that the state spent $108,000 during the last year on some 125 phones. He said it was difficult to estimate how much would be saved, but removing 18 phones is about 14 percent of the total, and he said ''we should reduce the bill by about that amount.''
The basic charge is $18 a month for each phone, plus 38 cents a minute. Officials with car phones are liable for personal calls made on them. For example, Mr. Borges and an aide who is also allowed to use the car phone, reimbursed the state more than $3,100 for personal calls made on his state car phone between July 1987 and February 1990. The Deputy Banking Commissioner, Paul J. McDonough, who is among those losing their car phones, reimbursed the state $171.46 in May for a series of personal calls he had made, The Hartford Courant reported.
In a letter to the officials losing their phones, Mr. Colarusso acknowledged that ''certainly there will be business inconveniences that result from this action; however, given the current situation, I am sure you will recognize that it is necessary to take this step.''
The phones being removed, he said, will be stored at the state's Office of Emergency Management, ''for future or emergency situations.''
Most of the remaining car phones are assigned to the Departments of Transportation and Environmental Protection, and the state police. Officials in the Departments of Correction, Motor Vehicles and Health Services also have them.

HEADLINE: School Board Group Facing Challenges

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
THE New Jersey School Boards Association, one of the state's most visible educational organizations, is under attack. In the wake of a blistering report by the State Commission of Investigation on its activities, a legislative assault and a revolt among some of its members, there is concern about the future of the 76-year-old organization.
''There are some legislators who think they hear a death rattle,'' said State Senator Matthew Feldman, Democrat of Teaneck, chairman of the Senate Education Committee and a strong supporter of the association.
The commission's highly critical report in April, charging mismanagement and fiscal irregularities, had a devastating effect on the association, which had expected some criticism after the three-yearinvestigation but was unprepared for the strong language and sharp censure in the report.
In recent weeks, however, morale has improved as the association has taken the offensive, describing how the organization began, and how it had started making changes as soon as the investigation began so that further problems could not occur. 
''No, I'm not worried about our future,'' said Jeremiah Regan, who was president of the association when the report came out and is a member of the Oceanport Board of Education. ''We've moved very rapidly and forthrightly to correct the deficiencies in our structure and particularly in our management system. I'm very confident that we will more than satisfy the Legislature and our own members that we're doing a good job. If they're not satisfied, then by God we'll go to whatever length is necessary to satisfy them.''
Questions about the association's future come at a time when boards of education across the state are already under fire for swollen budgets in tight fiscal times.
Founded in 1914, the association, which has headquarters in Trenton, represents local school boards at the state level and provides training and technical assistance for the state's 4,900 local school board members.
The trouble began in 1987 with the association's disclosure that an insurance fund administered by the organization had lost more than $800,000 because of bad investments. The commission concluded that the losses were symptomatic of ''much deeper problems'' within the association, ranging from general mismanagement to the squandering of taxpayers' money through extravagant dinners and double billing for expenses.
The commission held the association's executive director, Octavius T. Reid, ''primarily responsible'' for the problems and urged that he be dismissed. Mr. Reid, who has denied any wrongdoing, resigned last month.
Although all states have school board associations, New Jersey and Washington State are the only two with mandatory membership. The association's $7 million budget is financed largely through dues, ranging this year from $1,226 to $20,003, depending on the number of students a district has.
Even before the release of the commission report, there had been growing pressure to make membership in the association optional. State Senator Raymond J. Zane, Democrat of Woodbury, considers the current system a form of involuntary taxation.
''Currently, many districts are paying outrageous fees to belong to this association, and the money would be better spent on educating our children, especially in these difficult times,'' Mr. Zane said upon introducing a bill last month to allow voluntary participation in the association.
The association opposes the legislation, fearing that many school boards would withdraw, particularly since 48 percent of school budgets statewide were rejected by voters this year and boards have been forced to cut many items from their budgets.
 
Called a Counterbalance
In addition to offering training for school board members, the association has contended that it provides a vital service to the state by acting as a counterbalance to the teachers' unions.
''If we didn't exist, you'd have to invent something to do that,'' said Mr. Regan, whose term of office expired eight days ago. Mr. Zane's bill may face an uphill battle in the Legislature. ''I wouldn't say there is a lot of support,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''It was introduced at a timely moment when enthusiasm and confidence in budgets and school boards were at a low, but I will not be the executioner for the school boards.''
The Assembly Speaker, Joseph V. Doria Jr., Democrat of Bayonne, said: ''If you want a viable organization, you have to pay for it. It's played an important role in education for all these years, and trying to trash it now is wrong.''
Since the early 1980's, the New Jersey Education Association, a teachers' union, has supported a move to make membership in the School Boards Association optional.
''Just like membership in any association, you should do it because you think there are reasons you should have that relationship,'' said Debbie Scott, a spokeswoman for the teachers' union. ''Having to pay up to $20,000 a year depending on the number of students you have is unconscionable.''
 
Paying Dues as 'Agency Fee'
But to many association allies the union's argument is specious. Although teachers do not technically have to become members of the Education Association if the union is the bargaining agent in a particular school district, they have to pay 85 percent of the dues as an ''agency fee'' to cover the cost of negotiations.
The School Boards Association's fear that boards will leave if given the choice has not proved true in the 48 states that have optional membership. According to statistics compiled by the National School Boards Association, based in Arlington, Va., membership in state school associations ranges from a low of 84 percent in Missouri to 100 percent in 23 states, excluding New Jersey and Washington.
But Mr. Regan says he believes that New Jersey is in an unusual situation this year that makes it more vulnerable.
''Because of the budget problems this particular year and the bad press we brought upon ourselves with the S.C.I. report,'' he said, ''the environment is a tough one to work in at the moment.''
The New Jersey School Boards Association began to tighten its structure almost immediately after the insurance fund losses came to light. In addition to making the group that administers the fund an autonomous organization, it has adopted strict expenditure and accounting policies.
 
Recommendations Studied
A committee headed by Dr. John J. Petillo, president of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Jersey, is also studying the commission recommendations and will present its report in September.
In a somewhat odd comparison, the association's latest newsletter has likened Dr. Petillo, a former chancellor of Seton Hall University, to Toscanini, who could ''detect one wrong note from a second violin within the lush sound of the symphony orchestra.''
Dr. Petillo, the newsletter asserted, has been ''fine-tuning service organizations since 1976.''
For all the accusations in the commission's 105-page report, Mr. Regan acknowledges that it is fundamentally accurate.
''I think it was a reasonable presentation of the facts as I know them,'' Mr. Regan said. ''There was much more in there than I had ever known or even suspected.''
In the meantime, the association is facing tough economic times. Legal costs resulting from the state commission's investigation have been mounting and may ultimately exceed the $800,000 that was lost through the insurance fund investments. The association also has decided to keep next year's dues at this year's level to help offset the loss of state aid in school districts.
 
Dues Placed in Escrow
The hold on dues is not enough to keep some members happy. Woodbridge is one of several school districts placing their dues in escrow until the association permits optional membership, and even then there is a ''strong possibility'' that the district would not join, said Charles Famula, secretary to the Woodbridge Board of Education.
''We're disturbed that we're forced to be members,'' he said. ''The board feels we don't get anything out of membership outside of another lobbying organization in Trenton.'' The association is deeply troubled by such internal discord. ''It is obviously something that is of concern to the association, not so much because they're putting their dues into escrow, but because there has been an erosion of confidence in the association,'' said David Allen, a public relations consultant who is handling questions about the commission report for the association. ''We know we've got some rebuilding to do.''
Thomas Cannon, co-author of the commission report, says he believes that local school boards may hold the key to the association's future.
''Locals could very well decide the fate of the School Boards Association,'' he said. ''If the association doesn't want to bite the bullet and the Legislature doesn't want to change the law, local taxpayers and local boards could decide the fate of the association on their own.''

HEADLINE: The Task Facing Lowey's Challenger

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WHEN Nita M. Lowey decided two years ago to challenge Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi, the two-term Republican from Westchester's 20th Congressional District, she faced some formidable obstacles: it was her first run for elected office, her opponent was well-financed and two other Democrats were seeking the post.
Mrs. Lowey dispatched her Democratic rivals in a primary, matched Mr. DioGuardi's $1.2 million campaign spending and demonstrated that 13 years in Albany as assistant secretary of state, an appointed position, was evidently suitable preparation for the race against Mr. DioGuardi, which she won by a margin of 2 percent.
Now, with Mrs. Lowey the incumbent, the Republican challenger in this year's Congressional race, Glenn D. Bellitto, faces a similarly formidable task: it is also his first try for elected office, his opponent is probably as well prepared financially as she was two years ago and his candidacy has been overshadowed to a degree by the awkward search that preceded it.
 
A Parade of Candidates
The first candidate to be offered the post - and to reject it - was Barry I. Slotnick, the defense lawyer best known for representing Bernhard H. Goetz in the subway shooting case. Mr. Slotnick's early statement that he was considering running against Mrs. Lowey buoyed party officials who saw him as politically astute and able, or at least as able as anyone, to match Mrs. Lowey's election-campaign chest. 
But to their chagrin Mr. Slotnick decided not to run and waited until May 23, the day before the county Republican convention, to say so. The lawyer said he intended to concentrate on helping to resolve the ''turmoil'' in New York City.
Republicans said that the nomination would have been Mr. Slotnick's for the asking and that by waiting he had undermined his party's chances to unseat Mrs. Lowey. Mr. Slotnick, a Scarsdale resident, had all but cleared the field of candidates, according to party officials.
 
Outside Party Ranks
The Republicans then reached outside party ranks for a candidate to oppose Mrs. Lowey, selecting John Schafer, a 39-year-old systems analyst for American Telephone and Telegraph Company, who had lost a race for Mount Vernon comptroller in 1989 and who had run unsuccessfully in other races as a Right to Life Party candidate.
Mr. Schafer, a Conservative, said he had been approached by Republican Party leaders after other Republican candidates were rejected or had withdrawn from consideration. In accepting the nomination on May 24 at the Republican convention in the Y.W.C.A. in White Plains, he promised a vigorous campaign.
Mr. Schafer was on crutches when he accepted the bid, the result of a fall during a basketball game earlier in the day in the same Y. Some Republicans saw Mr. Schafer's hobbled condition as a metaphor of the party's search for someone to challenge Mrs. Lowey, but Mr. Schafer pledged a vigorous fight to unseat the Democratic incumbent.
If that fight occurs, it will see Mr. Schafer coming out of a different corner, that of the Conservative Party, because one week after accepting the Republican endorsement he renounced it, saying he could not be a candidate of a party that included an abortion-rights plank in its 1990 state platform.
That left it to Anthony J. Colavita, the beleaguered county Republican chairman, to find yet another candidate. He turned to Mr. Bellitto, a 32-year-old business analyst with Kraft General Foods in Rye Brook, who had returned from a honeymoon in Hawaii to find the position open again.
''I was not in the earlier selection process,'' he said, ''but when I heard that Schafer had withdrawn I told Republican Party leaders of my interest. They knew who I was.''
Mr. Bellitto's political experience has been limited to work within the Republican Party. He began early, he said, ''handing out election-campaign leaflets at the age of 12,'' later becoming a district leader, president of the 11th Ward Republican Club and a member of the executive committee of the Yonkers Republican City Committee. He also served as vice president of the Westchester County Young Republicans Club.
Mr. Bellitto said he came from a politically conscious family, in that ''my parents were always interested in politics, although not to the extent of running for office.'' The candidate's father, Salvatore J. Bellitto, is director of U.S. banking operations for the General Motors Corporation in Manhattan and his mother, Dolores Bellitto, works in the Bronxville Library.
The candidate, a Bronxville resident since he and his wife, Kyle Moran, bought a cooperative apartment in the village after their marriage on May 6, was born and brought up in Yonkers. He attended Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains and earned two degrees at Harvard University: a bachelor's degree in government in 1980 and a master's degree from the Business School in 1984.
His wife graduated from Dartmouth College in 1980 and entered Harvard Law School at the age of 19, ''one of the youngest ever to do so,'' Mr. Bellitto said. He added that ''she and I met at the Harvard Club in Manhattan and I proposed to her in Harvard Yard last year.'' She now practices in Manhattan.
 
A Hot Line Volunteer
He worked as a financial analyst both for Trans World Airlines in Manhattan and for International Business Machines in Tarrytown before moving to Kraft General Foods. He said he also volunteers as a crisis worker on Covenant House's toll free hot line in Manhattan.
He describes himself as a ''George Bush Republican,'' which he said means ''being opposed to any new taxes, reintensifying the attack on drug use through education and deterrence and supporting the death penalty as an option for a jury when a law-enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty.''
''As for abortion, I take the pro-life position, which is against abortion except in cases of rape, incest and endangerment of the life of the mother.'' Asked how he stood on the Republican Party platform and its abortion-rights plank, Mr. Bellitto said, ''If we can't have a pro-life plank, I'd rather see the state keep its traditional neutrality on the issue.''
He said that for the last eight years the state Republican platform took no position on abortion, and that Republican leaders have said there is room for diversity on the abortion issue.
''Locally,'' he said, ''Westchester County has to start preparing for the 21st Century by rebuilding its infrastructure and modernizing the County Airport without increasing the number of daily flights.'' He said he was also in favor of building the new postal plant at the airport, which has ''good access from I-684.'' Mrs. Lowey has sought to have it placed elsewhere.
He said he deplored the exodus of young people from the county. ''We have to find ways to revitalize communities such as Mount Vernon and Yonkers so they can serve as gateways to life in Westchester for young people just starting out.''
 
A Grass-Roots Campaign
Mr. Bellitto indicated that he was ''starting at the beginning'' in terms of raising money for the campaign. ''It will have to be a grass-roots volunteer campaign,'' he said, adding that the ''exorbitant amounts of money spent in Congressional races in Westchester is disgraceful. The seat in Congress should not be effectively reserved for millionaires.''
Mrs. Lowey, meanwhile, said she has been working a seven-day week in her freshman term and that many of the domestic issues are ''a natural transition from the 13 years in state government where I ran weatherization programs, neighborhood revitalization programs, dealt with housing, child care and senior citizens, and directed a department with offices in Manhattan and Westchester.''
''A number of the issues we dealt with in Albany are Federal issues,'' she said, ''and for the most part were financed in the state by Federal dollars.''
She said that in some areas her state and Federal experiences have overlapped. ''Take coastal zone management. Now that I'm working on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, I've been very actively involved in reauthorizing coastal zone management legislation. At the state level I was responsible for administering the downstate area for coastal zone management, which calls for the balance between economic development and environmental preservation.''
Mrs. Lowey noted that she was on a subcommittee crafting the major child-care bill and on a conference committee with the Senate ''to finalize child-care legislation.''
 
Criticism of the President
Representative Lowey criticized President Bush for ''allowing the savings and loan scandal to continue at a cost of $500 billion'' and added that the President has been lucky ''in presiding over monumental changes, such as in Eastern Europe.''
He played no role in those events, she said, ''but should now be leading the nation in changing its priorities from investing in bombers and missiles into books and math and science and health programs - this is the real battlefield, our domestic economy.''
Mrs. Lowey said she spends three days in Washington and four days in Westchester, has a full-time paid staff of 16, half in each location, and 20 college-age unpaid summer interns, also half in each location.

HEADLINE: Reflections on the Family for Father's Day

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Wellesley College's graduation ceremonies (front page, June 2) will soon be forgotten, despite controversies surrounding student protests over the selection of Barbara Bush as commencement speaker. The students did, however, succeed in forcing Mrs. Bush to confront the issues their petition raised. Her response should give neither comfort nor encouragement to defenders of the status quo. Read carefully, Mrs. Bush's speech asks Americans to reject assumptions underlying conventional ideas about economic growth, work discipline and the sovereignty of the market. 
Each of us, she said, is a ''human being first,'' a nurturing soul for whom time spent ''with a husband'' - or a wife - ''a child, a friend or a parent'' might be more important than tests, verdicts, deals and investments.
Juxtapose this argument with data on the length of the workweek (Week in Review, front page, June 3). A third of all executives - among men, nearly half - spend 49 or more hours at work. The median number of leisure hours among Americans dropped from 26 in 1973 to fewer than 17 in 1987. Why do we work so many hours? Certainly, the new technology makes it possible. Perhaps the new technology even seems to make it necessary in businesses tied to other time zones. But put simply, we do it to make more money. To make the economy grow. To compete with the Japanese.
Otherwise our standard of living will decline. We might have to live longer with outdated video and audio equipment. We might have to drive smaller cars somewhat less comfortable than our living rooms. We might have to wear clothes that look like what we wore last year.
What Barbara Bush has suggested is that we - men and women -reconsider the relationship between the gospel of production and the gospel of life.
What our First Lady is suggesting is that we all slow down a bit, stopping to smell the flowers. To paraphrase an earlier occupant of Mrs. Bush's residence, let us lower our material expectations, sacrificing them on the altar of peace of mind and human warmth. Perhaps then we will have time to understand and inhabit a world in which we - men and women - can be kinder and gentler.
But first, George Bush and his peers will have to offer to young men the same lecture that Barbara Bush has delivered to the women of Wellesley. He will also have to think about policy initiatives that will make such a revaluation of our priorities possible.

Isolated and Disaffected

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Every phase of economic history has its own employee health, family and financial struggles. ''Tales From the Digital Treadmill'' (Week in Review, June 3) offers a glimpse of some of today's. 
In coming articles, however, you should consider that exhaustion, mental stress and alienation from family aren't the only ways working people pay for the unforgiving hard edge and fast pace of globally competitive high technology. Broad changes in the shape of the economy have meant equally broad shifts in the minutiae of daily life.
Young couples, for instance, can't get the banking credit our parents came to expect. We're asked to dig deeper to pay for health-care plans employers once covered as a matter of course. Rising car-insurance costs have proceeded with decreases in coverage. Salary freezes and late work nights mean we take fewer vacations and can't spend them together. Layoffs and hiring freezes that eliminate colleagues and backup teams mean we move through life increasingly alone. Friends and neighbors can't help. They're working late, too. And while occasional meals out and days at the beach offer nice respite, they don't solve problems.
You say it's tough to gauge whether the economy gains from all this hard work. A better question would be: How can a working person care about a dubious economic index when his own lifestyle is nothing like the one he grew up expecting?

HEADLINE: Americans Still Don't Want to Give Up the $1 Bill for a $1 Coin

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Changing Change,'' your June 3 editorial endorsement of legislation to abolish the dollar bill, leaves me puzzled. You point out the overwhelming opposition to the proposal, but decide the voters should have to swallow it whether they like it or not. 
Potential budget savings are a good reason to hold hearings on the idea, but backers of the Susan B. Anthony dollar made similar (if more modest) claims in 1978. They said the coin would save us $10.5 million a year. It didn't. In fact, we're now using 50,000 cubic feet at the Mint and Federal Reserve Banks to store 424 million untouched Susan B. Anthony dollars.
You note that eight other countries have adopted high-denomination coins and cite Canada's new dollar, an 11-sided monstrosity aptly nicknamed the ''loonie.'' Why not emulate the 171 countries that have not adopted new coins? Finally, you say inflation has made the dollar bill out of date. Why? Would a coin stop or slow inflation? Of course not.
You put the Susan B. Anthony fiasco down to ''poor public preparation'' and failure to discontinue the dollar bill. In other words, the Government didn't jam it far enough down the public's throat. The Susan B. Anthony dollar flopped because most Americans did not want it. According to an April Gallup poll, 85 percent don't want a dollar coin now either, if it means getting rid of the greenback. We should let well enough alone and keep the dollar bill.

The Susan B. Anthony dollar failed because you can't buy anything with it. To carry an effective number of them makes a person jingle like a dog with a noisy collar. 
Let's get ahead of inflation. Skip to a $5 coin. Three or four could buy a bag of groceries. One could be a tip for dinner. We could even get change back at McDonald's again.
Once people get used to the convenience of a fiver (with five sides?), there will be a natural demand for a $1 coin to give as change. And if we design $10 and $20 coins now, the vending machine industry can plan for them and drive the demand as inflation takes us there.
Representative Silvio Conte is correct that a copper dollar (giant penny) seems ludicrous. How about recycling the heavy metals from used batteries into a useful product? Every politician's district creates trash.

HEADLINE: New World, New C.I.A.

BYLINE: By David L. Boren; David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The cold war is over. And some now argue that in this dramatically changed world, intelligence services like the C.I.A. are costly anachronisms that should be sharply reduced. In fact these changes have increased, not decreased, the need for the right kind of intelligence. What's called for is not less intelligence activity but the acquisition of new and different kinds of information.
For years, the Soviet military threat was the driving force behind intelligence budgets. Today, the Warsaw Pact is no longer a viable military threat, although the Soviet Union remains highly armed. Now we must begin to confront the question of how to relate to a democratic Soviet Union and how to contend with the explosion of information about that country and Eastern Europe. 
We must have a strategy, vision and discipline to guide U.S. intelligence in the future. This is particularly so because budgets will not be as large, and bureaucracies accustomed to unprecedented growth in resources cannot be allowed to sanctify the present and ignore the future.
Despite world trends toward democracy, caution is required. Our evidence shows that espionage against the United States has not diminished. Emerging East European democracies are struggling to control intelligence and security services that remain loyal to their K.G.B. masters. The Soviet Union, while moving toward cooperation with us in many areas, remains the only nation in the world capable of destroying us with nuclear weapons. As the U.S.S.R. experiences its own internal power struggles and moves through a radical transformation, we can never be certain whose hand will be on the nuclear trigger.
U.S. intelligence must be able to monitor Soviet military deployments and developments as well as the intentions of Soviet political and military leaders. We also must have the means to verify new and complicated arms control agreements and protect against technological breakouts.
While superpower tensions are easing, the world is not completely at peace. The proliferation of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons -especially in less responsible nations - threatens the entire world. Regional conflicts show no sign of abating. The political instability that feeds terrorism has not waned. Dangers of war between India and Pakistan present the world with the possibility of nuclear confrontation. The West's dependence on oil imported from the Persian Gulf continues to grow.
These are not new problems. But we should now focus on them more of our resources that were once consumed by the Soviet military threat.
The strategy to guide U.S. intelligence must be based on a number of factors. First, we have to re-emphasize classic human-source intelligence. We are weakest at determining the intentions of our adversaries and friends. Better human intelligence is critical to meeting the threats of the next century: penetrating terrorist cells, breaking the money-laundering activities of narco-traffickers and combating the spread of weapons technology.
The Congressional oversight committees are working with the C.I.A. to develop an innovative, long-term strategy that sheds cold war priorities and focuses on language and cultural skills and economic expertise.
Even in the most sensitive relationships, we must now align ourselves with the forces of change in the world. Anti-Communism can no longer justify cozy relationships with foreign intelligence services that commit or condone human rights abuses or prop up authoritarian regimes.
Second, we must understand that future American influence will depend more upon our economic strength and less upon our military strength. Nations previously followed our lead because they needed our protection. Now our influence will have to come more from economic strength and the strength of the example of our political and social systems.
The fastest growing area of espionage activities by foreign governments against the U.S. is not the theft of military secrets, but the theft of commercial secrets from private American companies to further national economic interests. This confronts the United States with serious questions of policy. How do we protect against government-conducted commercial espionage? Should we retaliate by collecting such information ourselves? If we did collect it, how could it be appropriately used by a free enterprise system with many competing producers of the same goods?
One thing is certain: Future intelligence officers will need a high level of ability to understand and evaluate economic data on subjects as diverse as currency, trade policy and new commercial technologies.
Third, the U.S. military presence abroad will be reduced. Thus the projection of U.S. forces will be much more difficult in the future, and we will need earlier warning of hostile intentions. Information must be timely and complete and in a form useful to our military commanders.
Intelligence excesses are largely behind us. We now have a body of laws and a process of Congressional intelligence oversight that aggressively seeks to insure that the C.I.A. operates in a manner consistent with the fundamental values of the American people. Critics should not ignore the fact that the intelligence community today is led by a man, Judge William Webster, who is committed to telling the truth and obeying the law.
Now is not the time to think about dismantling our intelligence service or calling for mindless budget slashing. The men and women of the intelligence community provide us with real accomplishments about which there can be little public discussion.
The transformation of our intelligence priorities is beginning. The oversight committees and the leadership of the intelligence community have begun the dialogue. The members of the Senate Intelligence Committee understand all too well that we will place our nation at risk if we do not change our thinking to reflect the changes in the world around us.

Moscow Rethinks The Art Of the Deal

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
AN old negotiators' adage has it that Americans play poker, Russians play chess.
Whether the issue is limiting nuclear warheads or getting a taxi driver to go to your destination, the characteristic Soviet bargaining style is a chesslike probing for weaknesses, a stubborn patience in the end game.
Since he returned invigorated from his tour in America, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been the grandmaster, taking on all challengers simultaneously - easing into negotiations with the wayward Baltic leaders, inching toward an agreement on German unification, jockeying with his popular rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, testing the country's appetite for a market economy.
With Mr. Gorbachev, the game is still chess. But for students of the game, the past week has been filled with illustrations of how Mr. Gorbachev has altered the Soviet style of play. 
In ''Negotiating with the Soviets,'' his recent book on Soviet conduct at the bargaining table, Raymond F. Smith identifies three related rules of behavior that tend to govern Soviet officials' negotiating style. Mr. Gorbachev, says the author, who is currently counselor for political affairs at the American Embassy in Moscow, seems bent on violating all of them.
The first trait, according to Mr. Smith, is a preoccupation with authority. While Americans may start out looking for common ground, the typecast Soviet citizen, whether he is a restaurant doorman or an arms control negotiator, is keen to establish his place in the pecking order. Every relationship is initially a test of strength. Compromise, the pragmatic ideal of American civil relations, is in Russian tradition a form of submission and, worse, a sign of weak principles. Negotiations tend to be a bartering of concessions, but the idea of splitting the difference is shameful.
Second is a powerful aversion to risk. American culture tends to reward the optimist, the entrepreneur. Russian tradition and Communist practice teach that he who sticks his neck out gets his head lopped off. The Soviet negotiator takes no chances; his strategy is to draw out the proposals of the other side and snipe at them.
Josef Stalin reinforced this authoritarian, risk-avoiding Russian tradition with a pervasive central control over society. In negotiations, Mr. Smith writes, the Soviet style is to try to manipulate all possible outcomes - for example, by seeking generally worded agreements that can later be re-interpreted in their favor.
Mr. Gorbachev, it now seems clear, has set out to introduce a new political culture, one that tolerates pluralism, values compromise and rewards initiative. It shows in the style he brings to his bargaining on both foreign policy and domestic issues. But he still struggles with traditional habits, which are rooted deeply in his society and - because Gorbachev is himself a Russian of peasant stock and Communist upbringing - in his own instincts.
Mr. Gorbachev is comfortable with risk and compromise in a way that his predecessors were not. Where a traditional Soviet negotiator might have waited out the other side, Mr. Gorbachev has little patience with impasse.
Watch him coming to terms with the future of Europe, where the Soviets have measured their security in terms of control - a buffer of subjugated territory and a huge arsenal. Now the comforting buffer is dissolving and the linchpin of the Warsaw Pact military alliance, East Germany, seems in the process of defecting to the West. Mr. Gorbachev keeps reaching into his bottomless briefcase and pulling out a new compromise. Last week he announced he would not object if West Germany's army remained in the NATO military alliance, even if East Germany's troops are withdrawn from the command structure of the Soviet bloc.
When it comes to domestic challengers, Mr. Gorbachev's behavior has been more ambiguous. He has freed his society from Stalinist controls but his sense of the authoritative pecking order sometimes seems right out of the old textbook. Rivals like Mr. Yeltsin, who as the new President of the Russian Federation has been promoting sovereignty for that vast republic, have been treated with scorn. Mr. Gorbachev has dismissed suggestions that he share power with insurgents, offering them only the most subordinate posts in his Government. In his dealings with the Lithuanian separatists, he insisted that any negotiations could begin only after Lithuanian leaders had bowed to the authority of Soviet law. To drive the point home, he slapped an oil embargo on the republic.
But last week, Mr. Gorbachev invited in the leaders of all the republics, including Mr. Yeltsin, and offered to remake the union as an alliance of ''sovereign states.'' Then he met with the presidents of the three Baltic republics and proposed terms that he said could lead to their independence. If Mr. Gorbachev is sincere about treating republican leaders as equals, last week's meetings were a turning point.
On the economy, Mr. Gorbachev finds himself contending with both the cautious instincts and the authoritarian tradition of his people. He wants to move the country away from the shabby security of a state-run economy toward a free market, and he wants to do it with a measure of popular consensus. It is not clear that he can do both. Judging from the debate last week in parliament, the public fears the risk of the market, and, paradoxically, wants Mr. Gorbachev to tell it what to do. Forced to vote on the Government's proposal to raise bread prices, the risk-averse parliament issued a resounding no. But the parliamentarians voted almost without dissent for a measure instructing Mr. Gorbachev to begin dismantling state economic monopolies by presidential decree.
Clearly, in this negotiation, Mr. Gorbachev is up against a society playing by Soviet rules.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Designing Tankers To Minimize Oil Spills

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Lately, and to everyone's disgust, oil and water do mix. As oil globules wash ashore from a spill in the Kill van Kull and fan out from the smoldering tanker in the Gulf of Mexico, America's latest oil import crisis, getting the stuff safely to shore, is stirring new interest in tanker safety. Engineers have proposed several steps, but they often contradict each other.
In the meantime, the world drinks more oil every year, and tends to import it over longer and longer distances as wells outside the Middle East dry up.
The most widely debated safety measure is double bottoms or double hulls to provide an added layer for protection in a grounding. Some experts say that if the Exxon Valdez had had a double hull, it would have spilled far less than the 11 million gallons it spread over Prince William Sound 15 months ago. Conoco announced recently that it will order double-hulled ships, and the House version of a bill now before Congress would require them. 
That step has been bitterly opposed by the American Bureau of Shipping, a private association with some regulatory functions. It is controlled by ship owners and now headed by Frank Iarossi, who was president of the Exxon Shipping Company at the time of the Valdez grounding. Exxon maintains that if the outer layer of a double hull is pierced, water rushing into the space between the hulls will make the ship settle lower, impaling itself more firmly. Others say explosive gases can gather in the space and corrosion can proceed uninspected.
Environmentalists suspect that another factor looms larger: such a hull is about 15 percent more expensive to build.
Mr. Iarossi was said by a spokesman, Thomas J. Tucker, to be abroad last week and unavailable for comment. Mr. Tucker said of double-hulling: ''There's an endless number of changes you could in theory make. It's a question of what can be done with regard to both safety and economy. There has to be a balance between what is practical and what is considered safe.''
Another option that has attracted interest is loading the tanker so as to contain the oil even if the hull is punctured. Proposed by George C. Blake, executive vice president of the Overseas Shipholding Group, a Manhattan-based company with about 45 tankers, the idea is to load only enough oil to make the pressure on the inside of the hull equal the pressure from seawater on the outside.
Since oil weighs 86 percent as much as salt water, this means that oil would still be carried above the water line. But it would not flow through a hole in the bottom.
''This is not to say that with tides and things you wouldn't get some transfer of oil,'' Mr. Blake said. ''But you certainly wouldn't have had the wave of oil that people described when the Exxon Valdez went aground.''
This kind of loading, called hydrostatic balancing, would cut cargo capacities by 15 to 20 percent, he estimated. But the Valdez accident is proof of calculations that it works, he said; after about 15 percent of the cargo was lost, the leak stopped.
Mr. Blake says there would be a corollary benefit. Currently, tankers empty their ballast tanks when they load and refill the tanks when they empty. The ballast tanks, alternately filled with salt water and salty, humid air, are a frequent site of rust. With partial loading, the tanks could be kept filled at all times, with fresh water.
Mr. Blake blames such rust for several recent accidents, including the Khark 5 off the Canary Islands in December. The Iranian tanker spilled 20 million gallons.
Another measure that could be taken now, advanced by Swedish engineers, is putting emergency shutoff valves on the air vents in tankers. When a tanker's compartments are pumped out, these vents let air in. If they were sealed upon a grounding, then after a little oil had leaked the vacuum pressure would hold the rest in, the theory goes. Here, too, the water pressure would equal the oil pressure, which would be reduced by the vacuum.
Edwin J. Roland, the president of Amoco Transport Company and the chairman of the American Petroleum Institute's marine transportation committee, favors another way to achieve hydrostatic balance, recently presented by Mitsubishi, the giant shipbuilder. It calls for building ships with ballast tanks all the way down each side, as a kind of bumper. In the middle would be oil tanks, but instead of side by side, as in a conventional ship, they would be stacked, to keep the oil pressure low.
''It gives you collision protection, it doesn't allow leakage if you penetrate bottom, and doesn't lock you in position if you run aground,'' Mr. Roland said.
He estimated the cost at 15 to 20 percent, similar to a double hull or partial loading. That increase sounds large, but transportation accounts for only a small fraction of oil's cost, $1.50 to $2.25 a barrel from the Persian Gulf and 80 cents to $1.25 from Europe, said Peter C. Beutel, a trader at Elders Futures in New York. A 20 percent increase on a $2 shipping bill comes to 40 cents, or just under a penny a gallon.
Mr. Blake's theory is that no tanker owner will assume such expense in isolation, and that the changes should therefore be ordered uniformly. But Mr. Roland said: ''I think today we would unilaterally make that kind of investment, no matter what the competition did. It's good business to stay out of trouble with the environment.''
That will be harder as time goes on. Unless tankers become safer, the prospect is that spills will increase with the volume of oil on the water. Global demand for oil is growing at about 2 percent a year, and the Middle East, with more than 60 percent of the world's reserves, will account for a larger and larger share of production.
And tankers are growing bigger. The largest today are 30 times bigger than the largest at the end of World War II. The new ones are less maneuverable and take far more draft; the Mega Borg, for example, was too big for many Gulf ports and was offloading some oil to smaller vessels when she was hit by an explosion.
 
THINKING BIG
 
Maximum tanker sizes at the end opf World War II and today. The supertankers are harder to maneuver, and likely to spill more oil when damaged.

1989: 550,819 deadweight tons

A QUICK FIX
Some engineers advocate loading tankers less than full - to about 80 percent of capacity - as a ready way to reduce oil spills without modifying tankers.
The strategy, called hydrostatic balancing, works on a simple principle. Oil gushes from torn ships only so long as the pressure of the oil against the inside of the ship is greater than the water pressure against the outside. When enough oil has escaped so that the pressures are about equal, the hemorrhaging stops - even if millions of gallons remain aboard a badly damaged vessel, as was the case with the Exxon Valdez. So the less full the tanker is to begin with, the less pressure on its internal walls and the less oil rushes into the sea when the hull is ruptured.
To keep a less-than-full tanker from riding too high in the ocean, the ballast tanks could be kept permanently filled with water, a departure from the common practice of emptying them as oil is pumped aboard and refilling them as oil is off-loaded. Proponents say this would bring an extra advantage: ship owners could afford to use expensive fresh water if they had to fill the ballast tanks just once, and this would significantly reduce the corrosion caused by the repeated pumping of salt water into and out of the tanks.

Why It Costs So Much To Run New York State

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
WHEN New York State's politicians hit the campaign trail this summer, voters can expect to hear some nasty exchanges about the state's financial problems. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is already blaming the difficulties on a national economic slowdown presided over by a Republican President. And the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Pierre A. Rinfret, is almost certain to attribute them to years of overspending under Democratic governors.
Both sides are, in some sense, correct. The immediate cause of New York fiscal problems is, as Mr. Cuomo notes, an economic slowdown that depressed tax collections and left a gaping hole in the state budget. But looked at from a long-term perspective, New York's fiscal distress appears to be a product of persistently high spending. By almost every measure available, government spending in New York exceeds that of other states.
''Apparently New Yorkers have a rich taste for services,'' said Robert Rafuse, a senior fellow at the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, a Congressional agency. ''This is not a judgment call. It is just something that is clear from the statistics.'' 
It's also clear from the statistics that New York employs more state and local government workers in proportion to its population than all other states except Alaska and Wyoming, but whether this indicates a needlessly bloated bureaucracy or reflects a high level of services is open to argument.
Indeed, statistics that measure the combined expenditures of state and local governments show that New York's per capita outlays are the second-highest in the nation, according to the United States Census Bureau. Only those of oil-rich Alaska are higher. In 1988, the latest year for which Census Bureau data are available, per capita spending by state and local governments in New York was $5,025, 50 percent higher than the national average. In neighboring Connecticut, per capita spending was $3,586, and in New Jersey it was $3,708.
 
Spending More for Everything
Behind New York's figures are higher-than-average payments for just about every service government delivers. To educate one child, New York spends $7,561 a year, more than any other state except New Jersey, according to figures compiled by State Policy Research Inc., a private organization in Alexandria, Va. For each child on Medicaid, the state spends $790 a year, a figure that is higher only in Alaska and Ohio. And to administer one welfare case, New York spends $1,118, more than every other state except Idaho and Oregon, and almost twice the national average.
New York's state and local government workers, most of whom belong to politically powerful public-employee unions, are paid more than their counterparts in all but two states, Alaska and California. The average government salary in New York as of 1988 was $31,368 a year. The national average was $26,244.
Over the years both political parties have participated in New York's extended spending spree. The state was known as a high roller in the 1960's when Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, led the government, just as it is known as one now with Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, presiding.
''What we're looking at here are 50 years of expenditure decisions, and 50 years of decisions to borrow money,'' said Hal Hovey, the president of State Policy Research. ''There were a lot of people involved and a lot of decisions.''
Such consistently high spending, it would seem, ought to have a compelling justification. Yet none is evident. One possibility is that New York spends more because its residents have more money. But even when wealth is factored out, New York is still a big spender. For each $1,000 of personal income earned by New Yorkers in 1988, state and local governments spent $280, or 30 percent more than the national average, according to Census Bureau figures. Only three other states - Alaska, Wyoming and Utah - spent more.
 
Higher Prices and More in Need
Other possible explanations are that prices are higher in the state, while a greater proportion of the residents are in need. In recent years, however, financial analysts have come up with a complex method of comparing state spending that adjusts for both the salaries of government workers in the state and the number of people who are likely to be eligible for services there. Even when these adjustments are made, government spending in New York is higher than in any other state, and 50 percent higher than the national average.
So what are the other possible explanations? Financial analysts say that there are two. The first is that New York provides more comprehensive services than other states. The second is that it provides its services less efficiently. ''You can characterize it as service differences or you can characterize it as waste,'' Mr. Hovey said. ''The math supports either conclusion.'' A good place to try to find some of the roots of New York's high spending is Medicaid, one of the state's largest and fastest growing government expenses. Half of all Medicaid costs are paid for by the Federal Government; in New York the other half is split between the state and local governments. A study last year by the State Comptroller's office noted that while New York has only 10 percent of the nation's Medicaid recipients, its Medicaid expenditures accounted for almost 20 percent of the nation's total Medicaid spending.
The study did not identify causes for New York's disproportionately high costs, but it noted several factors that clearly contributed. For one thing, Medicaid patients in New York tend to stay in the hospital longer than patients in other states, an average of 11.3 days compared with 6.3 days in California. In addition, while other states impose tight limits on outpatient services for Medicaid patients, New York has few such limits.
What the Medicaid statistics do not show, once again, is whether New York is providing better health services or is simply wasting money. State officials dwell on the former possibility. ''Typically we do provide more services to people in need,'' said the state budget director, Dall W. Forsythe. ''And I think we can argue successfully that we often buy better services. The things that New Yorkers have decided to pay more for are very reasonable and sensible.''
State officials also speculate that New York spends more on social services because its needy population is afflicted with more serious problems. New York's Medicaid patients tend to be sicker than patients in other states, this argument goes, so the state has to spend more to treat them. The argument is hard to prove, but experts say that it probably has some merit.
''The problems of the underclass are much worse in New York than in other states,'' said Steven Gold, director of the State University of New York's Center for the Study of the States. ''And New York City's problems are more severe.''
Predictably, state officials play down the importance of inefficiency as a factor in New York's high spending. But staffing levels in the state suggest otherwise. For every 10,000 New York State residents, there are 634 state and local government employees, according to the latest Census data. The national average is 504 workers for 10,000 residents. In New Jersey the figure is 516 government workers and in Connecticut 484.
Not only does New York have a higher proportion of government workers than other states, but also the number of government workers in the state is growing at a faster rate. Between 1980 and 1988, the number of government workers in New York grew by 20 percent at a time when the population was shrinking, according to a recent study by the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey. Eight other states had faster growth rates, but most of these states, including Florida, Arizona and Texas, also had growing populations.
Taken together, these statistics show that to reduce spending, New York has few choices besides cutting back on the services it provides and on the number of workers who provide them. Making the cuts, however, means making the kind of tough political choices that neither party has shown itself eager to make. So while voters should expect to hear a lot of theorizing about the source of New York's fiscal problems this summer, they should not expect to hear a lot of talk about solutions.

The tables below compare data from the seven states with populations of 10 million or more. Additionally, each state's standing among the 50 states is shown under the ''national rank'' headings. Outlays shown in these tables reflect both state and local expenditures. Comparing spending at only the state level can be misleading because the division of state and local fiscal responsibilities differs from place to place.

HEADLINE: Preventive Medicine, Soviet-Style

BYLINE: By CAROL STRICKLAND

 BODY:
''DAVAI! DAVAI!'' or ''Go on! Go on!'' shouted the young female obstetrician to the woman in labor at Leningrad's Obstetrics Polyclinic.
''Push, push,'' 14 American observers urged, watching the baby being born. The Soviet doctor then turned to helping the mother deliver the placenta. The baby girl, swaddled in blankets so that even her face was invisible, was left alone on a table against a wall.
''I couldn't believe that no one was observing and examining the newborn,'' said Dr. Lisa Baker, a family-practice doctor at the State University at Stony Brook. ''I kept asking where was the baby.'' 
Thirteen third-year Stony Brook medical students and Dr. Baker recently spent 11 days in Leningrad investigating preventive medicine. Instead of bearing stethoscopes and syringes, they carried a 12-by-4-foot banner reading, ''Peace Begins with Friendship.'' The malady they were combating had more to do with remmants of the Cold War than the common cold. ''Prevention of nuclear war,'' said Frank Pessler, a student, ''is the greatest piece of preventive medicine in this age.''
Differences in health-care practices struck the American visitors most forcibly, but members of the Long Island group said they also found commonality.
''Both of our countries face crises in health,'' said Virginia Cummings, a Stony Brook medical student. ''The Soviet Union's great problem is a lack of money for equipment, medication and up-to-date facilities. Our great problem is the waste of money and the loss of the physician-patient relationship in a sea of technology.''
The mission linking peace and public health began in September 1988, when a group of five Soviet doctors, members of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, an organization awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, visited Stony Brook. They returned to Leningrad with letters from Long Island medical students to their peers in the First Medical Institute Pavlov. A lively exchange of correspondence ensued, involving 30 pen pals in each country.
Last October, two Stony Brook students - Michael Vardy and Mr. Pessler - and Dr. Baker, all members of Physicians for Social Responsibility, an affiliate of the international physicians group, attended the latter organization's world congress in Hiroshima. In Japan, they met two of their Leningrad counterparts and planned exchange visits.
 
Soviet Students Awaited>
The Americans' visit to the Soviet Union this spring was the first arranged by students, rather than Communist Party hierarchy. Next fall, 14 Soviet medical students will arrive at Stony Brook to spread the message of both student groups: In Mr. Vardy's words: ''The individual can be healthy only when society is healthy.''
To gauge the health of Soviet society, the Americans took a crash course in Soviet medicine, touring hospitals, observing operations and attending medical school classes. They discovered that mandatory course offerings in the U.S.S.R. include ''Scientific Atheism,'' ''History of the Communist Party'' and ''War Medicine.''
''Soviet health care,'' said Lisa Hall, a Stony Brook student, ''is like walking into a hospital here 50 years ago. It was like seeing an old film - very simple.''
Indeed, a 1987 internal medicine text suggests using leeches to treat malignant hypertension.
Because most Soviet hospitals lack sophisticated equipment, doctors rely on low-tech inexpensive therapies like acupuncture and ''phytotherapy,'' or herbal medicine. A hand-lettered sign at the Institute of Nephrology recommended use of birch leaf extracts for kidney infection, one student said. A postoperative cardiac patient ''was inhaling camomile vapors out of a tea can,'' said Mr. Pessler, who noted the herb's antiseptic properties.
Although they said they found medicine in the U.S.S.R. primitive, the Americans gave Soviet doctors high marks for physical diagnosis, which, said Cathy Raduns, another student, ''has become a lost art in America because of technology.''
Mr. Pessler observed the hands-on approach when a Soviet cardiologist applied two fingers to a patient's chest, felt ''something like a cat's purr'' and diagnosed a hypertrophied left ventricle and left atrium. An X-ray (held up to a window for lack of a X-ray veiwer) confirmed his diagnosis.
Although lack of advanced equipment forces the Soviets to be excellent clinicians, in other areas the scarcity of technology is a clear disadvantage.
''For every 100 people who need chronic renal dialysis,'' Mr. Pessler said, ''they can treat only 15.''
In other cases, the New York students said they believed attitudes more than meager resources caused system deficiencies. ''The feminist revolution went right by them,'' Ms. Cummings said.
Although 80 percent of Soviet doctors are women, compared to 32 percent of the student body at Stony Brook Medical School, ''Women were not in specialties considered challenging,'' said Lyn Yasumura, another strudent. ''Never did a woman speak to us as a physician in a powerful position.'' Ms. Yasumura said she also heard remarks like, ''Women do not have the moral fiber to be doctors.''
Most shocking to the Long Island contingent was official blindness to the threat of AIDS. ''They've decided that AIDS does not exist,'' said Ms. Cummings. ''They actually punish physicians who diagnose it because they don't want to hear it.''
Although Government statistics say there are 470 cases of AIDS in the Soviet Union, the Americans said they learned that there were actually thousands, and hundreds of thousands of people infected.
The Americans said they discovered that AIDS was spreading almost unchecked, with transmission primarily due to reusing unsterilized hospital equipment and transfusing contaminated blood.
Only since 1988 have the Soviets screened blood in major cities. Elsewhere, the blood supply is contaminated and disposable needles and tubing are unavailable. Even rubber gloves are washed and reused.
Living with host families, the Americans observed Soviet culture as well as medicine at close range. The contact revealed dissimilarities:
''We have a sense of freedom about ourselves and how we live,'' Ms. Raduns said. ''In the subway we talk in animated voices. There, the people whisper if they talk at all.''
The Soviet student hosts were surprised to observe their American friends openly debating every aspect of their itinerary.
''At our typical meeting, everyone was interrupting and shouting,'' Ms. Yasumura said. ''Everybody has an opinion and everybody's opinion is right. My host just couldn't comprehend it, but that's democracy.''
Despite cultural differences, the two groups developed close bonds. After one evening party, ''We had a group hug,'' Dr. Baker said, with Soviets and Americans ''arm in arm, male and female. We were able to love and accept each other so easily. Why couldn't our Governments?''
Dr. Baker's hosts called her ''our daughter,'' and tended her when she was sick with a cold. ''They called me Lizenga. It means dear sweet tiny Lisa.''
The Stony Brook students may not go back to Leningrad, but they will welcome their friends to Long Island in the fall. A roller-coaster ride and a shopping trip to a mall are high priorities for the Soviets, for whom perestroika thus far has meant belt-tightening shortages.
''My host says he thinks he'll have a heart attack when he sees a supermarket,'' said Ms. Hall.
 
'Renewed Pride in University'
The trip will include more weighty activities, too. The visitors will attend a Physicians for Social Responsibility conference and tour University Hospital at Stony Brook.
''We have renewed pride in what our university has to offer,'' said another student, Jill Kraft. ''Yet it's important for us to show them the inequities - how our system works and doesn't work.''
''We'll show them a realistic cross- section,'' Mr. Pessler said. ''We'll take them to the Harlem Hospital Center, which is as dramatic as it gets at a chronically underfunded city hospital, and then to Mount Sinai, about the most capitalistic hospital you could find.''
''We saw over and over again that Soviet health problems are economic,'' said Adrienne Kane, a student. 'Their skills and intelligence are tops. If we spent more money on health care instead of war, we'd be leaps and bounds ahead. In a sense, we're in the same boat.''
For another student, Ann Marie Alino, the most memorable moment of the trip was her encounter with a Soviet soldier who served two years in Poland.
''We see pictures of tanks rolling into Afghanistan and think of the Soviets as war-hungry militarists,'' she said. ''But this soldier said he just missed his mom and dad and dog the whole time on active duty. Now when I look at the news, I'll think of that young boy.'' Ms. Alino said.

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: CHESHIRE;
Residents Alarmed by State Plans for Town

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
CHESHIRE is the site of two state prisons. Now that two more are under construction, slated for completion in the fall, and the state has proposed taking over almost half of a condominium project in the town for low- and moderate-income housing, people in Cheshire are saying that they are being asked to shoulder too much of the state's social responsibility.
''My town seems to be getting killed,'' said State Representative Mary G. Fritz, whose district straddles the Cheshire-Wallingford border. ''I think the state went ahead with all this because Cheshire has always just accepted these things. This is the first time the town has stood up and fought.'' 
Mrs. Fritz said she has tried without success to persuade the legislature to find some way of sharing the burden of prisons and other unwanted services. ''There is this feeling statewide that as long as it's not in my town, fine,'' she said. ''A formula to share the burden equally never comes up.''
 
Improvements Sought
Louis A. Zullo, the assistant to Chesire's Town Manager, said the town is negotiating with the state over the prison projects but has abandoned hopes of blocking them and is seeking some road or sewer repairs or other improvements in exchange.
''I'm not saying the town is looking for any favors,'' said Mr. Zullo. ''But we could use some breaks.''
Cheshire is already the site of the 672-bed Manson Youth Institute - what used to be called a reformatory - and the medium-security, 804-bed Cheshire Community Correctional Center. A spokesman for the State Department of Corrections, William Wheeler, said a 300-bed prison that could be used for minimum- or maximum-security inmates will be completed in Cheshire in August. And a 100-bed Alternative Incarceration Unit, the state's first attempt at boot-camp-style prison for 16-to-21-year-old first-time offenders who are not considered threats to the community, is to open in November.
Prisoners at the boot camp will undergo rigorous physical training, he said, and will learn vocational skills and self-help techniques. They will do community work ''like roadside cleanup and that sort of thing,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''We're trying to be good neighbors.''
Mr. Wheeler said Edson T. Bourn of Cheshire has been named warden of the boot camp, ''so there's one person in town who's not complaining.''
But there are not many more greeting the new prisons warmly, apparently, even though they are being built near the existing ones.
The community has changed greatly since the first correctional center was built there in the 1950's, said Mr. Zullo. Since then, he said, an elementary school has been built across the street from the prison, a nursing home opened down the road, and local farmlands have been bulldozed into subdivisions. The town of some 26,000 residents ''is not a sleepy little hamlet anymore,'' Mr. Zullo said.
The prisons' neighbors ''have problems with noise out there now,'' said Mrs. Fritz, who tried to help a local group block the boot camp's construction. ''What's it going to be like when they're marching the prisoners around at 5 o'clock in the morning?''
Mr. Zullo said he knows of no other town in the state that has four prisons and few that have a prison population that approaches 10 percent of the town's.
''In terms of sheer numbers of beds, we have to be right up there near the top,'' he said. ''Cheshire feels it's borne an unfair share of the prison population.''
At the Birchwood condominiums, where the state has proposed its takeover, residents say they fear the plan will dilute the value of their units.
''Discouraging isn't the word,'' said Lynn McKee, one of the Birchwood residents who have filed suit to stop the state program. ''If this goes through, my unit won't be worth what I owe on it.''
Steven G. Mednick, a lawyer from New Haven who is representing the Birchwood owners, said the suit is not a class battle. ''The people who live there now are not much different, economically, than the moderate-income people who would be involved in this program,'' he said. ''We're not trying to undermine the program, we're trying to make sure the people who already own units there are not harmed.''
Mr. Zullo said that while the town recognizes the need for affordable housing, municipal officials have asked the state to scale back its purchase of units at Birchwood.
''Instead of the 35 they're talking about, maybe a dozen or so would be more appropriate,'' Mr. Zullo said.
The apartment owners say they fear the loss of their equity if the state takes over the rest of the 84-unit project and begins selling the apartments at bargain prices.
Ms. McKee, a single mother, said she bought her unit for $99,000 two years ago.If the state purchases of the remaining ones, she said, they will be selling for either $28,000 or $46,000, depending on a buyer's income, which will drag down the price of her apartment.
Under the state program, the Condominium Acquisition Pilot, the state would purchase apartments then sell or rent them to low- or middle- income families. If sold, the units would have deed restrictions on the resale price, so no one could make unreasonable profits.
Birchwood is one of 17 developments over which the State Department of Housing is negotiating for units. The State Housing Commissioner, John F. Papandrea, said he could not comment specifically on Birchwood, because those talks have not been completed. But he said the pilot program will not detract from anyone's equity.
''We don't determine market value,'' Mr. Papandrea said. ''Market value is determined by a variety of other factors, and at this point, we're seeing, throughout the state, the effects of a deteriorating market.''
 
Helping and Hurting
But Mr. Mednick, who represents 32 of the 33 unit owners at Birchwood and the owners at a development in Branford that might also be enrolled in the program, said the plan could lower the value of the remaining units.
Many of the people at Birchwood paid about $100,000 for their units, putting 10 or 20 percent down, so they now carry mortgages of $80,000 to $90,000. If the value of the units drop to $46,000, the price of the higher-priced state units, the lawyer said, the owners would owe $24,000 to $34,000 more than the apartments are worth and would spend years working off that debt.
''You don't want to help 30 moderate-income people by hurting 30 other moderate-income people,'' Mr. Mednick said. ''If the state is so sure there is going to be no diminution of value, it should provide an equity guarantee, so that if anyone loses money, the state would make up the difference.
''These are hard-working, middle income people, single parents in many cases, who put their entire life savings into the down payment for these condos. Now they're facing a state program that may take that away from them.''

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Detour Off a Well-Worn Chinese Route

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
DO you have a yen for Chinese food, but would rather not travel the moo shu pork/egg roll route? Fu Ho in Syosset is tempting diners with the likes of black pepper veal, fresh banana chicken and shredded jellyfish. Long Island standbys are also available, but Chinese food fanciers who want to abandon well-worn culinary ruts can do so at this attractive newcomer.
Syosset residents will recognize the location as a former Friendly's. The familiar New England-style building has been transformed into a Chinese pagoda complete with green tiles over the doorway, golden dragons decorating the cupola and stone Foo dogs on guard at the door. 
Inside, no ice cream parlor echoes remain. A bracelet of lights, mirrors and a crystal chandelier are in the mode of the new, elegant, Hong Kong-style dining palaces now dotting Chinatown.
Service as well as food breaks the local mold. Instead of the Orient Express (rush 'em in, rush 'em out), the smiling owner hovers, admonishing patrons to eat slowly and enjoy the food.
Enjoyment comes easily at Fu Ho. Tempting soups are led by tofu vegetable and Fu Ho seafood, both simple, fresh and zingy with flavor. Old friends, wonton and hot and sour, are in place, but egg drop is mysteriously missing. Egg drop does make a guest appearance as part of two other soups. One, mushroom corn soup, is thin and dull. The other, snow white rainbow beef soup, is a tasty brew with chards of beef and crunchy vegetables.
Two of Fu Ho's most unusual appetizers are also its best: crouton shrimp puffs and bean curd vegetable rolls. The former are balls of shrimp paste (similar to that spread on shrimp toast) studded with croutons and deep fried until golden and crackly. The vegetable rolls pair paper-thin sheets of bean curd with julienned vegetables. They are rolled, fried to a turn and presented in a rich sesame sauce.
That same sauce enhances an appetizer of sliced cold chicken breast. Two other cold starter possibilities are the spicy Chinese cabbage salad, a perfect piquant choice for dieters, and shredded jellyfish. The latter is zippy with red pepper, but its texture is reminiscent of rubber bands.
More commonplace but of uncommon quality are the lean and tender barbecued spareribs. Honey baby ribs are tasty, but more bone and fat than meat. Dumplings - steamed, fried and Shiu Mai (stuffed with minced pork and shrimp) - are feather-light treats.
Dieters should zero in on the ''lite cuisine'' menu offerings. Steamed lobster with vegetables is prepared without salt, sugar, cornstarch or sodium. This pristine fare is made more appealing by a side dish of ginger sauce, which diners can spoon on at their discretion.
From the regular menu, drunk shrimp Shanghai style and black pepper veal take top honors. The salted, crunchy, jumbo shrimp are flamed in rum at tableside and served atop crispy Chinese vegetables. The veal, also served on a vegetable nest, is white, top of the line and fork-tender.
Three recommended entrees feature chunks of fried meat with crunchy, crisp coatings. Fresh banana chicken combines those spiffy nuggets with sauteed banana and garden vegetables in a slightly sweet mahogany sauce. A similar sauce enfolds the gold coin beef: meat chunks, sliced mushrooms, sesame seeds and broccoli. Home-style chicken adds a tad of hot Szechuan pepper to that now-familiar sauce.
The usual lo meins and chow funs dot the menu, but so do more-unusual noodle dishes like chow mee fun har moon style and Harbordine pan-fried noodles. The latter, a favorite from the Aberdeen section of Hong Kong, features a bed of crispy noodles topped with shrimp, chicken, beef and vegetables mixed with the ubiquitous house sauce. Chow mee fun is delicate angel-hair pasta entwined with baby shrimp, scallops, roast pork, shredded scrambled egg and vegetables. (The owner confided it was his favorite.) Desserts are the usual Chinese lineup, plus run-of-the-mill chocolate mousse.
Another western interloper is the full-fledged, leather-bound wine list of 24 economically priced choices starting with Wan Fu at $11.

HEADLINE: Focus: California Wineries;
Northern Operations Expand Southward

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

DATELINE: SANTA MARIA, CALIF.

 BODY:
THE Kendall-Jackson winery, which has been producing wine in Lakeport, in northern California, for eight years, will open a new operation 320 miles south this August - the first time a Northern California operation has built a winery so far from Napa County. Lakeport, in Lake County, is about 35 miles north of Napa County. Kendall-Jackson's $6 million, 84,000-square-foot Cambria Winery 12 miles southwest of Santa Maria is slated to produce about 100,000 cases of wine a year, which will make it the largest wine producer in Santa Barbara County. It will process grapes it is growing on adjacent vineyards.
''The primary reason we are in the area is that land values are so much lower,'' said Randall C. Clifton, director of wine operations for the privately held Kendall-Jackson. 
In the last three years, Napa County's rising real estate values - it is the country's most expensive wine region - and tighter building restrictions have forced several expansion-minded wineries to seek less expensive regions. Napa Valley land is far beyond the reach of most start-up operations.
''It's priceless real estate,'' said Jon Fredrikson of Gomberg Fredrikson & Associates, wine industry economists in San Francisco. In just three years, he said, vineyard prices in Napa County have risen 58 percent, to about $55,000 an acre.
In adjacent Sonoma County, considered part of Northern California's wine region, land values have doubled in the last three years, to about $30,000 an acre, partly as a result of new technologies that over the last decade have doubled crop yields to about 5 tons of grapes per acre.
But grape prices have not kept pace. The average price of Chardonnay grapes, one of the more valuable varieties, has increased only 33 percent in the last three years, to $1,224 a ton, according to the Wine Institute in San Francisco.
Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon grapes have risen 57 percent in three years, to $1,123 a ton, and Zinfandels have gone up 70 percent, to $886 a ton.
At the same time, consumer demand has slowed for premium wines, the segment dominated by Napa and Sonoma County wineries. Last year, sales of such wines grew only 2 percent, to 25 million cases, Mr. Fredrikson said. As a result, about a dozen Northern California wineries have turned south to less expensive areas in the Central Coast region, which runs from Monterey County south to Santa Barbara County.
Santa Barbara County in particular, about 270 miles south of Napa County, has attracted about a dozen wineries. Vineyards here sell for about $15,000 an acre, or 65 percent of the cost of comparable vineyards in the north.
SANTA BARBARA'S drought has not yet affected the vineyards, which require little groundwater compared to other crops.
The average price of Santa Barbara County's Chardonnay grape last year was $1,496 a ton, or 4 percent more than the average price fetched in Napa County. Vineyard owners in the south get a higher price for grapes grown on land that is roughly half the cost of that in the north.
In June 1988, Wine World, which owns the well-respected Beringer Brothers of Napa, paid $13 million fo the Estrella River Winery and 530 acres of vineyards near San Luis Obispo, midway along California's coast. The price was half the market value of vineyard property in Napa, where Wine World has operated since 1971.
A division of Nestles S.A. of Switzerland, Wine World also bought Cat Canyon vineyards near Santa Maria, paying $3.5 million for 700 acres. Rather than buy wine grapes from this region, as this company had done for years, Wine World decided to produce wine in the region, said Michael Moone, president of Wine World.
Around the same time, the Wine Group of San Francisco bought Corbett Canyon Vineyards in San Luis Obispo for $12 million. It also bought 330 acres in what was formerly called Los Alamos Vineyards in Santa Barbara County for $4 million.
A few years ago, Robert Mondavi Winery of Napa Valley and Kendall-Jackson jointly bought the 2,700-acre Tepusquet vineyard here for $12 million - considered a bargain. The two Northern California wineries divided the acreage. Kendall-Jackson's new winery, Cambria, will crush the grapes plucked from its portion of the vineyard.
Factors beyond the wine industry account for the big growth of California's vineyard values. A primary reason is the rapid appreciation of California real estate, especially along coastal regions where wine grapes grow well.
In the state's northern wine country, which includes Napa, Mendocino and Sonoma counties, the median price of a home in March was $176,000, or 23 percent higher than a year earlier, according to the California Association of Realtors.
For those who can afford the address, Napa County offers a slice of the good life, with rolling hills, a low crime rate and a handful of gourmet restaurants rivaling those found in San Francisco, 60 miles south. INDEED, many working couples buy homes in Sonoma County, putting up with a 100-mile daily commute to and from jobs in the Bay Area. ''This is a better place to raise a family,'' said Barbara Wood, a working mother whose husband makes the daily drive.
The migration to the wine country has not only helped push up real estate prices, but has also increased traffic in what is considered primarily an agricultural region. Napa Valley gets about 2.5 million visitors a year; they clog two-lane country roads on their weekend wine tours. The wine industry has spawned T-shirt, totebag and souvenir shops, all of which capitalize on region's wine-making notoriety.
In an effort to preserve its precious vineyard land, the Napa County Board of Supervisors adopted an ordinance earlier this year that prohibits future wineries from luring tourists with souvenir shops and drop-in taste rooms. It also required that at least 75 percent of the grapes processed by new wineries or used in expanding production be grown in Napa Valley.
''Otherwise, the area would turn from an agricultural region into a manufacturing center,'' said John L. Brown, vice president of finance and administration at Beckstoffer Vineyards in St. Helena, in Napa County.
The ordinance caps future growth by making it more difficult to start a winery in Napa Valley, which has contributed to the rise in vineyard values to the south.
However, the Central Coast region is beginning to feel the strain. While the price of vineyards in Monterey County has remained flat at $10,000 an acre, the value of Santa Barbara County's vineyards has tripled in the last three years.
The Santa Barbara County Planning Commission is considering limiting the growth and production of vineyards and wineries in much the same way as Napa County did.

HEADLINE: Ex-Klansman Puts New Racial Politics to Test

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKLIN, La.

 BODY:
It's racial politics for the 90's - not Old South race baiting, but a post-civil-rights-era assault on welfare abuse and programs like affirmative action that his audience sees as helping blacks while hurting whites.
''I'm not a racist like Jesse Jackson,'' David Duke said recently, peering into the Cajun country blue-collar crowd of perhaps 200 people at the American Legion hall here. ''I'm proud of my heritage like Jesse Jackson is proud of his. But I believe the time has come for equal rights for everyone in this country, even for white people.''
Many in the crowd wear blue and white David Duke T-shirts or baseball caps, and they give their approval in a low rumble of ''Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke,'' a response that has made the roadshow of the former Ku Klux Klan leader the talk of Louisiana. 
A year after his surprise election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, Mr. Duke has made himself a potent force in state politics, polarizing the Legislature along racial lines, gathering a fervent statewide following and mounting an unexpectedly strong bid for the United States Senate seat held by J. Bennett Johnston.
Despite the enthusiastic crowds, analysts say there is little chance he can win the Senate race this fall. But Mr. Duke, a Republican, is threatening to elbow the party's nominee, State Senator Ben Bagert, out of the race, and he is angling to force Mr. Johnston, an 18-year incumbent, into an embarrassing runoff. If he does, some critics say, he will achieve his goal of helping to build a national white supremacist movement.
''This is not really about Bennett Johnston or Ben Bagert,'' said Dr. Lawrence Powell, a Tulane University historian. ''It's about politics for the next 10 years.''
Mr. Duke's campaign, which was helped in May when the Louisiana House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved his bill opposing affirmative action, is partly a product of the frustrations generated by Louisiana's depressed economy and partly in keeping with the state's tradition of eccentric politicians, from Huey and Earl Long to Edwin Edwards.
It is aided by the state's unusual system in which all candidates from all parties, whether party nominees or not, run in the Oct. 6 primary. If no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote, the two top finishers face each other on Election Day. If one gets 50 percent, there is no general election. So far, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Bagert and Mr. Duke are the only contenders, although a black state legislator, Willie Singleton, says he might enter the race.
 
'A Mouth That's Different'
But Mr. Duke's campaign, with its focus on issues like affirmative action, government programs that set aside a certain number of contracts for minority businesses and what he calls ''the rising welfare underclass,'' is speaking to white resentments and explosive racial issues that resonate far beyond the state's borders. He is most popular with younger voters.
''Wherever I go, I find almost universal dislike for set-asides,'' said Gov. Buddy Roemer, a Democrat. ''I don't share that. But you can't come down here and say that Louisiana has a problem that's different than anyone else's. We have a mouth that's different, but not a problem.''
Mr. Duke's notoriety stems, for the most part, from his tenure as national grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and he has longstanding ties to far right and racist groups. He had little impact on the Legislature before the vote on his bill on affirmative action. But his views on race have brought him extraordinary visibility around the state. Some analysts say the vote was a sign that legislators believe he speaks for a powerful constituency.
 
Duke's Campaign
At the heart of the Duke campaign are gatherings like the one in this town of almost 10,000 people, with its white-columned, 19th century Main Street homes. Here people work in the oil industry, at local sugar-processing and carbon-black plants and in agriculture and fishing.
The fare at this gathering was Budweiser, Coke and potato chips; the contributions were stuffed in a plastic cup or exchanged for $10 Duke T-shirts or $3 Duke earrings, and the oratory was intensely personal and suffused with primal racial images.
When Mr. Duke talked about the death penalty, he placed it in the context of someone murdering his two daughters. When he talked about economic hardship, he spoke of those in the all-white crowd who cannot afford to rear children.
On the other hand, the abuses of welfare were summed up by women who receive benefits and have ''one, two, three, four, ten, fifteen, twenty'' children. Minority contracting requirements were symbolized by a black state legislator's driving a Mercedes and allegedly getting contracts while a white person in a pickup truck was frozen out.
Even the furor over his affirmative action bill had an oversized target.
''Ladies and gentlemen,'' said Mr. Duke, who has the lanky good looks of a former athlete, ''the only reason why we have problems is because the black caucus didn't get their way like they usually do. It's about time they weren't given their way.''
 
Where Frustrations Blend
In southern Louisiana, where the economy has been depressed since the oil industry doldrums began in the mid-1980's, economic and racial frustration tend to blend.
''He's against welfare,'' said Pierre Dupuis, a retiree who speaks in the melodic Cajun accent of the bayou country here. Using a racial slur, Mr. Dupuis complained that tax money goes to black people, ''with their big radios on the street, and they're laughing at us.''
But more common than slurs against blacks is a sense that white people are being victimized by affirmative action and the minority contracting programs. It is the centerpiece of Mr. Duke's speech and perhaps his most effective issue with voters.
''We don't have the same rights as black people,'' said Jay Louviere, a 29-year-old lumberyard worker. ''Duke's the only one standing up for white people.''
But critics say that the issue has more basis in emotion than economics, that programs like affirmative action evoke particular resentment from white people facing their own economic problems.
 
Furor Over Affirmative Action
''I don't think there are 500 people in Louisiana that have either been adversely affected or benefited by affirmative action,'' said Mr. Edwards, the former Governor. ''But everyone who doesn't have a job or whose son cannot get into law school believes it's because of affirmative action.''
Real or not, it taps into a powerful vein of anger that can seem the ultimate extension of the politics of sex and ethnicity.
''I believe there's a climate in this country that has become anti-Euro-American,'' said Emile Vidrine, a campus minister at the University of Southwestern Louisiana who is spending his summer working as a volunteer for the Duke campaign. ''I'm not putting anyone else down, but we have to put a stop to this idea that we can't stand up tall and say the European white man is one of the great races in the world.''
Mr. Duke's campaign exists in a complex relationship with his nearly lifelong involvement with white supremacist issues and groups. In an interview, he skirted issues he has espoused in the past, like genetic differences between white people and black people, and said his campaign was simply about equal rights for all.
''There are many liberals today who were radical leftists in their younger days,'' he said. ''I'm a conservative who might have been considered a radical rightist in my younger days.''
 
Links to Extremists
But Mr. Duke, who now heads a group called the National Association for the Advancement of White People, has maintained many links to other extremist groups. He used the subscriber list of the far-right publication The Spotlight for fund-raising, ran for President in 1988 as the candidate of the far-right Populist Party and as recently as a year ago sold Nazi and extremist books out of a building that includes his legislative office.
The Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, a bitter critic of Mr. Duke, characterizes him as ''an extremist ideologue who uses the pool of new followers as a recruiting ground for a white supremacist and anti-Semitic movement.''
Much of his campaign depends on his ability to persuade voters that he is not a dangerous extremist, and critics say his campaign could falter if a fuller picture of his activities reaches voters.
At the same time, many supporters say his past ignites his campaign and separates him from other conservatives.
''His background is what gives the added emphasis to what he says,'' said Jim McPherson, a New Orleans lawyer and Duke supporter. ''It says he means business.''
 
Few Expect Him to Win
Experts say Mr. Duke must get 65 percent of whites' votes to win a race in a state in which black people make up 27 percent of the electorate. Few think he can do it.
But recent polls show him running second to Mr. Johnston, with the Senator by no means guaranteed the 50 percent he needs to avoid a runoff. Many analysts think Mr. Duke could get at least 30 percent of the statewide vote. Most see an extremely fluid race, saying Mr. Johnston's support is relatively soft, Mr. Duke has fervent supporters but unfavorable ratings from about half the electorate and Mr. Bagert is little-known and underfinanced. Mr. Johnston says Mr. Bagert should quit the race to reduce the chances of Mr. Duke's making a runoff. Mr. Bagert replied that as the only unknown quantity in the race, he is the only candidate with much potential to pick up more support.
To some observers, what is most disturbing about Mr. Duke's campaign is that frustrated and angry white people seem willing to forget his extremism while embracing his more mainstream views on racial issues.
''I think a lot of people are enchanted by the message and are disregarding the messenger,'' said State Representative Odon Bacque Jr., an independent. ''To me it's frightening. I believe if no one takes him seriously, he can end up winning.''

HEADLINE: A Backlash in Romania;
In Calling Out Miners to Stifle Opposition, President Forfeits Control and Good Will

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, June 17

 BODY:
Less than a month after it won elections by a landslide, the Government of President Ion Iliescu has been plunged into a crisis that shows it is at the mercy of groups and forces beyond its control.
Deserted by the police and unable to count on the army to protect it from violent attacks last Wednesday, the Government put itself in the hands of several thousand rough and angry miners, who in a single day managed to do serious and possibly permanent damage to Romania's international reputation.
With Government sanction, thousands of miners traveled to the capital from outlying areas on Thursday and roamed the streets, randomly attacking people suspected of opposing Mr. Iliescu. When the miners departed, the President praised them as ''a strong force with much civic discipline.'' 
Reports of the miners' attempts to smash Mr. Iliescu's political opposition have brought harsh condemnation from many Western countries, including the United States, putting into question whether Romania will get the aid, credits and investments it needs for its economic recovery.
''It is most frustrating,'' Ion Pascu, Mr. Iliescu's foreign policy adviser, said. ''We need Western support and assistance. I just worry that we are not being given the chance to prove that we share Western values.''
Mr. Pascu said the Romanian Government was ''annoyed'' that the West had focused all its attention on the attacks by the miners.
He said that little had been said of the danger posed by anti-Government rioters on Wednesday, when troops opened fire on demonstrators and four people were killed. Today protesters held a small anti-Government demonstration on University Square without interference by the police.
 
Breakdown in Public Order
Mr. Pascu said the Government's response to the crisis last week had been hampered from the start by misleading information and a breakdown in the forces of public order.
For instance, he said, the army was unable to fire tear gas at the rioters on Wednesday because they had no experts trained in its use.
''The system in Romania does not function in a logical manner,'' he said. ''That is not a reason to forgive, but to always expect the unexpected.''
Few observers were surprised by the events in Romania, where violence has deep roots in politics. Since the December revolution that toppled the Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, the country has been troubled by tensions, suspicions and recriminations. Much of the distrust has been directed against the ruling National Salvation Front, which is dominated by former Communists.
The Government charged last week that the opposition attacks on the police station, the Interior Ministry and the state television station were instigated by followers of Romania's fascist movement. Mr. Pascu said the accusation was based on reports that a green flag - a symbol of the fascist Iron Guard - had been placed on top of the Interior Ministry during the siege.
Mr. Pascu said those reports were still unconfirmed, although Mr. Iliescu, in a speech of thanks on Friday to the miners, again tied the rebellion to the infiltration of former Iron Guard members from the West.
 
Right-Wing Scenario
''We are dealing here with a broader scenario of European proportions,'' Mr. Iliescu said. ''There was a joint action of right-wing forces, which started from the presumption that right-wing forces in all Eastern European countries had come to power.''
The biggest crisis Mr. Iliescu faces now is the product not of right-wing forces, but of his own Government's helplessness in the face of the miners' rampage. That helplessness was evident in his speech on Friday, when Mr. Iliescu rejected accusations that the miners had attacked ''peaceful citizens'' and the headquarters of opposition parties.
Such a bald denial of the facts - the miners not only ransacked the headquarters but stayed on to occupy them - was viewed here as a sign of how deeply the Government is now beholden to, perhaps even intimidated by, the miners.
State officials have said that miners will be prosecuted for the beatings and the vandalism, but Mr. Pascu acknowledged today that for political reasons any investigations would have to be undertaken quietly.
 
Rampage 'Out of the Blue'
Mr. Pascu said that Mr. Iliescu and other top members of the leadership were unaware that the miners were attacking opposition parties and newspapers until after the violence had ended.
''The miners' response came out of the blue,'' he said.
An essential question - one that Mr. Pascu said he could not answer - was how miners from the distant Jiu Valley gained precise information not only on the location of the opposition party headquarters, but of the private homes of its leaders, newspaper offices and even the homes of gypsies.
Gypsies became a particular target for the miners because of their role in the opposition's 53-day occupation of University Square, which ended Wednesday morning when the police moved in and arrested 263 people.
Mr. Pascu said that all of the 263 people arrested were freed the same day although the Government did not issue any order, another puzzle in a week of mystifying events.
Those unanswered questions - including a delay by the army in responding to the Government's call for help on Wednesday - have fed rumors in Bucharest. Conspiracy theories have emerged, including one that accuses the Government of orchestrating the entire chain of events to justify a crackdown against the opposition.
Mr. Pascu vigorously denied the charge, noting that the National Salvation Front, Mr. Iliescu's party, had already won power in elections. He also said the Government has offered to help the opposition parties rebuild their headquarters.
In a statement on Saturday night, the Government pledged to insure ''freedom of political expression for all, with the exception of acts of instigation and of neo-fascist propaganda.''
Opposition figures took heart today from harsh criticism of the miners by political leaders appearing on state television. They also noted that the police did not interfere with the demonstration on University Square.
Even at the height of the violence and confusion, there were signs that the Government was trying to prevent the miners from doing their worst. For instance, a Government envoy intervened to rescue Ion Ratiu, the presidential candidate of the National Peasants Party, just as a group of miners was preparing to drive him away in a van.
But Mr. Pascu also made it clear that the Government has had to treat the miners with care, even though by the time they arrived early Thursday morning their presence was no longer necessary, and had even become awkward.
To accommodate the miners and to keep them busy, the Government gave them a place to stay and a place to watch the World Cup soccer game. Mr. Pascu said the miners wanted to remain two more days in Bucharest but that the Government persuaded them to leave on Friday.
He said he felt that the call for help issued by Mr. Iliescu was a mistake - a reflex that reflected the President's training in a political system that exploited mass appeal. ''He is a prisoner of the setting, although he very much wants to change the setting,'' Mr. Pascu said.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
SECURITY AGENCY DEBATES NEW ROLE: ECONOMIC SPYING

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Facing the decline of the Soviet military threat, the National Security Agency is debating plans to shift its global electronic eavesdropping network to other activities, including spying on world trade and financial transactions, Government officials and intelligence experts say.
The agency is already considering reducing some of its Soviet operations, but any further shift would mark a basic change of mission for an organization whose foremost duty since its formation 38 years ago has been to warn of a Soviet military strike against Europe or the United States.
The National Security Agency, the largest of the nation's intelligence agencies, gathers all the intelligence derived from radio signals, telephones and other electronic communications. It is formally an agency of the Pentagon, but it coordinates its activities with the Central Intelligence Agency, whose director reports to the President in the Cabinet.
 
Some Eavesdropping May Rise
Senior officials of the National Security Agency, led by its director, Vice Adm. William O. Studeman, began this spring to draft a proposal to redefine its activities in light of the political and military upheaval in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Government officials and private experts said. 
Officials stressed that the agency must continue to monitor Soviet military and political developments as long as the Soviet Union remains a nuclear superpower and maintains the largest military force in Asia. In fact, some eavesdropping may well increase as political and social instability rises in Russia and its surrounding republics, they said.
But the officials said the emerging battles for economic primacy among Western nations and multinational companies - and not military rivalries - offer by far the most promising prospects for the agency's future activities.
 
Economic Might, Not Military
Among both senior intelligence officials and those in Congress who oversee their activities, the Soviet military retreat has given rise to a belief that American security now rests more in economic strength than in armed might. The temptation to use espionage as a weapon in the world's trade wars is fast becoming the hottest issue in intelligence circles.
Officials say the National Security Agency's discussions raise fundamental questions about the fairness of such tactics and their practicality. Even if the United States could set aside ethical objections to industrial espionage, there are legal barriers to disclosing such information and serious questions of which American companies should receive it - if, in fact, major companies with factories worldwide and joint ventures abroad can any longer be identified as American. Spying on Allies? The issue is especially delicate because some of the most attractive targets of economic espionage could well be companies or Government agencies of nations militarily allied with the United States, both in Western Europe and in Asia, notably Japan. Many of those nations are now believed to spy on American corporations.
''The real issue is do you want United States intelligence to steal the proprietary secrets of foreign nations,'' a Government official said. ''It's fundamentally anathema to our way of life. We don't do business this way.''
Industrialized nations, including the United States, routinely collect economic intelligence on their allies. The National Security Agency gathers data on financial and stock transactions and foreign government strategies that are useful in trade negotiations and other Government decisions, like the approval of foreign purchases of American companies dealing in restricted technologies, officials said.
There is a consensus among intelligence officials that the agency should gather more economic data, both to assist Government agencies involved in commerce and to detect coming economic disruptions that could affect American interests, like a collapse of financial markets or major banks.
 
Accidental Data Undistributed
National Security Agency eavesdropping outposts are also said to stumble routinely across foreign corporate trade secrets and national industrial strategies that could be of immense value to American companies competing abroad.
That information is not now sought or distributed within the Government, much less among private companies. Among the issues being informally discussed by top intelligence officials are whether the agency and other Government organizations should make a deliberate effort to collect such information, and who should benefit from it.
Neither the agency nor other intelligence groups could decide to gather such specific information on their own. Decisions on the kinds of data that agencies collect are made by committees of intelligence experts and Government policy-makers.
Among intelligence officials, there is an issue even more serious than ethics and practicality in economic espionage: whether such secrets could be shared without compromising the exotic means by which they were plucked from the airwaves, or disclosing the particular frequencies or telephone lines from which they were acquired.
''N.S.A. would go bananas if it collected data that wound up being shared with G.E.,'' said a former intelligence official who is an expert on economic intelligence. ''In their business, you don't disclose sources and methods, or your sources start to dry up.''
 
Reflections in the Budget
While little is committed to paper so far, officials said, the National Security Agency's first conclusions could be reflected in its budget for the fiscal year that begins in October 1991, which is now under review by Congress's committees on intelligence and the armed services.
Some officials cast the discussions as a belated effort to fend off advocates of sharp budget reductions.
''We've got an extraordinary investment in technical collection,'' a second official said. ''This is all so sudden and unpredictable that they don't know whether to start dismantling things, or what equipment to move, or whether they need new policies, or even how it will affect them in terms of the legality of what they do.''
The budget is classified, but its combined military and civilian components are now believed to exceed $10 billion annually. That could quickly drop by 10 percent or more, mostly through cuts in the military side of the budget, if the odds against a conventional war continue to lengthen, a Government official said.
''We have a general idea of where we want to go,'' he said, ''but we're still defining it.''
 
Operations Cannot Be Divulged
That official and others interviewed for this article refused to be identified because of the National Security Agency's longstanding insistence that its operations not be publicly described, even in general terms. The agency is among the most secretive of the Government's major intelligence organizations.
It is also one of the most effective, harvesting such an astonishing array of intercepted telephone calls, radio signals and other electronic traffic that officials generally agree that it provides the bulk of raw intelligence data.
In recent years, the agency has played roles in thwarting Iran's efforts to mine the Persian Gulf; tracking down Panama's deposed dictator, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega; exposing illicit sales of chemical-weapons-manufacturing equipment to Libya, and detecting the smuggling of American technology to Eastern Europe.
 
Focusing on Third World
The agency has already seized upon the eavesdropping opportunities presented by the South American narcotics trade, even challenging the United States Coast Guard and Customs Service for the right to monitor drug-smuggling ships and planes at sea. At the behest of the Director of Central Intelligence, William H. Webster, it also has become deeply involved in combating terrorism and the spread of strategic weapons in the Middle East.
In interviews last week, officials said the agency was likely to seek to increase those and other third world activities, in part because Africa and southern Asia are seen as the likeliest sources of future armed conflicts that would affect American interests.
The Soviet Union, however, remains the agency's bread-and-butter target. Most of the agency's largest and most expensive outposts in Europe and Asia, as well as its fleets of satellites, ships and aircraft, exist expressly to detect Soviet war preparations and changes in military doctrine.
The fates of some of those operations are thrown into doubt by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the withdrawal of some Soviet forces from parts of Eastern Europe, Vietnam and Afghanistan, officials said.
 
Presence in Germany to Fall
The agency probably will face growing pressure in this decade to remove ground stations targeted against Soviet forces in politically sensitive locations like Japan and the Philippines, they said. And it is certain to reduce its extensive presence in West Germany, where it maintains five major eavesdropping installations aimed at the old Warsaw Pact, the Baltic region and the western Soviet Union.
''I don't think they're survivable in the new world,'' a former senior intelligence official said of those outposts. Intelligence officials say they largely agree.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. AUDITS RISING FOR FOREIGN BANKS DOING U.S. BUSINESS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service has sharply increased its audits of foreign banks that do business in the United States, after finding that many paid little or no income tax in the mid-1980's.
While tax officials said they could not estimate the amount that might be collected through such audits, they said the audits of 10 foreign banks last year produced more than $100 million in added taxes. A former I.R.S. official who now works for a large accounting firm said billions of dollars were at stake in disputes over bank taxes.
Foreign banks account for a large and growing share of the American market. They control 22.6 percent of United States banking assets and hold 28.5 percent of American business loans, according to the latest annual survey by American Banker, an industry newspaper. Seventy-five percent of large American companies now use one or more foreign banks, according to Greenwich Associates, a consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn. 
 
Audits Aroused Suspicion
Federal tax officials said they suspected that many foreign banks had taken excessive deductions for their interest expenses. The suspicion is based on audits conducted in the last few years and on the extensive analysis of data collected from the tax returns of foreign banks.
''The I.R.S. thinks that international banks are getting away with murder plain and simple, that we have emasculated the tax law or subverted it, which is untrue,'' said Andrew D. Barkin, vice president at the New York office of Tokai Bank Ltd. of Japan. He said the bank, one of the 10 largest in the world, was undergoing a comprehensive audit by revenue service agents.
Lawrence R. Uhlick, executive director of the Institute of International Bankers, a trade association that represents more than 250 foreign banks operating in the United States, said foreign banks had longstanding disagreements with the revenue service about how to compute their interest costs. He said that the agency's rules were ''incredibly complex'' and he asserted that banks from certain countries were allowed by treaty to calculate their interest deductions by other means.
 
Many Difficult Questions
Like other multinational companies, banks face hard tax questions all the time because they do business in nations with widely varying tax systems.
''These are great banks from all over the world with impeccable reputations,'' Mr. Uhlick said. ''They are not deadbeats. They do not finagle on their taxes. They take seriously their tax obligations, and they are prepared to pay their fair share.''
In 1986, the last year for which the revenue service has complete data, foreign banks with American branches reported total receipts of $26.3 billion from their American operations. They took deductions totaling $25.9 billion, according to the tax agency. Interest is the biggest expense for most banks, and interest costs, computed by a complex formula, are often the most important factor in determining a foreign bank's tax liability in the United States.
''I don't understand how foreign banks could be doing business here for 10 years and not be making any money,'' said Richard A. Ward, chief of planning and special programs in the international audit division of the revenue service. ''It raises a lot of questions. The banks came here to make money.''
The bank audits are part of a general effort by the revenue service to scrutinize foreign companies more closely. Congress recently gave the agency additional power to demand access to the books and records of such companies.
Some people see a political motive for the audits. John O. Hatab, director of international banking services for the Price Waterhouse accounting and consulting firm, who advises more than 40 banks from 25 countries, said: ''The I.R.S. appears to be following the political lead of Congress. There is a perception in Congress that foreign businesses are not paying their fair share of U.S. taxes. The I.R.S. is starting a program to see if that's true.'' 22-Agent Team Formed Federal tax officials said they had recently established a team of 22 agents to comb through the tax returns of foreign banks and identify those in which there was significant potential to collect more revenue.
As part of its inquiry, the revenue service retrieved and reviewed all tax returns filed for 1986 and 1987 by foreign banks with American branches of significant size. About half of the 189 banks were selected for auditing, tax officials said.
Nearly two-thirds of the foreign banks doing business in the United States reported no profits from their activities in this country in the mid-1980's - and therefore no taxable income - tax officials said.
 
Additional Taxes Assessed
Tokai is not the only Japanese bank being audited. The American tax director of another large Japanese bank, who asked not to be identified, said tax agents had established a year-round presence in his New York office, visited the bank's London branch, asked the bank to retrieve documents from seven overseas offices, and assessed ''tens of millions of dollars'' in additional taxes.
Such assessments are often reduced through negotiations with the Government. But tax officials said some foreign banks had paid large sums without protest.
''These are big banks, and we are not talking about small amounts of money,'' said Mr. Uhlick of the Institute of International Bankers.
The I.R.S.'s Mr. Ward said the agency was not aiming at the banks of any country but was auditing returns with the greatest potential for additional revenue.
 
Power of Japanese Banks
The attention paid to Japanese banks reflects their economic importance. Seven of the 10 largest foreign banks in the United States are Japanese, and more than 30 Japanese banks have American branches. Revenue service officials said banks based in West Germany, France, Britain and other countries were also under review.
Foreign banks with American branches reported a Federal tax liability totaling $328 million for 1986, according to the tax agency. Of that amount, $118 million was offset by credits for taxes paid to other countries. Thus, the banks paid $210 million in Federal income taxes for that year.
The Institute of International Bankers reports that at least 20 members have received letters from the revenue agency asking for an extension of the statute of limitations so that the Government can thoroughly audit their 1986 tax returns. Ordinarily, a tax must be assessed within three years after the original return is filed, or the Government loses the right to assess additional taxes. Tax officials said they would ask other banks for extensions as the need arose.
Large companies usually agree to such extensions because otherwise the revenue service is likely to protect the Government's interest by issuing a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer, the formal beginning of a collection process.
In a memorandum to foreign banks last month, Mr. Uhlick said: ''These letters are important not only because they indicate a potentially significant increase in the total number of foreign bank audits, but also because they reflect a stepped-up level of foreign bank audit activity by the I.R.S. Assistant Commissioner (International) in Washington. These activities confirm the information we have received over the last few months that the I.R.S. plans to increase the level of its audit activity of the foreign banking community on an ongoing basis.''
 
Losses in Early 80's
In his memorandum, Mr. Uhlick quoted revenue service officials as saying they had ''recently reviewed the 1986 and 1987 tax returns of virtually every foreign bank engaged in business in the United States.''
Mr. Hatab of Price Waterhouse said, ''In the early 1980's, the total tax bill for foreign banks doing business here was not very big.'' But, he added, that could be explained by the fact that many banks were just moving into the American market and were losing money. Under the law, he noted, a taxpayer can use such losses to offset profits for up to 15 years.
British officials have repeatedly complained to the United States Treasury, saying the revenue service was trying to enforce regulations that were inconsistent with a British-American tax treaty.
The tax agency rejected that argument in a formal ''revenue ruling'' last year. It said British banks must use the formula prescribed by the agency because the 1980 treaty contained no ''specific rule'' for computing the interest-expense deduction.
 
Branch Office Operations
Most international banks doing business in the United States operate through branch offices, rather than separately incorporated subsidiaries. A branch is permitted much higher lending limits because the capital and assets of the parent corporation are assumed to be available to support the branch operations.
When an individual wants to take a tax deduction for interest payments, it is usually a straightforward procedure. The amount of the deduction is the amount of interest paid.
But when the American branch of a foreign bank borrows money, the parent company is legally responsible for repaying the debt. Under Federal law, the foreign bank, not just the branch, is the taxpayer. The revenue service maintains that money borrowed for one purpose frees money for other purposes, so a foreign bank cannot meaningfully link its interest payments to the specific activity for which the loan was obtained.
In 1980, the tax agency established the formula telling foreign corporations how to decide what portion of their worldwide interest expenses could be taken as a tax deduction in the United States. The calculation is complicated because banks borrow in many different currencies, at interest rates that change from day to day. The formula requires them to compute the ''average interest rate'' for various types of borrowing.

HEADLINE: Surplus of College Graduates Dims Job Outlook for Others

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of jobs, once performed creditably without a college degree, are going to college graduates today as employers take advantage of an oversupply of them.
College graduates are being found more and more among the nation's bakers, traveling salespeople, secretaries, bookkeepers, clerks, data processors and factory supervisors. And they are shutting out qualified high school graduates from many jobs, according to Labor Department officials, corporate executives and economists.
There are several reasons why this is happening. One, of course, is the growing complexity of many jobs that were once much simpler to perform. But more important is the current oversupply of college graduates. 
 
More Graduates in Work Force
At roughly 25 percent of the work force - higher than in any other industrial nation - college graduates outstrip the demand for their skills, the Labor Department reports. And the proportion of college graduates in the work force is continuing to increase.
Given this oversupply, many experts, including the authors of a report on the American work force being released today, say that employers are reluctant to gamble on high school graduates. In an age when public schools are accused of turning out many illiterates, corporate America has come to rely on the college degree as the safest guarantee that an applicant has the skills, discipline and maturity to tackle a job.
''The college degree, or even the evidence of having participated in college, has become the nation's major form of job certification,'' said William B. Johnston, a senior research fellow at the Hudson Institute. ''It is a rather expensive and extravagant sorting mechanism, to send people off to schools to learn skills that might not be necessary for work, but it is all that we have right now.''
The emphasis on hiring college graduates has helped to open a huge gap between the incomes of the college educated and the high school educated. Many recent studies show that the standard of living of the high school graduate fell in the 1980's for the first time since World War II, while the college graduates' standard of living, or real wage, rose by nearly 8 percent. No other industrial nation has such a wide wage gap between the two groups.
That wage gap has helped to spur more high school graduates to go to college. For decades only 50 percent had continued education after high school, but since 1982 the number has risen rapidly to nearly 59 percent, assuring the nation of a plentiful supply of college graduates for its job needs into the 21st century, according to Labor Department projections.
Russell Rumberger, a professor of education at the University of California at Santa Barbara estimates that the pool of college graduates exceeds by about 15 percent the need for their skills in professions that require college training, among them engineering, accounting, law and medicine.
The Uneducated Gain Skills Quickly The wage inequity and the growing preference for college graduates have prompted new studies to determine just how qualified high school educated Americans are. Some case studies, among them several presented at a conference of labor economists and social scientists at Brown University this month, found that many uneducated workers can quickly acquire the necessary skills to man even the most modern and sophisticated factories. If those workers succeed, then the prospect of a drastic shortage of skilled workers may be far less realistic than many had thought.
''It is pretty consistently the finding of researchers that the training process in state-of-the-art factories, with the most advanced technologies, is not that complicated,'' said Professor Clair Brown, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, and co-author of studies involving half-a-dozen major companies.
Many companies agree. A panel of businessmen, union leaders and academics, the Commission on the Skills of the American Work Force, in its report being released today, finds that 80 percent of the 400 employers interviewed said the appeal of educated workers lay not with specific skills they might have acquired at school.
Work skills can be taught on the job, they said, but education was associated with the notion that having a degree meant a person also had such qualities as punctuality, good work habits and the ability to learn on the job. For many American employers the four-year college education has become the proxy for these qualities, said Curtis E. Plott, executive vice president of the American Society for Training and Development, whose members are mostly corporate officers.
All these new findings contradict some of the most widely held perceptions about the American work force. One is that the United States has a shortage of skilled workers, making it unable to be competitive with other nations' industries, a shortage that is blamed primarily on public schools that turn out young people so poorly educated that they are untrainable.
In fact, according to Ronald Kutscher, a Labor Department official, the skill shortage has yet to materialize, except in a few areas, like nursing and medical technicians. And some major corporations draw similar conclusions. The General Electric Company, for example, reports no problem in retraining older workers to operate complicated, computerized machinery or in staffing new, high technology appliance factories in Louisville, Ky., and Decatur, Ala., with applicants who had two years of vocational school training.
''Somehow, people find their way to vocational training for jobs that pay enough,'' said Frank Doyle, a company vice president. The appliance factory pay averages $16 to $18 an hour, including $4 to $5 in benefits.
Company Fails Half Taking Test The New York Telephone Company contributed greatly to the perception of a nation of unschooled young people by reporting in 1987 that out of 90,000 applicants for jobs there, 84 percent had failed a basic literacy and math test. Unnoticed was that the people were mostly applying for low-wage, temporary jobs.
When the American Telephone and Telegraph Company gives a similar test to applicants for full-time clerical or operator jobs, positions that include health and pension benefits, the rate of passing is much higher, said Mary Tenopyr, the company's director of employee testing and selection.
''It has been our experience that when you offer a temporary job, you get a lesser quality person,'' Ms. Tenopyr said. What's more, the pool of applicants is so large that the company intentionally fails 50 percent of the test takers, qualifying only those who can score above average.
Motorola Inc. has found that even the poorly educated can be brought up to the standard fairly quickly and made ready for on-the-job training. In transferring workers from older factories to new, high technology plants that make cellular telephones, Motorola discovered that many could not pass a basic skills test that required an eighth-grade reading level, a knowledge of fractions and simple problem solving.
Most, however, mastered these skills after six months in the company's remedial training classes. ''Those who have taken longer are usually immigrants who speak English as a second language and weren't literate in their native language,'' said Edward Bales, a director of education for Motorola.
Motorola, is one of the few American companies that provides remedial training, and it resents having to do so. ''We spent $5 million on this training last year, and that came right out of profits,'' Mr. Bales said. ''The public schools should handle this task.''
But students in the public schools have no reason to believe that taking courses like mathematics will get them jobs. In a survey involving 50 high schools across the country, Professor John Bishop of Cornell University's Center for Advanced Human Resources Studies asked thousands of students who were not bound for college what mathematics courses they needed to qualify for their first choice of jobs. Fewer than 30 percent checked any math course at all.
''They weren't displaying a resistance to study, but an awareness that the job market does not reward them for taking algebra or geometry or trigonometry,'' Mr. Bishop said.
Schools' Responses Worry Employers The reason it does not is twofold: companies mistrust the caliber of the courses given, even when students take them and the companies have trouble verifying exactly what courses high school-educated applicants actually took.
When they send to high schools for students' transcripts, fewer than two in 10 schools respond, surveys show. In one case, the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company in Columbus, Ohio, where Mr. Bishop worked as a consultant, sent 1,200 letters requesting transcripts and received only 93.
The alternative is for a company to test high school educated applicants, as do Motorola, G.E. and the Ford Motor Company, among others. But smaller companies are reluctant to test because testing carries with it the risk that a rejected applicant will sue claiming discrimination. Smaller companies are not as willing as large ones to risk those legal costs, Mr. Bishop said.
Still, ad hoc ways are springing up among smaller companies to screen the high school educated. One method popular among smaller companies is probation - telling a young person to first work on the job for six months, then there will be a spot on the permanent payroll. Another is to subject even the lowest-level applicant for a clerical or janitorial job to half a dozen or more interviews. ''One object is to see if the person keeps showing up and gives consistent answers,'' said David Birch, president of Cognetics Inc., a consultant to small businesses.
Electronic Data System Corporation, of Dallas, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation founded by Ross Perot, has made applicant screening into a high skill. The company hires non-college people as computer operators and for some positions usually given to college graduates, but only after the applicant has filled out an 8-page application and gone through a series of interviews.
''A degree, from high school or college, is not a substitute for E.D.S. screening,'' said John Senderling, a company spokesman. ''We are looking for elusive, almost ineffable character traits, for someone tries hard and can succeed. Once we find that person, we assume we can teach them specific job skills.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Soviet Family's Plight: Leave for Israel or Hold On and Hope?

SERIES: LIVING IN LINE - SECOND OF TWO ARTICLES: TO GO OR TO STAY?

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
In a desk drawer in the apartment of Sergei Kuznetsov and Olga Avilova is a document that could drastically change their lives: an application to emigrate to Israel.
Deciding whether to leave the Soviet Union is a fundamental question about whether to have faith in the country's future.
Olga, a 34-year-old art historian, believes that the country will never emerge from the social, economic and ecological problems that have brought it to what she calls ''the abyss of civil disaster.'' She wants to save her family and start a new life abroad.
Sergei, a 28-year-old mathematician, says he trusts that the country is approaching a new era, however slowly, and that the country's educated professionalss have an obligation to encourage that process by staying in the Soviet Union. 
As the nation faces one of the most critical periods in its economic and political development, Sergei and Olga have been struggling, along with most everyone in the country, to deal with the monumental and often disheartening changes.
A few years ago, the hardships and doubts that the family now faces may have been much the same, but the possibility of leaving was infinitely more complicated. Since Olga is Jewish on her mother's side, more open Soviet emigration policies virtually assure that the family can leave for Israel.
The question of religion has never been very important to Sergei and Olga. Like most Soviet Jews, Olga considers herself Jewish by background, not by practice, and it was not considered unusual for her to marry Sergei, a Russian. Occasionally, she prays at a Russian Orthodox Church, a common practice among Jews of mixed heritage. But she and her family have been victims of anti-Semitism and she thinks that the time has come to end that cycle.
 
Persistent Prejudice
Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, tens of thousands of Jews have been emigrating, some to the United States but most to Israel. Some experienced years of harsh anti-Semitism and discrimination, yet the Soviet authorities long refused them permission to leave. Most lived with persistent prejudice that blocked their entry to universities or better jobs, or caused them trouble with neighbors, but they nevertheless had never considered leaving as an answer.
Over the last year or so, the subject of emigration has gradually permeated life in the crowded apartment on First Smolensky Lane that Sergei and Olga share with two daughters and Olga's elderly mother. It creeps into the most mundane conversations, like the time that Sergei bought up a case of porridge - 16 boxes - when he found it on sale in a local grocery store that was bereft of much else.
''It's good to have around the house for when fresh food is hard to find,'' he told Olga when he came home with his big purchase.
''What are we doing living in a country where our children could starve to death unless they eat groats,'' Olga snapped back. ''We should just leave, fill out the Israeli application and be done with this horror.''
Economics are a significant factor in the family debate about whether to leave. Many Jewish families taking advantage of easier emigration rules are trying to leave not out of a wish to practice Judaism freely, or because they fear anti-Semitism. They are applying to emigrate because living in the Soviet Union has become too difficult and they want a better life.
 
Fear of Economic Disaster
Olga is quick to admit that she wants to leave because she fears that the economy is falling apart. She is convinced that even middle-class people in big cities could soon be starving. She also feels that Soviet society will not be ready in her lifetime to accept and carry out the measures necessary to turn life around.
''I have a friend who aptly compares the situation here to Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt,'' Olga said. ''Before the Jewish people could get into the Land of Israel and begin a new life, Moses led them around the desert for 40 years, until all the people who had been slaves and still had the slave mentality died. God and Moses knew that only those who were not born to slavery could build a new life.''
To be sure, fear of anti-Semitism is also a major concern for Olga. She was first chided for being Jewish as a child, when the building janitor chased her out of the yard with a broom, shouting ''zhid!'' - an insulting term comparable to ''kike.''
The harassment, at turns subtle and overt, continues to this day. Liza recently came back from playing in the local playground and asked her mother what a ''zhid'' was. A mother of one of the other children had called Liza by the epithet, then ordered her own child to stay away. Olga worries that as the economy gets worse, so will the prejudice. Obligation to Stay? Sergei tries to fight her, but not with practical arguments. Though he says he believes that the economy will respond to new programs, he realizes that he has precious little proof. Instead, he argues from a personal and moral stand. He says he feels deeply that as a person of talent and drive, he owes it to his country to stay and help revive it.
Moreover, if he moves abroad, Sergei says, he will probably be forced to abandon his field at least temporarily to earn a living. He could go from a laboratory where he studies inductive reasoning to a taxi or to a kitchen. If so, it could take years before he is able to return to his work.
''What kind of life is it if I become materially richer and spiritually poorer,'' he said one day after Olga, who is on maternity leave from her job as an editor at an art publishing house, returned from a particularly grueling foray to the food stores. ''A person's entire soul changes from that kind of switch in life style. I want to change because of my own decisions, not because of external influences and some strange life.''
''Oh, Sergei, I agree with you in principle,'' Olga said. ''But it's time for me to think about my own kids. They're forced to eat terrible food and breathe this awful air. How will they grow, let alone thrive? Our bodies are learning to take so much abuse, we're all becoming mutants.
''And what about their minds? The education system is so bad. It's still bogged down by this absurd Communist ideology. Just look at this book.''
Olga grabbed Liza's second-grade textbook and began to read aloud a simplistic and dogmatic story about the young Lenin:
''Exactly at 7, Volodya woke himself up. Nobody had to wake him. Having slept, he got up immediately. He didn't allow himself to loll around in bed. He brushed his teeth, washed his hands and face well and. . . .''
And on the text went, implying that good children will train themselves well to become good Communists.
 
'But I Still Have Ideals'
Sergei slumped in his chair and shook his head. ''I know, I know,'' he said. ''But I still have ideals. I can't cast off my own country as dead. I couldn't live somewhere else peacefully, knowing that I'm in part guilty for leaving all these problems behind and not helping.''
The arguing and debating continued that day and resurfaced again and again all week. Olga's mother, Zhanna Gaysinskaya, who usually tries to keep peace in the tight quarters by holding her tongue, turned to Olga one day and said more emphatically than she ever had before: ''I want you kids to leave. There are too many reasons to leave and not enough to stay.''
By week's end, while the Government's new economic plan was being battered by politicians and workers across the country, Sergei was feeling defeated. The faith he put in the system was slowly starting to erode.
''Maybe we could fill out the application,'' he said to Olga, though he remains unconvinced that leaving is the answer, and the family debate remains alive. ''Or maybe I could get a contract with a computer firm and we could go for a year or two and see how it is. You know, now it's not so hard to come back if we change our minds.''

HEADLINE: Preparations Are Hectic for Mandela's U.S. Tour

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
When Nelson Mandela arrives in New York on Wednesday for a grueling, hastily scheduled 12-day, 8-city tour of the United States, he has a single, clear political objective in mind, organizers say: keeping economic sanctions and other pressure for change on the white South African Government.
''This is not some kind of a victory lap,'' said Roger Wilkins, national coordinator of the visit.
Mr. Mandela, released in February after 27 years in prison, has become the personification of the struggle against South Africa's system of racial separation, and for millions of black Americans the ticker-tape parades and rallies in ball parks will be a moment of pride.
 
Meeting With President
The deputy president of the formerly banned African National Congress, Mr. Mandela will meet with President Bush at the White House, address a joint session of Congress and make a speech to the United Nations General Assembly.
Perhaps as important, he will meet privately in New York with leading business figures, some of whom still have financial ties to South Africa, in an effort to keep economic pressure on the Government of President F. W. de Klerk. 
The eight-city tour, resembling a Presidential campaign swing, will include a ticker-tape parade to City Hall, New York's traditional hero's welcome; a rally in Yankee Stadium, and a star-studded concert in Los Angeles produced by Quincy Jones and Lionel Ritchie and including Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Paula Abdul and Bonnie Raitt.
Organizers have been swamped with requests for meetings with Mr. Mandela by people ranging from schoolchildren to socialites. There have been 5,000 requests for press credentials to the State Department. The cramped, makeshift offices of tour organizers in Washington and New York have been madhouses of constantly ringing telephones.
But there is also concern that the schedule may be too demanding for Mr. Mandela. He will be 72 years old next month and is in uncertain health, having recently undergone surgery for the removal of a benign cyst on his bladder.
On Thursday, the African National Congress headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, contacted the national tour organizers in Washington to ask that the schedule be scaled back. Indeed, by the weekend the schedule was still not firm, with officials emphasizing that all events were subject to change should Mr. Mandela need rest.
''Its all tentative, depending on how he feels,'' said Darlene Donloe, a spokeswoman for the reception committee in Los Angeles, toward the end of the tour. ''You have to remember he's an old man.''
Mr. Wilkins, the national director, said that one of his main goals was to protect Mr. Mandela's health by being the man to say no to the flood of organizations and individuals seeking to meet him.
''This man is not an ambulatory photo opportunity,'' Mr. Wilkins said. ''He's a 71-year old human being who's had a very strenuous life since he got out of prison.''
 
A Logistical Nightmare
With only four weeks to organize, the tour is a logistical nightmare.
''Its like running a campaign on a crash basis,'' said Mr. Wilkins.
''We're running a visit on the level of a head of state,'' said Mae Ngai, deputy director of the New York welcoming committee. ''But without being a state, so we don't have the resources, the infrastructure.''
The State Department will provide security, but the rest of the logistics will be handled by the national and local committees.
Another goal of the tour will be to raise funds for the A.N.C. Tickets to the various events range from $5 for some of the ball-park concerts to contributions from corporations of as much as $50,000 a seat for a reception in Los Angeles.
The need for the continuation of sanctions will be Mr. Mandela's main message, said Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, an anti-apartheid organization, who intitiated the trip at Mr. Mandela's request. Mr. Robinson, a Washington lawyer, directed a series of daily demonstrations outside the South African Embassy in Washington that saw 4,000 arrests there and 5,000 elsewhere in the country and is generally credited with helping to lead Congress to approve economic sanctions against South Africa in 1986.
Mr. Robinson and other organizers have said in interviews that there was concern in the African National Congress that the Bush Administration, which had opposed sanctions, would use the limited reforms thus far initiated by the de Klerk Government as a basis for lifting the measure.
The concern was heightened, Mr. Robinson and others said, by remarks on June 10 by the President's chief of staff, John H. Sununu, on a televised Sunday talk show. Responding to a question from Robert Novak, the syndicated columnist, about whether sanctions might now be lifted, Mr. Sununu replied:
''I think in terms of the law, the ability to remove sanctions is there, if I'm not mistaken. I think the President and Secretary of State Baker will be reviewing this and I suspect, over the next few weeks, there will be an evolution of what the exact policy will be.''
''Nothing could be farther from the truth,'' Mr. Robinson asserted. He said that only one of the mandated conditions for lifting sanctions had been met, the lifting of the ban against the A.N.C., but that other conditions like the repeal of the law establishing segregated living areas, the release of some 3,000 political prisoners and ''substantial progress'' toward the dismemberment of the apartheid system had not.
''Why turn off the heat when the water is about to boil,'' said Lindiwe Mabuza, the A.N.C's chief representative to the United States, emphasizing that it was the pressure of the sanctions, estimated to have cost the South African economy at least $10 billion, which helped force the climate of change.
''To withdraw the pressure is to frustrate these efforts, to send the wrong signals,'' she said. ''It is to say the South African Government has just got to do the minimum.''
The tour grew out of a meeting of about 70 supporters of the anti-apartheid movement, including Mayor David N. Dinkins, convened by Mr. Robinson in Washington on May 11.
One major city that is conspicuously absent from the itinerary is Chicago, which Mr. Mandela has been urged to avoid by his supporters there. They have criticized Mayor Richard M. Daley's policies on sanctions, contending that Mr. Daley has been too lenient with companies that have dealings in South Africa.
 
Arrival in New York
Mr. Mandela, who traveled to Canada yesterday after a similar swing through Europe, will arrive in New York early Wednesday morning to be welcomed by Mayor Dinkins. A motorcade through Brooklyn will be followed by a lunchtime ticker-tape parade through the financial district and a City Hall reception. Mr. Mandela, and his wife, Winnie, will stay at Gracie Mansion.
There will be an ecumenical service at Riverside Church on Thursday morning, a motorcade through Harlem and a ceremony at the Adam Clayton Powell state office building there, followed by a rally and concert at Yankee Stadium.
On Friday morning Mr. Mandela will have a private breakfast with business leaders, followed by an address to the United Nations General Assembly. While in New York, he will also tape television programs for Ted Koppel's ''Nightline'' and the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour.
On Saturday, Mr. Mandela will travel to Boston, where he will have lunch with members of the Kennedy family at the John F. Kennedy Library. There will be a motorcade through minority neighborhoods, a six-hour-long public rally at the Esplanade, and an evening fund-raising reception. On Sunday, he will visit two of his daughters, Zenani Mandela-Dlamini, 31, and Makaziwe Mandela, 36, who are both college students in the area.
Mr. Mandela will travel to Washington on Sunday, where he will have a White House meeting on Monday with President Bush, followed by a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. On Tuesday, June 26, after having breakfast with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, he will speak to a joint meeting of Congress. In the evening, there will be a rally at the District of Columbia Convention Center.
Unlike Mayor Dinkins, Washington's black Mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr., who is embroiled in a drug trial, will not play a role in Mr. Mandela's visit, organizers in Washington said.
Mr. Mandela will be in Atlanta on June 27 for a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In the evening, he will attend a rally at Grant Field Stadium. At Morehouse College, which is predominantly black, Mr. Mandela will be awarded an honorary doctorate from 117 traditionally black colleges and universities.
He will fly to Miami on June 28 to address the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees convention, and then he will travel to Detroit for a visit to the Ford River Rouge Plant and an evening rally at Tiger Stadium.
On June 29, Mr. Mandela will fly to Los Angeles. He will travel in a motorcade to City Hall, where he will make a speech on the steps. There is a fund-raising reception in the evening followed by the concert in the Coliseum, which seats 90,000 people.
 
Rally in Oakland
The next morning, Mr. Mandela will go to Oakland, Calif., where there will be a rally in the afternoon at the Oakland Coliseum, a fund-raising cocktail party and a $100 a plate dinner at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. Oakland and the Bay Area had pressed to be added to the schedule because longshoremen there have refused to unload South African cargo and because Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco have policies to divest themselves of holdings in companies that do business with South Africa. The area's Congressman, Ronald V. Dellums, a Democrat, has sponsored anti-apartheid measures in Congress for the past 20 years.
Mr. Mandela will depart for Britain on July 1.
Mrs. Mandela will appear at separate events in several cities, including New York, Boston and Berkeley, Calif.
The ad hoc nature of the organizing for Mr. Mandela's trip was shown by the two-day delay in selling tickets for the Yankee Stadium concert because of a dispute over the grass. Billy Joel, the singer, who has booked the Stadium for a concert, agreed to lend the Mandela committee his speakers and other equipment, including a tarpaulin and 7,000 folding chairs. But the Yankee's owner, George Steinbrenner, fearing damage if the tarpaulin and chairs remained on the field three full days, held out until he got a pledge from the city to repair any damage to the grass.
''Mr. Mandela is an international symbol of integrity, commitment and freedom,'' Mr. Steinbrenner said in a statement on Thursday. ''He is a leader by example and a world hero. The stadium grass, which will contain thousands of temporary chairs, may be demaged. But because of the importance of this event, we will move forward.''

HEADLINE: Officials Brace for Exodus Of Foreigners from Panama

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Immigration officials say the arrest of 63 Chinese on an isolated Alabama airstrip last week was a sign that thousands of foreigners may soon try to enter the United States illegally from Panama.
The officials say the Chinese represent a painful legacy of the corruption rife in the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and are among tens of thousands of foreigners in Panama who bought Panamanian passports, visas, residency permits and identity cards to escape their troubled homelands.
The officials said a large alien smuggling ring flourished under General Noriega. The aliens detained near Mobile were from mainland China and arrived by chartered aircraft from Panama in two groups on Saturday and Monday after paying up to $15,000 each for illegal passage to the United States, the immigration officials said. 
They were sent to immigration detention centers in Texas and Florida, where they face expulsion proceedings.
 
'Targeting the United States'
''We are aware that there are significant numbers of aliens in Panama that do not have legal residence there, and we're certainly sensitive to the possibility that they might be targeting the United States to arrive here illegally,'' said Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Estimates of the number of foreigners with uncertain legal status in Panama as a result of the ouster of General Noriega vary widely. Immigration officials in Washington estimated there are 7,000 Chinese and 2,000 Cubans in Panama. But some immigration officials and Panamanian government experts said there were up to 35,000 Chinese and 13,000 Cubans along with several thousand others, including Nicaraguans, Indians and Pakistanis.
The traffic in Panamanian immigration documents was sanctioned by the Noriega government, but was cut off after the United States invasion last December. The Government of President Guillermo Endara halted the sale of Panamanian documents overseas, and faced with daunting economic problems and high unemployment, it has grown increasingly reluctant to allow those in Panama to remain.
The arrival of Chinese in Panama increased dramatically last year with the Chinese Government's crackdown of the student democracy movement. Panamanian officials estimated that nearly 9,000 Chinese bought documents, most of them through the Panamanian consulate in Hong Kong, to enter Panama.
 
As Visas Expire, Desperation
But now the temporary visas and residency permits, some issued for a year, are beginning to expire. Many foreigners, living in Panama in poverty, are willing to risk illegal entry to the United States following routes and using smuggling techniques used by drug traffickers.
The Chinese apprehended near Mobile, including some with $1,000 bills sewn into their clothing, told investigators that they paid up to $20,000 each for passports and visas to enter Panama and spent an additional $15,000 to enter the United States, said Thomas P. Fischer, the immigration service regional director in Atlanta, whose jurisdiction includes Alabama.
He said they reported traveling a circuitous route from China to Hong Kong and then to London or Amsterdam before arriving in Panama. Most of those detained said they had left China two or three years ago.
Federal prosecutors in Mobile have charged Alfonso Mock-Castillo, a Panamanian restaurateur of Chinese ancestry, as the ringleader of the operation. They have accused him of arranging the flights through an undercover agent of the Customs Service. Mr. Mock-Castillo was arrested along with a woman, described by investigators as his accomplice, on charges of alien smuggling.
 
Suggestion of Noriega Role
Immigration officials suggested that Mr. Mock-Castillo had planned to transport up to 35,000 Chinese into the United States. Some of these officials suggested that the ring was part of an alien smuggling operation controlled by General Noriega and his associates.
But Dexter Lehtinen, the Federal prosecutor in Miami, who is prosecuting Gen. Noriega on drug trafficking charges, issued a statement denying that smuggling charges were likely. ''There is no indictment currently planned or contemplated against General Manuel A. Noriega in this district that includes any allegations of alien smuggling.''
Some immigration officials in Washington said they suspect that Federal prosecutors in Miami are wary of pursuing a case that would inevitably involve the politically volatile issue of Cuban immigration in South Florida, where Cuban-Americans form a powerful constituency. But immigration officials and prosecutors in Miami denied it.

HEADLINE: How to Make Europe Secure

 BODY:
Now that President Gorbachev has reconciled himself to a united Germany in NATO, he still must find a new place in Europe. And his newly independent neighbors in Eastern Europe need a sense of security. A collective security pact for all of Europe could meet both these needs. 
As the Warsaw Pact disbands, Moscow grows ever more nervous about its future in Europe. Hungary, long a Soviet satellite, now hints that it wants to follow Germany into NATO. But that would isolate Moscow even more and do nothing to promote long-term stability.
A collective security pact that binds all states against any aggressor would be preferable to alliances that commit some states to oppose others. The idea is being talked about across Europe, and it merits the Bush Administration's careful attention.
Eastern Europe is really Middle Europe, the countries caught between Germany and Russia. These states have enjoyed periods of precarious independence, but never independence with security.
That's why some Warsaw Pact members want to preserve the old alliance in some measure. Poland has invited the Red Army to remain at least until it gets border guarantees from Germany. Czechoslovakia's President, Vaclav Havel, wants the Warsaw Pact transformed into ''a treaty of sovereign states, with equal rights, formed on a democratic basis.'' That would give the Soviet Union a place among its neighbors.
But uneasy as Poland and other states are about a powerful Germany's renewed push to the East, they don't believe Germany poses a military threat. And they are not about to spurn Germany's economic advances. In any event, having endured the suffocating embrace of their Soviet ally for 40 years, most are not yet ready to link arms again.
Another alternative for Eastern Europe might be a form of armed neutrality, like that practiced by Finland and Sweden for 45 years. But armed neutrality isn't very attractive in Eastern Europe. Instead, there is a good deal of talk about a collective security pact among all 35 members of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, or at least among the 23 in NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
Such a pact could commit signatories, the U.S. and the Soviet Union included, to impose sanctions on and take up arms against aggressor states. It would also meet Mr. Gorbachev's need for a place in Europe.
What would such an arrangement look like? A new European Security Council could be established, perhaps in Berlin. Through periodic meetings of permanent representatives from the member countries, the council could, for instance, verify the treaty now being negotiated to reduce conventional arms. It could mediate disputes and provide peacekeeping forces to separate the contenders.
The history of collective security is not very reassuring, but perhaps this is the time and the place to try again. The idea offers an interesting way for Mr. Bush to assure that his victory on a united Germany in NATO does not dangerously isolate the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: How Minorities Are Sold Short

BYLINE: By Mark Green; Mark Green is Commissioner of New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs.

 BODY:
One of the unacknowledged underlying reasons for today's racial tensions in New York City is decades of small slights and systematic exploitation of minorities by banks, insurance companies, department stores and other businesses -not just one contested incident at a grocery run by Korean-Americans.
More than 20 years ago, the Kerner Commission cited consumer fraud as one of the causes of the riots in Watts, Detroit and Newark. Since then, minority groups in some respects have moved further than ever from the economic mainstream.
The income gap between whites and non-whites has widened. The shift from manufacturing to service industries, combined with the terrible flaws in urban education, has left African-Americans and Latinos at a disadvantage when competing for white-collar jobs. And Reagan-era attacks on affirmative action and civil rights programs did nothing to enhance racial economic justice. 
But perhaps nothing is so infuriating or depressing to minority people as the daily reminders of institutional discrimination. Consider:
Auto insurance. Drivers who happen to live in certain ZIP code areas pay higher rates, no matter how good their driving record. One recent analysis showed that 79 percent of the drivers in the urban core of the Bronx are in the high-premium, assigned-risk pool. Compare this with a rate of 41 percent in the rest of the Bronx and 16 percent statewide.
Employment. New York State has filed a string of five lawsuits alleging discrimination by employment agencies. The agencies are accused of having coded job candidates' applications by race. Evidently, top skills do not always insure desirable jobs for members of minority groups.
Shopping. Few major supermarket chains locate stores in minority neighborhoods. Thus, some residents of Harlem, to cite just one example, are forced to take gypsy cabs to the West Side to shop.
It was reported recently in Crain's that a D'Agostino's supermarket at 110th Street and Broadway will deliver groceries only as far east as Manhattan Avenue. Its deliverers will not go one block farther, which would take them into Harlem.
Moreover, major department stores refuse to open outlets in shopping malls located in solidly middle-class African-American areas -even though there is significant buying power in these neighborhoods.
Consumer banking. Major banks were well represented in minority neighborhoods in the 1960's. But in the past decade, most of the branches have been shuttered. All too often, no bank means no mortgages and no convenient access to banking services by local businesses. Yet banks do business under government charters, which require them to operate in the public interest and for the public's convenience - the entire public, not just the affluent.
Adding insult to injury, there is a good chance of rejection when a frustrated Latino or African-American does try to open a checking account in some other neighborhood. According to a recent study by two state legislators, most major banks in New York City require applicants for checking accounts to live or work near - usually within 10 blocks of - the branch.
This provision effectively bars minorities from opening checking accounts, which are one of the basic tools for full participation in the economy. To make matters worse, the multi-racial ''testers'' who conducted the study found that distance requirements were usually waived for whites but rarely for non-whites.
As for access to credit, Congressional hearings last month confirmed that African-Americans are rejected for mortgages twice as often as whites - even when income and other factors are equivalent.
These everyday consumer offenses amplify the toll imposed by broad income discrepancies and restricted access to education and health care. Until the day arrives when minorities can open a checking account at any bank, successfully hail a medallion cab, have mortgage applications fairly evaluated and get equitably priced insurance, there will be a steady and generous supply of grist for the mill of racial anger.
So, instead of conveniently blaming a few provocateurs for black-white-Asian tensions, we should focus on the eroding economic health of minority consumers.

HEADLINE: We Still Need Missile Defenses

BYLINE: By John Warner; John Warner, Republican of Virginia, is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Have the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union undermined the need for continued research on ballistic missile defenses? Absolutely not. If anything, the case for some type of missile defenses is more compelling today than at any time since the advent of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
We must remain prepared to deal with political and military instability. The Soviet Union is increasingly fraught with nationalist and ethnic unrest, and its economy cannot fulfill the basic needs of the people. Mr. Gorbachev's viability is questioned because of the seemingly indomitable problems facing his nation. 
The Soviet Union still possesses a formidable military capability. Most notable is its strategic offensive and defensive nuclear force modernization program. Soviet ballistic missile defenses around Moscow - the world's only such system - are being upgraded.
Consequently, our nuclear deterrent must remain, in both perception and reality, uncontestable to any foreign power. And we must consider the enormous benefits of a strategic missile defense.
Even as arms control negotiations move toward reducing the overall levels of strategic delivery systems, our existing strategic defenses -such as air defenses, early-warning and surveillance and intelligence -are clearly seen by other countries as stabilizing and unthreatening. Missile defenses will enhance this stability by assuring that our perhaps more vulnerable retaliatory forces are protected and by denying an attacker any certainty of achieving his objectives.
They also provide a hedge against cheating on arms control treaties. Indeed, effective missile defenses actually promote strategic arms control objectives by reducing the military value of multiple-warhead missiles. They also provide incentives for the Soviet Union to move to a less threatening force of single-warhead, land-based missiles.
In addition, there are many countries that now possess missiles that threaten the interests of the U.S. and its friends. Many of these missiles are capable of reaching allies like Israel and can be equipped with chemical or biological warheads, and soon even nuclear weapons.
Today, the number of developing countries possessing ballistic missiles with a range of less than 1,000 miles - such as Iraq and Syria - has increased substantially. William Webster, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, recently informed Congress that, by the year 2000, at least six third-world countries will have ballistic missiles with ranges of up to 1,800 miles, and three of them may develop ballistic missiles with a range of 3,400 miles.
Missile defenses in the U.S. and within the borders of our allies would greatly deter long-range ballistic missile use. Tactical ballistic missile defenses deployed by our allies would enhance deterrence and stability.
On a recent trip to California, I had a firsthand look at the Strategic Defense Initiative. The question is no longer whether the country has the technical ability to build cost-effective missile defenses; it is clear we do. Rather, we must now ask what role missile defenses will have in our national strategy.
As in the air defense debate in England during the 1930's, we must now ask: Does America want to be defended, and if so, with what systems? For England, the outcome of that debate was pivotal. It was England's advanced air defense systems that saved it in the summer of 1940.
It is worth remembering the words of Winston Churchill at the peak of the air defense debate: ''I think it would be a great mistake to neglect the scientific side of purely defensive action against aircraft attack. Certainly, nothing is more necessary, not only to this country, but to all peace-loving . . . powers in the world . . . than that the good old earth should acquire some means of destroying the sky marauder.''
Today, the marauder is ballistic missiles. I am convinced that we must now, more than ever before, plan for the inclusion of missile defenses in our national security strategy.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
No Time for Temper Tantrums

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When the P.L.O. betrayed the basis for talks with the U.S. by launching a major terrorist attack on civilian families on the beaches of Tel Aviv, Mr. Bush sent his Secretary of State to the Congress to lash the new Government of Israel with sarcasm.
Secretary Baker's blame-the-victim attitude invites more terrorism and a new cycle of stiffneckedness. As the supreme pragmatist, he should recognize that snide, self-indulgent wisecracks make great sound bites but impede progress.
Let's be constructive: in the Middle East, that means taking Mr. Baker's calculatedly intemperate here's-my-number, call-me-when-you're-ready blast and interpreting it in a different way. 
The new conservative (''right wing'' to those who never call its opposition ''left wing'') Government should take the Baker tantrum as good news: for a while at least, it means that Israel will be given a respite from intervention in its democratic political workings by a one-sided, anti-settlement Government in Washington eager to set up a Palestinian state under Arafat rule.
This will give the new Government, denied even the shortest media honeymoon, a chance to come up with a few surprises.
Surprise No. 1 is easy: to demonstrate it is not the gang of thugs that Arab apologists would have the world believe. The new Shamir Government has already welcomed a U.N. visitor and opened one Palestinian university facility; other demonstrations of good will should follow, unless these are met with a kick in the teeth.
The second surprise will come when the Government, always derogated as ''narrow based,'' lasts longer than a few weeks. Here is the unspoken discipline to splinter parties: when a few swing voters bring down the rightist coalition, a unity government is likely to emerge that will reform the splinters out of their seats in the Knesset. Thus, the next no-confidence vote could be their last.
The focus, Likudniks hope, will be on ''the absorption process.'' Today's enthusiastic welcoming is sure to face natural strains; young Israelis, facing unemployment approaching 9 percent, will be competing for jobs with arriving Soviet immigrants.
Housing Minister Arik Sharon can expect heavy coverage of disappointed immigrants and resentful sabras, but could confound his critics by rising to his greatest challenge - housing and employing Exodus III, which will strengthen Israel immeasurably.
Mention of that controversial character turns us to the surprises we can expect from a Labor Party no longer in thrall to the State Department. Mr. Sharon tells political friends: ''Peres is finished; our problem is Rabin.''
Yitzhak Rabin, Defense Minister until the popular Mr. Bush inadvertently knocked over Israel's grand coalition in a fit of peaking, is in the U.S.; I slipped up to New York and caught him, relaxed for a change, watching a soccer game on TV.
His longtime rival, Shimon Peres, remains leader of the Labor Party, hopeful that time will dim memories of his failed grab for power; Mr. Rabin, the most widely respected leader in Israel, knows he must move quickly to regain the party and national leadership he held in the 70's.
He would like to bring a primary system to his party, infusing it with young blood and capturing the nation's avid attention, but that might take four months to set in train; a quicker leadership decision would be through the 1,300 members of the party's central committee, most of whom owe their jobs to Mr. Peres and his cohort.
Because political parties exist to win, I'm betting on Yitzhak Rabin to bring it off. What would follow in time would be elections with an eye to the sort of reform Israel needs: a stable government of one side or the other.
Mr. Rabin envisions a prime minister elected directly, with a two-thirds vote of the Knesset needed to bring down his government - a hybrid presidential-parliamentary system. Others press a reform raising the threshold of the percentage of votes needed to rate seats in Parliament; whichever shape it takes, the need for stability is in the air.
What is the best U.S. policy? To restore our antiterrorism credibility by getting out of the P.L.O.'s snare of talks; to stop building the Iraqi threat with our trade and credits; and to get off Mr. Shamir's back as new Israeli leadership backed by an improved political system develops.
As that happens, and as Secretary Baker learns that Israeli leaders do not quake at his sarcasm, let the phones begin to ring.

A Final Insult: It May Even Cost More on Way Out

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
When Benjamin Franklin said that nothing is certain but death and taxes he did not anticipate the inevitable outcry over taxes imposed upon death.
Wealthy New Yorkers, all but resigned to the high cost of living in the city, are balking at an inconspicuous proposal that would raise the cost of dying in the city, too.
Tucked into Mayor David N. Dinkins's tax package is a 20 percent city surcharge on the state's estate tax. The extra tax on estates valued at $1 million or more originated with the City Council. 
Among $800 million of proposed levies, the $5 million that the surcharge is projected to generate in the fiscal year that starts on July 1 might seem to many people like small change. So, to a smaller number of people, perhaps, is the roughly $25 million that the surcharge is expected to begin producing annually in two years, once its full impact is felt.
But the surcharge has become symbolic. New York is a city whose business is wealth. Its relatively glacial economy, volcanic crime rate and overheated racial climate have combined again to create self-doubts among even the most committed, but highly mobile, New Yorkers.
Mr. Dinkins, sensitive to the jitters in the business world, largely buttoned his lips about taxes in his campaign last year. Yet, when the Mayor outlined his tax proposals last month, many business leaders responded sympathetically, given the dimensions of the budget gap he had inherited and his efforts to apportion the pain fairly.
Then someone spotted the surcharge. Its potential targets, their intermediaries and a number of tax experts warn that it might prompt some wealthy New Yorkers, many of whom already own homes elsewhere, to flee -depriving the city not only of the estate tax, eventually, but also of yearly revenue, meanwhile, from the personal income tax.
''Of all the taxes that have ever been proposed,'' the president of CBS Inc., Laurence A. Tisch, said, ''this is the one where you would end up with the biggest loss of revenue. This is so bad because right now everybody's on the cusp.''
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-oriented watchdog group, said the surcharge ''undoubtedly would raise some money, but would also, in theory at least, cause some exodus.''
Many New Yorkers routinely say they are dying to leave the city. But will others now be leaving to die?
Budget Director Philip R. Michael is not looking a gift tax in the mouth. ''I don't buy the argument that, 'Ha, I'm going to die, so I'm going to move,' '' he said.
Other fiscal officials are not so sure. When the Council initiated the surcharge, said its Finance Director, Marc V. Shaw, ''a lot of people looked at it as a good social mechanism to raise revenue, that for people who have come into a lot of money, once they're dead it's not the worst thing if they give a payback to society.'' Moreover, he said, the Council viewed a 10 percent estate-tax surcharge as an alternative to further increases in the personal income tax.
''If they haven't moved out of New York City because of the taxes yet,'' he said, ''this wasn't going to push them over the edge.'' But at 20 percent, the figure incorporated in the Mayor's proposal, Mr. Shaw said that ''it's approaching the point where it might actually cause people to move.''
State Tax Commissioner James W. Wetzler expresses reservations because, he said, the surcharge might just about double the effective estate-tax rate in New York City. The state tax on a $10 million estate would ordinarily be $1,456,500, he said. A Federal credit would reduce that, to $373,700. A 20 percent city surcharge could cost the estate an additional $291,300.
How many people would be directly affected by a surcharge? A market-research company estimates that the city is home to tens of thousands of millionaires, and 2,500 people said they made $1 million or more in 1987 alone. In Manhattan, where most of them live and die, 247 estates valued at $1 million or more were filed for probate last year.
Two prior impositions of what has been called the nation's only municipal estate tax were short lived. A 40 percent surcharge in 1934 on estates of more than $10,000 expired after one year. A 50 percent surcharge in 1975 was repealed before it was to begin.
Both times, one rationale for the surcharge was to make the tax burden seem more equitable. But some experts expressed concern about its potential consequences. The tax surcharge on estates was abandoned because officials feared that by further troubling New York's wealthier households, the city might inherit the wind.

HEADLINE: The 2d Man at the Helm of New Jersey's Taut Ship of State

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 15

 BODY:
If Jim Florio is the imperial Governor of New Jersey, then Douglas Berman, his 37-year-old State Treasurer, is both his keeper of the vault and the chief of the palace guard.
And as the campaign manager who directed the relentless assault last fall on Mr. Florio's opponent, Representative Jim Courter, Mr. Berman has also been his chief executioner, say Trenton politicians wary of his influence with the Governor.
Mr. Berman's ascendance in Trenton has been accompanied by growing complaints over the Florio administration's efforts to limit debate and access to government.
As Governor Florio has tightened his grip on the reins of government, restricting legislators' access to commissioners, reducing outside advice on the budget and funneling most news releases through his office, Mr. Berman has become the chief architect of the state's fiscal plan and virtually the sole purveyor of information about it.
 
'A Very Important Office'
''He's made Treasurer a very important office,'' said Assemblyman Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, the Republican Assembly leader. ''What are the most important things in government today? Money and spending.'' 
But that importance is compounded by Governor Florio's mandating that all questions on the budget go through the Governor's office, and designating Mr. Berman as the only person who will answer questions before the Legislature.
''If he's the only one who's answering,'' Mr. Haytaian observed, ''he's an important figure of government.''
Some complaints about the Florio administration's tight grip have been visible. On Thursday, Republican legislators gagged themselves with red bandannas to protest new rules imposed by the Democratic majority in the Assembly limiting debates to two hours.
Republicans - as well as some Democrats in private - were already chafing under the administration's decision to present only Mr. Berman at budget hearings.
 
Advisory Council Abolished
Another example of the administration's closed nature was Mr. Florio's refusal, upon taking office, to reappoint the New Jersey Economic Council. For more than two decades, under several administrations, the unpaid group of economic advisers had provided analysis and advice on fiscal and economic matters.
He even refused to meet with the council. ''We had been soliciting meetings for some time,'' said Dr. Joseph Seneca, a professor of economics at Rutgers who was chairman of the group. ''We had no success.''
''Our value was in our nonpartisan nature,'' Dr. Seneca added. ''That is useful and valuable.''
School officials are also complaining that they are being kept in the dark about the sweeping financial changes that public-school districts are undergoing as a result of the State Supreme Court's decision requiring New Jersey to equalize spending among rich and poor districts.
This week, for example, the Teaneck Board of Education adopted a resolution accusing the Govenor of using ''undemocratic'' tactics to further his school financing proposals. It charged that the administration had ''made no reasonable attempt whatsoever'' to share school aid figures - developed by Mr. Berman's department -''eliminating any credibility in the numbers'' used to support the restructuring.
 
Conscious Control of Information
Mr. Berman readily acknowledges that there was a conscious decision to enlarge the role of the Treasurer and a concurrent one to create a closely held information structure, similar to that of private industry.
''Budgets and flows of money determine outcomes,'' he said, referring both to political considerations and governmental policy. ''And being able to have tight control over that process is very important to the Governor.''
Mr. Florio, in pursuing his policies, has made Mr. Berman his chief political stategist, his primary liaison with the Legislature on money matters and his chief numbers cruncher.
And because of the way Mr. Florio is trying to transform politics and government in New Jersey, the responsibilities tie together seamlessly. And so in just five months in office, Mr. Berman has turned the relatively obscure office of Treasurer into what friends and enemies alike say is the second most important post in the state.
 
A Transformation of Government
''Jim Florio is trying to transform things in politics and government, and he needs Berman to help him do it,'' said a Democratic political figure with longtime ties to the Governor and who has had dealings with Mr. Berman. ''He's absolutely the second most powerful guy in the state.''
Mr. Berman has credentials as a political strategist. He was a deputy campaign manager for Senator Bill Bradley more than 10 years ago, left politics for a decade and returned as Mr. Florio's campaign manager in 1988. He is a corporate lawyer with a strong academic background - cum laude at Yale in 1974 and a law degree from Columbia in 1979.
He oversees the agency that collects taxes, creates the budgets and spends the money, and he has close to 7,000 employees to help him do it.
At the moment the budget, which is being slashed nearly everywhere, is the biggest issue in New Jersey. Mr. Berman advises the Governor on who will have to pay more in taxes - the rich, the poor or the middle class - and who will get the benefits - cities, suburbs, bankers or workers. And he is the man who arranges the numbers to get the desired effect.
 
Stifling of Debate Charged
At budget hearings in April, he was the only member of the administration allowed to testify, and Republicans accused Governor Florio of using Mr. Berman to ''stifle debate'' and ''gag department heads.''
''Governor Florio has turned the budget process into a puppet show in which he controls the strings,'' charged State Senator John H. Ewing, a Republican of Somerset County.
Mr. Berman said he was chosen to speak for the entire administration ''because I was the person making most of the decisions with the Governor.''
But is there not a pattern of tighter control of information, and even a reduced flow of it?
''There is a pattern, and there is a change,'' Mr. Berman replied.
The voters, he said, elected Mr. Florio ''to be the leader'' and ''to be responsible for the policies of state.''
That means in large measure that the bureaucracy should speak with a consistent voice, Mr. Berman said. ''We should not have three points of view,'' he said. ''The administration should have one point of view.''
 
'Sensitive to Everything'
As to complaints of inadequate dissemination of information by his office, he said that there was ''a lot of demand on computer time'' and that new figures being developed and revised almost daily could not be routinely distributed to all who might want or need them.
He also noted that ''The Governor has held a press conference almost every day.''
Assemblyman Haytaian complains that the tendency of the Florio administration to control information is part of a general strategy to avoid criticism.
''This administation takes everything very personally,'' Mr. Haytayian said in an interview. ''Forget about bad things being said - I don't think they want anybody to even question anything they do. You might as well go to Eastern Europe two or three years ago.''
''People say Doug Berman is arrogant,'' he said. ''But this administration is sensitive to everything.''
Even Mr. Berman's ostensible friends sometimes sound like enemies.
 
A Wariness About Berman
Asked what he had to say that was good about Mr. Berman, Mr. Florio's communications director, Jon Shure, responded, ''What makes you think I have anything good to say about him?''
Mr. Berman's own assistant, asked to name two people who had positive feelings about his boss, said, ''I can only think of one - and I'm not sure about him.''
And Governor Florio, serving himself a piece of cake at a joint ''birthday party'' for everyone in the press corps in the Capitol the other day, observed: ''Doing a piece about Doug Berman? Nasty piece? That should be easy. Lot of material there, lot of material.''
Very few people seem prepared to say just why they don't like Mr. Berman.
''He's so much smarter than most of the people around him,'' said a Democratic political figure who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''He just overwhelms people around him. He wears people down.''
He is also aggressively blunt in an atmosphere in which comity is at least superficially the standard of social commerce.
''Doug just acts out,'' the Democrat said. He recalled that before the election, Mr. Berman had met with other leading Democrats and had told an important legislator that the legislator had been ''Tom Kean's lap dog.''
''He just can't help himself,'' the Democrat said.

HEADLINE: After the Cold War, the Land of the Rising Threat

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Even as the cold war fades into history, American authors and publishers are discovering a new enemy: Japan. In a deluge of recent books and books to be published soon, the country that was once depicted as the land of geishas and cherry blossoms is increasingly being portrayed as the land of a rising threat to the United States, not only as a fierce economic competitor, but also as a potential military foe.
Several months ago, for example, ''The End of the American Century,'' a nonfiction book by Steven Schlossstein (Congdon & Weed), argued that a newly militarized Japan might use its power against the United States.
Next spring, St. Martin's Press plans to publish ''The Second U.S.-Japanese War'' by George Friedman and Meredith LeBard. Professor Friedman, who teaches political science at Dickinson College, in Carlisle, Pa., said the book would contend that ''there is a good chance of a major U.S.-Japanese conflict within the next 20 years, including the possibility of an armed conflict.'' 
Howard Kaminsky, the chief executive officer of the Hearst Trade Book Group, which includes William Morrow & Company, said, ''We haven't bought any of the Japan-bashing books yet, but we've seen proposals for a lot of them.''
 
'A Rush to Fill the Vacuum'
Other publishers said that they had also seen many proposals for books critical of Japan, and that they had signed several of them, much to the distress of some scholars.
''These books that bash Japan reflect a rush to fill the vacuum created by the winding down of the cold war,'' said Ronald Takaki, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California at Berkeley. ''The economic conflict between the two countries is being described in the language of World War II.''
Professor Takaki, the author of ''Strangers From a Different Shore: A History of Asian-Americans'' (Little, Brown), said some of the books reflected a racial panic among the authors. ''They see an erosion of America's manufacturing base,'' he said, ''and they realize that within the lifetime of our children they'll be living in an America where whites won't be a majority.''
What is distinctive about the books is not just their proliferation, but also their harsh depiction of Japanese values, ethics and ambitions. They differ substantially from many earlier books - including ''Japan As Number One'' (Harper/Colophon) by Ezra F. Vogel, a Harvard sociologist - that attributed Japanese success largely to an astute Government, to management techniques and to social discipline.
The publishing broadsides against Japan coincide with public opinion polls showing that Americans are reporting increasingly negative feelings about Japan. A New York Times/CBS News Poll released in February reported that 25 percent of Americans interviewed said their feelings about Japan were ''generally unfriendly,'' compared with 19 percent who said the same last June and 8 percent in 1985.
Publishers, however, deny that they are ganging up on Japan, or that racism accounts for the spate of books critical of Japan. Books, they say, often reflect a society's expressed or tacit concerns, and Americans, as the polls clearly show, are worried about Japan.
 
Of a Perceived Decline
This winter, Simon & Schuster expects to publish a book that is critical of America: ''The Japan That Can Say No'' by Shintaro Ishihara. The author, a Japanese legislator and former Government official, maintains that Japan holds the technological balance of power in the world and should therefore no longer be deferential to the United States. In the author's view, Japan is on the rise and the United States is declining.
It is possible, of course, that the Ishihara book could increase American fears and suspicions about Japan, helping to create an even bigger market in the United States for anti-Japanese books.
But most of the dozen or more books to be published in this country about Japan are already unmistakably unflattering. Two scheduled for publication in the fall are sharply critical of Japanese lobbbying activities in this country. ''Agents of Influence,'' by Pat Choate (Alfred A. Knopf), charges that Japan is spending $350 million a year to try to sway American public opinion in favor of Japanese interests, and is even indirectly financing American political parties.
''The Japanese Power Game'' by William J. Holstein (Charles Scribner's Sons) asserts that Japanese lobbying, already powerful, is likely to grow stronger.
''The House of Nomura: The Inside Story of the Legendary Japanese Financial Dynasty,'' by Albert J. Alletzhauser, recently published by Arcade Publishing/Little, Brown, offers a less than admiring look at the Nomura Securities Company in Tokyo, the world's largest brokerage firm.
The company's global power, the author says, was made through connections with Japanese gangsters and politicians. In late April, after the book was published in London, Nomura filed a libel suit against the author and publisher and sought an injunction halting distribution of the book. But the book continues to sell in Britain, where it had reached No. 1 on the best-seller list of The Times of London.
 
Into the Fictional Realm
Novelists, too, are beginning to label Japan as the enemy: No. 5 on the hard-cover fiction best-seller list of The New York Times this week is ''Dragon,'' by Clive Cussler (Simon & Schuster), which is about a conspiracy to force the West to accept Japan's world leadership. And this fall, E. P. Dutton plans to publish ''Avenue of the Stars,'' by Jina Bacarr and Ellis A. Cohen, a novel about a ruthless Japanese billionaire who tries to take over the last private movie studio in Hollywood.
Both novels are a far cry from ''Shogun,'' James Clavell's generally admiring novel about 17th-century Japan and the Japanese character, which was published in 1975.
Other books have been highly critical of Japan, of course. Two years ago, Daniel Burstein published ''Yen! Japan's New Financial Empire and Its Threat to America'' (Simon & Schuster). And last year, Knopf published an indictment of the Japanese social and political system, ''The Enigma of Japanese Power'' by Karel van Wolferen, a Dutch journalist who has lived in Japan almost 25 years.
In his introduction to the paperback edition, published this month by Vintage Books, the author writes that his ''pessimism concerning the ability of the Japanese poltiical system to cope with the external world has only grown since the book first appeared,'' and he notes that ''the number of foreigners who question Japanese motives is growing.''
 
A Country's Defense Budget
Assertions that the Japanese pose a military threat to the United States and to the West are not new; similar assertions were made as long ago as 1972, in ''Black Star Over Japan: Rising Forces of Militarism'' by Albert Axelbank (Hill & Wang), and as recently as 1985, in ''The Militarists: The Rise of Japanese Militarism Since WW II'' by Edwin P. Hoyt (Donald Fine).
But authors who make similar claims today can point to Japan's growing military sector.
''Japan now has the third largest defense budget in the world,'' Professor Friedman said. ''While part of that has to do with the inflation of the yen, and even though defense is 1 percent of their G.N.P., it's still enormous. It's not so much a rise in militarism, but a rise in arrogance, a sense that now they'll show the world what they can do. The question is what they will do when they are thwarted, if we cut off their supply of oil, for instance.''

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Las Vegas Is a Winner for Casino Owners

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
As Donald J. Trump wrangled with his banks last week, Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., one of the most profitable gambling companies in Las Vegas, was able to raise $100 million in new debt with barely a yawn from the credit markets.
The ease with which Circus Circus was able to borrow money was an indication that investors and lenders continue to view the casino industry as generally well managed and financially stable, Mr. Trump's troubles notwithstanding. ''The Trump situation was a non-issue,'' said Glenn Schaeffer, the chief financial officer of Circus Circus.
And Stephen A. Wynn, the chairman of Golden Nugget Inc., observed: ''For Circus Circus, for Caesars, for us, for some of the others, it's been a very stable business over a very long period.'' 
The industry is not without troubles, particularly in Atlantic City, where many casinos are struggling amid overbuilding and a weak economy in the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states that supply most of the New Jersey city's visitors. Mr. Trump's new Taj Mahal casino is doing well, but partly at the expense of other casinos in the city, including his two other properties, Trump's Castle, which missed $73 million in debt payments on Friday, and the Trump Plaza.
Excluding the Taj Mahal, the total Atlantic City gambling win - the difference between the amount wagered and the amount paid to bettors - declined 9 percent in April from April of last year, to $221.6 million.
Perhaps more distressing for Atlantic City's future, the gambling industry there has not been able to transform itself into a resort destination that attracts not just busloads of day-trippers with cups full of quarters for the slot machines, but vacationers who stay for three days or a week and are willing to spend money off the casino floor.
Las Vegas, by contrast, is booming. The city is in the third year of a casino-building craze, with virtually every gambling company in town adding to or refurbishing existing hotel-casinos or constructing lavish new ones: Circus Circus will open its $290 million, 4,000-room Excalibur casino on Tuesday; Caesars Palace is undergoing a major renovation, and Golden Nugget's $620 million Mirage casino, opened late last year, has so far been a smashing success. Moreover, every major casino is drawing more business.
''There's a very big difference between Nevada and Atlantic City,'' said Michael Mueller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''In the case of Las Vegas, the opening of the Mirage has had the effect of increasing the size of the total market. In Atlantic City, what's happened is that you had another large new entrant, the Taj Mahal, and everyone else is down.''
Much of Las Vegas's continuing growth comes from the progress it has made in recasting itself as a resort town fit for families and vacationers for whom sitting in the sun and watching a few shows may be more appealing than the card tables. MGM Grand Inc. is even building a theme park in the biggest bet yet that Las Vegas can shed its sin-city image.
''It's a very strong industry over the long run,'' said Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''I'm not going to say a recession won't hurt them, because it will. But the stocks have already been discounted to a degree by the East Coast recession. Most of these companies will do well, especially if their operations are concentrated in Nevada.''
Most analysts say Circus Circus is currently the strongest of the casino companies, in part because the company has not entered the Atlantic City market, choosing instead to concentrate in Nevada. The company has also stuck closely to its strategy of appealing to mass-market vacationers interested in low-cost rooms and food, lots of slot machines and some inexpensive entertainment. Excalibur is an attempt to grab that market with a huge, castle-like casino and a Renaissance-era atmosphere, complete with regularly scheduled jousting for those who tire of pulling slot machine handles.
Most analysts are also recommending the stocks of both Golden Nugget and the Hilton Hotels Corporation, neither of which currently operates casinos in Atlantic City. Analysts are less bullish on Caesars World, the Bally Corporation and the Aztar Corporation, formerly Ramada Inc., all of which operate casinos in Atlantic City as well as Nevada.
Sunbathing, Wayne Newton and gimmicks like the Mirage's fire-belching man-made volcano may attract more visitors, but it is the casino operations that are still the industry's financial engine. Caesars World, Golden Nugget, Mr. Trump's Taj Mahal and the Hilton still rely heavily on the high rollers they fly in from around the country and the world.
But for most casinos, the action now is in slot machines, which only a few years ago were virtually an afterthought for the industry. As gambling has become a mass market activity, in New Jersey as well as Nevada, the slot machine has become the game of choice, partly because it is less intimidating to inexperienced gamblers than table games and partly because the stakes are lower.
In 1978, 35 percent of the dollar volume of legal gambling in Nevada went through slot machines. Last year, the figure was more than 60 percent.
''Slot machines have become the dominant game in the industry,'' said Mr. Schaeffer of Circus Circus. ''It's not the inveterate gambler that drives the business any more, it's the tourist.''
Because they pay off to bettors at pre-set rates, slot machines provide additional stability to casino finances. Still, casinos are not totally immune to bad luck. Caesars World reported a drop in profits for its quarter ended last Jan. 31, largely because it won less money than it expected at its Nevada casinos. Analysts attributed the performance to some big losses the casinos suffered in baccarat, the game of choice for most high rollers.
But for the most part, the law of averages works decidedly in the favor of casino companies: In the long run, gamblers will lose much more money than they will win. As long as casinos can keep operating expenses and debt levels under control, analysts said, gambling companies, their shareholders and their lenders can count on a growth in profits paralleling a growth in the number of people willing to put their chips in play.

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves To Shore Up Texas Bailout

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 17

 BODY:
The Resolution Trust Corporation transferred $2.1 billion in deposits late Friday to the Federally owned Sunbelt Savings F.S.B. in Dallas from two insolvent savings institutions. The unusual deal is intended to resolve two expensive situations for the Government.
The goals of the arrangement are to attract bidders for Sunbelt's costly operations and to avoid paying off depositors of the other two institutions. The move will cost taxpayers $1.7 billion. 
Federal officials were unable to attract acceptable bids for the Bexar Savings Association and the Gill Savings Association, both based in San Antonio, said Steve Katsanos, a spokesman for the Resolution Trust agency.
 
High Interest Rates
A loss estimate of $1.2 billion for Gill Savings makes it one of the most costly rescues recorded by the Government in the savings industry crisis. The loss for Bexar was put at $483 million.
Sunbelt executives and officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed the transaction, Mr. Katsanos said. The F.D.I.C., which insures deposits up to $100,000, controls Sunbelt.
Unlike other insolvent Texas savings institutions under Federal control that were transferred to private owners, Sunbelt has been a continuing drain on the Treasury. The institution has $9 billion in assets, but only $3.6 billion in core deposits, and the difference must be financed by attracting billions in additional deposits by offering high interest rates. The high operating costs were a factor in discouraging potential bidders, Mr. Katsanos said.
Bexar Savings and Gill Savings, which collapsed after a few years of fast deals and rapid growth, were known for soliciting deposits by offering high interest rates to savers far beyond the San Antonio region. Yet Mr. Katsanos said the addition of their deposits to Sunbelt would strengthen Sunbelt's core deposits. It will also give Sunbelt a branch network in San Antonio, he said.
Sunbelt was knit together by regulators two years ago from eight collapsed savings associations at a cost that Government officials then estimated hen at $5.5 billion over 10 years. It includes three former high-flying Dallas-area institutions - Sunbelt Savings Association, Western Federal Savings and Independent-American Savings - and is now the second-largest savings institution in Texas, as ranked by assets, after the First Gibraltar Savings Association, which itself was formed from five troubled Texas institutions.
 
Criminal Charges
The former top executives of the defunct Sunbelt, Western Federal and Independent-American have either been charged with fraud or are the subjects of criminal investigations. These executives, who had many business links between 1982 and 1985 when the institutions grew rapidly, also are defendants in civil complaints that seek hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.
The Government estimated the defunct Sunbelt's losses at $1.9 billion and assets at $4.1 billion when it was seized in 1988. Losses at Western Federal were estimated at $1.4 billion, while Independent-American's losses were put at $873 million.
The new Sunbelt's headquarters and most of its branches are in Dallas. It also operates in Houston.

HEADLINE: Suppliers Brace for Arms Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
If the Pentagon follows its plan to shut the M-1 tank program in a budget-cutting move, the impact will not end with the General Dynamics Corporation, the big weapons maker that assembles the tank at factories in Ohio and Michigan.
It would also be a big setback for the tiny Lakewood Manufacturing Company in Westlake, Ohio, which makes fenders and other metal parts for the tank, and for Cadillac Gauge Textron Inc. in Warren, Mich., which makes the aiming system for the tank's gun.
Scores of other companies would also lose large amounts of business, in some cases enough to endanger their survival. In a recent survey of 120 of its M-1 subcontractors, General Dynamics found that 15 percent would have to close a plant if production of the tank program was ended.
 
A Ripple Effect
The M-1 program is just one example of how the coming Pentagon budget cuts would ripple through thousands of subcontractors in all 50 states. Such smaller companies heavily dependent on military contracts are particularly vulnerable to the upheaval and accelerated consolidation that awaits the military-supply industry as it enters the post-cold war era. 
Lakewood, for example, derives more than 50 percent of its $6.5 million in annual sales from subcontracting work for General Dynamics on the M-1 and employs half its 95 employees on the program. Its executives are already preparing for the changes ahead.
''We're aggressively trying to diversify into commercial markets, and we think we'll be able to replace some of the M-1 work, but we'll be hurt,'' said Richard C. Peplin Jr., the company's owner. ''Some people will be laid off, and the company will go backward to some extent.''
While the ranks of subcontractors include large corporations like Texas Instruments Inc. and the General Electric Company, most lack the size, the name recognition and the political influence of prime contractors like General Dynamics. But the business of supplying nuts and bolts, wing sections, radar equipment, microchips and other components is an immense enterprise that cuts across regional economies and industry lines.
On most arms programs, roughly half the budget ultimately flows to subcontractors. Last year, for example, when the Pentagon awarded $120 billion of prime contracts, more than $56 billion was farmed out to subcontractors, many of which rely on yet another tier of suppliers for the parts they need. 5 Percent Cuts Ahead Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is lobbying Congress to limit cuts in the Pentagon's $300 billion budget to about 2 percent a year through 1997. But Congress seems certain to insist upon deeper cuts, probably in the range of 5 percent a year after accounting for inflation.
Cuts of that magnitude would reduce the size of the United States military force by as much as 25 percent. They would also mean canceling, delaying or scaling back most big weapons programs. In addition to the M-1 tank program, Mr. Cheney has already recommended cuts in other high-profile systems like the B-2 Stealth bomber being built by the Northrop Corporation and thousands of subcontractors.
The weapons industry is not the only one in which subcontractors are put at risk when the business cycle turns down, as suppliers to the automobile industry have long known. But analysts and industry executives think the current political atmosphere will mean a permanent reduction in the size of the military contracting industry.
 
A Decade of Pressure
The last decade has left many military subcontractors battered by foreign competition and squeezed by new Government rules that lowered the allowable profit margin on contracts and raised the costs of dealing with the Pentagon bureaucracy, which stepped up its oversight and demanded more paperwork. A half-dozen Government and private studies now conclude that further weakening could imperil national security.
''If present trends persist, the once-mighty arsenal of democracy could become little more than an electronic laboratory, perhaps even incapable of manufacturing the materiel required for deterrence or for protecting U.S. national interests around the globe,'' said a report issued last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
 
A Faster Exodus
The center estimated that the number of companies doing military contracting work decreased to fewer than 40,000 in 1987, from 138,000 in 1982. Government officials and private analysts say budget cuts will only speed that exodus. ''There is no question that we have already lost a significant number of subcontractors and suppliers,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who is chairman of a subcommittee on the military contracting industry, ''and budget cuts are one additional element that will adversely affect them.''
Michael Quinn, the director of marketing and program operations at Cadillac Gauge Textron, a division of Textron Inc., said that if the M-1 program ended, the company would probably have to lay off at least half of its 65 skilled engineers and hundreds of production workers.
''The state of the art would stop advancing and our ability to remain competitive internationally would erode,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''More important, when there's a new generation of technology, we'll be starting over with amateurs. If suddenly the Russians weren't withdrawing or some other threat appeared, it would be at least four years until we could support a tank production effort.''
The same types of issues are already facing other subcontractors across the country. Texas Instruments said earlier this month that it would eliminate 1,000 of the 22,000 jobs in its military systems division, reflecting declining demand for its military electronics products, which are used in scores of weapons systems. The P.V. Tool Company in Westbury, L.I., a precision-tool maker that gets 80 percent of its business from the nearby Grumman Corporation, has seen annual revenues fall by almost 40 percent as Grumman programs like the F-14 Navy fighter plane and the A-6 attack plane are scaled back or canceled.
 
Paring Back Suppliers
Even where programs have not been canceled, the prospect of budget cuts is squeezing subcontractors, as prime contractors pare back the number of suppliers they deal with, seeking to give their business to those who consistently deliver the best price and the best quality.
''The aerospace industry is cutting back its supplier base, and it's doing it by selecting those suppliers that are improving their operations,'' said Ted Tiaga, the owner of Golden Eagle Manufacturing, a metal-working company in San Dimas, Calif., which makes parts for missiles and torpedoes.
The prime contractors, seeking to keep their own plants and personnel busy, are also starting to do some work themselves that they formerly would have subcontracted. ''When the defense budget is growing, it's easier to farm the work out,'' said William B. Burnett, a vice president at the consulting firm Charles River Associates. ''When the budget is shrinking, the primes are more likely to keep the work in-house.''
 
Competition Intensifies
The battle to get business from prime contractors has become increasingly intense. In some cases, suppliers are cutting their prices significantly, seeking to win enough business just to keep operating.
Lamsco West Inc. in Santa Clarita, Calif., recently bid for some additional work making portions of the outer skin of the B-2 Stealth bomber, offering to do the work at its cost. The company lost out to another subcontractor that was willing to do the work for even less.
''Some of these small shops almost have to take business at less than cost in order to at least meet their overhead expenses,'' said Gladden Baldwin, the general manager of Lamsco West.
 
More Nonmilitary Work
Many subcontractors are looking for more nonmilitary work. Golden Eagle Manufacturing, which relies on military business for 95 percent of its revenues, wants half its business to be commercial, Mr. Tiaga said. It has already had some success making parts for the water-purification industry and for medical instruments.
But most commercial markets are already highly competitive, and many subcontractors admit they are likely to have only limited success with diversification. Moreover, for many companies, nonmilitary business is not a realistic option.
''Everything we do is designed for the life-and-death defense situation,'' said Mr. Quinn of Cadillac Gauge. ''If we were to build a commercial product it would probably be overpriced by five or six times.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Rally Is Expected to Stall

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Credit market analysts say that for the time being the bond market's heady rally has probably stalled. Indeed, over the next few weeks interest rates may tend to rise somewhat, even though underlying fundamental factors point strongly to sluggish economic growth and a moderating inflation rate.
A heavy flow of new issues from the Treasury will supersede what remains a very positive fundamental outlook, the analysts said.
''In the three weeks from late June through the second week of July, the market will face auctions of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes, more of the Refcorp bonds, 52-week bills and regular weekly bill auctions,'' analysts at MMS International noted in a bond market commentary late last week. The bonds issued to finance the activities of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is overseeing the bailout of the savings and loan industry, are known as Refcorp bonds. 
Concern about the coming supply may have contributed to Friday's selloff, which pushed yields on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 up to 8.41 percent from a four-month low of 8.37 percent on Thursday.
Focus on the new issues is likely to intensify this week, since there are no important economic reports scheduled.
''With no major economic indicators, supply will be a bit of a worry and cause a backup in market rates,'' said Steven Slifer, a senior vice president and financial market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities.
 
No Action From Fed
Adding to the market's concerns is an increasingly widespread realization that the Federal Reserve, despite continued public prodding from high-ranking members of the Bush Administration, is not about to ease monetary policy.
An easing move might win some political points, but at this juncture economists said any step by the Fed would not do much to help the economy.
''I don't see anything on the horizon that could cause the economy to pick up,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, an independent economic consultant in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
''At best, we will be stuck in a range of 1 percent to 2 percent growth for the rest of the year. My own bias would be for the Fed to ease a little bit more, but in this environment I don't think it would change things very much,'' he said. ''A half-a-point drop in rates is not going to prod companies to borrow more, or prompt construction companies to build faster.''
Based on household debt figures, a decline in interest rates would probably not do much to revitalize consumer spending. Retail sales, a big chunk of overall consumer expenditures, fell for the third straight month in May, and seem unlikely to revive soon.
John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc., said that since the 1982 recession household debt has risen at an annual compound growth rate of 11.3 percent. Over the same period, personal income growth has risen by just 7.5 percent each year.
 
Household Debt Rises
As a result, household debt has soared from nearly 61 percent of personal income to a record 77 percent, Mr. Lonski said. The last cyclical peak in household debt was in 1979, when it accounted for 64.4 percent of personal income.
''The gap between debt and income growth simply cannot persist,'' Mr. Lonski said. ''Unfortunately, the process of realigning household debt growth with personal income may again help usher in a recession,'' he added, as it did in 1980 and again in 1982.
Worries about the dangers of leverage and its impact on an organization's ability to remain profitable are also cropping up in the investment-grade corporate bond market.
For much of 1989, the major concern among would-be buyers of corporate bonds was the risk associated with takeovers.
Those risks led to a sharp rise in so-called ''event-risk'' covenants that provided protection to bondholders should the issuer be subject to a hostile takeover.
With the sharp decline in the ''junk bond'' market and heightened focus by regulators on bank lending for highly leveraged transactions, those sorts of concerns have all but evaporated.
''Over the last several months interest in event-risk covenants is down very substantially,'' said Solomon B. Samson, a managing director and chairman of the rating committee for the corporate finance department at the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Indeed, through the first five and a half months of 1990 a total of 23 issues had takeover related event-risk covenants, according to the Securities Data Company Inc. By comparison, in the last six months of 1989, 108 issues included such language.
 
Covenants Redefined
''Event-risk'' covenants are not dead, but, in a reflection of the times, they have been redefined.
Over the last few months investment banks, led by Bear, Stearns & Company, have introduced so-called credit sensitive notes, securities with an adjustable coupon that is based on the issuer's credit rating.
For the most part, companies interested in using such securities carry ratings lower than A. In the event of a ratings upgrade, the coupon on the securities would be reduced. A ratings downgrade, by contrast, would lead to an increase in the coupon.
A number of recent issues, including a $1 billion offering backed by the Chrysler Corporation in late April, a $600 million offering from the Georgia-Pacific Corporation on June 6 and a $300 million offering from the Chrysler Financial Corporation, a Chrysler subsidiary, have had such features.
In the case of Chrysler Financial, the notes it sold last week through underwriters at the First Boston Corporation carry a one-time ''put'' for investors that can be exercised if Moody's Investors Service, which currently has Chrysler under review, lowers its ratings on the auto maker. Moody's said it would decide by the end of the month whether it would change Chrysler's ratings.
S.&P. last week downgraded its credit ratings for the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler.
''There are still issuers who need event-risk language,'' said one investment banker, who asked not to be identified. ''But increasingly they are issuers who have business risk. Chrysler is one example. No one is going to take them over, but they are in a business which is going through some tough times. At this juncture, would-be bondholders are concerned about issues like that.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
KOHL SEES BALLOT BY TWO GERMANYS BEFORE END OF '90

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, June 18

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today that a December date for the first all-German elections in more than 50 years was ''coming near to being very, very likely.''
Mr. Kohl's comment, in a television interview, was his most assertive to date on the possibility that German unity could become a reality by the end of the year.
The Chancellor has pressed for several weeks to expand the West German parliamentary elections scheduled for Dec. 2 into an all-German vote, which he originally planned for next year.
 
Much Remains Undone
The election could amount to political reunification, since the West German Constitution envisions direct accession by former German states into the Federal Republic. But the number of internal and foreign arrangements that remain make December a difficult deadline. 
Internally, East Germany must still reconstitute the five former states abolished by the Communists in 1953, and the two Germanys must still reconcile their legal systems, property laws and the differences developed over four decades. Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere of East Germany has called for a second treaty between the Governments to cover those issues before unification.
The Germanys must also reach agreement with the four victorious World War II Allies - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France - in the ''two plus four'' talks on German unity.
 
November Accord Sought
The talks are being held to end the four powers' occupation rights in Germany and to devise new security arrangements for Central Europe. The two Germanys have said that whatever the legalities of the situation, they do not want to proceed with unification without four-power approval.
Bonn hopes to reach an agreement in time to present it to the 35 nations of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe for endorsement by November, but negotiations with Moscow over compensation for the loss of East Germany as an ally have been difficult.
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany held his eighth round of talks in two months today with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union, and they will meet again on Friday at a foreign ministers' session of the two-plus-four talks in Berlin.
Mr. Kohl, however, declared at a conference of his Christian Democratic party in Bonn earlier today that 1990 would be ''the year of German unity.''
His party set Oct. 1 as the formal date to merge with the Christian Democrats in East Germany, who are led by Mr. de Maiziere. The Social Democrats and the small Free Democrats have also set dates next fall to merge with their East German counterparts.
Mr. Kohl's prediction that all-German elections can be held in December draws on several developments in the Germanys that give a sense of momentum.
 
Vote Expected This Week
The Parliaments of both Germanys are to vote this week on the treaty, signed last month, uniting their currencies and economies as of July 1. The move is the first big step toward merging the two countries.
The legislatures are also scheduled to pass matching resolutions on Tuesday renouncing any designs on German territories ceded to Poland after World War II, a measure that will clear one of the foreign obstacles to unity.
The most formidable obstacle, however, is the Soviet Union's concern over its economic and military security once East Germany is out of its sphere.
As before, Mr. Genscher and Mr. Shevardnadze gave little indication of the substance of their talks, but the frequency and intensity of the meetings suggest that they are working hard to fashion a compromise, possibly in time for the next session of the two-plus-four talks on Friday.
The most immediate reason for Mr. Kohl's optimism was apparently the debate he witnessed on Sunday in the East German Parliament on an unexpected motion to proceed immediately to unification. The motion was diverted to a committee by a large majority, but the debate revealed a readiness in East Germany and in the West to move up actual unification.
 
Optimism and Caution
Mr. Kohl said his visit to East Berlin left him ''with the firm impression that the wish exists there to vote with the Federal Republic.''
Mr. de Maiziere has been more cautious than Mr. Kohl on the possibility of unity in December. He noted yesterday that East Germany must still reconstitute the former states, which were abolished by the Communists in 1952, and to prepare a second treaty on the conditions of unification.
Mr. Genscher and Mr. Shevardnadze met for six hours in the town hall of Munster in keeping with their effort to hold their talks in cities with symbolic significance for their endeavor. The Munster town hall is where the peace accord ending the Thirty Years' War was signed in 1648. Last week, the two ministers met in Brest, where the Germans first invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.
The negotiations between the Germans and the Soviets have become the focal point of the two-plus-four talks, in which the participants are working to lift the last vestiges of military occupation and to resolve the place of a united Germany in the European security structure.
Mr. Shevardnadze said the meeting was constructive and useful, but added: ''I don't want to create the impression that everything proceeded smoothly, that all outstanding issues were resolved. Some thorny problems remain.''
The Germans are rumored to be preparing a major package of financial aid, trade and security guarantees to gain Soviet support for unification.
Mr. Genscher intimated that one of the items under discussion was a form of agreement between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, possibly a non-aggression treaty.
''It is important that we try in this area for a new definition of the relations of the members of the two alliances toward each other,'' he said. ''That might happen in a joint declaration. That might happen in a treaty-like agreement.''
Moscow has objected to letting a united Germany belong exclusively to the North Atlantic alliance, and the West has rejected a Soviet counterproposal to have Germany belong to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

HEADLINE: Probation Overload;
Glutted Probation System Puts Communities in Peril

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
Local and Federal probation systems, overwhelmed by the increase in drug-related crimes, are changing in ways that experts say are making communities less safe.
Probation departments have become seriously understaffed just as they are being relied on more heavily than at any point in their history; probation, rather than prison, is by far the most prevalent form of punishment.
Probation officers have become less and less involved in their traditional counseling and supervison roles, more akin to social work, and are more consumed with law enforcement, tracking down those who have violated the terms of their freedom. #1,000 Criminals to an Officer In New York last year, almost 38 percent of the criminals who had been given probation were sent to prison for violating rules, mostly for new crimes. Five years ago, 26 percent of the probationers were sent to prison for violations. 
In interviews, judges, prosecutors, probation officers, legal experts and probationers said the combination of these circumstances had become a serious community problem, particularly in neighborhoods with high concentrations of drug offenders.
''There is not a probation department in the nation that is adequately staffed to handle the needs of the new high-risk offenders,'' said Cecil Steppe, chief probation officer for San Diego County. This year caseloads in his department are running as high as 700 probationers for each officer, up from last year's high of 400.
Most experienced supervisors say it is not unreasonable to ask an officer to keep track of 30 probationers, but they add that the system begins to become unsafe when the ratio nears 100 to 1. Yet in Los Angeles, which has the nation's biggest probation department, a single officer is expected to handle as many as 1,000 criminals.
''When people say that probation is the alternative to prison, right now they have got it backwards,'' said Mr. Steppe.
 
More and Worse Felons
More than two-thirds of the nation's convicted criminals are now under the supervision of Federal and local probation departments. With drug-linked crimes clogging the judicial system from courtrooms to prison cells, judges are increasingly handing out sentences of years on probation. When a prison sentence does precedes probation, it is often for only a few weeks or months.
Probation systems are handling more felons and hard-core criminals than at any time in history. Although records showing the proportions of various categories of criminals were not kept until recent years, officials said that in the past, very few hard-core criminals were ever given probation. Today, sentences of probation only are sometimes meted out even for brutal offenses like rape and child molestation.
Even as probation departments face increased demands, they are receiving fewer and fewer resources. Their budgets are declining in relation to other segments of the court system. In New York City in 1985, for example, the budget for the Department of Corrections was $302.5 million, and for the Probation Department $30.3 million. Last year, the budget for corrections was $616.9 million, a 103 percent increase; the probation budget had risen just 49 percent, or $45.1 million.
Probation is a period of time under court supervision but not behind bars, imposed by a judge. Parole, by contrast, is granted by a board to a criminal who has served part of a prison sentence. Probationers and parolees are supervised by different departments. The intention of both is to encourage legal behavior by granting freedom to those who are seen as good risks.
Many judges, prosecutors and probation officials say that probation has become the weakest link in the judicial chain and that the public now perceives it as just another word for coddling criminals. Yet the only real alternative, they say, is to spend untold billions of dollars to expand prisons.
 
At the Roots
Tougher Sentences? 'It's a Myth'
In 1988, the latest year for which figures are available, 2.3 million people were on probation, an increase of 5 percent over the year before, according to the Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. About one million were in prison and jails, up 4.3 percent from the previous year. Studies by the Rand Corporation indicate that in the last decade, the population of prisons had increased by 45 percent while the number of those on probation jumped by 75 percent.
The probationers are mostly male, unemployed and in their 20's, and many are illiterate. Their most common offense by far is possessing or selling drugs.
Mr. Steppe and other experts estimate that 70 to 75 percent of the probationers are addicted to drugs or alcohol, yet only a fraction are receiving treatment.
 
Community Safety at Risk
Probation is ''now the dominant place to put drug traffickers and people convicted of drug possession,'' said Mark A. Cuniff, executive director of the National Association of Criminal Justice Planners, a respected Washington organization of administrators and researchers. He added, ''It's a myth that judges are getting tougher and putting more people away.''
Los Angeles County has the largest probation department in the nation, supervising 85,000 people. Barry J. Nidorf, chief probation officer there, said that about 10,000 of the probationers, or 11 percent, are on drug testing and treatment programs. But he said at least 60 percent and perhaps as many as 80 percent of the 85,000 actually need such care because of their addictions.
''If you equate undetected drug use with crimes to support habits, as I do, then it means that community safety is at risk,'' Mr. Nidorf said.
 
Officers Walk Into Crimes
He said about half of the Los Angeles probation population is under the supervision of two-member teams that each handle 2,000 probationers. The ratio is considerably lower for the most dangerous offenders, Mr. Nidorf added, but it is still inadequate. Budget cuts that have been proposed could raise to 85 percent the share of the probationers supervised at the 1,000-to-1 ratio, Mr. Nidorf said.
Probation officers report that they are increasingly walking into the middle of criminal acts in the course of their duties. Counselors making house calls in most cities routinely enter dangerous neighborhoods and crack dens. New York probation officers chasing a probationer recently saw him drop a kilogram of crack.
 
At the Federal Level
Supervision Suffers As Jobs Multiply
In the Federal probation system, not only are caseloads higher and the probationers more dangerous, but nearly a dozen laws enacted in the last eight years have also broadened the role of officers, who are now required to perform many functions beyond merely supervising criminals.
A report last year by the Federal courts' Administrative Office concluded, ''The probation system cannot adequately fulfill with existing resources all the responsibilities that the Congress has imposed upon it by statute.'' and it cited ''increasing security risks to the community.''
Matters have become worse since the report was issued, said Judge Edward R. Becker of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia. Judge Becker is the chairman of the Committee on Criminal Law and Probation Administration of the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body of the Federal judiciary.
''It is one of the most significant problems that the judiciary faces,'' Judge Becker said in an interview. ''The probation system has been neglected for too long.''
One of the Federal system's most time consuming and newly redefined tasks, investigating convicts and preparing detailed reports for judges before sentencing, often takes priority over supervision of criminals.
''When the system gets overloaded with investigative work, supervision on the street suffers,'' said Donald L. Chamlee, chief of the Probation Division of the United States Courts in Washington. He added that probation officers had conducted more than 148,000 investigations in the last year.
 
At the Local Level
Morale Plummets As Caseloads Rise
As a consequence of exploding work loads, increased danger and a squeeze on resources, probation departments across the nation are reporting low morale and high turnover.
''We don't have enough money and we don't have enough experience and we just can't do the job with what they give us,'' said Dominic Colluccio, an 18-year veteran of the New York probation department who is now the union president for the probation officers. ''No one is here long enough to know what they are doing.''
With starting salaries for probation officers of from $23,480 to $26,327, and eventual advancement of $2,300 possible in 10 years, probation officers in New York have little incentive to stay in the jobs. Nor do they elsewhere.
A 1990 study for the Justice Department by the National Association of Criminal Justice Planners found that the average salary for probation officers is $21,800, and the average for the highest grade of officer is $33,500.
Moreover, the jobs are clearly more demanding than they used to be. Mr. Colluccio said that 15 years ago, more than two-thirds of the probation population in New York consisted of people convicted of misdemeanors and three-quarters of those who violated probation would be sent to jail.
Now, 73 percent are felony offenders and fewer than two-thirds of those who violate their probation rules are ordered to serve jail time.
 
At the Street Level
Deceit and Danger In the Bronx
Emblematic of the morale problems facing probation offices everywhere are the experiences of a corps of special officers in the Bronx.
One unit of 12 officers who specialize in drug-addicted criminals share a single cramped room in which they interview and counsel more than 800 probationers.
''Counseling is a joke in the sense that you have 5 to 10 minutes with each person and you have to fill out forms to the extent that there is never enough time to follow through,'' said Officer Carlos Ramirez.
On a recent day, three officers from another special unit, whose members make home counseling visits, talked with Shon S., a 17-year-old about to marry his girlfriend. He could not spell the name of his 13-month-old stepdaughter. Shon S. had been convicted of threatening a child with a pellet gun and demanding money. He was using two to three vials of crack a day last fall when the crime occurred, and when he was placed on probation, he was ordered to attend one of the few treatment programs available.
 
Sniffles? Allergies, He Says
Thin and boyish, Shon S. told the officers that his sniffles were from allergies. Since his sentencing, he admitted, he had stopped attending treatment. That is a probation violation, but the officers did not order him back into court, primarily because he had not been violent.
A third special unit spends its time tracking down probationers who are suspected of commiting more crimes. These officers venture into neighborhoods where crack is widely used and prowl through the urine stench of ominous apartment buildings. The officers catch about 20 violators a week.
The vast majority of those who are caught are released again by the end of the day. With the jails so overcrowded, if they have not committed a major crime, the mere fact that they did not abide by the conditions of probation is no longer good enough reason to hold them.
''Catching them is like throwing dirt in the wind,'' said Miguel Ibarra, who heads the squad and like the others carries a guns and wears a bulletproof vest. ''You finally get 2 and then there are 15 more folders waiting on your desk.''
 
At the Policy Level
Prosecutions Grow, But Not Budgets
Despite the conditions in probation departments, lawmakers and Federal and state officials say it is more politically attractive to seek resources for prosecutors, judges and prisons than to seem soft on crime by proposing more support for probation.
Indeed, President Bush's national drug control strategy includes ambitious goals for prosecutions, prisons and judges, but makes no mention of probation.
At the local level, too, the inability of probation departments to attract resources is causing frustration.
''There is a gap between what we're perceived as doing and what we actually do,'' said Catherine M. Abate, the commissioner of the New York City Probation Department, the nation's second largest.
''People perceive us as soft even as we fill a dual role of law enforcement and counseling,'' she said. ''What is not recognized by the public is that society does not have the resources to continue to build more prisons for the growing number of people it is prosecuting.''

HEADLINE: Rinfret's Record: New Scrutiny for Candidate

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET with KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Ever since party leaders seeking a gubernatorial nominee plucked his name from the address book of a New York Republican loyalist, Pierre A. Rinfret has portrayed himself as a renowned economist who has advised four Presidents and breezily turned down offers to join the Cabinet.
But for two decades, Mr. Rinfret has also fought criticism that he is equal parts showman and sage, and an examination of his record shows that some claims he has made about his political and educational experience are indeed exaggerated.
 
Echo of a Debate
Some former Nixon Administration officials disputed Mr. Rinfret's suggestions that he had been a major adviser to the President, and none remembered him being offered Cabinet positions.
And while he never earned a doctorate, the economic forecaster has long claimed the title ''Dr. Rinfret,'' using it in resumes, legal documents and 10 times in his political biography.
These discrepancies echo a debate about Mr. Rinfret's qualifications and character that began almost from the moment he joined the small fraternity of economists whose projections and opinions make news. 
 
A Theatrical Style
Mr. Rinfret's positions on the issues facing the state are little-known, and he says he has not yet had time to develop many. But his background is sure to come under greater scrutiny now that he has taken his first shot at elected office, as standard-bearer in the New York Republican Party's bid to unseat Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The portrait of Mr. Rinfret that emerges from interviews with his associates in business and politics is that of a tough-talking economist trusted by leading corporations, a theatrical speaker who may give the Governor a run for his oratorical money and a multimillionaire businessman with a knack for marketing and a style so bruising he has taken relatives and friends to court.
But some of Mr. Rinfret's fellow economists say his salesmanship and flair for self-promotion outshine his professional skills.
''A criticism that would most frequently be made is that he is very colorful, but he is a little more sound and fury than substance,'' said Paul W. McCracken, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Nixon Administration.
John P. Sears, a former campaign manager for President Ronald Reagan, described Mr. Rinfret as a ''good salesman.'' But he added, ''He's not looked upon in his field as someone who is an in-depth, researched thinker, but rather as someone who can take a quick look at something and give you an opinion.''
Milton Friedman, the economist, who, like Mr. Rinfret, advised President Richard M. Nixon, recalled Mr. Rinfret as ''kind of a wild man. He tended to go to extremes with whatever his views were.''
Mr. Rinfret - who is generally described as a supply sider who is skeptical of regulatory agencies - insists that any criticism stems from his outspokenness in a profession noted for its smugness and domination by what he has called ''the little gray men.'' His ability to deal with the state's growing budget problems, he says, stems from his business background, including his success in building an international consulting and commodities firm.
''I really believe the state is in trouble,'' Mr. Rinfret said. Describing his race against Mr. Cuomo, he said, ''Cuomo is Teflon, fine. Watch me take the Teflon off him.''
'Robert Allen, a Texas businessman, said he remains a fan of Mr. Rinfret's even though the candidate once took him to court for failing to pay a bill. ''He's aggressive and he asserts his will. He's a very persuasive, expansive guy.''
''He has much more of an acting quality than most economists,'' said Kenneth Lipper, a former New York City Deputy Mayor who has watched Mr. Rinfret at speaking engagments. ''He's a witty, unholy speaker. He can't win, but if he doesn't get too weird, he can do damage to Cuomo.''
 
As an Economist
A Blunt Mixture Of News and Views
During the 1950's and early 1960's, Mr. Rinfret learned the trade of economic consulting with Lionel D. Edie, a pioneer in the business.
Mr. Rinfret was hired by Mr. Edie in 1951 as a $5,750-a-year junior economist. He said Mr. Edie, president of the company, took him on as a protege and became like a father to him.
In July 1963, shortly before Mr. Edie died, Mr. Rinfret took over as chairman of the business. Mr. Rinfret left Edie & Company in 1966 to form his own consulting business, Rinfret-Boston Associates. Mr. Edie had died and Mr. Rinfret said he had a falling out with other principals in the company.
Most of the stock in Mr. Rinfret's new business was owned by The Boston Company, a holding company. Mr. Rinfret eventually bought control of the whole company and began operating it as Rinfret, Inc., which has grown into a group of consulting and financial-futures trading firms with offices in New York and Switzerland. Mr. Rinfret is its president.
Although Mr. Rinfret had earned a reputation in the industry, he did not become widely known until 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson, seeking to promote the economic benefits of a tax cut, cited one of his forecasts in a televised speech.
Like most economic forecasters, Mr. Rinfret's success rate has been mixed.
In 1961, he correctly forecast an economic downturn. In the 1970's, just before the nation's economy went into recession, he predicted that there would not be one.
More recently, in early 1988, Mr. Rinfet incorrectly predicted that a recession was imminent. But he says that in October of that year, just before the stock market collapsed, he warned his clients of trouble on Wall Street.
Mr. Rinfret, who lives in a Park Avenue apartment that he said may be worth as much as $12 million, works out of cluttered offices on Lexington Avenue. There he trades in what he calls ''economic intelligence'' - a mix of census data, government reports and the remarks of political leaders in newspaper articles or interviews conducted by him or one of his two dozen employees. He analyzes the information, prints it in a newsletter and sells it to major corporations at a price he will only say is ''expensive.''
Back in the 1960's, it was reported that some of his corporate clients were paying as much as $50,000 a year for his newsletter and special research requests.
''We try to meld politics, finance, economics, history and sociology into a comprehensible whole,'' said Mr. Rinfret, who sits on the board of five major corporations - Revlon Inc., the Revlon Group, Brunswick Corporation, Bally Manufacturing Corporation and Abitibi-Price Inc., of Canada.
He also makes use of his political connections. In one recent issue of ''Rinfret. Intelligence on the world,'' the economist said his analysis of the Federal deficit was based on ''a point about Federal revenues'' passed on to him by Martin Anderson, an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan. In another, he said he knew about the Johnson Administration's budget policies because ''I was there.''
The language in Mr. Rinfret's newsletter is often blunt. ''The American people don't give a damn about the Federal deficit,'' the newsletter reported in May.
In a business that relies on contacts and reputation, Mr. Rinfret's name is important to him. Last year he filed a lawsuit charging that his nephew, Paul Rinfret, had no right to start a trading firm with ''Rinfret'' in the title. The suit, one of two against family members, is pending in Federal court in Manhattan.
 
Personal Background
When Is a Degree A Doctorate?
Though he now favors antique rifles and expensive sailboats, Mr. Rinfret said he grew up poor, one of six children. A native of Montreal who moved to New York City at age 4 1/2, he said he lived in Hell's Kitchen and that his father was a struggling salesman who had trouble making the rent.
Mr. Rinfret said he showed an early knack for science, and worked his way through school.
Despite his passion for biology, Mr. Rinfret said he did not enter the field because there was not enough money in it.''You know what a biologist made in 1945 or 1946?'' he said in an interview. ''If you got $15 a week you were lucky.''
He eventually received bachelor's and master's degrees in business from New York University after serving in an infantry division in World War II. He said he once took on a machine gun nest and singlehandedly captured 14 German soldiers. He received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
After the war, Mr. Rinfret won a Fulbright Fellowship and used it to study political economics at the University of Dijon. He left a year and a half later with a Diplome d'Etudes Superieures, which University officials say is the equivalent of an American master's degree.
Shortly after returning to the United States, Mr. Rinfret said, he contacted the French consulate in New York City and was told by an attache that he could refer to the degree as a doctorate of political economy. Indeed, Mr. Rinfret has often described himself in documents as holding a doctorate, including his in signed filing with the National Futures Association, which regulates commodities traders.
But last week, officials at the University of Dijon said Mr. Rinfret would have had to study at least four more years and complete a lengthy dissertation to win the French equivalent of a doctorate. And Axel Nesme, acting cultural attache at the French Consulate in New York, said ''it is a little bit erroneous for him to claim he has a doctorate.''
Mr. Rinfret said in an interview last Friday that he recognizes that ''there is an equivalency problem. You get different answers from different people. I do not deny that.''
But he said that even if the Dijon doctorate does not count, he can claim a doctorate because of the honorary degree he received in 1973 from Pepperdine, a private university in Malibu, Calif.
''I checked this with my counsel years and years ago,'' Mr. Rinfret said. ''I said, 'Does this give me the right to call myself doctor if I want to do that?'
 
And he said, 'Absolutely.' ''
Sherry Harris, senior editor of publications for the American Council on Education, said recipients of honorary degrees do not normally use them in their titles.
''The traditional rule is only an earned Ph.D. or a medical degree qualifies,'' she said. ''Some people do affect it. But it is an affectation.''
 
In Politics
'Mr. President, I'm Not Interested'
Since being nominated on May 30, Mr. Rinfret has described himself as a political insider who advised four Presidents - John F. Kennedy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nixon and Mr. Reagan.
In his acceptance speech at the State Republican Convention, Mr. Rinfret said he was ''offered the equivalent of three Cabinet posts'' by Mr. Nixon. He has subsequently said that the Nixon Administration also offered him the ambassadorship to India and the position of trade representative to the Soviet Union.
In an interview last week, Mr. Rinfret expanded on his ties to the Nixon Administration, saying Mr. Nixon personally offered him jobs as his Secretary of Commerce in 1972 and as a member of his Council of Economic Advisers in 1968. Additionally, he said, two aides to Mr. Nixon asked whether he would be interested in becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1971.
Describing the offer to be Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Rinfret, an enthusiastic raconteur, recalled that he was standing near a podium, waiting to give a speech, when he was told that he had a phone call from the President.
''He said, 'Pierre, you know the Secretary of Commerce position is open. Might that interest you?' I said, 'Mr. President, what's the Secretary of Commerce do?' He said, 'I don't know.' I said, 'Mr. President, you don't know?' He said, 'Well, doesn't he add up the G.N.P. or something like that?' I said, 'Mr. President, I'm not interested in adding up the G.N.P.' ''
Mr. Rinfret said Mr. Nixon then asked if he would be interested in being ambassador to India. ''I said, 'Mrs. Rinfret doesn't like Indian food,' '' he recalled, smiling at the tale.
Mr. Nixon did not respond to several telephone messages left at his office. But several top aides in his Administration, including John D. Ehrlichman, the chief domestic policy adviser; Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally; Peter M. Flanigan, a presidential assistant; and two chairmen of his Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. McCracken and Herbert Stein, said they did not know that Mr. Rinfret had been seriously considered for any Cabinet positions.
 
A 'Passing' Enthusiasm
In his memoirs, Mr. Ehrlichman said Mr. Rinfret was ''only a passing and very controversial enthusiasm'' for Secretary of the Treasury job in 1971, which eventually went to Mr. Connally.
Several Nixon aides said Mr. Rinfret did occasionally have the ear of the President. But one top Nixon adviser, who asked not to be identified, said Mr. Nixon and his advisers consulted Mr. Rinfret ''to placate him,'' because Mr. Rinfret was prone to criticizing the Administration publicly.
''I think the concern was that he would go make speeches to forums and make predictions about the economy and the world,'' said the Nixon aide. ''Nixon was concerned about him becoming an active enemy.''
But William Safire, a columnist for The New York Times and a former Nixon aide, said he recalls that Mr. Rinfret was indeed offered a job on the Council of Economic Advisers after Mr. Nixon's election in 1968. And, by Mr. Safire's account, Mr. Nixon valued Mr. Rinfret's economic advice.
Describing his ties to the Reagan Administration, Mr. Rinfret said that Mr. Anderson, then a top campaign aide, asked him in 1979 to become the chief domestic policy adviser to Mr. Reagan. A 'Roaring Fight'? By Mr. Rinfret's account, the offer was extended after he and Mr. Reagan had a ''roaring fight'' over tax policy in a meeting that he said was set up by Mr. Sears, the campaign manager, and attended by Mr. Anderson.
Both Mr. Anderson and Mr. Sears said Mr. Rinfret was never offered such a formal campaign role, and Mr. Anderson said he recalls the meeting between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Rinfret as ''a normal spirited discussion.''
Mr. Rinfret said he had never considered running for office until a week before the State Republican Convention, when the party was still desperately seeking a standard bearer. It was then that State Senator Roy M. Goodman, the Republican leader of Manhattan, asked Laurence C. Leeds, an investment banker and Republican district leader, to scan his personal telephone book in search of names.
''When I was going through my address book and got to the R's, I said, 'Roy, we've got it,' '' Mr. Leeds said.
Mr. Goodman recalled: ''I said, 'My gosh. I just saw him last week and didn't think about him. But he might do it.' ''
''I called him,'' Mr. Goodman went on, ''and two and a half minutes later the fat was on the fire.''

HEADLINE: LATIN LEADERS GET NEW U.S. AID PLAN

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANTIGUA, Guatemala, June 18

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today gave the five Central American Presidents the bare outlines of a plan to marshal and coordinate international aid to this poverty-ravaged region.
Mr. Baker made his plan public at the end of a three-day regional summit meeting, the eighth in a four-year series. The meeting, coming as all Central American wars but El Salvador's have been stilled, was the first devoted to development and not to the fighting throughout the region.
''The bottom line, I think, is this: Central America is poised as never before to consolidate democracy, achieve lasting peace and disarmament and create conditions for growth and opportunity in which all of the people of this region, particularly the poor, can share,'' Mr. Baker said at the end of his nine-hour stay here. 
 
U.S. Policy Review
Mr. Baker's trip, arranged at the last minute, follows a review of Washington's Latin American policy, ordered by the White House. American officials have said the order reflects a desire by President Bush to become more involved in Latin America.
Under the American aid plan, the developed countries and international donors and institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund would cooperate to support political and economic changes throughout the region.
While privately voicing sharp criticism, the Presidents publicly welcomed Mr. Baker's proposal. ''We look at it with happy eyes, much pleasure and much hope,'' Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador said, speaking for the five Presidents.
President Rafael Calderon Jr. of Costa Rica, speaking in an interview before a private meeting with Mr. Baker, said: ''The U.S. is taking the lead to getting aid from the world for Central America. That's very important. We all celebrated it.''
The plan as described to the Presidents by Mr. Baker was vaguer than a draft circulated by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleberger at a recent Organization of American States meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, and appeared to differ substantially from it.
Under the proposal, modeled after a plan to channel aid to the developing democracies of Eastern Europe, the United States would be the group's secretary. The United States, Japan and the European Community, possibly joined by Venezuela, would serve as co-chairmen of the group.
 
Old Resentments Aggravated
In the only public criticism of the plan by one of the Presidents, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala said Central America should run the show. ''The executive secretary should be a Central American,'' he said after breakfast with Mr. Baker.
But President Cerezo, the host of the meeting and the senior Central American leader, said the Presidents had no time to raise the issue with Mr. Baker at their hourlong breakfast at the Ramada Inn. ''We're going to discuss it later,'' he said.
The idea of an American secretary for the aid group aggravated old resentments of the United States.
While the region's leaders may publicly praise the United States as ''the leader of the free world,'' they also privately blame it for worsening the sharp social inequities and civil wars that have plagued the area in the last decade and led to an economic crisis.
Some Presidents and their senior aides said they suspected that Mr. Baker's plan was little more than a thinly disguised effort to continue dictating developments while taking advantage of declining tensions to reduce sharply the American financial burden.
''It's not fair that those who finance a regional conflict should be the ones to enjoy the benefits of peace,'' said a Guatamalan development expert who attended the summit meeting in Antigua, 30 miles west of Guatemala City. ''The peace dividend shouldn't just go to the suppliers of weapons.''
Although many people in the region are living in worse conditions than a decade ago, United States aid to the region dropped this year to a total of $565 million from $702 million last year.
After the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua lost elections in February, Congress approved a special $300 million Nicaraguan aid package, raising this year's total bill to almost $900 million. At the same time, Congress allocated $300 million to Panama, which traditionally is considered a part of South America but which was an observer at the summit meeting, attended by the Presidents of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua.
 
No Cut in Commitment
''Peace looks like it's coming to Central America and as Frank Sinatra used to say, 'I've done it my way,' '' said a development official, who described the Baker plan as an American effort to cut costs.
But the Presidents reported that Mr. Baker had repeatedly said his plan would not lead to any reduction in United States commitment to the region. The leaders said the Secretary told them that the money would ''complement'' rather than replace aid. In response to concerns that the United States would be secretary of the group, he assured them that the structure of the organization could be negotiated.

HEADLINE: Japan to Help Clean Mexican Air

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 18

 BODY:
Japan said today that it would provide $850 million in loans to Mexico to help battle air pollution there. It will be Tokyo's first expenditure from a $2 billion fund intended to help poorer countries deal with environmental problems.
The Government took the occasion of a visit from President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico to announce a series of loans. The loans are to be used to remove sulfur from heavy fuel oil and diesel fuel burned in Mexico; to produce lead-free gasoline, and to refurbish locomotives to improve the cargo-handling capacity of Mexico's rail system, reducing the number of trucks in Mexico City. 
 
Loans at Low Rates
Part of the money will come in the form of loans by the Export-Import Bank, which is trying to send some of Japan's huge trade surplus to poorer countries. The interest to be paid by heavily indebted Mexico will be far less than that paid on ordinary loans.
Japan's efforts are an attempt to resolve two international problems: resentment for amassing hundreds of billions of dollars in trade surpluses in recent years, and criticism that Japanese companies have pursued environmentally unsound practices, such as financing logging operations in some parts of South America and Southeast Asia that destroy rain forests.
 
Pledge Last December
The Government initially announced its intention to help improve the environment in poorer countries last summer at the economic summit meeting in Paris. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu visited Mexico last September, and pledged to make the first such loans to the Latin American country.
In a speech here today, President Salinas was frank about Mexico's problems, but he made a strong appeal for more Japanese investment. Mexico is discussing a free trade pact with the United States, similar to a pact the United States already has with Canada.
Given that such an agreement would open the Mexican and American markets to each other, President Salinas hinted that Japanese companies might find it attractive to use Mexico as a gateway to North America.

HEADLINE: Mandela Urges Canadians to Maintain Sanctions

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 18

 BODY:
Nelson R. Mandela appealed today to the Canadian Parliament to continue economic sanctions against South Africa.
''As an expression of humanity, and not as an act of charity, we ask you to walk the last mile with us,'' Mr. Mandela told a joint session of the House of Commons and Senate in Ottawa, which accorded him prolonged ovations before and after his address. It was a theme that the African National Congress leader is expected to repeat when he arrives in the United States on Wednesday. 
Introducing the 71-year-old anti-apartheid leader, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said that Canada, long a leader in the push for international isolation of South Africa, should not relax the trade and economic sanctions it imposed against the Pretoria Government's racial policies.
Some countries, notably Britain, have argued that sanctions should be eased to reward President F. W. de Klerk for his moves to dismantle apartheid and to encourage whites in South Africa to continue supporting racial liberalization.
Since taking office last year, Mr. de Klerk has freed Mr. Mandela, legalized his organization, the African National Congress, and moved to end segregation of hospitals, parks and other public facilities. But more fundamental issues, like residential and school segregation and the white-dominated political system, remain to be resolved.
''Apartheid in all its repugnance is still the law in South Africa,'' Mr. Mulroney said. ''At this critical juncture, the Government of Canada believes the way to advance the progress toward democracy is to maintain the sanctions.'' $4.3 Million for Repatriation He said tonight that his Government would also donate the equivalent of $4.3 million to a new fund for repatriating African National Congress supporters living in exile.
For Mr. Mandela, who was released from jail four months ago after serving 27 1/2 years for political offenses, the visit here has been an occasion to measure the esteem in which he is held around the world. He flew to Ottawa from London on Sunday aboard a Canadian Government executive jet dispatched by Mr. Mulroney. Together with his wife, Winnie, he was greeted at the Ottawa airport by the Prime Minister, other senior ministers and a scarlet-jacketed guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
After his speech to Parliament today he flew to Toronto, where tens of thousands people gathered in front of the provincial legislature to hear him. Mr. Mandela had canceled another appearance in Toronto earlier in the day, complaining of fatigue. But he showed no sign of tiredness as he spoke.
He is scheduled to visit Montreal on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he will continue his six-week foreign tour by flying to New York.
The highlight of his Canadian visit was the speech to Parliament, an honor usually granted only to visiting heads of state or government. He began his address by thanking the legislators for ''allowing us, who were outcasts only yesterday'' to speak in a place dedicated to the principle that people should govern themselves.
''The fact that we have not had the opportunity to do the same thing in our own country, even as guests, emphasizes the iniquity of apartheid,'' Mr. Mandela said. He praised Canada for its anti-apartheid role in the United Nations and in the Commonwealth, the group of nations that were formerly colonies of Britain.

HEADLINE: TRIAL FOR BARRY IS READY TO BEGIN

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
After five months of legal maneuvering, defense and prosecution lawyers finally chose a jury today to hear the Federal Government's drug case against Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. The panel will be sworn in Tuesday, then hear opening statements.
The selection of the 12-person jury, with six alternates, took less than an hour in Courtroom 2 of United States District Court here. But it was a measure of the charged legal, political and racial nature of the Barry case that it took lawyers on both sides more than two weeks of preliminary questioning of more than 150 prospective jurors to reach that point. 
 
Panel Mostly Black and Female
For their efforts, they ended up with a panel of Mr. Barry's peers, including alternates, that is mostly black, middle-aged and female. As is usually the practice, those who are alternates will not be identified until final arguments have been heard.
Of the 18 prospective jurors, 15 are women, 13 are black and five are white. Among them are a hospital clerk, a hospital administrator, a clerk in the city Employment Department, an accountant in the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, a history teacher at a private school and an art gallery manager. Two are unemployed.
As soon as the final juror had been chosen, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered all 18 sequestered in a local hotel. He said more than a month ago that he did not want to risk any juror's being influenced by news reports or rumors during the trial, which he called ''highly charged.''
Mayor Barry, who faces 14 counts of using drugs and lying about it, has denied using illegal drugs but has been treated for addiction to prescription drugs and alcohol. He contends he is a victim of overzealous, vindictive prosecutors.
Last week he said that while he planned to go through with his trial and expected to be vindicated, he nevertheless would not seek re-election because both he and the city needed to ''heal'' as a result of his troubles.
His detractors say his announcement as a ploy to curry favor with jurors. The Mayor's chief defense lawyer is R. Kenneth Mundy. On the prosecution side will be Richard Roberts and Judith Retchin, assistants to the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, Jay B. Stephens, who is not expected to particiaate actively in the trial.
Mayor Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of possessing cocaine and 3 felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use. He also faces a single misdemeanor charge that he conspired on at least 20 different occasions with at least 10 different people to obtain and use drugs.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 26 years in prison and fined $1,850,000.

HEADLINE: Wary Negotiators Nearing Crossroads in Budget Talks

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
This may be the week something finally happens in the budget talks between Congress and the White House.
If it isn't, it ought to be, say lawmakers and officials of the Bush Administration who have spent the last month examining every possible permutation of the budget but have not agreed on even the size of the deficit, let alone how to cut it.
''Why are people in that room?'' asked Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip. ''Mostly because they couldn't get out of it. The President's men decided it was time to have a summit, Republicans are there because they like to be accommodating to the President, and Democrats are there because they couldn't say no.'' 
When the negotiators reconvene on Tuesday they will hear from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on how a 25 percent cut in ships, planes and troops would translate into savings in the military budget over the next five years. Mr. Cheney is expected to outline deeper cuts for the Army and Air Force than those services have suggested in their own budget plans, while making more modest cuts in the Navy.
 
Back to the Starting Point
Tuesday will also be the first time the negotiators broach the subject of taxes as part of their noncommittal review. An update by the Congressional Budget Office on the economy and projections for the 1991 deficit will complete the review, bringing the negotiators to precisely where they started a month ago: haggling about who will make the first offer so that real bargaining can begin.
''Like Yogi Berra said, when you reach the crossroads, take it,'' said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee. ''The pressure is on both Republicans and Democrats from our colleagues to either get this thing moving or find a way to diplomatically get out of it. We're operating on a fuse that probably lasts until the July break.''
As far as Democrats are concerned, the first move is up to the Administration. What they expect is an Administration proposal showing the spending cuts and tax increases that would be needed to slash $45 billion to $60 billion from the deficit in the fiscal year 1991 and at least that much in each of the next five years.
''We are very wary invitees to this dance,'' said Senator Wyche Fowler Jr., a Georgia Democrat who is a member of the negotiating team. ''They are going to have to show us.''
Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee, said the maneuvering to get a deficit package would be trickier than that. ''I think the shaping of the plan is going to have to be without attribution,'' he said. ''People have talked about an immaculate conception, but I think this conception is going to be very untidy.''
Politics aside, the budget arithmetic is daunting. The estimate the negotiators are to receive this week from the Congressional Budget Office is expected to show a deficit of about $140 billion, requiring spending cuts and tax increases of up to $76 billion to reach the $64 billion deficit ceiling for 1991 imposed by the budget-balancing law.
None of those figures account for the cost of operating the Federal agency that administers the bailout of failed savings and loan institutions or removing the surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund from the calculation of the deficit, two thorny issues the negotiators will also have to settle.
If the deficit reduction numbers are staggering, the alternative could be worse. The budget-balancing law imposes automatic spending cuts, half in military programs and half in domestic programs, if lawmakers and the Administration cannot come to an agreement by October. Richard G. Darman, the Director of Management and Budget, is expected to outline the extent of such automatic cuts and how they would fall on individual programs when he presents the Administration's midyear economic forecast on July 15.
 
'Pain and Heartache' Predicted
Mr. Panetta calls that presentation ''the kickoff of the doomsday machine,'' but other negotiators say it may take a few months of living with the automatic cuts to force decisions on paring popular programs like Social Security and raising taxes.
''The pain and heartache that will go into those decisions is such that Congress will not do it until after the November election,'' said Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.
Most of the other negotiators say a solution has to come sooner than that, and Mr. Cheney's review may prove at least a partial icebreaker. The Defense Secretary has already told the negotiators that the 25 percent cut in ships, troops and aircraft over five years will not reduce Pentagon spending in 1991 much beyond the $3 billion envisioned in the budget that the Administration presented in January. But the chairmen of the budget and armed services committees say the savings could be twice to three times that much.
Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Comittee, has completed an analysis of the 25 percent reduction in ships, troops and planes. His analysis shows that substantial cuts in spending can be achieved over five years, depending on how the reductions are made.
Mr. Aspin said the most important factor in determining the amount of savings in the military budget was the pace of modernizing weapons.
Mr. Cheney's study is expected to apportion the 25 percent reduction unevenly among the armed services, with the Army and Air Force bearing a larger share of the cuts than the Navy. Administration officials say the study assumes that the number of Army divisions would be cut from 18 to about 12; that air wings, each consisting of 72 planes, would be cut from 36 to about 25, and that the Navy's 14 battle groups would be reduced to 12.
Even if the negotiators' view prevails, they will still be a long way from reaching the deficit reduction goal of $45 billion to $60 billion that Mr. Darman outlined at a recent budget session. Like the lawmakers who have participated in the talks, he said a major concern was selling a package to the rest of Congress.
''We're going through a necessary consultative process because if and when we do something, we have to be able to bring people along,'' he said. ''It's always been the case that we have the option of waiting for a crisis. The trouble with that is that it would be irresponsible.''

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Cuomo The Statesman

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

 BODY:
Mario Cuomo took a traditional step last week to show that he is ready for the White House: He made a speech on foreign policy. What he showed is that he has a long way to go before he can be taken seriously as a candidate for President.
The Governor spoke to a dinner of the United Jewish Appeal in New York. His subject was American policy toward Israel - President Bush's policy, which he pictured in extravagant terms as a threat to Israel's survival. 
At the recent summit meeting, Mr. Cuomo said, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev made little progress. But ''they did seem to agree on one thing: that the emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel might be contained or limited.''
How's that again? George Bush agreed with Mikhail Gorbachev on limiting Soviet Jewish emigration? He did not, and he would not. The charge was pure demagogic invention.
Mr. Gorbachev, the Governor went on, ''continues to play the same deadly game the Soviets have played for decades'' in the Middle East. He continues ''to build a web of diplomatic, economic, political, military and intelligence alliances with the most dangerous actors in the region, people who intend to damage and, ultimately, to destroy Israel.''
In fact, Mr. Gorbachev has been reducing Soviet activity and commitments in the Middle East as elsewhere. He rejected Syria's request for massive new weapons supplies. He told the P.L.O. to forget its military dreams and get on the path of peace with Israel. Why would Mario Cuomo want to ignore the facts in favor of a Red scare?
''Our Administration in Washington has sent strong signals indicating a lack of support for the Israeli Government,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
The Administration has been critical of Prime Minister Shamir and his new Likud-based Government for its reluctant attitude toward negotiations. But Governor Cuomo made his charge far broader. He said the Bush Administration was mortally threatening Israel.
''This is not about Likud or Labor or personalities,'' he said. ''It is about Israel herself. It is about Israel's survival. . . .
''The weak support for Likud policies is in fact weak support for the underlying policies that Israeli Governments have evolved over a period of time, going back essentially to the 1967 war.''
Is it possible that Mr. Cuomo sees no difference in Prime Minister Shamir's policies? For 40 years Israel held itself open to negotiate with any Arab partner. Mr. Shamir has turned away from that path, putting up one objection after another to even talking with Palestinians.
The new Shamir Government is pledged to build more Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. It includes extremist parties that want to expel the 800,000 Palestinian residents from the West Bank.
Prime Minister Shamir was ''correct,'' the Governor said, in refusing to give any assurance that Soviet immigrants would not be settled in the occupied territories. Every U.S. Government since 1967 has opposed such settlements. Does Mr. Cuomo want to retreat from that policy? From the American commitment to United Nations Resolution 242, which calls for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories in return for peace and secure borders?
Mr. Cuomo condemned the ''peace process'' supported by President Bush. He said ''it depends on assurances of peace from people still committed to the destruction of Israel.'' In fact, the Bush policy was devoted to getting talks going between Israel and a Palestinian delegation that Israel itself would have to approve. It was an attempt to carry out Mr. Shamir's own plan for talks - which Mr. Shamir then killed.
In this country it is normal, and fair, for a politician to identify with the dreams of different ethnic groups. To pander to extreme nationalist emotions is another matter. Jewish audiences are wise enough to know the difference.
Indeed, the leading American Jewish organizations do not agree with Mr. Cuomo. They are extremely anxious about the power of the far right and religious fundamentalists in the new Israeli Government. They oppose the policies of settlement and permanent occupation. They hope that somehow the peace process -the plan for negotiations - can be revived.
Governor Cuomo should beware of talking loosely on a subject of which he knows so little. Ranting like Ed Koch is not likely to play well in national politics, and it does not become Mario Cuomo.

HEADLINE: Florio Tax Plan Clears Hurdle in Assembly Vote

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 19

 BODY:
The state Assembly late last night passed Gov. Jim Florio's plan to double the income tax for New Jersey's most affluent taxpayers. The vote was the first hurdle in the new Governor's attempt to enact a host of bills that would raise taxes on the wealthy and provide aid to low- and modest-income residents and school districts.
Early today, the Assembly followed up an earlier Senate vote and approved the $12.4 billion budget for fiscal 1991, 11 days before the deadline set by the state Constitution. But to pay for that budget, which includes deep cuts in most state services except welfare and prisons, the Legislature must still pass a number of other new taxes. 
The Senate passed the budget by a 21-17 margin, the Assembly by 44-34.
 
Doubling Highest Bracket
The income-tax vote, 41-36, in the Democratic-controlled Assembly was on a bill that would raise the tax from 3.5 percent to 7 percent for families with incomes of more than $150,000 and single people with incomes of more than $75,000.
Although the bill must still be passed by the Senate, which the Democrats also control, last night's vote represented a major step for Mr. Florio in his agenda of changing - quickly and drastically - the way New Jersey raises and spends money. A group of about a half dozen North Jersey legislators had wavered over the prospect of higher taxes and a new school financing plan that they said would cost suburban areas like theirs heavily.
Under intense pressure from the admininistration, Assemblyman Thomas J. Duch of Garfield and Louis J. Gill of Passaic gave Mr. Florio the 41 votes necessary to pass the tax bill in the 80-member house. But other Democrats, Joseph A. Mecca of Clifton, Neil M. Cohen of Union and Cyril Yannarelli of Paterson, opposed the income tax rise.
The income-tax vote was also the first real test in a week of voting by the Legislature on nearly a dozen proposals crafted by Mr. Florio and his Democratic allies.
The new taxes to support the budget for fiscal 1991 - the fiscal year that begins July 1 - include an increase in the sales tax from 6 to 7 percent and a giant hike in taxes on cigarettes and other tobbacco products, new taxes on alcohol and new taxes on petroleum products.
The second package of legislation includes a new formula for school aid and a $1.2 billion increase in the income tax, and a reduction in property taxes through new rebates of up to $500 for homeowners and renters.
 
Narrowing the Gap
The object of the Florio reforms, the Governor has said, is to narrow the gap in school financing between rich and poor disticts, and to provide property tax relief for homeowners. The administration has said that the state has depended too long on property taxes, which help affluent areas and hinder those with low property values.
The school aid formula and the income tax had been a particular focus of anxiety among Democrats running for re-election next year, particularly the Bergen County legislators, who said their districts had been treated unfairly under the original Florio proposals. The speaker of the Assembly, Joseph Doria, as well as Douglas C. Berman, the state Treasurer and a top Florio strategist, and Steven Perskie, the Governor's chief of staff, spent most of yesterday in private discussions with reluctant legislators.
''We were confident that the legislative leadership was in control of this process,'' Mr. Berman said. ''The results bear us out.''
 
Two-Hour Debate
During more than two hours of debate before the income-tax vote, Reublicans repeatedly attacked the Florio plan as a rebirth of ''tax and spend'' liberalism, at a time when New Jersey is slipping into a recession. The tax plan, they said, would discourage economic growth and force businesses and jobs into other states.
''New Jersey's prosperity is not paved with higher taxes,'' said Assemblyman Robert Franks, a New Providence Republican. ''It's absolutely unfair, inexplicably so.''
The next major test of the Florio program, legislative leaders here said, will be a vote on the school formula by both houses.
Mr. Doria and top administration aides said they hoped to pass the budget, tax and school aid bills by the end of the week.
While legislators met behind closed doors, the Statehouse was surrounded by demonstrators from the New Jersey Education Association, the state's teachers union, which opposes Mr. Florio's plan to shift the payment of pensions from the state to school districts.
Demonstrators carried signs saying ''One term governor,'' and, playing off of the description of Mr. Florio by his critics as Robin Hood, ''Bergen County is not Sherwood Forest.''

HEADLINE: Real-Estate Board Urges Tax Breaks for Business

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
The Real Estate Board of New York proposed a major new tax-incentive program for businesses and developers yesterday, saying that the plan would keep and attract enough jobs and encourage enough investment to more than pay for itself.
In what seemed an expression of a commercial real-estate industry burdened by slackened demand and rising vacancy rates, the board issued nearly 20 recommendations. They included tax credits for businesses that sign long-term leases and create jobs, an expansion of tax breaks for renovations and the shifting of more of the property-tax burden to housing. 
The board, the major real-estate trade organization in the city, argued that its proposals would stimulate enough activity to be ''revenue-neutral.''
 
Given to Dinkins
''I don't think we have proposed outrageous abatements or concepts here,'' the president of the board, Steven Spinola, said at a news conference. ''I think the time is now to start discussing it, rather than wait another year, when we may be in worse shape than we are today.''
Mr. Spinola said the proposal was given to Mayor David N. Dinkins on Thursday. Jeanne Nathan, a spokeswoman for the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, said the administration considered the plan comprehensive and thoughtful and had begun to study it. She also said the administration had asked for a one-year extension of the Industrial and Commerical Incentive Program, which is to expire at the end of the year.
The incentive program phases in tax increases on new or renovated office buildings at different rates in different areas, except for the financial district and the East Side of midtown, which are excluded.
Earlier yesterday, State Senator Franz S. Leichter, Democrat of Manhattan, released his analysis of the program based on a study of 800 applications for incentives that he said would cost nearly $470 million over 10 years. About $250 million of that cost, Mr. Leichter said, went to projects that he asserted would have been built even without subsidies or that had failed to create jobs leading to better positions.
 
Thousands in Tax Credits
Mr. Leichter cited exemptions for luxury hotels, movie theaters and doctors' offices, among other projects, and said, ''Much of this is a gift by the taxpayers of the City of New York, because that development would occur even if there were no benefits whatsoever.''
Under the real-estate board proposal, businesses signing 10-year leases would receive a combined $2,000 state and city tax credit for each worker living in the city or a $1,000 state credit for each employee who is a state resident. In an acknowledgment of the city's fiscal troubles, the credit would be phased in after five years.
A business would receive a credit of $250 a year on the commercial-rent tax for each employee it hired who lives in the city. The rate of that tax would be gradually lowered.
The board called for the incentive program to be extended for four years and for exemptions for renovations in the excluded parts of Manhattan. The plan also proposed other ways to reduce the tax burden on renovations and commercial and loft buildings that are converted to housing.

HEADLINE: Advances Raise Hope For Crops That Grow In Salty Conditions

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AGRICULTURAL scientists say advances in identifying and developing plants that thrive in salt water and salty soils may help alleviate severe food shortages in developing countries.
In the last decade, scientists have domesticated wild plants known as halophytes, which thrive in salt water and are sources of food, fodder and fuel. They have worked to make conventional crops more salt-tolerant through crossbreeding and have developed hybrid species that can repair soils ruined by salinization and supplement food supplies for animals and people.
Farmers are beginning to increase food supplies by growing grasses in the sand dunes of the Nile, and food grains on the coastal dunes near Bhavnagar, India, lands once believed to be too soaked with salt to support crops.
 
Salt-Tolerant Tomatoes
Sweeter, tastier tomatoes and melons made more salt-tolerant through crossbreeding are being grown with drip irrigation in desert settlements in Egypt and Israel. In Pakistan, a hybrid grass called sordan is not only providing food for cattle but also improving soil ruined by poor farming practices so that it can once again grow conventional crops. 
Methods used in these areas can work in Africa and other parts of the third world, the scientists say.
While current research provides a basis of hope for combating food shortages, there are still many unanswered questions and problems in saline agriculture, including the high costs of many methods. Scientists are divided over which aspects of saline agriculture offer the most promise for increasing the food supply in poor nations.
Scientists like Dr. James W. O'Leary, director of the Environmental Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson, say they believe that the most promise lies in the domestication of salt-tolerant plants.
Others, like Dov Pasternak, an agricultural scientist and professor at Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, say that making conventional crops like tomatoes, cotton and melons more salt-tolerant will be more useful.
Researchers at the United States Salinity Laboratory in Riverside, Calif., are studying the genes and development of hybrid plants to create new salt-tolerant species.
Millions of acres of land worldwide are not used for crops because they are too salty or the available water is too salty for irrigation. These lands include coastal deserts where only seawater is available, former farmland with soil that has been ruined by poor irrigation practices and arid areas atop salt lakes or underground brackish water.
Scientists say there is an increasing need to develop saline agriculture as the world's population grow and available farmland decreases.
''There is today big pressure on the semi-arid and arid land of the world - population pressure,'' said Dr. Pasternak. But he added that those countries have saline water that can be used to feed people who are starving in those areas.
''I believe that the knowledge that we have developed can be used in all deserts of the world,'' he said, asserting that every desert has saline water that has not been used to grow crops.
Scientists say that salt has reduced productivity on about 49.4 million acres of the world's irrigated land, threatening the economies of arid countries like Egypt, Iraq and Pakistan, where irrigation is the foundation of agriculture.
A report published in April by the National Research Council listed hundreds of salt-tolerant plants, including grasses, shrubs and trees, that ''could contribute significantly to the developing world's supply of food, fiber, fuel and fodder.''
Dr. O'Leary said many of the plants discussed in the report, like several salt-tolerant grasses that can be used to feed cattle and whose seeds can be used to make bread, could make good crops and bring into use lands that now cannot be used for agriculture.
The report addresses a problem faced by more than a billion people in developing countries who rely on forests for fuelwood but are faced with rapid deforestation. It identifies salt-tolerant shrubs and trees like those belonging to the genus Prosopis or Eucalyptus, that can be grown on salty, marginal lands and can be used for cooking and heating.
Other plants identified in the report include several species of a halophyte called Acacia, found in Australia, which are rich in nutrients and higher in energy, protein and fat than wheat or rice. Aborigines have ground the dry, ripe seeds of these plants to make a coarse flour that can be used to bake bread on hot stones or in the ashes of a fire.
But scientists say several problems remain: the management of such crops requires advanced and carefully planned irrigation, and Dr. O'Leary said the cost of carrying out many crop management programs has not yet been addressed.
''I think a realistic projection would be 10 years for when you will see large-scale planting of halophytes, or in 10 years, halophyte research will be on the junk pile,'' Dr. O'Leary said.
''It's not going to be cheap,'' he said, referring to the high cost of labor and materials like pipes and pumps.
Dr. Pasternak recently abandoned research on halophytes because he has been more successful in increasing the salt tolerance of conventional crops like tomatoes, cotton and some melons and irrigating them with brackish water.
Calling halophytes the answer to the third world food crisis ''is too presumptuous,'' Dr. Pasternak said. ''It has not been proven yet. The only use for halophytes is for forage.'' Dr. Pasternak, using drip irrigation, works primarily with water containing 5,000 to 7,000 parts per million of salt. Seawater contains 35,000 to 38,000 parts per million.
Dr. O'Leary conceded Dr. Pasternak ''is probably right'' in focusing on conventional crops instead of halophytes. But he said it was ''highly unlikely that conventional plants will be adapted to high levels of salinity'' of 10,000 parts per million and above.
 
Drip Irrigation Method
Dr. Pasternak recently completed a project in Egypt where he introduced drip irrigation in sand dunes of the Nile to produce melons out of season. In drip irrigation, instead of periodically wetting an entire field, water is constantly dripped on the soil right around the roots of plants through a hose run along crop rows. This method greatly restricts the amount of water sprayed over an entire field, preventing salt buildup, but it insures that soil around the roots is almost always moist. Dr. Pasternak said the salinity produced tastier and sweeter fruit. Scientists at the United States Agricultural Research Service in Kimberly, Idaho, have worked successfully in Pakistan with a hybrid grass called sordan, which can be used as feed for cattle and can repair damaged land.
 
Repairing Damaged Soil
In Pakistan and other parts of the third world, a major main problem for farmers is the prevalence of lands called sodic. Unlike saline soils, sodic soils no longer have a high concentration of different types of salts of magnesium, sodium, calcium but contain only sodium that has been chemically adsorbed on the clay. This makes the clay too crusty to admit air and water easily, making it unsuitable for growth of crops.
Sordan grass, the result of breeding between a plant called sorghum and Sudan grass, can repair the damage in sodic soils and reclaim the land so that it can once again be used to grow conventional crops.
David L. Carter, director of soil and water management research at the Agricultural Research Service in Kimberly, Idaho, said that sordan ''is going to produce some good forage on these marginal soils and at the same time will reclaim some of these soils for crops for human consumption.''
What the plants do when grown on sodic soils is to release organic acids into the earth through their roots. The organic acids dissolve calcium carbonate, or lime, which is found in most arid lands.
The calcium that is released displaces the sodium left in the soil. The sodium goes into solution and joins with the carbon dioxide from the lime to form sodium bicarbonate. This compound is then washed away by water from rain or irrigation.
After growing sordan on sodic lands for about two years, farmers can often re-use the soil for conventional crops.
 
Crops for Salty and Damaged Soils and Water
 
Tecticornia
This salt-tolerant plant yields seeds that the Australian aborigines grind into a flour that can be used for bread. It grows in coastal mud flats above the normal tidal level.
 
Sordan grass
This grass repairs soil made crusty by sodium compounds. It releases acids that dissolve calcium carbonateto release calcium and carbon dioxide. Calcium displaces sodium in the soil. The sodium dissolves and joins with carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate, which washes away.
 
Source: ''Saline Agriculture'' (National Academy Press); David Carter
 
Using Saline Water, Drop by Drop
In drip irrigation, tubes release controlled amounts of water, most of it into the soil just around the roots of plants. The method allows frequent irrigation to keep the soil almost constantly moist but reduces the total amount of water used. This is especially important when using saline water because it also reduces the amount of salt deposited in the field.

HEADLINE: Dow Down 53.71 to End At 2,882.18

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Stock prices took their worst tumble in five months yesterday, with analysts attributing the fall to heavy computer program selling, a weak bond market and renewed worry over corporate profits and the interest-rate outlook.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.71 points, to 2,882.18, with 12 blue-chip issues in the 30-stock index showing losses of a point or more.
The 1.83 percent drop was the Dow's worst one-day loss since Jan. 22, when it fell 77.45 points, or 2.89 percent.
Three American financial exchanges announced plans yesterday for all-night trading of stocks and options, starting in 1992, putting them in potential conflict with a similar system announced last week by the New York Stock Exchange. [Page D2.] Volume at 133.47 Million The market slid steadily throughout the session in light volume, with no rally to take stocks to higher ground after Friday's record close at 2,935.89. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.03, to 356.88, and declining issues outstripped advancing ones, 1,230 to 353. 
Volume reached 133.47 million shares, compared with Friday's heavy trading of 205.13 million shares.
''I think the main reason for the drop was a lot of sell programs pushing the market down,'' said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. ''There was no fundamental news to trigger such a decline.''
He added that the decline in the bond market had a big impact on stocks, as did some of the economic numbers that were issued last week, causing anxious investors to take some profits after Friday's rally.
The economic reports, investors had hoped, would show a weak economy that would convince the Federal Reserve that it could trim short-term interest rates.
Last week's figures showed, Mr. Sohn said, that the economy is weak but the inflation rate is unacceptably high for the Fed, dashing any hopes that the central bank will ease credit in the next few months.
On Friday, the Government reported that consumer prices rose two-tenths of a percent in May; on Thursday, it said prices at the producer level rose three-tenths of a percent last month.
 
Focus on Earnings
''There's a tug-of-war between corporate profits and interest rates in the stock market,'' Mr. Sohn said. ''When corporate profits are not doing well that tends to pull the market down. But that has been more than offset by optimism regarding low interest rates. Now that it seems we're not likely to get low interest rates, the focus is back to profits.''
Earnings results for the second quarter will start to come out in early July, and investors who believed this market would finish out the quarter with a strong kick may be surprised, said Robert H. Stovall, head of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers Inc.
''A few more days like today, and it might not look so bad to be underinvested when the quarter closes,'' he said.
I.B.M. lost 1 5/8, to 118 3/4, in heavy volume, leading some technology stocks down.
Among other blue-chip losers, Procter & Gamble dropped 1 7/8, to 82 1/2; Philip Morris, 1 1/4, to 42 3/4; 3M, 1 1/4, to 86 3/8; Chevron, 1, to 71; Kodak, 1, to 41; General Motors, 1 1/8, to 49 1/8; International Paper, 1 1/8, to 53 1/4; General Electric, 1, to 69 1/8; Merck, 1 3/8, to 81 1/2; Boeing, 1 1/8, to 59, and United Technologies, 1 3/8, to 58 7/8.
Among technology stocks, Compaq Computer dropped 4 3/8, to 123 5/8. An Oppenheimer analyst, Edmund Spelman, dropped the issue from his recommended list, citing its recent price appreciation.
Southeastern Banking led the most-active list, down 1/2, to 10 1/2, after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its senior debt and commercial paper ratings, citing a weak Florida real estate market.
Wells Fargo lost 2 1/2, to 77, and another Western banking institution, HomeFed, fell 1 1/4, to 22 1/4. BankAmerica lost 1, to 29 7/8. Citicorp dropped 1/2, to 23, and Bank of New York fell 1 1/8, to 33 3/8.
Among financial issues, Federal Home Loan Mortgage lost 1 5/8, to 75 1/2, and Federal National Mortgage 1 1/2, to 40 1/8.
 
Chrysler Gains
Chrysler bucked the trend and finished up 3/8, to 15 1/2. Analysts said speculation about a possible alliance between Chrysler and Fiat had intensified.
Walt Disney, which gained last week on good reviews for the movie ''Dick Tracy,'' fell 4 5/8, to 127 1/8, after weekend box office results were lower than those of some other blockbuster film debuts.
Plum Creek Timber fell 2 5/8, to 25 1/4. An article in The Wall Street Journal about the company's forest-cutting policies described it as ''one of the Pacific Northwest's most controversial corporate citizens.''
Scott Paper was ahead 1, to 47, on a buy recommendation reiterated by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, while Stone Container, another paper products company, lost 1 3/4, to 17 3/4.
Software Toolworks, which makes software for Nintendo machines, sank 4 7/8, to 19, in over-the-counter trading after an article in Barron's characterized the company's outlook as lackluster.
The Nasdaq composite index sank 6.76, to 460.79. In over-the-counter trading, Nike, the athletic shoe company, lost 2 3/4, to 76; Sun Microsystems dropped 1, to 32 7/8, and Intel fell 1 1/4, to 47.
The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 3.27, to 360.76.

John J. McAtee Jr., a lawyer, will join Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company on July 5 as a vice chairman with responsibility for the firm's domestic and international investment banking. The appointment was announced yesterday by Frank G. Zarb, the investment and brokerage firm's chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Zarb stressed Mr. McAtee's breadth of experience as adviser to investment bankers and corporations during 27 years at Davis Polk & Wardwell, the big New York law firm. 
''I think it will add a new dimension to my experience,'' Mr. McAtee said yesterday, ''and I will not have to focus just on legal matters.''
He does not think he will need skills different from his legal ones in the new job, but he added, ''I will be managing more people than I do as a law partner.''
Smith Barney's corporate finance staff has almost 250 professionals. It provides general underwriting services, merger and acquisition advice, merchant banking and real estate financing. The firm is a subsidiary of the Primerica Corporation.
As to increasing the staff, he said: ''The group is on a move upward. The climate is perfect for Smith Barney, and last year was a record one in its investment banking as well as in securities brokerage activities.''
As a lawyer he enjoys most ''getting clients out of jams involving mergers and acquisitions,'' an area in which he has specialized in recent years at the law firm.
Saying he thrives on stress, he recalled one transaction involving a British company he represented. ''Intense negotiations went on all one week,'' he said. ''I made two round-trip trips to London, taking overnight flights and arriving back by the Concorde the next morning.'' Despite some jet lag on his part, the acquisition was completed successfully.
Mr. McAtee joined the law firm shortly after graduating from Yale Law School in 1963, and in a fast six years became a partner. Before that he served as a Navy officer for about two years following graduation from Princeton University in 1958, where he majored in economics. Like his father and grandfather, he had decided to be a lawyer, possibly in St. Louis, where he grew up.
Mr. McAtee, who is 53 years old, plays tennis or squash every week year-round ''with the same group for 20 years.''
''I scuba dive well but play golf badly,'' he added. He lives in Greenwich, Conn., and has two children.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Rethinking Business Education

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
IT is no secret that one of today's overriding challenges is the need to make changes in graduate business schools. In fact, a recently published report, ''Leadership for a Changing World - The Future Role of Graduate Management Education,'' discusses some of the steps business school deans and business leaders consider necessary.
John Rosenblum, the dean of the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia and a co-chairman of the academic commission that prepared the report, spoke about some of the more provocative ideas in an interview last week.
One of the big concerns among the deans is how the already crowded M.B.A. curriculum will deal with a host of newly emerging topics, including ethics, the environment and international business. 
As one answer, Dr. Rosenblum and others have been discussing changes in the traditional two-year M.B.A. program, with many criticizing the European idea of an intensive 11-month program and the 15-month program offered at some American graduate schools. Dr. Rosenblum said there are some creative alternatives.
''A few of us on the commission discussed a year program right after college, a second year about six years later in a person's career, followed by a two-month program in another six years,'' he said. ''I think the idea is worth considering. It would help free ourselves from the paradigm, or box, of the traditional two-year M.B.A. program.''
Such a plan would allow students to gain experience, while giving experienced managers an opportunity to continue their formal educations. ''Managers need to constantly reinvent themselves,'' Dr. Rosenblum said.
Another concern has been that some business school professors spend too much time on research that is not helpful to business. In its report, the commission stressed that business schools had tended to concentrate on ''elegant, abstract models'' that seek to unify world economic systems rather than help students understand ''the messy, concrete reality of international business.''
The commission, while stressing the importance of ''effective scholarship,'' urged that professors acquire more business knowledge to ''relate their scholarship to problems facing business leaders.'' The report also noted that some knowledge and skills ''may be best provided by faculty with managerial experience.''
Dr. Rosenblum agreed wholeheartedly with that last point and said he had added experienced corporate managers to his faculty - not just as adjunct professors but as full players.
''Faculty are enriched by diversity,'' he added.
One of those managers is Thomas C. MacAvoy, 62 years old, a former president of Corning Inc., the upstate New York glassware company.
''He is a chaired professor who teaches a course called 'Innovation and Technological Management,' '' Dr. Rosenblum said. ''And he has collaborated in the design of our new course in leadership, which will be given this fall for the first time.''
Another is Robert J. Sack, 56, who was a partner for 25 years in the former accounting firm of Touche Ross, which is now Deloitte Touche, and was also chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
''He has come here to teach international financial reporting and also a course on communicating corporate value,'' Dr. Rosenblum said. ''In both cases they are the kind of professionals that would fit well as members of the tenured faculty.''
Dr. Rosenblum also said that many graduate business schools should find niches.
He applauded Rollins College's Roy E. Crummer Graduate School of Business, where the dean, Martin Schatz, hires only older, experienced professors with Ph.D.'s.
Dr. Rosenblum noted that Rollins stressed teaching and course development over research.
The campus at Winter Park, Fla., obviously also has an attraction for many older professors at a time when business school professors are in short supply.
''The difference between a teaching faculty and a research faculty is in what the faculty publishes, rather than if the faculty publishes.'' Dr. Schatz said. ''We encourage our people to publish material that improves the teaching process. Unlike many other schools, we value the publication of textbooks.''
Dr. Rosenblum called this a powerful niche strategy. ''I think we should celebrate differences among graduate schools of business,'' he added. ''More schools need a self-identity. We hope that this booklet will be a catalyst to more creative thinking like this.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Generally Lower; Gold Slips in U.S. Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday, buffeted by technical factors and expectations of lower interest rates in the United States.
Gold prices rose modestly overseas, but slipped lower in later United States trading.
The dollar spent most of the day drifting downward in a continued response to last week's United States producer and consumer price reports. The data indicated weaker domestic demand and heightened prospects for interest rate cuts, dealers said. 
Traders believe the Federal Reserve, which sets the nation's monetary policy, is more likely to nudge interest rates lower to stimulate the economy amid signs of a slowdown. Such a move would be bearish for the dollar, which is more attractive to investors when United States rates are higher.
 
Technical Factors Cited
Jerry Rothman, a trader with Merrill Lynch Futures, said there was no news to affect the dollar and that investors were testing the currency to see how far it would go. However, he said, the dollar was likely nearing its lows.
A dealer in London said that ''it's really a technical market right now.''
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar fell in New York trading to 153.65 yen, from 153.90 yen late Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, it closed at 153.88 yen, down 0.64 yen from Friday's close, and in London, it was quoted at 153.75 yen.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7130, from $1.7060 late Friday. Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.7145 from $1.7090.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.6760 West German marks, down from 1.6885; 1.4157 Swiss francs, down from 1.4330; 5.6395 French francs, down from 5.6805; 1,230.00 Italian lire, down from 1,239.00, and 1.17455 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17085.
Gold fell 20 cents an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $349.30 a troy ounce. Later, the Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $348.25, down 25 cents.

HEADLINE: Report Urges Job Training

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Most American workers ''will see their dreams slip away'' unless society invests far more in improving their skills in school and on the job, a commission led by two former Labor Department Secretaries officially reported today.
The report offered a blueprint for changing the way schools, business and government prepare workers for an increasingly complex economy. 
It recommends that United States companies devote at least 1 percent of payroll to skills training and that no one under 18 be allowed to hold a job until earning a certificate proving mastery of basic academic skills and work qualities.
It also recommended that states, with Federal assistance, create local youth centers for insuring that all dropouts aged 14 to 21 earn mastery certificates. The report estimated such centers would cost $8.2 billion a year.
The study was produced by the 34-member Commission on the Skills of the American Work Force. The panel included top business, education and labor executives. Its chairmen were two former United States Labor Secretaries, Bill Brock and F. Ray Marshall, and Ira Magaziner, an international business authority.
The report was based on about 2,000 interviews conducted at more than 550 companies and agencies since last July in the United States, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Japan and Singapore.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
A brief article by The Associated Press in Business Day yesterday about the Commission on Skills of the American Work Force described its recommendation on job training incompletely. It recommended that no one under age 18 be allowed to work without earning a ''certificate of initial mastery'' of basic skills or enrolling in a program toward the certificate.

HEADLINE: THE MANDELA VISIT;
Mandela the Messenger: Celebrated, Yet Life-Size

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, June 19

 BODY:
Since he was freed after 27 1/2 years in prison, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela has shed his legend as one of the world's most celebrated political prisoners and emerged as a consistent and tough spokesman for the African National Congress.
Over the last four months, Mr. Mandela has been content to serve as a disciplined, if very prestigious, member of the liberation movement that he joined 46 years ago. Though he carries the title of the congress's deputy president, its domestic leadership has been entrusted to his old comrade, Walter Sisulu.
By declining to exploit his celebrity for his own political ends, Mr. Mandela, who is scheduled to arrive in New York on Wednesday to begin a 12-day, 8-city tour of the United States, has both exceeded and fallen short of expectations engendered among South Africans, black and white, during his long incarceration.
 
Most Popular South African
When Mr. Mandela walked out of prison on Feb. 9, his patrician bearing and unfailing courtesy encouraged hopes that he could become the first black president of a nation where nonwhites make up more than 85 percent of the population. Even today, he remains the most popular man in South Africa. 
By setting an example of resistance to apartheid devoid of personal animosity, Mr. Mandela has inspired people of color in and beyond South Africa, among them many Americans of African descent.
''When we used to talk of freedom, we believed it was just a dream,'' said Thabo, a high school student in Soweto who did not want his last name used. ''But now we believe it is something that can happen.''
But some South Africans who wanted Mr. Mandela to move dramatically to foster national reconciliation have been upset by his insistence that it is too early for foreign countries to drop the sanctions against South Africa or for his organization to renounce its armed struggle against the white minority Government with which he has opened a dialogue. And white businessmen have been concerned about his defense of nationalization and redistribution of wealth, which the African National Congress has long viewed as necessary to let blacks share equitably in the country's resources.
 
Demonstrates Devotion
Such is his devotion to the congress that Mr. Mandela, who celebrates his 72d birthday on July 18, embarked on an exhausting six-week tour of 13 countries only a day after he was discharged from a Johannesburg hospital after surgery to remove an inflammatory cyst from his bladder.
Some supporters expressed concern that Mr. Mandela was undertaking too much on behalf of the congress. ''He must also be told that he is more valuable here at home than globe-trotting trying to convince the world that our struggle is a just and noble one,'' City Press, a black-oriented newspaper popular in the segregated townships around Johannesburg, said in a recent editorial. ''He could have done that after full recovery from his operation.
''What is the wisdom? Does the A.N.C. hope to gain selfish politi-cal mileage out of parading a tired man in front of overseas audiences? We hope not.''
While calling President F. W. de Klerk a man of integrity and urging white South Africans to support him, Mr. Mandela has complained that Mr. de Klerk was not doing enough to eliminate apartheid.
''Twenty-seven years ago when I went to jail, I had no vote; 27 years thereafter, I still have no vote, and that is due to the color of my skin,'' Mr. Mandela told a joint news conference with President de Klerk on May 4.
He has been criticized by Mr. de Klerk in turn for espousing a continuation of the guerrilla struggle that the African National Congress declared against the Government in 1961 after its peaceful appeals for change were rebuffed. The Government contends that the call for armed struggle has encouraged violence in black townships. It is a charge that Mr. Mandela has rejected.
''The only type of violence that we accept is organized violence in the form of armed action which is properly controlled and where the targets have been carefully selected,'' Mr. Mandela said on June 2.
 
Softening on Nationalization
Mr. Mandela has hinted at a softening of the African National Congress's old call for key sectors of the economy to be nationalized.
Last month, he assured a meeting of white businessmen that nationalization and redistribution were not the only words in the congress's vocabulary.
But he has rejected arguments that large-scale Government ownership has contributed to economic failure in some African countries. At a news conference on June 2, Mr. Mandela took exception when a reporter asked if the African National Congress would avoid the ''complete mess'' in which some African countries found themselves economically.
''If there are any economic problems in Africa today, the responsibility for such mess, as you call it, must be laid squarely on the shoulders of the former colonial powers,'' Mr. Mandela said.
Any inconsistencies in Mr. Mandela's remarks seem to reflect the diversity of thinking inside the African National Congress rather than his own dissent from its policies.
''He has never regarded himself as an individual apart from the A.N.C.; he has always been very, very firm on that and he has just not changed,'' said Ahmed Kathrada, a comrade who was in prison with Mr. Mandela.
Mr. Kathrada, who is the congress's information secretary inside South Africa, said the Government sought to drive a wedge between the African National Congress and Mr. Mandela while he was in prison by presenting him as the more acceptable face of the organization.
''They tried to project the image of him as the moderate A.N.C.,'' Mr. Kathrada said, but Mr. Mandela would not cooperate. Mr. Mandela has described his talks with Mr. de Klerk and other officials before his release as facilitating a dialogue on behalf of the African National Congress.
 
A Passion for Discipline
Mr. Mandela's passion for organizational discipline was expressed at a rally in Port Elizabeth on April 1.
''Anyone who has an agenda of their own and conducts their activities in ways which are not compatible with the guidance of the president and the N.E.C.'' - references to Oliver Tambo and the congress's National Executive Committee - ''is a threat to our discipline, cohesion and organization,'' Mr. Mandela said. He called such individualists dangerous.
On rare occasions when Mr. Mandela found himself at odds with the congress, he has adjusted. Worried about the factional violence in Natal between members of the Inkatha, a conservative Zulu political and cultural organization, and supporters of the United Democratic Front, a congress ally, Mr. Mandela agreed in March to share a platform with the Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader. He backed out after front officials from Natal objected.
Mr. Mandela can still draw tens of thousands of supporters to a rally, but they may not do what he urges. He was cheered in Durban on Feb. 25, when he urged those involved in the factional fighting in Natal to throw their weapons into the sea and make peace, but the violence did not stop.
In traveling for the African National Congress, Mr. Mandela has embraced Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in Lusaka, Zambia, and compared the Palestinian struggle against Israel to the struggle of black South Africans against Pretoria.
In Luanda, Angola, Mr. Mandela spoke of liberty in Fidel Castro's Cuba. And in Tripoli, he described the Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi as a worker for human rights.
''I am not expressing any opinion as to what is going on inside the countries thyat I visited,'' Mr. Mandela explained on May 29, when a reporter asked about his choice of foreign friends.
''What concerns me is the foreign policy of those countries, especially insofar as it relates to us. Those countries who are fully committed to assisting the anti-apartheid forces in this country are our friends,'' he said.
 
Support for Israel's Rights
As for the Palestine Liberation Organization, Mr. Kathrada explained that Mr. Mandela was expressing the African National Congress's solidarity with a kindred liberation movement.
''We were aware of the repercussions that the meeting with Arafat would have, but we have a relationship with the Palestine Liberation Organization and he didn't find it necessary to hide that,'' Mr. Kathrada said. Mr. Mandela subsequently assured a group of American Jews that he also supported Israel's right to exist.
Mr. Mandela has further defended African National Congress's long alliance with the South African Communist Party, saying the congress would not abandon old friends. ''I have been working with them,'' Mr. Mandela said at his first news conference on Feb. 10. ''Their immediate objective is similar and it is natural for us to work closely together.''
If Mr. Mandela has political ambitions within or beyond the African National Congress, he has yet to reveal them. A few days after his release, Mr. Mandela was asked whether he aspired to become South Africa's first black president. He said no.
''My ambition is to see to it that we have peace in the country and that we can appreciate each other's talents, each other's contribution to the future of South Africa,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS TO RETURN LAND IN OKINAWA

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 19

 BODY:
The United States and Japan announced today that the American military had agreed to return about 4 percent of the land from its base installations on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, in a long-awaited move that appears likely to leave the strongly anti-military residents of Okinawa unsatisfied.
After two years of negotiations, prompted by an emotional appeal from the Governor of Okinawa in April 1988, the United States agreed to return a little more than 2,000 acres, about 4 percent of the land it has occupied since taking the islands after a hard-fought battle in the closing months of World War II. The 2,000 acres was far less land than the Okinawans had sought.
 
Antenna Sites and a Golf Course
The parcels to be returned are spread over 23 sites, and range from a smattering of antenna locations to a golf course and an oceanside site that the Okinawa government has said it wants to develop as a resort to invigorate the local economy. 
The United States formally returned control over Okinawa and some neighboring islands to the Japanese Government in 1972, but still keeps bases on about 20 percent of its land, much of it in prime locations. Some other parcels were returned in 1980.
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is scheduled to visit Okinawa on Saturday to attend a memorial service for those who fell in the battle. Saturday is also the 30th anniversary of the security treaty that has governed America's long and sometimes difficult military involvement in Japan.
 
Bitterness Toward U.S. and Tokyo
The announcement today thus appeared to have been timed to smooth his visit, which could be tense because of resentment among many Okinawans over the state of the local economy and what is perceived to be Japanese condescension toward the islanders. In a recent poll, 61 percent of the Okinawans questioned said they were opposed to the American presence, for which many islanders blame the Government in Tokyo.
''From the standpoint of the Okinawan people, the land being returned is not sufficient,'' Junji Nishime, Governor of Okinawa Prefecture, said through a spokesman. He nonetheless thanked the American and Japanese negotiators for their efforts. ''We appreciate this as an advance toward our goal and hope the Government continues discussions on gaining the return of the parcels that were excluded from the present agreement,'' he said.
The Okinawans, who are among the poorest of Japanese citizens, are seeking oceanfront and harbor sites that they hope to develop into resorts to improve the islands' tourist trade and to develop a free-trade zone.
 
Land Return Could Take Years
Officials on both sides emphasized that the agreement announced today is unrelated to Defense Department plans to scale back the heavy American military presence in Japan and the rest of Asia in response to a shrinking budget and the sharp reduction in cold-war tensions.
The return of the land could still take years, since the transfer of several parcels, like the golf course at Camp Zukeran, are contingent on offers of new sites for the American forces.
Today's announcement came just a few days before the 45th anniversary of the battle through which the American military won the islands. It was the last major battle with Japan before the conclusion of World War II, and ended with hundreds of Japanese killing themselves in underground bunkers rather than surrender.
Nearly 75 percent of the American forces in Japan are in bases on Okinawa. During the 1970's, bases in the Kanto region, the plain surrounding Tokyo, were consolidated and a number of sites were returned. A housing complex on Okinawa was also returned in 1980.

HEADLINE: If Communism Is Waning, Asia Defies the Trend

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 15

 BODY:
About the same time that Mikhail S. Gorbachev was ending his visit to the United States and voters in several Eastern European countries were heading into multiparty elections, the Communist Party of India was issuing a statement that began, ''The U.S. imperialists have intensified their aggression against Cuba.''
This month, the Communist Party of India-Marxist, the largest and most influential leftist party in the country, issued a 33-page indictment of Soviet change and of the overthrow or renaming of Eastern European parties. It defended Stalin and branded European Communism a ''deviation.''
In Nepal, parties of the left have begun unity talks as a prelude to making a move for power in voting next year. In Vietnam, a roundup of dissidents is under way, and in China there was the silent anniversary of the crackdown on the democracy movement in June 1989. 
Communist and other leftist parties in Asia have not only bucked the trend that has swept their counterparts from power in most of Europe, they have continued to grow in strength and to attract new followers, particularly in South Asia, where poverty is stark and development slow.
New parties of the left are appearing in India, where a peasant-based Indian People's Front entered Parliament for the first time last year, and in Nepal, where new and sometimes radical groups with shadowy leaderships have been emerging from underground since multiparty democracy was restored in April.
 
The Old Icons Go Up
While pictures and statues of Marx, Lenin, Engels and Stalin come down elsewhere, they are going up here.
''In Asia, we still have feudalism to fight,'' a Nepalese journalist working in the Philippines said. In Katmandu, leftist leaders say no other political organization is bold enough to offer real change or well enough organized to bring it about.
In India, leftists say they can play a major role in combating the growth of religious fundamentalism while battling the evils of caste and class. They avoid debate on the collapse of Communism elsewhere, saying the problems of European socialism are not necessarily relevant to them.
''The masses of people in these countries are obviously suffering from so many very severe problems, what would be the alternative to socialism?'' Indrajit Gupta, general secretary of the Communist Party of India, the smaller of the two main leftist parties, asked in an interview last month.
''The alternative of private enterprise and capitalism, I don't think would wash here,'' he said, sitting under a portrait of Ho Chi Minh. ''
 
Urban and Intellectual
Mr. Gupta, who is 71 years old, joined the Communist movement at Cambridge University in the 1940's and after returning to India concentrated on building bases among the disadvantaged.
His only regret, he said in another interview nearly two years ago, was that Indian Communism has remained an urban, intellectual phenomenon. Its voters have been drawn from the most literate constituencies. But they have joined through choice, and Mr. Gupta sees this as an advantage.
''The leaderships of the Communists in Eastern Europe never made their own revolutions, and that was a big handicap,'' he said, comparing the course of European socialism with many Asian examples. ''Power was handed to them on a plate by the Soviet Army.''
In Hanoi in April, Le Mai, a Deputy Foreign Minister, argued similarly, saying that the Vietnamese Communist Party was a home-grown nationalist movement that brought the country independence and unity. But he ruled out putting it to the test of a vote, saying the economic rebuilding of the country took precedence.
 
Communists in Big Roles
He and other Vietnamese also repeated a theme heard frequently in Southeast Asia: that Asian societies are different, preferring consensus and living more comfortably with one-party states. Vietnamese Communists point to Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore as an ardent capitalist with a closed political system.
Indian Communists are in an unusual position in Asia. They head state governments in West Bengal, which includes Calcutta, and Kerala. At the national level, they support the centrist Government of Prime Minister V. P. Singh without joining his coalition.
Their important role in national politics has given them additional strength at local and state level, particularly in West Bengal. The state's Chief Minister, Jyoti Basu, a leader of the Communist Party of India-Marxist, has become one of Prime Minister Singh's advisers.
Mr. Basu's decision before elections in November to cooperate with the Hindu-based Bharatiya Janata Party in fielding candidates so as not to dilute the opposition vote played a major part in the defeat of the former Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, and his Congress Party.
He continues to play a stabilizing role, while his state reaps the development and investment rewards that it was denied while the Congress Party was in power.

HEADLINE: Dole Predicts a New Budget Plan

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said today that the Administration had told him that the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, would present a negotiating proposal when budget talks resume Wednesday. Mr. Dole said he had not seen the proposal, but described it as ''enough to satisfy the Democrats' request.''
According to officials close to the negotiations, Mr. Darman will propose a $20 billion cut in domestic programs, with $17 billion of that coming from a variety of popular programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits and farm subsidies. The officials said the Darman plan would seek a reduction of only $3 billion to $6 billion in military spending, far less than Democrats want. They also said it would have no tax increases beyond those proposed in President Bush's January budget. 
The budget that Mr. Bush presented included about $36 billion in measures intended to cut the deficit, including $13.9 billion in revenue increases and $5.6 billion in user fees.
 
Democrats Want Deeper Cuts
Democrats have insisted that the Administration be the first to come forward with suggestions to reduce the deficit because it was President Bush who initiated the budget talks five weeks ago. Representative Leon Panetta, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, said today that Democrats would not consider any Republican proposal credible unless it showed deficit cuts in the range of $50 billion to $60 billion.
Negotiators are scheduled to begin their Wednesday session with an update on the economy.
Despite the lack of an accord, the House began appropriating money for the next fiscal year over the protests ofg Republicans.
Its began by raising by $350 million what President Bush would spend on cleaning up the nation's atomic weapons complex next year and launching 25 new water projects opposed by the Administration.
The House by a vote of 355 to 59 approved a $20.8 billion energy and water spending bill that is $575 million more what President Bush requested in his budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
The bill also increases by some $400 million what President Bush wanted to spend on 637 water projects. But it also grants his request for $318 million to begin construction of an $8 billion atom smasher in Texas.
Amendments calling for across-the-board cuts of 10.5 percent, 5 percent or 2 percent were overwhelmingly defeated.
As passed, the bill would provide the Army Corps of Engineers $3.6 billion, nearly half a billion dollars more than it received last year, for its 550 water projects. The 87 water projects run by the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation would get $957 million, nearly $7 million less than this year but still $42 million above what President Bush sought.

HEADLINE: Hiring Ban Is Shrinking Military's Civilian Force

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
Five months after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney imposed a freeze on hiring, the military's million-member civilian work force is slowly shrinking.
But the goals of the freeze have been scaled back. Since it was announced in January, the Pentagon has granted several exemptions in response to a chorus of complaints from civilian employees and military commanders who found themselves desperately short of everything from typists and mess-hall cooks to doctors and airplane mechanics.
Pentagon officials had planned to eliminate more than 50,000 jobs from the work force of 1.07 million civilians by Sept. 30, when the freeze is to expire. The officials now say that perhaps 40,000 jobs will be dropped from the $39 billion civilian payroll by the deadline. About 22,000 had been dropped through the end of April, the latest figures show. 
 
Savings Went for Aid
But the $83 million that Pentagon officials had expected to save was instead shifted last month by the Administration to a a supplemental appropriation bill that provided economic aid to Nicaragua and Panama.
Nonetheless, at a time when Mr. Cheney is facing reductions in military forces, Pentagon officials say freezing civilian hiring is a relatively painless way, politically and administratively, to make reductions.
''The objective was to stockpile as many vacancies as possible to avert layoffs later, and the freeze is meeting its objective,'' the acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for civilian personnel policy, Frank P. Cipolla, said in an interview.
The civilian reductions are separate from Mr. Cheney's plan sent to Congress Tuesday outlining the effects of a 25 percent cut in military forces.
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the budget talks between Congress and the White House, which are certain to force troop reductions, Mr. Cipolla said it was unclear whether the freeze would be extended beyond Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year.
Mr. Cheney's original order also imposed a freeze on promotions and transfers to fill vacant jobs.
The Pentagon last imposed a hiring freeze in 1982. It lasted a few months.
 
Construction Freeze Extended
In an unrelated decision, Mr. Cheney last week extended until Nov. 15 a worldwide freeze on $7 billion in American military construction projects and said through a spokesman that he would ask Congress to cancel many of them. The freeze, which was also imposed in January, had been scheduled to expire last Friday.
As for the hiring freeze, military installations report that while the reductions are no longer hampering daily operations, other workers have to pick up the slack as vacancies go unfilled.
''Across the board, people are having to do extra things,'' said Lieut. Col. Duane Roberts, a spokesman for McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif., which has lost about 200 of its 12,500 civilian workers. ''You can do that for a while, but it takes its toll and people burn out.''
In Maryland, Fort George G. Meade has lowered its civilian work force by 200 people to 5,292 since January. The engineering and housing department, for example, has lost 15 positions, including four mechanics, a pipefitter and a bulldozer operator. ''With a dwindling resource pool, you do the best you can with what you have,'' said Don McClow, a spokesman at Fort Meade.
 
Critics See Lack of Planning
Critics of the freeze contend that reducing the work force through attrition is an unreliable substitute for long-range personnel planning.
Lawrence J. Korb, who served in Ronald Reagan's Administration as Assistant Secretary of Defense for manpower, installations and logistics, said a freeze would produce proper work force levels only by ''pure happenstance.''
Problems cropped up almost immediately after the freeze took effect on Jan. 11. Mr. Cheney's original directive was tightly drawn, exempting only a few categories. These included hiring commitments that had been made before the effective date of the freeze; medical, safety and security workers, and people identified by the heads of a military department or Pentagon agency as ''essential to maintain an important national defense capability.''
But the Pentagon quickly added to the list recent college graduates recruited to fill entry-level jobs in important areas like logistics, financial management, engineering and procurement. ''We didn't want the pipeline to dry up,'' Mr. Cipolla said.
In addition, the ban was lifted for civilian employees working at military exchanges, clubs, day-care centers and other activities where the employees' salaries are paid by the fees of those using the service.

HEADLINE: Babies, Rice Farms and Diplomas

 BODY:
Can it be that Japan's alarmingly low birth rate is the Government's fault because it encourages women to get a higher education? That's what Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told the Japanese Cabinet last week. He has since been backing and filling, but there seems little doubt about the original sentiment - the more women in college, the fewer in accouchement.
Women have not attained full equality in Western societies either, but Mr. Hashimoto's views sound surprisingly quaint. He implies that women do not merit the same chances as men, and that the duty of Japanese citizens is to subject their private lives to the interests of the state, as interpreted by members of its ruling elite like Mr. Hashimoto. 
If Japan's goal is to raise its birth rate, keeping its women uneducated seems hardly the best way. Japanese undoubtedly choose to have small families because of the same demographic transition to low fertility and mortality rates experienced by other modern industrial societies. This transition is intensified by the price of land, which has been allowed to reach preposterous heights. The value of Tokyo's land is now said to equal that of the entire United States. The grounds of the Emperor's palace alone are valued at $70 billion, more than all the land in Florida.
The high price benefits Japanese companies, which can borrow vast sums on their land holdings and out-invest their Western competitors. It's less of a boon to young Japanese couples, who must live in cramped quarters and take out 100-year, three-generation mortgages to buy a house.
As Finance Minister, maybe Mr. Hashimoto could do something about the tax system that sustains Tokyo's curious breed of urban rice farmers. If they could only be induced to sell their downtown rice farms, the price of land would fall to more natural levels and the number of rooms per Japanese household would rise, doubtless followed by the birth rate.
That's just a theory, of course, but it would surely win a lot more votes than Mr. Hashimoto's idea of turning back the clock.

HEADLINE: Judaism's Alive and Well and Living in America;
The Nature of Identity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Seymour Lachman and Barry Kosmin (Op-Ed, June 4) make assumptions that, unfortunately, are shared by many non-Jews as well as Jewish religious sects. The most common is that being part of the Jewish community consists of affiliation and participation in a Judaic religious sect. 
They equate this assumption with another questionable one: ''Christian American norms of piety and affiliation.'' There's a better equation in the number of Christians and Jews whose ''affiliation'' rests on the celebration twice a year of Easter or Passover, and Christmas or Hannukah. Attendance at church services by Christians for these holy days is best compared to the large attendance of Jews at synagogues or temples on Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New Year.
Another section of the Jewish population that makes a point of celebrating these holidays is the growing number affiliated with local chapters of the Society of Secular Humanist Judaism. This suggests that Jewishness may or may not depend upon piety or religious affiliation. Jewishness is a ''club'' from which one cannot resign, even though attempts have been made by conversion, assimilation, denial (name change) or intermarriage. This is because, again and again, Jews have been made the scapegoats for social, economic and political ills.
Whether we are American Jews, French Jews, English Jews or Eastern European Jews, this sense of community has an international aspect. Our survival as Jews has depended upon that most vital aspect of community that meant helping one another in times of stress; keeping our history, certain ethnic and cultural traditions alive, especially the value of education and life itself. Religious, or not religious, we remain Jews.

HEADLINE: For Industrial Growth, Give Risk Capital a Break

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Tom Wicker states (column, May 28) that ''much of today's high-tech industry was spun off from federally financed military and space research,'' and he calls for an industrial policy that would apparently target certain industries for Federal support.
As a venture capitalist for 30 years, I can think of few company spinoffs from Government-sponsored military and space research. Some of our companies have benefited from Federal support of scientific research. More often they refuse military and space-related funds because of the concomitant change of direction from commercial products.
The best way to encourage industrial growth is to restore the lower tax rate on long-term investments in risky enterprises we had from 1922 to 1986. To quote John F. Kennedy, ''The tax on capital gains directly affects investment decisions, the mobility and flow of risk capital from static to more dynamic situations, the ease or difficulty experienced by new ventures in obtaining capital, and thereby the strength and potential for growth of the economy.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush, Keep Your Promise to American Families

BYLINE: By Marge Roukema; Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, is a member of the House labor-management subcommittee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Congress has passed the Family and Medical Leave Act, confronting President Bush with a decision that goes to the heart of the concerns facing hard working, tax-paying American families. That's why I am so perplexed that White House sources continue to predict that the President will veto this bill despite his frequently stated support for family values and job security.
In a day and age when the majority of families need two paychecks to get by, it is inconceivable that we do not have a minimum guarantee of job security when a medical emergency strikes. The debate over the Family and Medical Leave Act is not about Federal mandates or benefit packages. It is about values and a standard of decency, and protecting the jobs of workers who are trying to hold on to the American dream. 
The act simply insures that working Americans who must take short, unpaid leaves - because of the birth of a child, the serious illness of an immediate family member or their own serious illness - will be able to return to their jobs. The act would require larger companies, with 50 employees or more, to allow their permanent workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for a certified reason.
Opponents of the bill have told the President that the act would place untold burdens on American businesses. Not true. Not one state or business that has adopted similar or more far-reaching leave policies has told Congress of disruptions or declines in productivity.
The business community has legitimate concerns about what it perceives as a long list of proposed and imposing Federal requirements that would interfere with collective bargaining and add strains to our global competitiveness. But the Family and Medical Leave Act is not one of them.
I speak as a Republican with a rock solid record of support for and from the business community. But I also speak as a woman who at one time chose to leave my profession as a teacher to raise my children full-time.
I was fortunate to have the choice. Unfortunately, most women today are not in a position to do the same. Two-thirds of women have jobs outside the home because of economic necessity. While job security for both wage earners in a ''traditional'' family is more crucial than ever, it is absolutely critical for the increasing number of single-parent households.
But this is only part of the new equation. People over the age of 75 are the fastest growing segment of society. Americans are healthier and living longer, but the overwhelming majority of these elderly will need the care of a family member when serious illness strikes. If they cannot be cared for at home, they will require expensive nursing home treatment, which relatively few can afford.
These are not abstract problems. I know. I've been there. When my son was stricken with leukemia and needed home care, I was able to be at home to give him the loving care he needed. But what of the millions of mothers who work for the thousands of companies that do not have family leave policies?
Are we in Washington going to tell a pregnant woman or the mother of a child dying of cancer to go find another job? Why should we take a productive, tax-paying worker who happens to have a medical crisis and throw them off the payroll? Unfortunately, for many of them it may be just a short drop onto public assistance.
Is the Family and Medical Leave Act a radical departure from the traditions of American labor law? Not at all. It is completely consistent with established labor standards that gave us such protections as child labor laws, anti-sweatshop codes and the 40-hour work week. As society has changed, we have always adjusted our labor protection standards to meet the new circumstances.
Clearly my Republican Party does not want to be perceived as the driving force behind a reduction of the capital gains tax for the rich while it turns its back on America's working families. President Bush should sign the Family Medical Leave Act. It is good policy and good politics.

HEADLINE: Fed Up, L.I.'s Young Are Thinking Florida

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: MERRICK, L.I.

 BODY:
Like many young couples on Long Island, Kenneth and Sharon Jaeger both work, he during the day and she at night. Whoever is home looks after the baby.
''As I'm walking in the door, she's walking out,'' Mr. Jaeger said. ''We have to do it to make ends meet.''
The Jaegers are sick of it. They are tired of scraping by to pay taxes and the mortgage when together they earn more than $42,000. They are tired of the traffic and tired of the house they bought three years ago as a fixer-upper and are still trying to fix up. 
Like many young couples on Long Island, the Jaegers want to move. And that is why Mr. Jaeger spent a recent afternoon at the Florida Development Corporation here listening to a talk on life in Florida.
Florida real-estate promoters, pursuing their decades-old quest for Northerners tired of the cold and familiar, are finding a growing market in people like the Jaegers. Increasingly, through seminars and real-estate showcases, they are introducing the young families of Long Island to the opportunities of Florida.
In the past, most of the Long Island immigrants to Florida were older people hoping to cash in their Long Island dream and retire. But people moving there today are almost as likely to be young families who never found the dream in the first place.
''In the past two years, we have found a real change in the market,'' said Ann Levitt, the associate director of marketing for Florida Development, which acts as a broker for various Florida developers. ''Fifty percent or so of the families are young working people. They say they can't afford to buy a home or are getting taxed out of their houses.''
 
Search for the Good Life
Long Island used to be a land of opportunity for the young, with good jobs, clean air and a way of life that was easier and friendlier than New York City's. But many Long Islanders say the good life is no longer within reach here, and they are looking elsewhere. Florida, they believe, is what Long Island once was, only with better weather.
Among the most popular forums that bring together people who want to move out have been the Florida Real Estate Showcases. When the first was held as an annual event eight years in the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, 3,500 people attended, said John Erisman, vice president of United Show Management Inc., which sponsors the get-togethers.
The company has added two shows, one in the spring, most recently on June 9, and the other in November. The show in January, Mr. Erisman said, drew almost 30,000 people.
''I see the crowd getting gradually younger,'' he said. ''There's still the retiree, the empty nester who's alone and the second-home buyer. But you do see more young people. They want to cash in and get out of Long Island.'' Jim Bogen could not agree more. ''It's a sick place; I'm burning myself out,'' said Mr. Bogen, 24 years old, a construction worker attending the Florida Development Corporation's seminar here. Mr. Bogen, who is married, lives in an apartment on the top floor of someone else's house. Even though he works overtime to bring in $30,000 a year, he said, he cannot afford to buy a home on Long Island. ''For what I could afford, it would have to be a garage in Wyandanch,'' he said.
 
Moving to Areas of Growth
''It breaks my heart,'' he said. ''I've got my family and my friends here. But now I have my own family to look after.''
Another concern is jobs. After a long period of expansion, job growth has slowed considerably in the metropolitan region in the last two years, and important industries on Long Island, including defense and construction, are suffering.
''My husband's in the building business, and you can't build here,'' said Helen Folkers, who lives in Ridge and who was at the most recent Real Estate Showcase, held at the Radisson Plaza Hotel in Melville.
''Young people move for economic advantage,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional director of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the last two years, he said, job growth has slowed considerably on Long Island and in New York City as it has been increasing in Florida. He said: ''People are looking around, and saying, 'Where are the prospects brighter?' And they're moving into areas of growth.''
 
Study by University
Mr. Ehrenhalt said the number of jobs in New York State grew in 1988 and 1989 by 1.9 percent, the sixth-worst record of any state. In that period, Florida added 400,000 jobs, for 8.4 percent growth, the seventh-highest in the country.
It is hard to say just how many Florida residents once lived on Long Island. But Florida consistently gains more people from New York than from any other state.
A study last year showed that 13.9 percent of all people settling in Florida in the last five years were from New York, said Stan Smith, director of the population program in the bureau of economic and social research at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
Florida is not the only place that Long Islanders move to, of course. Virginia and the Carolinas are popular, too. But Florida has gained a sort of mythical reputation here as a land of opportunity, with cheaper housing, a balmier climate and a calmer style of living.
 
'Love the Warm Weather'
''It's clean, it's affordable, there's no rat race, the people are nicer, and I love the warm weather,'' said Joseph Pagliaro, 34, a computer programmer who joined hundreds of people, young and old, at the show in Melville.
With his two friends, Mr. Pagliaro cruised through the rows of booths, where developers distributed brochures, displayed videotapes of palm-tree laden landscapes and spacious houses, and offered deals like special fly-and-buy trips, where potential customers are flown to developments in Florida free of charge, no purchase necessary.
With glossy pamphlets that advertised three-bedroom houses starting at $81,000, far lower than a comparable Long Island house, the booth for Artistic Homes, a builder in Spring Hills, Fla., on the Gulf of Mexico west of Orlando, drew a brisk crowd. ''Seventy percent of the people who come to our homes come from the Northeast, and Long Island is our main pool of people,'' said Harry Paul, a sales manager.
Many visitors to the showcase said that if the real-estate market on Long Island were not so sluggish, more people would move right away. They spoke of houses on their streets that had been on the market for months and even years, and they said they worried about what would happen when they put their houses up for sale.
 
Fear of Popularity
''Nobody can afford to leave until they sell their own house,'' said Jean Dunn, 38, whose house in Holtsville has been on the market for six months.
According to the Long Island Board of Realtors, 23,502 houses were listed for sale on Long Island in April; 799 were sold that month.
As much as people want to leave, some said they worried that the popularity of Florida would make the areas they want to move to no better than Long Island in a few years.
Houses in Florida cost $50,000 to $100,000 less than comparable houses up north. Developers say prices are rising as much as $10,000 a year.
Jobs are plentiful in some expanding parts of the state, particularly around Orlando in the center, Melbourne on the Atlantic coast and Fort Myers on the Gulf. Representatives of the Florida developers said salaries are about half what they are on Long Island. Prices of most commodities are similar to those in Long Island, the developers added, but there is no state income tax in Florida.
Florida is growing, though the rate has tapered off and counties are beginning to adopt plans to manage growth, said Ken Dalecki, editor of the Kiplinger Florida Newsletter, which tracks trends in the state. Where 1,000 people a day used to move to Florida, he said, now 800 do. By the year 2000, Mr. Dalecki said, two million to three million people will move to Florida, putting the population at 16 million.
Worries about Florida's growing out of control or becoming a Long Island away from Long Island are not stopping Chris Cerullo, 35. He wants out, and he wants out now. He has put down money on a $95,000 house in Kissimmee, near Orlando. A house he was looking at here, in Far Rockaway, was selling for $165,000.
''I grew up here and I'm going to miss it,'' Mr. Cerullo said. ''But I have no choice.''

Colleges Scrambling to Fill Up Freshman Classes

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 19

 BODY:
Many colleges and universities say they expect substantial declines in the size of their freshman classes this fall - the first unequivocal sign that the nation's pool of college-age students is indeed shrinking.
''The numbers of freshmen dropped a little last year, but this is the first year of what we are calling 'the deep slide,' '' said Michael Barron, admissions director at the University of Iowa, which expects to have 10 percent fewer freshmen on than it did last year.
With the exception of a few highly selective schools, which draw from a disproportionately large pool of applicants, public and private institutions from New York to California have reported drops in applications, an increase in rejections from students who had been admitted, or both.
 
Making Up Lost Tuition
As a result, schools are scrambling to make up lost tuition by trimming budgets, dipping deeper into waiting lists, extending application deadlines and aggressively recruiting new students. 
''You name it, schools are doing it,'' said John C. Hoy, president of the New England Board of Higher Education.
According to a survey by the National Association of College Admissions Counselors, as of May 1, 21 percent more of its member schools still had openings in their freshman classes this year than at the same time last year. About 499 of the 672 institutions that responded to the survey said they still had openings in their freshmen classes.
Officials at Pace University, which does not have a waiting list, said enrollment at its New York City campus is down 250 students this fall; 1,700 freshman enrolled last fall. ''We are going to be beating the bushes for more students, let me tell you,'' said Herbert Falk, a university spokesman. ''There are still some students on the line and we are going to do whatever we can to make Pace their school of choice.''
At Northeastern University in Boston, the largest private university in the country, numbers look a bit more grim. The potential of a 25 percent to 28 percent drop in freshman enrollment has led to a freeze in university hiring and faculty salary increases until 1991.
 
Downturn in Economy Is Cited
Because of its relatively small endowment of $153 million, tuition revenue at the 33,000-student school is crucial. The anticipated drop of 800 to 1,000 students in the fall would mean a revenue shortage of $8 million to $10 million.
''The primary causes of the drop are the downturn in the New England economy and the demographic situation,'' said Northeastern's president, John A. Curry.
The University of Southern California, another of the nation's largest private schools, is expecting a 12 percent drop in freshman enrollment. And the decline at the Illinois Institute of Technology, in Chicago, might be as high as 20 percent, or 328 fewer students, administration officials said.
From 1988 to 1994, the number of high school seniors is expected to drop by 11.8 percent, or from 2.7 million to 2.4 miilion, according to the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. And while new census statistics show the proportion of those who go to college has increased, the demographic slide should take its toll until 1995, when the college-age population is expected to begin to rise.
While many public universities, including the Big Ten, are expecting fewer freshmen this year, the demographic shift is hitting the less selective private institutions hardest. Competition for students is tough among these schools, said educators, especially with the growing gap in the cost of tuition between public and private schools.
 
Lowering of Standards Is Seen
Unfortunately for the more expensive schools, a delay on the part of the College Board in processing financial aid forms has given an advantage to the less costly public institutions,educators said.
Educators also said that because of the shortage of potential freshmen, many students are being accepted to colleges where they would normally have been rejected.
''People were taken off wait lists much more than usual this year,'' said Elizabeth G. Barringer, a college counselor at St. Mary's Episcopal School, a girls' school in Memphis. ''Some of our girls got into schools that they normally wouldn't have gotten into.''
Stanford University admitted 200 applicants who had been on the waiting list - more than twice the number in previous years.
As competition for students stiffens, recruiting campaigns have also taken off.
''We feel like other schools do, that we have to get the message out more effectively,'' said Melvin Bernstein, chancellor of the Illinois Institute of Chicago, which has stepped up efforts to find new students.
At Boston University, freshman enrollment dropped a mere 3 percent, or 105 students, partly because of a ''bonding tactic'' used with prospective students.
 
'A Very Strange Years'
''Now every student gets a special letter from the chairman of the department when he or she is accepted,'' said George Schiller, vice president for enrollment management. ''This is a very strange year. The marketplace has changed. Students are more confident that they can get in where they want.''
Admissions officers deny that standards for potential students are being loosened to fill their freshman classes, but say that is not necessarily the case when it comes to other schools.
''This is a buyers' market,'' said Mr. Hoy, of the New England Board of Higher Education. ''It's ultimately a zero-sum game. We have tapped the market.''

About Education

BYLINE: By Fred M. Hechinger

 BODY:
Two political scientists affiliated with the Brookings Institution have proposed a radical plan that would deregulate and, in effect, make the public schools private. It would encourage private schools to compete for students with public schools in a free market. It would let parents pick their children's schools, public or private, with the taxpayers footing the bill.
The proposals are offered in a book published this month by Brookings, ''Politics, Markets and America's Schools,'' by John E. Chubb, a senior Brookings fellow, and Terry M. Moe, a professor of political science at Stanford University. 
Reaction has been instant and sharply divided. Some praise the approach as competitive, letting good schools triumph and poor schools go out of business. They view it as a means of giving parents the power to hold schools accountable.
Others predict that extreme deregulation will result in an education version of the savings and loans debacle. They see it as the destruction of public education.
''It puts our public schools at risk,'' said Bill Honig, California's Superintendent of Schools and widely regarded as a school reform leader. ''I think it's crazy to try this radical surgery.''
But Thomas H. Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey and now president of Drew University, responded positively, saying, ''Now it's becoming apparent that the very organization of the schools is a problem.''
The book is already being judged in political, as well as educational, terms.
The Wall Street Journal headlined it, ''Liberals Are Joining Conservatives in Urging Use of a Free-Market Philosophy to Reform Schools.'' But the fact that Brookings, a Washington-based think tank considered liberal, has published this book, which clearly applies conservative economics to the schools, does not necessarily mean that the idea will be supported by liberals and conservatives alike. Major support comes from conservative groups, like the Heritage Foundation.
On one point of the proposal there will be little disagreement: schools suffer from excessive bureaucracy and top-down regulations. The trend toward what is known as school-based management is already a major plank in school reform efforts.
Similarly, the idea of giving parents a choice of schools is spreading rapidly. Magnet schools, which concentrate on certain areas of study, like the arts or mathematics and science, are an example.
But most reformers call for choice only within the framework of the public schools. By contrast, the Chubb-Moe proposal urges unlimited choice, including nonpublic schools. A private school would need only to meet minimal requirements to call itself public and benefit from public financing in the form of state-financed ''scholarships'' that would come with each student.
The authors not only would encourage participation by private schools but would like ''to include religious schools as well, as long as their sectarian functions can be kept clearly separate from their educational functions.'' Would religious schools accept such a separation?
Opponents of the plan view the ''scholarship'' terminology as a semantic device to get around long-standing opposition to a voucher system - giving parents vouchers representing public funds to pay for tuition at nonpublic schools. Despite then-President Ronald Reagan's commitment to vouchers, they got nowhere in Congress, which held that vouchers would jeopardize financial support for public education and would violate separation of church and state.
Mr. Chubb holds that competition, accountability and good teaching, rather than money, improve the schools and that too much money is now consumed by the bureaucracy.
Opponents say the creation of state-financed ''choice offices'' and ''parent information centers,'' as the Chubb and Moe's book proposes, would create a new bureaucracy. And schools would be free to reject applicants and to expel students.
Under the proposed free market, schools would ''be organized and operated as they see fit.'' Systemwide tenure would be abolished. Each school would determine its tuition and the minimum government stipend it was willing to accept.
Will choice plans lead to increased racial segregation? The authors promise safeguards to prevent this. Yet a comparison of rich and poor districts, or of urban and suburban schools, suggests that affluent parents tend to find ways to provide better schools for their children than poor parents.
Moderates believe that systems can be reformed without radical change. ''Politics, Markets and America's Schools'' confirms that the radical right and the radical left share the belief that change will be possible only if the system itself is first brought down.

HEADLINE: Goodyear Plans to Cut 1,100 Jobs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, which was recently bumped from its long-held position as the world's largest tire producer, announced yesterday that it was laying off 1,100 workers and taking a $35 million charge against earnings as part of a sweeping restructuring program.
Goodyear, based in Akron, Ohio, said that because of competitive pressures in the tire industry, along with the $35 million charge, it expected a second-quarter loss of $10 million. Goodyear's last quarterly loss was in the first period of 1986, primarily because of a write-off. 
The company said the layoffs would come from the ranks of its 50,000 North American workers. Goodyear will now have 28 regional offices in North America that will report directly to the headquarters in Akron, rather than the current structure, under which 43 district offices report to five regional divisions, which in turn report to the headquarters.
Goodyear has been burdened in recent years by continued sluggishness in North American automobile production, higher operating expenses and losses related to its All-American Pipeline. Economic conditions in Brazil, where Goodyear has production operations, have also contributed to company problems.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Goodyear fell 25 cents yesterday, closing at $33.75.
 
Tire Industry Competition
Competition in the tire industry has intensified as a number of large, international producers have acquired smaller companies, primarily in the United States. The most recent was last year's $690 million acquisition of the Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Company by Groupe Michelin of France, making it the largest tire maker. That came a year after the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, formerly the second-largest producer in the United States, was purchased by the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan for $2.6 billion.
Since then, Goodyear has moved to cut costs and reduce layers of management. In April, the company said that it would create two new business units: one for consumer tires serving the passenger tire market and one for commercial tires, primarily non passenger tires. The company has announced several personnel reductions in the last three years, but yesterday's represented the largest number of workers furloughed since the company fought a failed takeover attempt in 1986 by Sir James Goldsmith, the British investor.
In the company's announcement yesterday, Goodyear said that it was eliminating five field region offices in the United States to achieve ''a flatter, more efficient and responsive organization.'' The company said it was realigning wholesale operations, retail subsidiaries, field sales and home office support groups.
In an interview yesterday, Tom H. Barrett, chairman of Goodyear, said that the restructuring was necessary because Goodyear had been unable to recover much of its sales and administrative costs in some areas in North America. ''We think we can correct this with this restructuring,'' Mr. Barrett said. ''We can recover more of our costs with a more effective organization and with fewer people.''
Mr. Barrett said that the quarterly loss was ''difficult for us.'' But, he added: ''Even though we're unaccustomed to it, we have to think in the long term. We could put it off, but that would serve no purpose.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Fall in Light Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury security prices inched lower again yesterday, in business so slow that dealers said the decline was virtually meaningless.
''There wasn't even a good rumor to trade off of,'' one government bond trader said.
A report showing that housing starts dipped by 1.4 percentage points last month, to their lowest level since October 1982, led to some selling. The number was in line with expectations. 
''The market has been indoctrinated to expect numbers on the weak side, and this housing-start figure was well forecast,'' said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a firm in Princeton, N.J., that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign-exchange and credit markets. ''At this point, we need economic news that is even weaker than expected to push the market forward.''
 
Normally Slow Period
The sluggish pace of activity left participants groping for observable events that could cause a pickup in business.
''I'm hoping the two-year and four-year note auctions next week will do the trick,'' the bond trader said. ''But we are in what normally is a slow period. It's tough to construct a scenario where we will be really busy over the next week or so.''
Analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, said in their daily market commentary that the pace could pick up on Friday, when new economic data, including May statistics on personal income and consumption, are released.
''Until then, the recent negative tone is expected to remain intact,'' the analysts said.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered in late trading at a price of 102 31/32, down by 7/32, to yield 8.47 percent. The benchmark issue was offered late Monday at a price to yield 8.45 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 15/ 32, down by an eighth of a point, to yield 8.49 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/ 32, down by 1/32, to yield 8.37 percent.
Treasury bill rates were unchanged to up slightly. 3-Month Bills Unchanged By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.72 percent, unchanged on the day. The rates on the six-month bill rose by a basis point, or hundredth of a point, to an offered rate of 7.63 percent. One-year bills were offered at 7.56 percent, up by 4 basis points.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Minnesota offered $200 million in bonds at competitive bid yesterday.
A bid from a group led by the First Boston Corporation won the securities, which consist of serial bonds maturing from 1991 to 2009. The bonds were reoffered with coupons ranging from 5.71 percent in 1991 to 7.05 percent in 2009.
The issue, which is rated AA by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, met with a cool reception.
According to investment bankers close to the transaction, by late yesterday about $110 million worth of securities remained unsold.
 
Municipals Also Off
The lackadaisical attitude was also present in the secondary municipal securities market. The dealers said that prices of most widely quoted issues dipped by an eighth of a point to a quarter of a point.
''There's just not a lot of customer flow,'' a municipal bond trader said.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, the prices of most issues were unchanged on the day, the traders said.
The prices of outstanding bonds issued by the Occidental Petroleum Corporation were little changed, the traders said, despite an unexpected ratings downgrade by Standard & Poor's. The Los Angeles-based oil company's senior debt and preferred stock ratings were lowered to BBB-minus, from BBB.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Retreats Again While Gold Moves Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued to fall against major foreign currencies yesterday in a market once again dominated by technical factors. Gold prices slipped lower.
''A lot of people don't understand why we're down here,'' said Robert Ryan, chief foreign exchange dealer for the Bank of New York Company, ''But it's hard to fight a trend.'' 
The pound rose to a 15-month high against the dollar in London, a move dealers said was helped when sterling broke above a chart level of $1.7150.
Traders also reported some concerns that United States interest rates - which support the dollar when they are at higher levels -might decline because of the slowing economy in this country.
The pound rose to $1.7198, from $1.7130 late Monday, in London. In later New York trading, the pound rose to $1.7225, from $1.7145 late Monday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 153.72 yen, down 0.16 from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 153.65 yen, and in New York, it fell to 153.49 yen, from 153.65 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.6725 West German marks, down from 1.6760; 1.4090 Swiss francs, down from 1.4157; 5.6230 French francs, down from 5.6395; 1,227.25 Italian lire, down from 1,230.00, and 1.17385 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17455; Gold edged 20 cents lower on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $349.10 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $347.90 an ounce, down 35 cents from Monday.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $348.25 a troy ounce, from $349.45 late Monday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $347.80 from late Monday's $348.75. In Hong Kong, gold closed at $350.45 an ounce yesterday. The market was closed Monday for a holiday.
Silver fell in London to a late bid price of $4.84 an ounce from $4.85. In New York, silver fell 1 cent to close at $4.815 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange.

HEADLINE: Government Critics Harassed in Mexico, Setting Off a Storm

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 20

 BODY:
A campaign of intimidation and harassment of critics of the Mexican Government, apparently by Government security forces, has provoked a growing human rights crisis here, grave enough to have required the direct intervention of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
In the latest of several incidents in recent weeks, the secretary of one of Mr. Salinas's most outspoken critics was stopped last Friday by four armed men who said her employer would be killed if he continued his activities. She was also interrogated about his work, contacts and family by the men, who held a gun to her head before leaving in a model of automobile often used by the police here.
The death threat was directed against Jorge Castaneda, an intellectual who is the son of a former Mexican Foreign Minister and a political ally of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of the left-nationalist Democratic Revolutionary Party. Mr. Castaneda has strongly criticized Mr. Salinas's economic and political policies in publications here and in the United States and at numerous American academic conferences, activities that have angered members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and the Government. 
On Monday, three days after the threat, Mr. Castaneda's secretary went to the chief prosecutor's office to examine photographs of public security agents and identified a member of the Mexico City judicial police as one of her assailants. On her way home she was assaulted and robbed by a man who said he was aware she had just implicated the policeman and warned her that she too would be killed if she did not halt her activities.
Threats of violence against supporters of Mr. Cardenas are regarded with great seriousness here as a result of the murder in July 1988 of two of his campaign aides, just days before the presidential election in which disputed official results saw him finish a strong second. While the case remains unsolved, Mr. Cardenas has said he holds ''the darkest and most reactionary sectors of the Government'' accountable for the killings.
The latest incidents have also generated alarm in political circles because Mexico's centralized political system grants extraordinary authority to the President, and his subalterns are traditionally reluctant to take any important action without his approval. In that context, any freelance operation by the security organs would imply an unusual loss of presidential authority.
''I do not know which is more worrisome, that the Government does not have control or that the Government is ordering these things be done,'' Mr. Cardenas said in an interview on Tuesday. ''I don't know which of the two positions Salinas is in, but I can't discount either possibility.''
 
'Unacceptable,' Salinas Says
On Saturday, Mr. Salinas, who had just arrived in Tokyo to begin a 10-day Asian visit, phoned Mr. Castaneda to express ''my solidarity in the face of this unacceptable incident'' and followed it with a letter that was published Sunday in one newspaper here.
The threat against Mr. Castaneda ''goes precisely against what I have maintained as an invariable norm of conduct for my administration, which is to guarantee scrupulously the liberties and rights of Mexicans,'' wrote Mr. Salinas, who this month also announced the formation of a new Government-sponsored National Human Rights Commission.
Nevertheless, the official Government newspaper El Nacional, which did not print the Salinas letter, took a hostile position on the incident the same day. ''Anyone who has ever exchanged points of view with Castaneda knows of his insistence and obsession in passing himself off as a victim of supposed official intimidating pressures, which have remained exclusively in the realm of his imagination,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.
The only newspaper to publish Mr. Salinas's letter was La Jornada, a left-wing daily where two night watchmen were shot to death in April. The Government announced Tuesday that it had arrested five members of a left-wing guerrilla movement in the case. But frightened staff members at the newspaper say they regard the killings, which followed Government complaints about their news coverage and editorial line, as retribution by the same ''darkest and most reactionary sectors'' mentioned by Mr. Cardenas.
 
'An Array of Abuses'
The threats against Mr. Castaneda, and Mr. Salinas's unusual public response, come just days after Americas Watch, the Washington-based human rights group, published a stinging report titled ''Human Rights in Mexico: A Policy of Impunity.'' In it, the organization complained of ''an array of abuses that have become an institutionalized part of Mexican society,'' including ''killings, torture and other mistreatment by the police'' as well as ''disappearances and election-related political violence.''
''Neither President Salinas nor any other official at the highest ranks of Government has made it clear to security officers in the field that they must desist from all abuses of internationally recognized human rights or face immediate arrest and prosecution,'' the report said.
In April, Mr. Salinas sent army units into Mr. Cardenas's home state, Michoacan, to quell opposition protests of fraudulent elections there. Early in May, the opposition Mayor of the town of Aguililla, Salomon Mendoza, was arrested on drug and murder charges after he went to police headquarters at a military base to complain about a drug raid by the federal judicial police in which dozens of homes were entered without search warrants and more than 100 people were arrested.
A few days after that, Leonel Godoy, a Democratic Revolutionary Party member of Congress and a lawyer who was part of Mr. Mendoza's defense team, was abducted by four armed men, who beat him, stole documents on police abuses in Aguililla and threatened him with a gun as they drove around.
 
Security Forces Accused
The Democratic Revolutionary Party has charged that Government security forces were involved in the kidnapping of Mr. Godoy, which ended when the legislator was dumped in a vacant lot and told to run for his life.
In another case that has aroused national concern, Norma Corona Sapien, who as head of the Human Rights Commission in the state of Sinaloa regularly denounced abuses by federal and state judicial police, was shot dead on May 21 near the university where she taught in Culiacan.
At the time, Miss Corona was investigating the torture and murder in February of a Mexican lawyer and three Venezuelans who were studying and teaching in Sinaloa, last seen alive when they were arrested by the federal judicial police. The Venezuelan Embassy here said it was told by the Mexican authorities that the Attorney General was holding the men on arms trafficking charges, an accusation the families of the four men say is false, but the Attorney General's Office later denied ever having the men in custody.

HEADLINE: FRAUD UNCOVERED IN PROPERTY SALES IN SAVINGS RESCUE

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
The Federal rescue program to sell billions of dollars worth of property seized from failed savings and loans is just beginning, but Government auditors have already detected evidence of misconduct.
Regulators are investigating a series of questionable practices: fees and salaries of hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to consultants and former savings executives; country club and other expenses billed to the Government, and even an attempt to pay for one property with a suitcase full of cash, which may have been a money-laundering effort by organized crime.
Although the collapse of the nation's savings and loan industry has left a trail of losses, fraud and waste, officials and real estate experts say, the real problems are probably just starting. ''There's a high potential for more scandal and rip-offs'' in the coming sales, said Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General.
 
Effect on the Economy
The Government has decided to sell the foreclosed real estate as quickly as possible, with big auctions scheduled to begin in a few months. That was a policy decision intended to control the cost of the bailout to taxpayers. The reasoning has been that selling off the properties rapidly would be better for local real estate markets and the national economy than having the Government hold a huge portfolio of assets, prolonging the uncertainty and drawing out the costs. 
Essentially, the Government has decided that the economic risk from delaying the sales would be greater than the likely losses from the misconduct and mismanagement. Even officials at the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government organization set up last year to handle the industry bailout, concede that the volume of real estate disposals will be so great that, short of staff and forced to take procedural short cuts, they will not be able to prevent problems.
''We realize that this provides an enormous potential for sweetheart deals and other problems,'' said David C. Cooke, executive director of the Resolution Trust. ''And we also realize we won't be able to eliminate it. Our hope is that we will be able to try to keep it to a minimum level.''
Disposing of the savings industry's legacy of failed real estate investments, which range from single-family houses and office buildings to uranium mines and pasture lands, represents the biggest property selloff in America's history.
The General Accounting Office, in determining where to direct Government auditing efforts, recently pinpointed 14 areas of activity most likely to cost taxpayers money from fraud, waste and mismanagement. The sales of savings and loan properties were one of the areas at the top of the list, along with Defense Department procurement and awarding Housing and Urban Development contracts.
After a policy review, the Resolution Trust decided that it lacked the real estate expertise to handle the selloff program itself, brokers and managing agents will be the conduit through which hundreds of billions of dollars in property will be maintained and sold. Accordingly, there is ample opportunity for some of these managers to arrange kickbacks, fraudulent expenses and favoritism in selecting subcontractors.
''It gets all the way down to hiring people to trim the grass,'' said John J. Adair, inspector general of the Resolution Trust.
To narrow the scope for abuse, the Government recently developed a series of economic incentives for the private managers of seized properties that ties their ultimate compensation to the final price for the asset, the speed with which it is sold, and the expenses incurred in maintaining it.
Still, Federal officials acknowledge that great potential for abuse remains. 10% Who Aren't Honest ''When you're talking about so much in assets - billions and billions of dollars - the potential is large that there will be abuses, especially since a lot of this is being handled by the private sector,'' said Mr. Cooke of the Resolution Trust. ''If 90 percent of the people working for us are honest, that still means there will be 10 percent who won't abide by the rules, and that's a lot of money.''
The magnitude of the challenge facing the Government became clear last week. The Resolution Trust released its list of real estate for sale, 35,908 properties with a book value of $14.9 billion. Though the list included mines, pasture lands, parking lots and golf courses, nearly 84 percent of it was residential property, mainly in Texas. A nationwide auction of other properties, each with a value of $1 million or more, is scheduled for September to be conducted on closed circuit television, and regulators say they expect to coduct about four such large auctions each year.
The 35,908 properties had been owned by 148 failed savings and loans in liquidation. Last week, the Congressional Budget Office raised its estimate of the number of savings and loans that may eventually collapse to 1,700, of a total of 2,500 institutions in the country. Analysts forecast that more than 300,000 properties will eventually be sold because of the collapse of the savings and loan industry.
There are early signs that Government regulators have had trouble in curbing suspect practices. For example, Representative Bruce F. Vento, chairman of a banking committee group overseeing the Resolution Trust, said in Congressional hearings on Friday that six former executives of two California institutions placed under Government control, Mercury Savings and Western Empire Savings, as recently as May continued to draw six-figure salaries as high as $300,000 or more, even though they had stopped working at the institutions many months earlier.
The Congressional panel also expressed concern about a $500,000, one-year contract to a Salt Lake City consulting firm to manage a failed institution in Minneapolis, Midwest Savings, and arrange the sale of its assets. Representative Vento, a Minnesota Democrat, said that despite the expense, the consulting was done only part time and no serious bids were received for the bulk of the assets.
 
Unrelated Expenses
Auditors for the General Accounting Office say there has been little oversight of the expenses billed to the Government in connection with thefirst 52 savings and loans sold by the Government last year. Many of their unmarketable properties are still owned by the Government, but managed by the buyers of the savings institutions, and therefore the Resolution Trust pays expenses associated with them. The Government auditors say they have found instances of country club expenses, rentals of vehicles and travel expenses that apparently were not related to the managing of the properties.
Staff members at the General Accounting Office who are monitoring the sales and conducting an audit of the Resolution Trust have identified several problem areas.
First, the regulators are still severely short staffed. The Resolution Trust has moved cautiously in hiring, filling about half of its budgeted staff. Mr. Adair, the inspector general, who is in charge of investigating suspicious dealings in the sale of assets, finally took office in April after several months of a lengthy nominations process.
Mr. Adair has so far appointed only four people, including his secretary. His department has a budget for 150 auditors and investigators who will be posted around the nation, looking into hundreds of cases, but he said that even that staff level may be insufficient.
Another potential problem, the auditors say, is that while regulators do conduct background checks of the purchasers of savings and loans, the Government is not screening any of the buyers of the failed institutions' assets. Regulators expect that many of the buyers of the assets will be the property developers and speculators who defaulted on loans from savings institutions for the same property.
In a way, the process is set up to encourage a holder of property whose value has plummeted in a depressed real estate market to default on the loan and then repurchase the property at a substantially lower price.
 
Knowing the True Value
The bidders for Government-seized assets are also expected to include savings and loan executives who know the most about the true worth of the property being sold, but who share in the responsibility for industry's collapse.
''A lot of the same people are going to show up under new entities, trying to buy from the Government,'' said Mr. Bowsher of the General Accounting Office.
Such sales would often be less a legal problem than a political embarrassment. The sales would not be illegal, but they could prompt a public outcry because so much taxpayers' money is being consumed by Federal bailout.
The property sales, regulators say, could well provide organized crime with a comparatively easy way to launder profits from illegal activities, like narcotics sales. Mr. Cooke described a scene earlier this year in which the Resolution Trust halted the sale of an office building after a bidder tried to put down a deposit with a suitcase full of cash.
The contracting of hundreds of management agents, vendors and operators for an array of assets is being accomplished under less stringent Government procurement standards than those required for Federal agencies and departments. Under the Resolution Trust guidelines, the background of contractors is ''self-certified,'' meaning that those who bid give their assurance that they are not criminals or in default on Government loans. While background checks of the winning bidders are expected to be accomplished through private firms, those firms have yet to be hired. Government officials are concerned about how it will be accomplished quickly, yet thoroughly.
''There's a lot of anxiety by the R.T.C. regional staff about how to enter into these contracts and the Washington staff has yet to issue any guidelines'' said Gaston L. Gianni, an assistant director at General Accounting Office. ''It's a very sensitive area.''
Yet despite the risks, the historic property sale will soon begin. In regions like the Northwest, where few savings and loans have failed, the effect on home and land prices will be scant. But in Southwest, in particular, the Resolution Trust sales will be closely watched since the sales could further depress weak local markets.
''We won't know whether we have reached the bottom of our real estate market until the R.T.C. sells off its properties here,'' said Ioanna T. Morfessis, chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council.

HEADLINE: The Mandela Visit;
Mandela Gets an Emotional New York City Welcome

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela, the living symbol of resistance to South African apartheid, swept tired but triumphant yesterday into an emotional New York welcome.
During Mr. Mandela's first hours in the United States at the start of an eight-city visit, tens of thousands of people in the black Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bedford-Stuyvesant, East New York and Fort Greene lined the sidewalks, wildly cheering the honored guest's motorcade and brandishing clenched fists.
In lower Manhattan huge clumps of computer printouts tumbled to the streets of the financial district in place of ticker tape, made obsolete by electronics, in the city's traditional hero's greeting.
 
A Compelling Moment
''Apartheid is doomed,'' Mr. Mandela said at the end of brief, graceful remarks at a City Hall welcoming ceremony. ''South Africa will be free. The struggle continues.'' For the city's blacks it was a particularly compelling moment. 
''I felt a blessing from God that I could be part of this,'' said Taraja Samuel, an administrator with the city's Board of Education, who took her 15-year-old son Taiye to the City Hall ceremony. ''I came of age in the 1960's, but the regret of my life is I never met Dr. King or Malcolm. I told my son today to be in the presence of Nelson Mandela was an honor.
''This makes me able to go back to the board, despite all the problems, and know that I can make a difference,'' she said. ''This man is an inspiration.''
 
Huge Security Operation
As Mr. Mandela praised David N. Dinkins as New York's first black Mayor, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, who managed Mr. Dinkins's campaign and played a major role in organizing Mr. Mandela's visit, wept in the row behind them.
The police estimated that 750,000 people saw Mr. Mandela at one point or another - 50,000 in Queens at Kennedy International Airport and along the route, 100,000 as he passed through Brooklyn, 400,000 along the ticker-tape parade and 200,000 in the ceremony at City Hall. Hundreds of thousands more saw the events broadcast live on local television.
Police helicopters flew overhead, and Mr. Mandela's 40-car motorcade bristling with police and State Department security officers was led by two dozen police motorcycles. As part of a huge security operation, traffic was frozen as the motorcade passed.
 
Concern About Health
As the day progressed, there was increasing concern for the health of Mr. Mandela, the deputy president of the African National Congress, who will turn 72 years of age next month and was released less than five months ago after 27 years in prison. He is in the midst of a six-week, 14-nation tour and at the beginning of a hastily arranged visit to the United States, where he is seeking financial support and the continuation of economic sanctions against the white regime in South Africa.
Last night, an exhausted Mr. Mandela canceled several scheduled events, including meetings with black journalists and exiled South Africans, and even the scaled-down, intimate family meal at Gracie Mansion that had replaced plans for a 22-person dinner went by the boards.
Roger Wilkins, the national coordinator of the trip, told journalists last night that the Dinkinses were eating downstairs while Mr. Mandela remained in the guest suite upstairs.
After the City Hall ceremonies, Mr. Wilkins said: ''It was clear he reached the limit where he should not be pushed. The man is tired.''
Earlier, Zwelakhe Sisulu, Mr. Mandela's press secretary and the director of information of the African National Congress, told reporters that Mr. Mandela was ''quite tired after such a hectic day.''
Mr. Wilkins had said at the earlier news briefing: ''The fact that we express our concerns doesn't mean we have a sick man on our hands. It just means that we are being realistic about a very strenuous program for a 71-year-old man.''
 
Two Hours Late
Mr. Mandela arrived from Canada almost two hours behind schedule yesterday morning in order to get extra rest, and by the end of the day he was visibly worn.
As Mr. Mandela rode up Broadway, he was encased in an odd vehicle immediately dubbed the ''Mandelamobile.'' A small bulletproof glass shelter with a peaked roof was built atop a police flatbed truck. Spotlights fixed to the corners of the roof give it an uncanny resemblance to a prison watchtower.
But all the security was virtually swept aside at one point as hundreds of excited black teen-agers surrounded the motorcade when it left Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, running, whooping and cheering alongside the cars. State Department security officers paled and their eyes widened at the sight.
 
Issue of U.S. Sanctions
The major political goal of Mr. Mandela's trip is to keep economic sanctions on South Africa in hope of creating pressure for greater social change. African National Congress leaders say they fear that the limited reforms instituted by the Government of President F. W. de Klerk could be used to justify a lifting of sanctions.
President Bush, who opposed sanctions, told reporters somewhat wistfully yesterday that he is precluded from removing any of the sanctions. Under the law enacted in 1986 over the veto of President Ronald Reagan, the sanctions may not be lifted until a series of specific conditions are met, and the Bush Administration acknowledges that has not yet happened.
''I can't lift the sanctions under existing U.S. law,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference in Huntsville, Ala. But he said he intended to take the issue up with Mr. Mandela when they meet at the White House on Monday.
 
Show of Support
''I look forward to talking to Mr. Mandela about this,'' the President said. ''There are black leaders in South Africa that disagree with him on this question of sanctions.''
The President added that his Administration was looking for ways to demonstrate its support of Mr. de Klerk's Government.
''I'd like to find a way to show Mr. de Klerk that we, the United States, are grateful for this new approach that is having South Africa evolve to a much more open society and hopefully one day to one which is color blind in terms of participation in the political process,'' he said.
 
High School Visit Goes Forward
Mr. Mandela's red and white plane, a Canadian military transport, touched down just after 11:30 A.M. at Kennedy, A.M., where several hundred elected officials, community advocates, African National Congress members and supporters and journalists had been waiting for hours, most of them, it seemed, talking on cellular telephones.
Mr. Wilkins, the writer and educator who is running the American trip, called in the middle of the night, a senior aide to Mr. Dinkins said, to tell Harry Belafonte, the singer who is one of the main organizers here, that Mr. Mandela was tired and needed more rest. Mr. Wilkins said the African National Congress wanted to cancel the visit to Boys and Girls High School, the mayoral aide said, but Mr. Lynch, the Deputy Mayor, insisted that it go forward.
But Mr. Mandela appeared almost radiant as he stepped from the hatch of the airplane, a tall figure in a conservative gray suit, blue shirt and dark-patterned tie. He would soon be wearing a gold ''big apple'' pin in his lapel. Behind him, Winnie Mandela, wearing purple and white traditional African dress with a matching head wrap, raised a clenched fist.
 
'Child at Christmas'
''I saw astounded people; I saw euphoric people,'' Mr. Wilkins said at the end of the day. ''I saw a nearly 72-year-old man tired from a very emotional day. But when I was running by that security vehicle, I looked up, and the smile on his face was like a child at Christmas.''
A receiving line of about 50 dignitaries, including the Mayor and his wife, Joyce, and Govs. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Jim Florio of New Jersey, was stretched along a red carpet to a speakers stand where the African National Congress's black, green and yellow flag stood along with city, state and American flags.
But Mr. Mandela first stooped down, his hands on his knees, and gave his undivided attention to two young girls, members of the African National Congress, who tied scarves in the group's colors, bandana style, around his and his wife's necks in greeting.
Then, moving with the dignified, almost regal bearing - he is a hereditary tribal chief - that he would maintain, Mr. Mandela took 10 minutes to work his way through the receiving line and then swept past the speakers stand to greet the crowd of several hundred supporters.
 
'Walk Together'
''It is a source of tremendous joy and strength for us, my wife, our delegation, to be received with such a rousing welcome by the people of the city,'' he said in brief remarks after being welcomed by the Mayor and both Governors.
''Join us in the international actions we are taking. The only way we can walk together on this difficult road is for you to insure that sanctions are applied,'' he added in what he said would be his main message throughout his visit.
Roadside crowds gradually swelled as Mr. Mandela's motorcade raced from Queens into predominantly black sections of Brooklyn, with schoolchildren neatly lined behind banners. People waved portraits of Mr. Mandela and posters or makeshift signs welcoming him.
But in the predominantly white communities of Howard Beach and Ozone Park, Queens, there were a few rude gestures, and one man with a video camera held his hand in front of the lens with a finger raised, so that the motorcade became the background for an obscene gesture.
Some 3,000 people, a predominantly black crowd, were waiting on the athletic field of Boys and Girls High on Fulton Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant when the motorcade arrived shortly after one o'clock. At times they seemed to be a sea of yellow signs that said ''Free South Africa,'' red-black-and- green liberation flags, dazzling multicolor headdresses of African and Caribbean design and T-shirts with Mr. Mandela's face.
''Mandela, Mandela,'' the crowd cheered, surging forward in the muggy sunlight as Mr. Mandela and his wife climbed the makeshift stage of an 18-wheel truck. ''Keep the pressure on.''
''We in South Africa have always known that we have loyal friends among the people of New York, but we have no idea that we were perceived with such love and warmth,'' Mr. Mandela said in a slow, deliberate voice, each word punching through the public address system. With little further ado, he began into an appeal to raise money to build schools in South Africa.
As the motorcade left, many in the crowd raced out of the schoolyard and into the streets, slowing the pace to a crawl. Many raced along with the cars on foot or on bicycles until they could speed up.
The sidewalk crowds swelled as the motorcade moved through Bedford-Stuyvesant, with welcoming banners like ''Forward to Victory'' stretched across Fulton Street.
 
The Parade Begins
Mr. Mandela paused briefly for lunch at the Coast Guard Station at the Battery and an almost obligatory photo opportunity with the Statue of Liberty in the background. Then he climbed into the odd-looking Mandelamobile for the ticker-tape parade.
As 3 P.M. approached, the crowd was beginning to thin along Broadway. People looked at their watches, stood on tiptoes and, where space and dress allowed, slumped to the curb to rest. Executives kicked their wingtips at the paper underfoot and secretaries moaned for their Nikes.
Then, in a wail of sirens and a shower of saved-up confetti, the motorcade appeared.
The canyon of tall buildings presented a strange sight. Instead of the familiar ticker tape of parades past, rectangles of paper floated down and the police and sanitation workers lining the streets had to kick through thick wads of computer printouts.
''It was worth waiting for,'' Henrietta Wilson, an officer's assistant at Chemical Bank, said as she rushed back toward the Battery to work. ''That was history.''

HEADLINE: Peru Drug Fund Used in War, Aide Says

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The State Department's chief narcotics specialist acknowledged to Congress today that millions of dollars in American drug-control aid to Peru would be used in part to fight leftist guerrilla groups that are said to protect coca growers and traffickers.
''I want to be very frank in saying that where the insurgency and the drug traffickers are inextricably bound together, we have to deal with them together,'' said the official, Melvyn Levitsky, Assistant Secretary of State for international narcotics matters. ''We have an interest in helping them fight that insurgency.'' 
Mr. Levitsky's comments in testimony before a House Foreign Affaars subcommittee drew a sharp, skeptical response from the panel's acting chairman, Representative Peter H. Kostmayer, who questioned whether the United States, which has already assigned military trainers to Peru, was being drawn into a counterinsurgency war that ''we cannot win.''
 
Wary of Guerrilla Wars
''I continue to have grave doubts about the militarization of the Andean anti-narcotics effort,'' said Mr. Kostmayer, a Pennsylvania Democrat. ''Are we getting the United States involved through the back door in fighting guerrilla wars?''
The Bush Administration has committed $35 million in military aid to Peru in what American officials acknowledge privately, but rarely confirm publicly, is an effort to assist the Peruvian Government in its decade-old struggle with the Shining Path, a brutal guerrilla group that controls large parts of the country and seeks to impose a worker-peasant state.
The newly elected President of Peru, Alberto Fujimori, has not yet said whether he will accept the American aid package.
 
U.S. Officials Optimistic
State Department officials who spoke on condition that they not be identified said the Administration was optimistic that Mr. Fujimori would eventually be persuaded to accept United States military aid, including assistance from additional American military trainers, in combating the Shining Path, or Sendero Luminoso.
''The Sendero Luminoso is a major part of the drug picture,'' Mr. Levitsky said at today's hearing of the House panel, the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs. ''They protect the drug traffickers. They negotiate between the growers and the traffickers and increasingly they are engaged in drug trafficking themselves.''
Mr. Levitsky insisted that American military involvement in Peru would be limited, and that American military trainers would not join in combat operations against drug traffickers.
Today's debate in the House subcommittee came after a newly released private study, sponsored in part by the State Department, that predicts a military coup in Peru and identifies a growing threat from the Shining Path.
The report, which was prepared by the Rand Corporation, a California-based research organization that often serves as a Government consultant, found that because of political and economic turmoil in Peru, ''the real question is not whether there will be a coup but when.''

HEADLINE: St. George's Journal;
Grenada Is Target of U.S. Jets (Carrying Tourists)

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada, June 17

 BODY:
Seven years after 6,000 G.I.'s landed here to protect 500 medical students and restore order after nearly a week of violence between rival factions of the Marxist Government, Grenadians are eagerly awaiting a second airborne invasion from the north.
For many, the planeloads of tourists that will begin landing on the large, once provocative Cuban-built runway this week on American Airlines flights represent the hope for an end to a prolonged and often turbulent spell of political and economic uncertainty.
Coming after elections in March that produced a coalition Government widely seen as competent, if not firmly anchored or stirringly popular, the decision by the first major United States carrier to begin regular flights here has led to near euphoria.
''This is going to make a tremendous difference,'' said Richard Cherman, chairman of Grenada's tourism board and co-owner of one of the country's few true hotels, referring to the new air connections. ''For the first time, we are going to have a presence in the U.S. market and a Government committed to developing tourism.'' 
 
Long Flights, Few Hotel Rooms
With poor connections to the United States, and 10-hour flights separating the island from Western Europe, Grenada's hotels have long suffered low occupancy rates, keeping this intensly green mountainous island a treat yet to be discovered by many tourists, but leaving the economy largely dependent upon the vagaries of the nutmeg, mace, cocoa and banana markets.
Even after several years of steady growth in tourism, last year Grenada received only about 68,000 tourists, less than a quarter as many as visited several Caribbean islands of similar size.
In addition to the long flights, with multiple stops that passengers have had to endure in the past, Mr. Cherman said, the country's limited hotel capacity of about 1,000 rooms, intermittent political troubles and lack of advertising had prevented a takeoff of tourism.
With the new daily airline service from the American Airlines hub in San Juan, and plans to nearly double hotel capacity by late next year, many predict that the tourism industry will grow by 10 to 15 percent a year.
 
Fear of 'Weird Developments'
While the twinge of anticipation pleases everyone from Mr. Cherman to ordinary Grenadians in the population of about 100,000, nearly all are crossing their fingers that no more of what one diplomat called ''the weird developments that have happened so often here in the past'' crop up to spoil the island's coming-out party.
Those developments have included everything from the fatal shooting of a United States Embassy diplomat last year by an apparently deranged policeman to an unexplained fire in April that destroyed the rustic brick Government Financial Complex and main post office in the snug, horseshoe-shaped harbor city of St. George's.
An official investigation found no sign of arson, but many continue to attribute the nighttime blaze to bitter rivalries among the small political elite.
Perhaps even more than events like those, many Grenadians fear that rivalries will split the fragile governing coalition led by the 63-year-old Prime Minister, Nicholas Brathwaite, opening the way for populists with highly personalized and erratic styles to reassert their dominance over the country's politics.
 
Support Among Rural Poor
Foremost among those politicians is Sir Eric M. Gairy, a former Prime Minister and longtime national leader who was overthrown by Maurice Bishop, the popular, charismatic Marxist who was killed in the violence that preceded the United States invasion in 1983.
A deeply eccentric figure who dresses only in white and cream, calls himself a mystic and speaks of unidentified flying objects, among other phenomena, Sir Eric, who is now nearly blinded by glaucoma, gave many here a fright by narrowly missing a chance to form a government in the last election.
Despite having earned a reputation among the country's better-educated classes for capricious authoritarianism, including endorsing the brutality of a paramilitary group, the Mongoose Gang, Sir Eric retains strong support among the rural poor.
 
Failed Bid for Parliament Seat
By the narrowest of margins, Sir Eric lost his bid for a parliamentary seat. But his party, the Grenada United Labor Party, performed well enough to lead the opposition.
On the veranda of his large, pink hillside home that overlooks the picturesque capital, Sir Eric stares intently into the distance as he evokes biblical images to prophesy apocalyptic violence in Grenada that will return him to power.
''God told me: 'I appointed you before you even entered your mother's womb,' '' he said, gesturing abruptly, while a nearby follower nodded enthusiastically. '' 'The nation will fall into your hands another 10 years, even if I have to extend your years like I did Abraham's.' ''
Some here point to his recent electoral defeat, the defection of some party leaders to the governing coalition and the growing frequency of such offbeat pronouncements as signs that Sir Eric's days as a leader are surely behind him.
But many politically knowledgeable Grenadians are much more guarded.
''If the Government can last five years, Gairy will be out,'' said Leslie Pierre, managing editor of a leading independent newspaper, The Grenadian Voice. ''If they fall apart, he will have a chance. The Eric Gairy's of this world can never be written off. Not while they breathe.''

HEADLINE: Excerpts From President's News Conference on the P.L.O. and Other Issues

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference in Huntsville, Ala., yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times through the Cable News Network:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
Based on the recommendation of the Secretary of State, I have decided to suspend the dialogue between the United States and the P.L.O. pending a satisfactory response from the P.L.O. of steps it is taking to resolve problems associated with the recent acts of terrorism, in particular that May 30 terrorist attack on Israel by the Palestinian Liberation Front - a constituent group of the P.L.O.
By way of background, on Dec. 14, 1988, Yasir Arafat, speaking on behalf of the P.L.O. executive committee, recognized Israel's right to exist. He accepted the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and he renounced terrorism.
Now, subsequently, the United States announced that because the P.L.O. had met our long-standing conditions for dialogue, we would begin a substantive dialogue with the P.L.O. And at at the time we applauded Chairman Arafat for taking these essential steps and we have conducted such a dialogue with the P.L.O. through our embassy in Tunis.
Over the past 18 months, representatives of the United States and the P.L.O. regularly exchanged views about the political and security situation in the region.
On balance, we believed that these exchanges contributed to progress in the peace process. 
 
A Raid by Sea
On May 30, 1990, the Palestinian Liberation Front attempted a seaborne terrorist infiltration into Israel. Palestinian Liberation Front leader Abu Abbas represents the P.L.O. [sic] on the executive committee of the P.L.O. The size of the force and the geographical target area strongly indicates that civilians would have been the target.
That day we issued a statement deploring this attempted terrorist attack. On May 31 we raised this incident with the P.L.O. in Tunis. We told them that it could not avoid responsibility for an attempted terrorist action by one of its constituent groups and needed to take steps to deal with the matter by condemning the operation, disassociating itself from it and by also beginning to take steps to discipline Abu Abbas, the perpetrator.
We've given the P.L.O. ample time to deal with this issue. To date, the P.L.O. has not provided a credible accounting of this incident or undertaken the actions outlined above.
The U.S. does take note of the fact that the P.L.O. has disassociated itself from this attack and issued a statement condemning attacks against civilians in principle. But as we previously indicated, this is not sufficient. This alone is not sufficient.
The U.S.-P.L.O. dialogue has demonstrated that it can advance the Arab-Israeli peace process. And at the same time, the dialogue is based on the assumption that the P.L.O. is willing to abide by the conditions it accepted in December 1988, including renunciation of terror.
At any time that the P.L.O. is prepared to take the necessary steps, we are prepared to promptly resume the dialogue.
In the meantime, we would hope and expect the peace process would proceed as intended and without delay.
We remain committed to the pursuit of a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and to a just and lasting peace. And as we've often stated, it is our view that such a peace must be based on those two resolutions - U.N. Resolution 242 and 338 and the principle implicit therein as territory for peace and provide for Israel's security and Palestinian political rights.
We believe that Palestinian participation is vital to any successful process and that there are real opportunities for Palestinians in this process. We strongly hope that Israelis, Palestinians and the Arab states will recognize these opportunities and take the necessary steps to create an environment in which a viable peace process can thrive. We denounce violence in the area and call upon all parties to eschew violence and terror and opt instead for dialogue and negotiation. We're prepared to continue working with the parties toward this end.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
The Moves Toward Peace
Q. Doesn't your announcement of today coupled with Secretary Baker's words that the Israelis should call the White House when they're serious, mean that the U.S. position in the peace process for the Middle East is dormant right now?
A. John, it's not moving forward right now and the offer still stands. I have sent a letter to Prime Minister Shamir. I have very specifically asked questions that relate to seriousness about the peace process but I would like to see the peace process move forward, nothing herein should indicate anything different because here we're simply taking an arrow shot at, at terrorism. . . .
 
Savings and Loans
Q. Mr. Marlin seemed to have lit a fairly short political fuse with his comments on the S. & L. bailout and accusing the Democrats of having a big part in that mess. Are you ready to play that game this election year and blame the Democrats for a problem that others have laid on years of permissive regulation by the Reagan Administration?
A. Norm, you're almost getting me into the fight by the way you asked the question, but I know I'm not going to. I want to get the savings and loan problem solved. And Marlin properly, seeing a couple of shots across my bow from certain distinguished members of the United States Senate decided not to acquiesce in those attacks without some response. What he did was appropriate.
But what I'm trying to do is not respond to individuals and to simply keep moving forward on this process, and not try to be out there saying here's who's to blame and here's who's not to blame. . . . I think more important than continuing to pour fuel on that spark is to work cooperatively with the Congress in trying to get this mess solved and of course that is a part of what will be discussed in the, in the budget process. I would say to the American people on this one, the obligation is to protect the depositor. That's what our obligation is. And another obligation is to prosecute those who have broken the law and there's been an active prosecution under way.
 
Allies and P.L.O.
Q. Is it true that none of our allies, with the exception of course of the Israelis, wanted you to suspend these talks with the P.L.O.? . . .
A. . . . I think there will be a, a lack of agreement with what I've done here on part of some of our strongest allies. And I know this is true on the part of some of the most reasonable and moderate Arab states. But I would simply remind them of the conditions upon which the dialogue started in the first place and I would also remind them that if they look at this statement, and remedial action is taken, the dialogue from the U.S. side can promptly be restored.
 
Mandela and Sanctions
Q. Mr. President, as you know, Nelson Mandela arrived in the United States today and you're going to meet with him next week. What are you going to tell him on the sanctions question? And the second part, there have been reports - oh, some weeks ago - that the United States [unintelligible] agency was a fraud, and a process led that led to his arrest many years ago. And there've been suggestions that you should apologize in behalf of the United States Government and the American people. Will you do that?
A. No. I will take my leadership on that question from Mr. Mandela, who put it very well when he said, let bygones by bygones. And that is not to agree with or disagree with the charge. On the second point - your first, my second - the sanctions under the law cannot be listed [sic] until certain additional steps are taken by South Africa.
Let me be very clear: I salute Mr. de Klerk for what he's done. He's come a long, long way. And I salute Mr. Mandela for his approach to de Klerk; I think that demonstrates a willingness to talk that few of us might have predicted a couple of years ago. But there still are things that have to be done, under our law, in order to lift the sanctions. . . .
But in any event, there has to be progress. And I'd like to find a way to show Mr. de Klerk that we, the United States, are grateful for this new approach; that is, having South Africa evolve to a much more open society and, hopefully, one day to one which is color blind in terms of participation in the political process.
But I can't lift the sanctions under existing U.S. law . . . I had some original reservations about the sanction approach. But I will say that it seems to - if you can credit sanctions with the evolution of - towards democracy in South Africa, I'd have to say, well, it seems to be - you know, there's some good things to it.
But it's delicate, because I want to find a way to show our appreciation to de Klerk, and yet I don't want to pull the rug out from under Mr. Mandela.
 
Aid for the Soviets
Q. Mr. President, are you planning to support a G-7 initiative, for economic reasons, to the Soviet Union at next month's economic summit? And if so --
A. No, I'm not planning to do that. I expect, though, that matter may be discussed. There are - I've tried to very upfront with Mr. Gorbachev when he was here about the difficulties in terms of financial support. I talked to him in Malta about that. Indeed, we presented him with a list of things that might be done to improve our ability to work in full cooperation with them on that. But I don't plan a new initiative and yet I want to see perestroika continue. I haven't changed my view that economic reform is important, and I recognize that support from the West can well help the economy.
But there's an awful lot of reform that has to take place - in the market, in the distribution systems. There's some political problems that we have that I've discussed very frankly with Mr. Gorbachev - not the least of them $5 billion a year going down to Cuba - so we've still got some problems there. But discount the fact that we are planning some bold new initiative. On the other hand, I'm perfectly prepared to talk to our allies on any subject, and I think that will probably be one of them.
 
Dealing With P.L.O.
Q. Back on the P.L.O., one of the theories passed around in your own Administration was that the intent of this terrorist attack was to derail the peace process. Are you at all concerned that by suspending the dialogue you're playing into the hands of the hard-liners, like Abu Abbas? And is there also --
A. Yes. Let me stop you there, just to respond, so I don't forget the question. Yes, I am concerned about that. Go ahead.
Q. Well, if you're concerned about it then why did you - why did you take this action?
A. Well, because we had to weigh the whole question, and the question was complicated by the fact that there were three specific undertakings, one of which - a very important one, in my view - has clearly been violated. So - but it's not an easy call because I know some feel that the P.L.O. dialogue is totally unproductive and, as I indicated in this statement, I don't. And the question up here was, well, do our allies - will they agree with the steps that I've taken here in Huntsville today? And the answer is, no, some of them will not agree because they do feel that the dialogue has kind of helped calm things in some parts of the Middle East.
So what the answer to it is, is for the P.L.O. to take the action that I've called for and to satisfactorily - to satisfy us that those who were responsible will be disciplined, and condemn this specific act. It's not enough to simply reiterate - reiterate one's concern on terrorism.
Q. Is there a danger, too, that those Palestinians who had put some hope in the dialogue between the P.L.O. and the U.S. might now throw up their hands in desperation and resort to violence?
A. Well, I hope that's not the case, and yet I would refer you to the very last page - of my last paragraph or two of the statement, when I did call for no violence. And I think it's fair to say that any time you're dealing with something as complicated as the Middle East, you worry about that. But I hope that's not the case, and I hope they'll see in my statement a rather temperate view here that, though we're specific in calling for the condemnation of this particular terrorist act, that if - once that is done, in keeping with Arafat's undertaking -that we can resume talks.
There has been a frustration, Jim, in the Arab world, that the - that this dialogue has not resulted in more -more progress. And I understand the frustration. I don't happen to agree with it. I think things are better because we've had the dialogue. But Israel has strongly objected to it, and some Palestinians have been, as we can clearly see, concerned about it. But I believe that we ought to try to find a way to get it back at some point.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
At Romanian Inauguration, Promises and Doubts

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, June 20

 BODY:
Ion Iliescu was inaugurated President today, ending six months of provisional rule that began with the violent overthrow of President Nicolae Ceausescu last December.
In an auditorium whose walls and ceilings are adorned with the names and images of Romania's cultural and political pantheon, Mr. Iliescu in his inaugural address promised free-market economic reforms, the rule of law, full recognition of individual and minority rights and improvements in Romania's social safety net and moral fabric. He also put forth a defense of the Government's violent breakup of a protest last week.
It was uncertain, despite the promises, whether Mr. Iliescu would transform his words into deeds and heal the trauma of the Ceausescu era, given Romania's highly charged, confused political atmosphere. 
The United States Ambassador to Romania, Alan Green, boycotted the ceremony today to show concern over the Government's violent breakup of a seven-week protest against Mr. Iliescu in a central square last week. Officials have said 6 people were killed and more than 100 hurt as the police broke up the protest, before the Government called miners to the city in what it said was a move to defend Romania from a coup attempt.
 
Seeks Distance From Miners
Besides beating up anti-government demonstrators, the miners attacked scores of innocent people, ransacked private homes and opposition party offices and newspapers, and manhandled and threatened opposition leaders.
Mr. Iliescu publicly thanked the miners last week. In his speech today, however, he sought to disassociate the Government from the illegal acts the miners committed.
Mr. Iliescu said today that the violence last week exposed serious inadequacies in the country's military and law enforcement agencies and called for a strengthening of Romania's security apparatus and greater discipline in the armed forces.
''The state and government leadership was faced with a direct challenge that it could not cope with efficiently,'' he said. ''Under those circumstances an appeal was made to the population to support the authorities.''
People who said they watched last week's events reported seeing army troops encouraging an attack by anti-Government demonstrators on police headquarters. Western reporters said they saw troops giving victory signs to groups of demonstrators milling around University Square, the plaza where the protest took place, after the first police attempt to clear the square.
 
Aid Is Suspended
The pro-Government violence prompted Western governments, including the United States, to halt non-humanitarian aid to Romania, a move that is certain to make the promises that Mr. Iliescu voiced today all the more difficult to fulfill. Mr. Iliescu stressed in his speech that the Romanian Government is counting on international aid.
In a statement released Tuesday, Mr. Green, the American Ambassador, called on the Romanian Government to condemn the acts of vigilantes, to guarantee the safety of people who exercise the right to free expression and to engage in constructive dialogue with democratic opposition groups. United States Embassy officals, however, will continue to meet directly with senior Romanian Government officials, the statement said.
The ceremony today, which was delayed for almost a week because of the violence, came off without incident. The hundreds of heavily armed soldiers and security troops who surrounded the auditorium wound up facing only a few onlookers and small crowds of flower-carrying Iliescu supporters, who were kept a safe distance from the building.
 
Strike at University
At Bucharest University today, a number of students and professors started a three-day strike in protest against the continuing detention of students taken into custody last week by the police and miners.
Rumors abound in Bucharest that there are rifts between elements of Romania's army and the security apparatus and that a split has developed between Mr. Iliescu, who won last month's presidential election here by a wide margin, and Prime Minister Petre Roman. Despite those reports, Mr. Iliescu today reappointed Mr. Roman to run Romania's Government until Parliament takes up the formation of a new government.
Mr. Iliescu's chief opposition party rivals, Radu Campeanu of the National Liberal Party and Ion Ratiu of the National Peasant Party, expressed satisfaction with most of the speech.
''I liked particularly the passages in which he guarantees human rights, respect for the individual, assembly, and all of the freedoms we are yearning for in this country,'' Mr. Ratiu said.
But, Mr. Ratiu added, ''If what he said about the events of last week are a guide to his sincerity, then I am very worried because the way he presented the events of last week is totally wrong.'' Mr. Ratiu charged that there was total collusion between the security forces and the miners.
Mr. Campeanu said ''the important role will be taken by the opposition to force the Government to make the transition from words to deeds.''

HEADLINE: After Renaissance of the 70's and 80's, Philadelphia Is Struggling to Survive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 20

 BODY:
The urban renaissance here, marked by the frenzied construction of $5 billion worth of downtown office buildings and the rebuilding of frayed neighborhoods in the 1970's and 80's, is sputtering out. The new urban issue here, as framed by the city's austerity budget for next year, is survival.
''If we raised taxes any more than we did, we would have had to expand the highways to the suburbs for all the moving vans,'' said City Councilman John F. Street, who earlier this month successfully pressed for $65 million in reductions in city services, including programs for the homeless and street cleaning.
Philadelphia's taxes are among the highest in the nation, and are three times those in its suburbs, which have better schools, less crime and many jobs, according to the Pennsylvania Economy League, a nonprofit research group.
 
City Is Facing Insolvency
But without more tax revenue, the city could become insolvent. Some city officials, including the finance director and the controller, say deficits expected in the next year or two could mean severe reductions in city services and could set off a fiscal crisis. 
On June 8, Standard & Poor's, the Wall Street rating agency, reduced the city's bond rating two notches, to the lowest rating, BBB-, held by any major city. St. Louis and Detroit, the two next lowest rated, are rated BBB.
Mayor W. Wilson Goode, whose proposal for more taxes was defeated last month, says the city will be able to hold on until the state comes to its rescue after the fall elections for governor and much of the State Legislature. But incumbents have not shown much eagerness during the campaign season to help Philadelphia.
The city wants to increase revenue by adding taxes on cigarettes and gasoline; creating a new sales tax, and making its wage tax, now about 5 percent for everyone, progressive like Federal taxes. The city needs the Legislature's approval for these changes.
 
A Critical Stage
Urban specialists say most older Northeastern and Midwestern cities share Philadelphia's problems, but they say the problems have reached a critical stage here. ''Sadly enough, Philadelphia is showing the way,'' said George Sternlieb, professor of urban planning at Rutgers University.
''We didn't genuinely redevelop our cities in the seven fat years we just went through,'' Professor Sternleib said, ''so we face some real troubles in the seven lean years ahead. There was a momentary euphoria in downtown monument building in the 1980's, but those monuments are beginning to look like tombstones surrounded by the old crumbling cities.''
Like many other cities, Philadelphia, the nation's fifth largest, is in a desperate competition with its suburbs. More than 400,000 people, largely middle-class whites and blacks, have moved to the suburbs since 1950, when Philadelphia reached a peak population of 2.1 million. The flow out left behind a city with an increasingly poor, elderly and needy population that is about 45 percent black and about 5 percent Hispanic and Asian.
One of every four Philadelphians, including almost half its homeowners, lives below the poverty line. More than 260,000 residents receive public assistance, representing about 40 percent of the state's caseload. The city also produces about half of the prisoners in the state.
 
Decline in Federal Aid
While the city's population has shrunk and become poorer, problems like AIDS, homelessness, drugs and crime have increased rapidly.
Federal aid to Philadelphia declined from more than $250 million in 1981 to $54 million this year. County governments help other Pennsylvania cities like Pittsburgh, but Philadelphia is a county unto itself and, thus, cannot raise revenue from its suburbs.
Nor can the city tax its own residents as it wishes. State law limits the city's taxing authority, said Betsy Reveal, the city's finance director.
''My favorite example,'' she said, ''is that all the Ma and Pa groceries stores paid $3 million in taxes in 1988 while all the banks paid less than $500,000.'' The state limits the revenue taxes Philadelphia can impose on highly regulated business like banks and insurance companies.
Philadelphia has the nation's highest wage tax and the nation's highest transfer tax on real estate sales; both are about 5 percent. In addition, the city has the nation's highest automobile insurance rates, state officials say. People here also pay the highest fares for public transportation and taxi cabs. Housing, however, is relatively inexpensive, averaging $68,500 a house.
 
'An Evacuation Mentality'
Some academics say the city has spun out of control. ''I believe there is a total lack of faith in city government,'' said Jay Lamont, director of the Real Estate Institute at Temple University. ''There is definitely an evacuation mentality that has been accelerating in the last 12 months, particularly in Center City,'' he said, referring to the neighborhoods in and near downtown.
Overall residential real estate sales in the city slowed by 27 percent in the last six months, while sales in Center City slowed by 39 percent, according to the Philadelphia Board of Realtors. ''Our residential phone stopped ringing about last August; it's terrible,'' said Charles F. Seymour, chairman of the Jackson-Cross Company, a brokerage.
The boom of the 1970's and 80's, though dying, is still delivering some good economic news: five new hotels, major highway repairs and a huge convention center that is scheduled to open in 1993. The city has had moderate growth in jobs since 1983, after a 20-year decline, said Ted Hershberg, a professor of public policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
 
Mayor Defends City
Mayor Goode says the city is no worse off than any other major city and is in better condition in some respects, like safety. ''We're responding well to the crisis we find ourselves in,'' he said in a recent interview.
He said the city would be able to weather the financial crisis in the short term by selling property and restructuring debt. But he said the city could not remain ''competitive'' unless its tax system is revamped.
He also defended the quality of city services and challenged assertions of a growing disenchantment. ''I don't think there is an evacuation mentality at all,'' he said. ''Some people, because of crime, want to move, but that's no different than in Boston or New York.''
The city's crime rate increased 15.7 percent last year, the biggest one-year increase since 1980, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In Center City the Philadelphia police report a sharper increase. Even so, Philadelphia has the lowest crime rate of the nation's 10 largest cities, with 6,978 crimes per 100,000 residents.
 
'Situation Is Far Worse'
''The situation is far worse than the statistics show,'' said Craig Snyder. He is director of the Criminal Justice Task Force, a group of city leaders who advocated changes to speed the judicial system, and he is a Center City Republican running for the State House of Representatives this year.
''The fact is that property crime has been legalized in Philadelphia,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''There are 30,000 fugitives on the streets that no one is looking for,'' people who have been arrested for nonviolent crimes and released pending a court hearing because jails are full. Many then do not show up for the hearing.
Even Philadelphians who say they love the city say they hate what has happened. ''My property taxes have quadrupled in the last year and a half, and all I hear from city government is, 'We don't have enough money, we don't have enough money,' '' said Robert Kershaw, president of the Victoria Park Neighborhood Association in Center City.
More reductions in city services are likely this year because the $2.1 billion budget for the fiscal year 1991, which starts July 1, is based on the proposed new sales tax, which the city has no authority to impose but hopes the State Legislature will approve.
The budget also makes no provision for uncontrollable expenses, including pay and benefit increases for city employees and higher borrowing costs. Officials say those expenses could exceed $200 million. In lowering the city's bonding rating, Standard & Poor's said the new budget ''does not bode well for restoration of fiscal stability.'' Moody's Investors Service, the other large rating agency, has already given the city its lowest investment-grade rating and is considering reducing it further.
The reduction in bond rating could increase the city's borrowing costs, possibly by $10 million a year if Moody's also reduces the city's rating, said Ms. Reveal, the city's finance director.
She said the city could become insolvent if unbudgeted expenses rose to $100 million.
''The next 18 to 24 months are real touch and go, but if we get through those rocky waters we should be in for some smooth sailing,'' she said. If, that is, the State Legislature permits Philadelphia to revise its taxes.

HEADLINE: White House Urges $51 Billion Cut in Deficit

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The Bush Administration sought today to initiate serious bargaining with Congressional negotiators on how to cut the 1991 Federal budget deficit, proposing a plan aimed at reducing it by $51 billion.
The proposal, under which most of the cuts would come from reductions in spending for domestic programs, was presented as budget experts on both sides informed the negotiators that the 1991 deficit was now likely to be $20 billion higher, reaching a total of about $160 billion, than projected when preliminary talks began a month ago.
The new estimate does not include the costs of bailing out the savings and loan industry, an effort that will add tens of billions of dollars to Federal spending in the fiscal year 1991, beginning on Oct. 1 The Administration's proposal today came after Democrats on the Congressional negotiating team insisted that the White House make the first move in the bargaining process, warning that if serious negotiations were not under way in the next 10 days the talks might collapse.
 
Reluctance on Both Sides
With the November election campaigns preparing to shift into high gear, both sides have been reluctant to be identified with the kind of spending cuts or tax increases that would be necessary to cut the deficit significantly. 
In any case, lawmakers acknowledged that given the new estimate for a deficit of about $160 billion, even their most ambitious goals for a compromise package of spending cuts and tax increases would leave them far short of the amount needed to bring the deficit down to the $64 billion ceiling set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law.
Thus, it appeared more likely than ever today that Congress would have to raise that ceiling, although the negotiators pointedly refrained from saying so.
The Administration's proposal was offered in an oral presentation on Capitol Hill by Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director. Precise details were lacking, but the plan calls for the bulk of the $51 billion deficit reduction to come from spending cuts in domestic programs.
The proposal envisons some additional savings in the military budget that President Bush proposed in January, but no additions to the roughly $20 billion in user fees and other revenue increases that the President suggested then, according to Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
 
Some Private Complaints
While Democrats responded to the proposal publicly by calling it a starting point for serious talks, they were more critical privately, complaining that it placed too heavy a burden on domestic programs and too little on military programs. They also said it did not address the need for more revenue.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, also expressed concern that the savings envisioned over five years, estimated at $450 billion by Mr. Darman, fell short of the the $500 billion to $600 billion that Democrats have called for.
To complicate matters for the budget negotiators, the new deficit estimates do not include the costs of a bailout of failed savings and loan institutions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that operating costs for the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency managing the bailout, would add $68 billion to the deficit in 1991, while the Administration said that the bailout cost would add from $23 billion to $43 billion to next year's deficit.
Some lawmakers on the negotiating team said they were stunned when Mr. Darman told them today that the Administration was now estimating the deficit at $159 billion. That is just $3 billion less than the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, whose projections of the deficit have customarily been far higher than the Administration's. Just a month ago, Mr. Darman had told the negotiators that his highest estimate of the deficit was $138 billion.
 
Similar Economic Forecasts
The Administration and the Congressional Budget Office also agreed on assumptions about the economy over the next year, projecting growth of about 2.5 percent, inflation of slightly more that 4 percent and short-term interest rates at just under 7 percent.
But Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told reporters that part of the reason for the unusual concurrence was that his agency had been ordered by lawmakers to assume adoption of a significant defict-cutting package this year.
He said the economic forecast also assumed that the Federal Reserve Board would ease interest rates as a way to cushion the impact that deep spending cuts would have on the economy.
While the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office agreed on the forecast for next year, their projections for 1992 and beyond diverged, with the Administration taking a more optimistic view on growth, inflation and interest rates.
The economic assumptions are a critical factor in projecting the size of the deficit, since changes in unemployment rates, economic growth and inflation influence both the spending for various Government programs and the level of tax collections. Interest rates also have a large impact because they determine how much the Government must pay investors to finance the cost of the national debt.

HEADLINE: Both Parties Fault U.S. on Competitiveness

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
Trying to tap an issue that could figure in campaigns this fall, Democratic and Republican lawmakers today criticized the Bush Administration's policies on economic competitiveness.
Most surprising were the comments of Representative Newt Gingrich, a conservative from Georgia who is the Republican whip in the House of Representatives. Although Mr. Gingrich praised the Administration's efforts to reduce the capital gains tax to create more capital for private investment, he said House Republicans ''would probably be more aggressive and more intense'' than the White House.
Mr. Gingrich said House Republican leaders were seeking ''more activism from the White House.''
Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans provided a cost for their proposals for nurturing American industry, which were released at separate news conferences. The Democrats urged direct Government aid to high-technology companies. The Republicans' package focused on Government strategies like tax incentives and regulatory reform to help create private capital for American companies.
''This Administration has no strategy for dealing with high technology or the global marketplace,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader. ''And this failure means we're losing.''
Mr. Gephardt noted the rift in Republican ranks. ''There is a group in the Republican Party that is ideologically opposed to the Government doing anything to make sure America remains competitive,'' he said, ''but there are many Republicans who want to work with us.''

Cheering a Flip-Flop

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
When a politician changes his position, he or she is usually derided for a ''flip-flop.'' But here are two cheers for President Bush's about-face decision to help poor countries stop using chemicals destructive to earth's vital ozone shield.
A third cheer will be due when Mr. Bush flip-flops again and decides -as mounting evidence dictates - to take action now against global warming, the so-called ''greenhouse effect.'' Under counseling from his iron-fisted chief of staff, John Sununu, Mr. Bush is so far willing only to call for more study. 
That's like seeing Willie Horton at your front door, and asking him in to state his intentions before you call the cops.
Also on Mr. Sununu's bad advice, the President had welshed on a U.S. pledge to put up $25 million of a fund to help poor nations pay for substitute chemicals more ''ozone-friendly'' -but more expensive - than the damaging chlorofluorocarbons they've agreed to phase out. Under strong international and domestic pressures - including some from within the Administration - Mr. Bush reversed himself and Mr. Sununu last week.
That's not only an ozone-friendly flip-flop; it should also have profitable U.S. economic consequences. Nations like China and India, as they abandon chlorofluorocarbons, will need the substitutes - for instance, in China's home refrigeration program. Those countries alone have 40 percent of the world's population, and thus can offer a substantial market to U.S. manufacturers of chlorofluorocarbon substitutes.
Mr. Bush still is virtually isolated in the world in his reluctance to do anything about global warming. Standing alone, of course, is not necessarily a reason to change; nor is Mr. Sununu wrong that there is scientific uncertainty about the climatic consequences of the steady increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - an increase that is not in doubt.
The White House has insisted on awaiting an exhaustive study by more than 300 experts on the climate brought together by the United Nations. Last month, however, an ''executive summary'' of the U.N. survey was published in London - and it largely discredited the Sununu-Bush do-nothing policy.
With only a few dissenters, the panel concluded that if worldwide ''business as usual'' continues, the earth's global mean temperature could increase by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century. That would produce a global mean sea-level rise of 25 to 26 inches, with significant regional variations.
That's still an informed prediction, not an absolute certainty, since mathematical models of the atmosphere can vary; but it was the most authoritative conclusion yet reached by a credible scientific body. It was good enough, moreover, for Prime Minister Thatcher, who promptly announced her decision to reduce the projected growth of Britain's carbon dioxide emissions, stabilizing them at 1990 levels by the year 2005.
But just cutting the rise in emissions is too little, too late. The United Nations report called for a 60 percent immediate reduction in current greenhouse gas emissions, just to stabilize concentrations of those gases already in the atmosphere. Britain, moreover, emits only about 3 percent of carbon dioxide worldwide; the United States is responsible for about 25 percent.
Meanwhile, in an evenhanded article in next month's Scientific American, Robert M. White, a former chief of the U.S. Weather Bureau, suggests a rational list of high-priority, common-sense actions demanded by what is already known about global warming.
Mr. White, now president of the National Academy of Engineering, concedes the ambiguities of atmospheric models and projections and the seriousness of some scientific reservations. He concludes, nevertheless, that ''a wise course'' would be ''one that recognized uncertainty but would not permit that uncertainty to forestall action.''
He would begin with steps that also make sense ''for other economic and environmental reasons'' - first priority going to energy conservation and efficiency. A shift from coal and oil to natural gas would substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions; a more drastic move to non-fossil energy sources would be of even greater benefit. Reforestation and forest preservation would help absorb greenhouse gases.
Even such beginning steps will not be easily taken. Mr. White doubts that any policy course can do more than ''retard'' climate warming. And if even that much is to be accomplished, George Bush - or maybe only John Sununu - needs to do another flip-flop, soon.

Hailing Mandela Can Be Easier Than Hailing Cab

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
During the nine years that he has lived in New York, Victor Mashabela has grown accustomed to the vicissitudes of getting a taxicab in Manhattan. ''It's a problem,'' he said. First, Mr. Mashabela figured some cabbies were simply reluctant to go as far as the Bronx, where he lives, from the office building in which he works on Second Avenue in midtown. Then he suspected another motivation. After all, some drivers hadn't even stopped to ask his destination. ''They just pass me by,'' he said. Mr. Mashabela is a 34-year-old black man. He works for the African National Congress in New York. And yesterday while many New Yorkers were hailing Nelson Mandela, the A.N.C.'s deputy president, some of them, simply because they are black, were still having trouble hailing a cab.
Drivers' typical rationale for bypassing them underscores two trends that conspire to make black people disproportionate targets: lingering fears about personal security, which routinely prompt many whites to shun blacks on the statistical grounds that they are predisposed to crime, and racial segregation, which may suggest to a cabby that any neighborhood in which a black passenger is likely to live is one that the driver would rather avoid. 
Legal barriers to integration here were dismantled years ago. Yet while the official policy evoked by the word apartheid no longer exists in this country, the legacy of the word's derivation - the state of being apart - nonetheless endures.
That Yusuf K. Hawkins, a black teen-ager, apparently had no compunctions about going to Bensonhurst, a predominantly white Brooklyn neighborhood, last summer reflected an emerging ubiquity among blacks.
That he was killed by a gang of whites, largely because he was black, suggested that the city may be more like an ill-fitting jigsaw puzzle than the gorgeous mosaic that David N. Dinkins, New York's first black mayor, often celebrates.
In Mr. Dinkins's victory itself last year, blacks hurdled an electoral bar that had been bending inevitably, but slowly, to political gravity. But gains in integrating politics or the work place have not been matched in housing, in particular.
For years, additional blacks were barred from certain city housing projects and high schools to maintain artificially a racial balance acceptable to whites, who are typically more tolerant when they constitute a majority.
While New York is not the nation's most segregated city, by one measure four in five blacks would have to move in order for the races to be randomly distributed in the New York region.
While class and economic differences are factors, ''it's pretty clearly race,'' says Dr. Douglas S. Massey of the University of Chicago's Population Research Center. ''Blacks earning $50,000 or more are almost as segregated as those earning less than $2,500.''
Two years ago, Dr. Richard R. Green was named the city's first black schools chancellor. But he was apparently unable to penetrate another white refuge. Dr. Green and three other black executives - Darwin N. Davis, a senior vice president of Equitable Life Assurance Company; John L. Jones, personnel director of Xerox's American operations, and George Lewis, vice president and treasurer of the Philip Morris Companies - regularly played golf at public courses because, Mr. Davis said, no private country club in Westchester or Fairfield Counties invited them to join. (Mr. Lewis has since joined St. Andrews Golf Club, in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.).
No country clubs are on Mr. Mandela's itinerary this week. Instead, at Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, where more than 9 in 10 students are black, he implored youngsters yesterday to raise money for better schools in South Africa, where parents were alarmed last year when only 42 percent of black high school seniors passed their final examinations.
Of those students who graduated from Boys and Girls last June, only 2.3 percent received Regents-endorsed diplomas. Tonight, Mr. Mandela is to tour Harlem, where the death rate for blacks under the age of 65 is almost three times that of American whites.
To a city drained by recurring rancor from last summer's killing in Bensonhurst, lionizing a hero from abroad offers an uplifting launch to summer, 1990 - more uplifting than hunting villains or parallels at home.
''New York is better than South Africa,'' Seloka Phirwea, of the African National Congress's New York office, said yesterday. ''But there is not unlimited access. It's not legal, but at the same time there is a race problem.
''You can't legislate people's attitudes,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Authorities Release Profile of Gunman Haunted by Zodiac

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
The gunman who the police believe has shot three people since March 8 and is obsessed with the 12 signs of the zodiac is a loner with a limited education who may be acting out of a desire for attention, authorities theorized yesterday.
But a profile prepared by a special police task force also indicated that the publicity the gunman has already received may be enough to satisfy his need for attention. 
''His desire could be satisfied,'' Chief of Detectives Joseph R. Borrelli. ''We may never hear from him again.''
 
Analyzing the Letters
Chief Borrelli said the the task force had enlisted the help of astrologers, graphologists and psychologists to analyze letters and other evidence in an attempt to produce an accurate profile of the gunman, who has wounded three people in an eight-block area of the East New York section of Brooklyn and neighboring Woodside, Queens.
The police say the man has written three cryptic letters with information about the shooting, sending two to the press and leaving one at the scene of the third shooting.
Based on the manner and style of his writing, Chief Borrelli said the task force has reported that the man may be unemployed and may, at best, have a high school diploma.
There have been no witnesses to the shootings and the only description came from a 78-year old man who was using a cane when he was shot on May 31. The man described the gunman as an unkempt man in his early 30's, about 6 feet tall and 180 pounds, with a mustache and beard. In the last shooting, the police said that the gunman wore a Navy watch cap or a ski mask.

Give the Loot to the 'Amateurs'

BYLINE: By Ira Berkow

 BODY:
The $64 million question for the National Collegiate Athletic Association is: What to do with the extra $64 million - or even as much as $75 million - it will receive from its new television basketball contract with CBS?
It was reported yesterday that an N.C.A.A. committee responsible for disbursing some of the revenue obtained through a rich television agreement with CBS made its first recommendations on Monday. But it failed to come up with a formula for distributing the windfall. I have the formula: Give it to the players. Split up those millions among the entertainers themselves who make the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament such a great attraction. The tournament is not an academic event. It is such a high level of entertainment, in fact, that the TV deal calls for the N.C.A.A. member schools to receive $1 billion over the next seven years. 
In round figures, that total looks like this: $1,000,000,000.00.
The players are the ones who labor, who in essence are the employees of the university, and who are generally overworked and underpaid. Even Bear Bryant said these people aren't student athletes. ''They are athletes first and students second,'' said the Bear. That is, they are pros.
It's true that players are given scholarships to school. But in too many cases, they don't get an education. They just get a tuition.
Some will quibble about that, and talk about educational opportunites. But the number of hours needed for sports, and the lesser hours available for studies, hamper the academic pursuits of even those who are truly interested in books.
Others, like Sean Higgins, who just left the University of Michigan after his junior year of eligibility to try his luck in the N.B.A., are, as he said, in school to showcase basketball talents.
Some critics will say, well, aren't there other good areas in the field of education where these millions should go, such as to disadvantaged students, or to teachers, or even to a library? The answer, of course, is yes, and no.
At most universities with big-time sports programs, the athletic department is independent from the rest of the university, and the money it generates often goes right back into a larger and larger program. And when an athletic department does give money to some other needy exponent of the university, it is often news.
Last November, the athletic department of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill donated $100,000 to the general library system on campus. This was so unusual in the athletic course of events around the country, apparently, that it inspired the university to send press releases from coast to coast heralding this largesse.
But in the free-market system, the accepted economic structure of the United States of America, the money that is triggered by the players should go in some equitable part to those who labor for it. They earned it, toiling with success in the basketball vineyards for six months.
Rock stars get their financial due, but revenue-producing college athletes don't. In his article ''Sports and Antitrust'' for the June 1990 issue of the Notre Dame Law Review, Lee Goldman of the University of Detroit Law School notes that in 1987, the Nebraska football team reportedly earned $11 million in revenues, and paid out $150,000 in scholarships. Something's amiss in the system.
The working stiffs should get greater compensation. It's only right, morally, ethically and maybe even legally, as Professor Goldman contends.
Meanwhile, there's $64 million or more floating around. Prof. William L. Silber, in the department of economics and finance at N.Y.U., and Henry Feldman, a Manhattan C.P.A., helped me with the following figures for my idea of disbursement of the minimum $64 million:
If each of the 64 teams in the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament has 15 players, then each player in the first round would be guaranteed $48,483.85. The players on the top 16 teams would each receive $96,969.70. The players on the top four teams $193,939.90 apiece.
There are many other ways to break this down, of course, including the players on the No. 1 team getting more than No. 2, and No. 2 getting more than Nos. 3 and 4.
One might also just make it easy and let each of the 64 teams split the $64 million evenly, $1 million for each team. Or allow each of the nearly 300 Division I schools to split the $64 million.
Now, the coaches might holler. But many of them are getting large amounts of money to begin with - as much as $1 million a year from enterprises including TV shows and sneaker deals, which players, as ''amateurs,'' are not allowed to share in. Of course, players could vote their coach a share of their earnings; it's up to their individual sense of generosity, or it depends upon what they will have agreed - or just a greed.
It is, after all, the American way.

HEADLINE: House of 2 Faces: Prim and Romantic

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOUTHOLD, L.I., June 15

 BODY:
Perfection it was not.
Four years ago, Douglas Peix purchased an unassuming one-story saltbox, which the previous owners, to borrow a phrase from historic preservationists, had ''remuddled.'' Out went the cutesy shutters, the phony plastic scallop-shell sink, the fake stained wood, the mousy wall-to-wall carpeting and the dreaded dropped ceiling that hid 17th-century beams in the dining room.
In came a folly in the backyard and a two-story porch that Mr. Peix, a partner in the New York architectural firm of Peix & Crawford, describes as ''small-scale monumental.'' 
While architects to the south in the Hamptons are busy building ''modernist houses vying with each other for attention,'' Mr. Peix (pronounced ''pikes'') said, he chose a different route.
He bought the small six-room 1653 house on a quarter acre next to an abandoned orchard and transformed it from a maiden aunt into a tasteful but glamorous belle.
From the street, the house looks like Puritan New England. But behind the clematis-covered trellis in the backyard, it goes wildly romantic. The dual personality suits its architect, who has a passion for the picturesque. ''I've always liked towers,'' he said of the 18-foot-high folly in the backyard. ''I wanted it to be romantic and mysterious, like Rapunzel's tower.''
To create his weekend world-within-a-world, Mr. Peix did not add space. Rather, over four years, he worked with the existing 1,500-square-foot house, prized, he said, because ''it had a lot of character - it leans.'' By tearing down a few unsightly sheds and taking out a few walls, then adding his own imagination plus some unheated space, he altered it forever.
Hedge House - ''I suppose I was looking for alliteration,'' Mr. Peix said - was remodeled at a cost of approximately $58,000. The folly cost about $8,000, and the porch, around $16,000. The house is ''a laboratory,'' the 45-year-old architect said. ''I try to work on things here that clients might say don't make any sense.''
Like many old houses, Mr. Peix's was a warren of little rooms. The first thing he did was to install a window with both stained glass and leaded panes to open up the view in the dining room.
In a move that might seem ornery, he next sealed off the front door, keeping the side door open for visitors. The proximity to the sidewalk was too close for his comfort. A nonworking front door is ''the ultimate solution for warding off door-to-door salespeople,'' he said.
The architect's property is not exactly rambling. To make the yard look bigger, he used a visual trick beloved of Renaissance painters: forced perspective. The lattices and fences that surround the house actually recede, starting at a height of about seven feet and getting slightly shorter toward the back.
Perhaps only an architect could look at a tumbledown shed and see visions of an electric train set. In one of the most dramatic transformations, Mr. Peix tore down the shed and replaced it with a copper-roofed folly inspired by Lionel's rail-yard towers (''I envision a switching mechanism up there,'' he said).
The folly, a device often used by dotty 19th-century British landscape architects, now houses garden tools on the ground floor and a futon and deck chairs in the nook above. It is a cozy, meditative place, ''a place to have a vacation from the house,'' the architect said.
In the summertime, luxurious thickets of clematis snake their way up the sides, adding to the poetic mood. Mr. Peix drew on regional vernacular architectural styles, including clapboard shingles and sloped roofs. Over the steps leading to the top of the folly, there is a birdhouse, a copy of a house Mr. Peix designed in Warren, Conn.
The architect positioned the folly at an angle to the main house, visually expanding the backyard still further. Unaccustomed to follies, dubious local building inspectors, concerned about zoning codes, dropped a tape measure to verify the height. The neighbors are now won over, the architect said, but one fretted that the folly was going to ''look like a border guard tower.''
Inside the house, Mr. Peix rebuilt two living-room fireplaces into one with secondhand bricks. Upstairs, he converted a bedroom into a bathroom and dressing room, adding crown moldings, an old tub and a window by Frank Lloyd Wright for atmosphere. He inserted an octagonal window where two tiny windows used to be.
But chiefly, he redid the kitchen. The architect wanted a double pitched roof, to disguise the flat tract-house slope of the remodeled original. He added an old arched weathered door, a work island and vaguely Viennese beams with cove lighting.
To rebuild the kitchen, he had to tear down another ramshackle shed. Its demolition led to the architectural tour de force: a two-story open-air porch worthy of Tara. The porch was inspired at least in part by economy. ''It's cheaper to build open than enclosed,'' Mr. Peix said. The porch is 12 feet by 12 feet, the same dimensions as the late unsightly shed. It has a red hip roof, as opposed to the driftwood gray familiar on Eastern Long Island. Although small, it feels heroic, due to the presence of a skeletal wall of columns, a sort of classy architectural tick-tack-toe board. It may be the only renovation in America whose look is based on a facade painted by Piero della Francesca in his fresco series, ''The Legend of the True Cross.''
But Mr. Peix added an unabashedly childlike element: a built-in stepladder, which handily transports the intrepid architect upward to the gutters and skylight, an idea borrowed from an Off Broadway theater. ''I didn't want to have to drag a ladder out to do the cleaning,'' he said.
The porch is now an outdoor living room, complete with ceiling fan. Sitting there, overlooking a garden filled with herbs, blueberry bushes, arborvitae, peonies, foxgloves and poppies, it feels both monumental and intimate, a ''juxtapostion of formal and informal,'' the architect said.
The house keeps its historic character while accommodating its architect's yen for innovation. As with all houses, there is a moral to the story. You might think of it as ''The Little House That Could.''
''Spend money on doors and windows,'' Mr. Peix advised. ''Even a simple house can be wonderful.''

A Vision Beyond the New Gilded Age

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

The Politics of Rich and Poor
Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath
By Kevin Phillips
Illustrated. 262 pages. Random House. $19.95.
In his first book, ''The Emerging Republican Majority'' (1969), Kevin Phillips correctly predicted the coming conservative era in American national politics. Now, two decades later, in a book that he might well have called ''The Emerging Democratic Majority'' but that he has chosen instead to name ''The Politics of Rich and Poor: Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath,'' Mr. Phillips predicts that in the 1990's the pendulum will swing back again and a shift to more liberal politics will ensue. 
This will happen, he reasons, because wealth has become too concentrated as a result of the Reagan era's policies. ''The 1980's were a second Gilded Age,'' he writes, ''in which many Americans made and spent money abundantly. Yet as the decade ended, too many stretch limousines, too many enormous incomes and too much high fashion foreshadowed a significant shift of mood. A new plutocracy - some critics were even using the word 'oligarchy' - had created a new target for populist reaction.''
The pendulum must swing because it has in the past, he states. Though Mr. Phillips warns against making too much of ''historical parallels,'' he can't resist comparing the 1980's to the Gilded Age and the Roaring Twenties, each of which resembled the other in 10 significant ways (''conservative politics,'' ''difficulties for labor,'' ''tax reduction,'' ''concentration of wealth,'' and so forth), and each of which was followed by eras of relative progressivism.
''Lacking a hereditary aristocracy or Establishment,'' he writes, ''our leadership elites and the alignment of wealth are more the product of political cycles than elsewhere.'' As he concludes, ''The genius of American politics - failing only in the Civil War - has been to manage through ballot boxes and electoral votes the problems that less fluid societies resolve with party structures geared to class warfare and even with barricades.''
How will the next shift occur and what will it bring? Mr. Phillips - who has also written ''Mediacracy: American Parties and Politics in the Communications Age,'' ''Post-Conservative America'' and ''Staying on Top: The Business Case for a National Industrial Strategy'' - scrupulously avoids predictions.
Instead he concentrates most of his book on analyzing exactly how the Reagan Presidency altered the nation's economic landscape. He shows, for instance, how ''it takes a decade or more for the G.O.P. to shift from broad middle-class 'nationalism' into 'capitalist overdrive,' '' and how Richard Nixon, ''an altogether middle-class figure,'' did not ''unleash capitalism'' nearly to the extent that Ronald Reagan did.
He examines closely the traditional Republican methods of disinflation, limited government, less regulation of business, reduced taxation and high interest rates by which wealth was concentrated during the Reagan era, and he shows how the resulting shift of a few percentage points in the share of income held by the top 1 percent of Americans led to ''the emergence of four dozen U.S. billionaires . . . with a supporting cast of a hundred thousand decamillionaires.'' This represented ''a plutographic revolution comparable to that of the late 19th century.''
Finally, he analyzes who was hurt because of the shift in income, and concludes that it was young people, women, blacks, union members and farmers, precisely the makings of a revived Democratic coalition.
His analysis is compelling, if occasionally tedious in its poring over statistics and charts. If it seems odd that he now appears on the side of the Democrats where he once served as chief political analyst for the 1968 Republican Presidential campaign, one can only conclude that he shares the vision of the economist Joseph Schumpeter, who, Mr. Phillips writes, viewed capitalism as being ''profoundly unconservative by any standard except its respect for market forces and moneymaking.'' As Mr. Phillips concludes: ''Populists and progressives are not alone in opposing the 'malefactors of great wealth.' ''
His analysis is also a little frightening. According to the chart in which he compares three Republican ''heyday periods,'' the Gilded Age ended with the Panic of 1893 and ''subsequent depression,'' the Roaring Twenties ended with the Crash of 1929 and ''subsequent depression,'' and the 1980's ended with the ''Crash of 1987, mini-crash of 1989 and relevant events of the 1990's.'' This sounds ominous, to say the least.
Of course, one might seek comfort in the one significant way that, in Mr. Phillips's analysis, the 1980's have differed from the earlier heyday periods of capitalism - namely, the creation of the enormous national deficit and the consequent raising of foreign countries' stakes in the country's fortunes. Perhaps the increasing foreign ownership of America's property and resources will help to soften the impact of what Mr. Phillips refers to so chillingly as the ''relevant events of the 1990's''?
Mr. Phillips doesn't hold out that hope. He merely speaks slightingly of the way we have been selling our birthright: ''Policies of sharp tax-bracket reductions, unprecedented Federal deficits and borrowing at high real interest rates, along with deregulation, permissive finance, massive borrowing overseas and consequent sales of U.S. assets and companies, accelerated America's relative economic decline beyond what would have occurred in a less avaricious environment.''
And his final words leave the reader up in the air: ''What would develop . . . remained to be seen. But normally optimistic Americans spoke of the future with foreboding, and the decade ended as it had begun: amid a rising imperative for a new political and economic outlook, and with the imminent prospect of a very different chapter in the annals of the wealth and power of the United States.''

HEADLINE: Leadership Changing At Chase

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
In a changing of the guard that reflects the ascendancy of the consumer banking business, the Chase Manhattan Corporation announced yesterday that Willard C. Butcher, chairman, would be replaced by Thomas G. Labrecque, president, and that Arthur F. Ryan would become the new president.
The changes, which will be effective at the end of October, were not surprising but were announced sooner than planned. Mr. Labrecque, 51 years old, has been president and Mr. Butcher's heir apparent for nine years. Mr. Ryan's success at developing Chase's consumer banking businesses had made him a favorite for the No. 2 job.
Mr. Butcher said the changes were announced several months earlier than expected in order to precede a major revamping and cost-cutting program in the bank's corporate finance businesses. ''We wanted to make the line of succession clear and avoid speculation,'' Mr. Butcher said. ''We now have a man of judgment in Labrecque and a great implementor in Ryan.'' 
Arthur P. Sotor, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said, ''The promotion of Art Ryan is a reminder of the fact that Chase and Citibank, two of the biggest wholesale banks in the country, are today making as much or more profit from their retail activities than from the traditional banking activities with corporations.''
 
Branch Network Improves
Under Mr. Ryan, Chase improved its branch network in New York City and greatly expanded consumer financial businesses like credit cards, student and mortgage loans, and automobile leasing. During 1989 those activities and others included in the individual banking group earned more than $300 million, or about half the profit the company would have earned had it not taken special charges to cover things like troubled loans to less developed countries.
''Nobody will ever mistake me for an expert in mergers and acquisitions or a credit officer,'' Mr. Ryan said. But he added that earlier in his career, when he was head of the data processing area, he became familiar with the basic operations of corporate lending and other areas of the bank.
A quick-smiling, fast-talking executive who will admit to a more than occassional urge for a cigarette, Mr. Ryan, 47, was born in Brooklyn and has a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Providence College in Rhode Island.
Mr. Labrecque, who many analysts credit as the executive most responsible for the decisions to expand retail banking activities and tighten expense controls, has been a prominent executive since the mid-1970's when he was involved in New York City's financial crisis. Tall and smooth talking, Mr. Labrecque has spoken frequently about the need for American banks to have broader powers in the securities and insurance businesses.
Mr. Labrecque said that as chairman, ''My primary focus will be the strategic and competitive positioning of the bank, corporate financial management, and helping Art on the day to day issues.''
Mr. Butcher, 63, who succeeded David Rockefeller as chairman of Chase in 1981, led the bank during a decade when its traditional strength as a lender to businesses was hard hit by competition from foreign banks and the shift by large corporations to raising money in the securities markets rather than borrowing from banks.
Besides reductions in personnel and other expenses in the corporate finance or wholesale lending part of the bank, Mr. Butcher said, ''We have to deal with some real estate things.'' As a major lender for commercial real estate projects, analysts expect that Chase has been hit in recent months with a large increase in problem loans, which will require it to set aside addtional reserves to cover losses.
 
Pending Changes
The three executives declined to comment on the reorganization at Chase, except to say that it is pending. Analysts say they expect the banking company to announce major cuts in employment, concentrating on its wholesale lending business in the United States and Europe. Chase, which is currently the second-largest banking company in the country behind Citicorp, may also announce the sale of some assets or even whole businesses.
The retail banking business, which has been growing by more than 15 percent annually, is not expected to be much affected by the revamping. With profits of about $1 for every $100 of assets, the retail banking businesses managed by Mr. Ryan earn a return of about 20 percent on the equity capital needed to operate them.
The star of the retail banking business is Chase's credit card business. Mr. Ryan has pushed the business to higher profits by overseeing the development of computerized systems to spot risky customers and reduce the transaction costs.

HEADLINE: House Unit Votes Curb On Insurers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The House Judiciary Committee approved legislation today that would strip insurance companies of most of their exemptions from antitrust law.
The approval was the first a Congressional committee had ever given to any amendment to the 45-year-old McCarran-Ferguson Act, which gives the insurance industry protection from the antitrust restrictions that apply to other industries.
The measure is not likely to become law this year, but the committee's action indicated that the issue is expected to be a hot one in Congress next year.
''The Judiciary Committee has crafted a bill that will allow the brisk winds of competition to blow in the insurance industry,'' said Representative Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and chief sponsor of the legislation. 
He said his measure would lead to lower rates and better coverage for consumers.
The insurance industry vigorously opposes the bill, mainly on the ground that unlike most other businesses that are free of regulation, its prices and products are regulated by state agencies.
 
Supported by Democrats
The committee approved the bill by a vote of 19 to 17. All the votes in favor of the measure came from Democrats. Three Democrats joined the panel's 14 Republicans in voting against it.
Congressional aides said Mr. Brooks would bring the bill before the full House for a vote this year if a preliminary nose count showed it would pass. The close vote in his committee probably reflects the division of the House as a whole, and aides on both sides of the question said they could not predict how such a vote would go.
In any event, a vote in the Senate is not scheduled this year. A subcommittee is holding a series of hearings and plans to hold more next year.
That means that even if the House passes the measure this year, the bill will die and will have to be reintroduced in a new Congress next year.
The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 exempts insurance companies from all rules against monopolies except for acts of ''intimidation, coercion and boycotts.'' In practice, that has meant that companies selling casualty and liability insurance, primarily automobile and homeowner policies, have been free to share data and set prices among themselves. Life insurance companies for the most part do not do this.
 
Challenged by Consumers
Consumer groups have long contended that the exemption was unjustified. But the insurance lobby, which has representatives in every Congressional district, is one of the most influential in Washington, and the industry has been able to thwart all previous attempts to rewrite the law.
The bill was given political impetus by a revolt in many states in recent years against the high cost of insurance. California voters, for example, approved a referendum two years ago that rolled back automobile insurance rates. Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, who was elected last November, made an attack on the insurance industry a centerpiece of his campaign.
The Brooks bill would outlaw price-fixing and the allocation of markets by regions. It would also prohibit the common practice of tying the sale of one form of insurance to another. Some companies, for example, will not sell automobile insurance to a customer unless that customer also buys a homeowner policy.
 
Democrats' Strategy
One of the reasons many Democrats in the House would like to bring the Brooks bill to a vote this year, even though it stands no chance of becoming law, is to force Republicans into what might be an uncomfortable vote on the side of the industry.
David Farmer, who heads the Washington office of the Alliance of American Insurers, one of the main industry lobbying organizations, said today that the bill would not result in lower rates for consumers. Insurance rates, he argued, are ''driven by losses, and this bill does nothing to address the rising cost of medical care, safer cars or tougher highway enforcement standards.''
Mr. Farmer said consumers profited from the ''economies of scale'' that resulted from insurers working together. Moreover, he said, insurance companies deserve an antitrust exemption because they are required by state regulators to offer certain lines of unprofitable coverage, like policies for poor drivers, and to participate in pools in which successful companies cover the losses of those that go out of business.
He said the industry would fight the legislation vigorously.
On the other side, J. Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, said insurance companies had become ''the Eastern Europe of American enterprise.''
The practical effect of the Brooks bill, he said, would be to spur the growth of more efficient companies and ''reduce prices over time as competition takes hold.''

HEADLINE: Fed Report Sees Growth As Sluggish

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The economy is continuing to grow sluggishly, although the construction sector appears to be weakening, the Federal Reserve said today in releasing results of a survey of its 12 district banks.
''The tone of district reports suggests continued slow growth in the economy with little change in the underlying inflation rate,'' a summary of the survey said.
The results of the survey, completed June 8, were similar to those of three others this year that found slow but continued economic expansion, with moderate inflation. 
The survey was conducted by the Cleveland district bank for use at the meeting on July 2 and 3 by the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.
 
Worry About Tight Credit
The Fed has kept a tight grip on credit to slow the economy and reduce inflationary pressure. Some officials and economists say the economy has slowed too much and could slide into recession if the Fed does not loosen its grip.
One sign of sluggishness, the survey found, was ''very little growth, if not a decline, in real consumer spending for durable and nondurable goods this quarter from last.'' Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Retail sales, about half of consumer spending, fell in May for the third consecutive month, the Commerce Department reported last week. The last time that retail sales declined for three straight months was in the fall of 1981, during the last recession.
''Both residential and nonresidential construction have been edging downward in recent months in most districts,'' the survey said, ''and indicators of future construction suggest further softening.''
 
Excess Supply of Office Space
The report said, ''An underlying problem in commercial construction is an apparent excess supply of new office space in many parts of the country,'' particularly downtown Manhattan and in metropolitan areas of the Dallas district.
Credit demand appears to be easing, while real estate, consumer and business loans are still growing, although at reduced rates, the report said.
''Lenders are reported to have tightened standards, especially for real estate loans, but there is still little information that suggests credit restraint is spreading to other markets,'' the survey found.
 
Manufacturing Sector Flat
It reported that manufacturing production has been relatively flat for several months. This sector has been particularly affected by the Fed's high-interest rate policies, since many of its products are purchased with loans.
Automobile and related industries have been a drag on manufacturing in the Atlanta district, but Chicago and Cleveland respondents noted some strengthening in production.
''In contrast, the aerospace industry is a source of strength in several regions of the country (Boston, Minneapolis and San Francisco) and the energy sector is expanding (Dallas and Kansas City),'' it added.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 1.74 Points on Sluggish Volume

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices ended the day with a thin gain, after rising in early trading and then quickly falling. Volume continued to be sluggish.
By closing time, the Dow Jones industrial average stood at 2,895.30, up 1.74 points. Volume rose slightly, to 137.42 million shares, from 134.9 million the day before, with 777 issues down and 668 ahead. 
The big drag on the stock and bond market appeared to be yesterday's survey of economic conditions around the country as reported in the so-called beige book from the nation's 12 Federal Reserve banks.
''The tone of district reports,'' said the Federal Reserve's summary of the findings, ''suggests continued slow growth in the economy with little change in the underlying inflation rate.''
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said, ''What they're saying is that economic conditions are weakening and the beige book is confirming that. The upshot is that economic weakness is accumulating and inflation is becoming less of a concern.''
Gains among the 30 industrial blue chips were relatively minor. Alcoa - up 1, to 66 - was the only stock in the group to gain as much as a point. Alcoa officials said they knew of no reason to account for the rise.
Upjohn, the pharmaceutical company and long a rumored takeover target, rose 2 1/8, to 42 1/8, in heavy trading. Schering-Plough, another often-rumored takeover candidate, rose 1, to 46, also in heavy trading.
 
Haven in Drug Stocks
Schering's chairman, Robert P. Luciano, told analysts that the company expected earnings this year to rise at least 18 percent. But drug stocks are a traditional haven during uncertain times and volume in drug stocks yesterday was particularly strong.
Abbott Labs rose 1, to 40, with more than one million shares traded after Mimi Cutler Willard, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, recommended the stock. Bausch & Lomb rose 1, to 65 3/4. Warner Lambert rose 1 5/8, to 63. Johnson & Johnson gained 7/8, to 64 5/8.
Nike, which makes athletic shoes, rose 2 5/8, to 77 5/8, in heavy trading after Heidi Steinberg, who follows the stock at Salomon Brothers, recommended it on price weakness and because she expected strong profits this year.
On the Amex, Binks Manufacturing rose 2 1/4, to 42, on news of a takeover bid. Kelso Management, which owns 7.7 percent, said an unidentified Chicago company had offered much more than the $45 earlier bid by the Illinois Tool Works.

HEADLINE: House Panel Approves Measure on Penny Stocks

BYLINE: By GREGORY A. ROBB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
A House subcommittee today approved by voice vote a measure that calls for increased Federal oversight of the penny stock market.
The legislation is a compromise version of a bill that would have banned certain types of penny stock practices considered abusive but that still increases the amount of information available to investors.
Congressional aides predicted that it would now move quickly through the House. But they said it was still unclear whether the Senate would pass the measure. The legislation was approved today by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance with little debate. 
 
Powers for S.E.C. Voted
In a separate vote, the subcommittee, as expected, approved a package of new enforcement powers for the Securities and Exchange Commission. That bill would allow the commission to seek monetary fines for Federal securities law violations besides insider trading and would give the agency the power to impose temporary cease-and-desist orders.
Penny stocks are low-priced securities that trade over the counter but are not listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system. They trade chiefly in the so-called pink sheets, the printed listings of brokers' offers to buy and sell that are distributed daily among dealers in the stocks.
The S.E.C. and the National Association of Securities Dealers had opposed the provisions of the original penny stock bill as unneccessary because they believed that significant progress had been made by Federal and state regulators in policing the industry.
 
Objections Removed
Since the bill was introduced, negotiations among the staffs of the parties involved have led to changes, and the securities commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers removed their objections to the current measure.
Under the legislation passed today, the S.E.C., which had been seeking more flexibility to set rules governing penny stocks, was given the power to pass rules increasing the amount of information that penny stock brokers must disclose to their clients.
The original measure would have banned ''blind pool'' and ''blank check'' offerings, which allow only cursory disclosure of business plans and which critics say are a common vehicle for fraud and abuse, but the S.E.C. felt that such a ban would have curtailed legitimate capital-raising by small companies and the commission sought the power instead to increase disclosure.
A ''blank check'' company proposes to sell stock to the public and use the investors' money to shop around for some other business to buy. No business plans or details are provided. A ''blind pool'' offering simply indicates the general sector of the economy in which investments will be made.
In addition, the bill restricts use of the proceeds raised from such ''blind pool'' and ''blank check'' offerings until the issuer gives details about how the money will be used and shareholders will be able to rescind their stock purchases if they are not pleased with the decisions.
In another area of compromise, the new bill instructs the S.E.C. to facilitate the development of an electronic trading system for penny stocks instead of mandating such a system.
The N.A.S.D. had opposed a measure in the original bill that would have mandated that it review all penny stock offerings. This measure was shelved. Instead, the S.E.C. will report to Congress in one year about the adequacy of all stock exchange and N.A.S.D. rules relating to penny stocks.
''What we've tried to draft here is a laser beam piece of legislation, zeroing in on the penny stock market,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, the chairman of the subcommittee and a co-sponsor of the bill.

HEADLINE: A Savings Fiasco in Texas Ends at a Fire-Sale Price

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 21

 BODY:
In the mid-1980's the Stonebridge Ranch, a 6,250-acre development planned as a sprawling community of million-dollar homes, scenic golf courses and 13 man-made lakes, symbolized the vigor of the North Texas economy and the optimism of the aggressive savings and loan that poured an estimated $330 million into buying and upgrading the property.
The Federal Government on Wednesday agreed to sell Stonebridge Ranch, 30 miles north of Dallas, to a Japanese industrialist for $61 million. The savings and loan that once backed the development so eagerly was seized by the Government 18 months ago, after it was declared insolvent. The losses of nearly $270 million will be paid for by the American taxpayer.
The sale is a striking example of the losses the Government is likely to face as it sells off the real estate it has seized from insolvent savings and loans - a crucial element in the Federal bailout of the industry. 
''We taxpayers aren't going to realize anything close to our cost in Stonebridge and hundreds of other similar projects,'' said Frederick E. Roe, a Dallas investment manager. ''It's probably typical of what we can expect in the future.''
The short history of how Stonebridge Ranch absorbed and then lost so much money is a story of the unrestrained ambition of local developers, heedless lending by aggressive savings executives, and the connections between the two groups.
 
Prominent Shareholders
In this case, the story includes politically prominent Texas businessmen who were important shareholders in the savings and loan that backed the development: Robert S. Strauss, chairman of the Democratic Party during the Carter Administration; his son, Richard C. Strauss, and J. Livingston Kosberg, a nursing home owner and an active fund-raiser for the Democratic Party in Texas.
Although their roles have been examined by regulators, none of the three have been charged with misconduct in the failure of the Gibraltar Savings Association and its parent, the First Texas Financial Corporation, or in the losses suffered by Stonebridge Ranch.
The new owner of Stonebridge Ranch, assuming a bankruptcy court approves, is Yukio Kitano, an industrialist in Osaka, who has large real estate holdings in Hawaii. Real estate experts said it was the largest investment by any Japanese business in Texas real estate.
Mr. Kitano's agent, George Meyer, said his client hopes to persuade Japanese manufacturers to put American operations at the site. He said that part of the site is zoned for light industry and that the Government had kept the property in ''beautiful condition'' since taking control of it. ''There's not a blade of grass out of place,'' he said.
He said Mr. Kitano visited the site for the first time last week. ''He could see the possibilities, and he just loved it,'' Mr. Meyer said.
The area is near a cluster of offices of American corporations. The J. C. Penney Company is building its new corporate headquarters within 15 minutes of Stonebridge Ranch. Sprawling suburban office complexes of large companies, including the Frito-Lay division of Pepsico Inc., the Electronic Data Systems division of the General Motors Corporation and Texas Instruments Inc. also are nearby.
Mr. Kitano won the right to buy Stonebridge in a competitive auction. Other bidders included the Mobil Corporation and H. Ross Perot, the Texas computer entrepreneur.
 
Government Defends Price
For its part, the Government says that given today's real estate market in Texas, the price was reasonable.
''The sales price we received is a good indication of the market value of the asset,'' said Frank Campagna, a Government official who has acted as manager of the project.
The 270 homeowners living at Stonebridge Ranch have apparently suffered little from the development's financial troubles. The sidewalks, roads, golf courses, hiking trails and lakes are already built. The development is designed for some 27,000 homes and apartments, with the management company selling land to private contractors, who then build homes on the lots. Since it opened in 1988, the prices of lots sold to home builders have risen somewhat.
Still, by the time the project opened the development funds were already sunk into the Stonebridge Ranch and real estate prices had plunged from the levels of a few years earlier.
 
A Symbol of Ambition
Stonebridge Ranch was the most ambitious real estate undertaking that executives and owners of Gibraltar Savings conceived for the fast-growing Texas economy in the early 1980's.
Mr. Kosberg had acquired Gibraltar and the First Texas Savings Association by 1983 and soon handed to Richard Strauss, a real-estate developer and member of the First Texas board, the responsibility for transforming Stonebridge from thousands of blueprints into a gleaming reality.
The younger Mr. Strauss, fortified with a loan of more than $100 million from Gibraltar, outbid Mr. Perot for the Stonebridge property in 1984.
Real estate professionals said Mr. Strauss, who headed a real estate subsidiary that was wholly owned by Gibraltar, paid $17,000 an acre at a time when nearby parcels were finding buyers at more than $30,000 an acre.
The North Texas economy was booming along with the finance, military and aerospace industries, and this prairie farmland far beyond North Dallas was considered some of the most valuable in the state.
Gibraltar later financed $150 million in improvements that included two high-quality golf courses, a beach and tennis club, an equestrian center, 13 lakes and more than five miles of hiking and biking trails. In all, the savings institution had approximately $330 million in loans to Stonebridge, according to people in the Dallas real estate industry.
But Gibraltar's big dreams for Stonebridge collapsed with the Texas economy in 1986, as oil prices plunged and the staggering oversupply of office space, housing and other developed real estate became apparent. By the time Stonebridge offered its first homes for sale in 1988, Gibraltar was nearly insolvent.
 
A Deal With Perelman
Federal regulators seized Gibraltar Savings and First Texas Savings in the waning hours of 1988, and sold them along with three other institutions as one new institution to a group headed by Ronald O. Perelman, the chairman of Revlon Inc.
The Perelman group paid $315 million to the Government for the new institution, First Gibraltar Savings. First Gibraltar, with $12 billion in deposits, is now the largest savings institution in Texas.
The Government estimated the net worth of the institutions combined to create First Gibraltar at a negative $866 million, with most of the losses recorded from troubled loans at Gibraltar Savings and First Texas Savings. That figure would include the loss estimates from the more than $300 million in loans to Stonebridge Ranch. The total cost to taxpayers of the First Gibraltar rescue has been estimated at $5.1 billion over 10 years.
The Perelman group never played a role at Stonebridge Ranch. Control over the Gibraltar subsidiary that owned the project, the Ranch Development Company, was transferred by regulators to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
When Congress ordered the disolution of that agency last year, Stonebridge Ranch and thousands of other properties acquired from insolvent savings institutions were transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That agency managed the sale of such seized properties until the Resolution Trust Corporation was created last August.
 
Arrangement Is Criticized
After Gibraltar's demise, the Government retained Richard Strauss as manager at Stonebridge Ranch. Henry S. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the House Banking Committee, last year criticized what he termed Mr. Strauss's ''sweetheart'' contract to manage Stonebridge.
That and other public criticism appeared to have persuaded regulators not to accept Mr. Strauss's offer to buy Stonebridge last year. M. Danny Wall, who was then the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, had reached a tentative deal for the Government to sell the property to Mr. Strauss last June. In September, Mr. Strauss withdrew the bid.
Mr. Strauss's company was dropped as manager of Stonebridge in March, when regulators put the Ranch Development Company into a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. The Club Corporation of America, the largest manager of golf, tennis and dining clubs in the nation, has operated Stonebridge for the last three months.
For his part, Mr. Strauss says he remains an active developer in Texas. According to business associates, his life style and spending habits have not changed noticeably because of the financial reverses of Stonebridge and Gibraltar Savings.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
2 Germanys Adopt Unity Treaty And Guarantee Poland's Borders

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, June 21

 BODY:
The Parliaments of the two Germanys adopted matching measures moving them another step closer to union today, one a resolution guaranteeing Poland's existing borders and the other the treaty on monetary and economic union.
The outcome of the votes was never in doubt, but both measures carried a burden of hope, anxiety and controversy. The debate in both Parliaments was at times strident and emotional.
The sessions in Bonn and East Berlin also marked the first time that the Parliaments approved matching measures, and the act joined a flurry of activities that gave a sense of quickening momentum to unity. 
The foreign ministers of the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and the two Germanys are to meet Friday for the second ministerial session of the ''two plus four'' talks at which the foreign powers are negotiating an end to limitations on German sovereignty left from World War II.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d of the United States arrived in West Berlin today and met with the foreign ministers of West Grrmany and East Germany, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Markus Meckel.
After his meeting with Mr. Meckel, he urged the ''two plus four'' participants not to let their deliberations fall behind the speeding pace of unification.
''It is important that there not be a hiatus between internal unification, that is, political and economic unification of the two Germanys, and a resolution of the external aspects of unification,'' Mr. Baker said.
The main issue before the talks has become finding a way of extricating East Germany from its military and economic links to the Soviet Union.
So far, Moscow has opposed letting a united Germany join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. There are rumors of a large Western aid package for the Soviet Union in exchange for its endorsement of unification.
 
Monetary Union on July 1
Then on July 1, the monetary and economic union is scheduled to take effect. While the measure will enable East Germans to exchange their money for West German marks, it is also expected to cause many East German enterprises to collapse, creating at least a temporary surge of unemployment.
Forming a backdrop to these developments has been Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new effort to advance the first all-German election, and so reunification, to December.
Addressing the West German lawmakers during their 13-hour session, Mr. Kohl said, ''Rarely in its history has the German Parliament faced such important decisions as the ones confronting us today.''
He said both sides would have to make sacrifices for the goal of unity. But if economic union was delayed any further, he said, a flood of East Germans to West Germany would resume and ''this would have meant the immediate collapse of the G.D.R.''
The comment was in part a sally at the Social Democrats, who fought a hard internal battle after their standard-bearer, Oskar Lafontaine, proposed opposing the treaty.
His stance threatened a split when a majority in the party leadership declared that opposing the treaty would arouse considerable resentment in East Germany.
 
'Incalculable Risks'
In the end, the Social Democrats decided to vote for the treaty, but a bloc of 25 members broke ranks and voted against it. ''We do not want to take responsibility for the incalculable risks of this policy,'' said Peter Glotz, spokesman for the group.
The treaty was ratified by a vote of 445 in favor, 60 against and one abstention. It now goes to the upper house for final adoption.
The debate was equally emotional in East Berlin, where the treaty was passed by a vote of 302 to 82 with 1 abstention.
Most of the opposition was from the Communist Party of Democratic Socialism, whose leader, Gregor Gysi, was jeered when he spoke of the measure as an ''act of violence'' that would touch off social unrest.
When the vote was announced, members of the governing coalition embraced one another on the floor while the opposition sat in glum silence. Richard Schroder, floor leader of the Social Democrats, declared the treaty ''the second act of our revolution.''
 
Loss of Lands Condemned
There was less debate on the Polish border resolution. But in his speech Mr. Kohl delivered a strong condemnation of the postwar border shift that transferred a broad stretch of German land to Poland and resulted in the expulsion of millions of Germans.
The issue became a heated dispute earlier this year when Poland demanded that the two Germanys guarantee that a united Germany would not claim the territories.
Mr. Kohl initially resisted, largely for fear of alienating the powerful lobby of the Germans expelled from those territories, but he retreated before an international outcry and agreed to the matching resolutions that were adopted today.
''Let no one be mistaken,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''Today we face an absolutely clear choice. Either we confirm the existing border, or we gamble away the chance of German unity.''
But he also voiced considerable sympathy for those who had been expelled, whom he described as people ''forced to pay a high price for crimes committed by others, without being guilty themselves.''
 
'A Grave Injustice'
''The truth is - and this should not be suppressed on a day such as this -the expulsion of the Germans from their native regions was a grave injustice,'' Mr. Kohl declared. ''There was no justification, either moral or legal. Nor can we say decades later that it was legitimate.''
The resolution approved by the Parliaments also cited both Poles and Germans as victims. It noted that the Poles were ''subjected to terrible suffering by the crimes that were committed by Germans and in the name of Germans.'' But it also said that ''a great injustice was done to millions of Germans who were expelled from well-rooted homes.''
The resolution affirmed the existing border along the Oder and Neisse rivers, and called on a unified Germany to finally confirm them in a treaty.
It passed in the West German Parliament by a vote of 487 in favor, 15 against and 3 abstentions. Most of the negative votes were Christian Democrats representing organizations of the expelled people. The vote in East Germany was 361 in favor, 6 against and 18 abstentions.
In the debate on the resolution, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher declared that ''West Germany and its government are giving up nothing that had not already been lost long ago, lost as a result of a criminal war and a criminal system.''
The resolutions predictably drew bitter comments from representatives of the expelled Germans. Herbert Czaja, head of the main organization of Germans who fled or were driven from their homes, said it was ''bitter that the expellees were expected almost exclusively to bear a special sacrifice for the whole of the people.''

HEADLINE: Arabs Split in Reaction to Bush's Move on P.L.O.

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, June 21

 BODY:
The United States decision to suspend contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization produced forecasts today of increased violence from many Palestinian and Arab commentators, but some Arab nations sought to dampen the furor with more muted expressions.
In formal statements, Egypt and Jordan registered ''regret'' over the United States decision, announced yesterday by President Bush, and said that they hoped the discussion would soon resume.
Westerners said that Egypt in particular seemed to be signaling both to the Arab world and to the United States that it still supported efforts to reach a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict and that it hoped for continued Washington engagement in peace efforts.
''While welcoming the U.S. Administration's emphasis on the importance of Palestinian participation in establishing peace, Egypt hopes that this suspension of the U.S.-Palestinian dialogue will be lifted as soon as possible,'' President Hosni Mubarak's office said in a statement. 
Diplomats said that Egypt had sought to avert a suspension of the contacts.
 
A Raid Attempt Is Key Issue
Mr. Bush said that the decision had become necessary because the P.L.O.'s chairman, Yasir Arafat, failed to meet American demands that he specifically condemn an attempted Palestinian raid on Israeli beaches and that he punish Abbul Abbas, the head of a small P.L.O. faction that took responsibility for the assault.
Mr. Arafat and senior P.L.O. officials in the organization's Executive Committee gathered in Baghdad today to discuss the move by Washington. But there was no immediate word on their conclusions.
Egypt is the most prominent Arab ally of the United States in regional diplomacy and receives $2.3 billion a year in economic and military aid to fortify its position as the only Arab nation at peace with Israel.
Despite Cairo's cautiously worded statement, some officials and diplomats said senior policy-makers were angered by the United States decision. The suspension of the discussion is viewed among Arab analysts as likely to bring to a complete halt the faltering peace effort of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
''Everyone will be locked in immobility for the next few months,'' said Tahsin Bashir, an authoritative Egyptian commentator.
 
'Whole Situation Sliding'
A Westerner said that Egypt ''sees the whole situation sliding and is trying to get a hold of it.''
But it was unclear how Cairo would revive its role as a moderator and diplomatic conduit between Arab countries, the P.L.O. and the United States.
''From the Egyptian side, it's going to be hard for them to engage the P.L.O.,'' the Westerner added.
For the last 18 months, since Mr. Arafat renounced terrorism and acknowledged Israel's right to exist, Egypt has championed Washington peace moves in the Middle East.
But, as diplomacy has faltered, Cairo has lost ground to more strident forces demanding a tougher line toward Israel, and those forces have been strengthened by several United States decisions seen by many Arabs as shielding Israel and its effort to crush the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
That, in turn, has led to a surge in anti-American sentiment and frequent forecasts that Arab and Palestinian frustrations at the failure of the peace strategy will lead to violence.
 
'Violence and Extremism'
''We hold the United States responsible for the violence and extremism which will sweep the region as a result of this decision,'' Salah Khalaf, a senior P.L.O. official, said in Tunis.
Mr. Arafat is said by his advisers to be caught between Washington's demands and an increasingly vociferous Palestinians demanding more militant policies now that the diplomacy sponsored by the United States and Egypt is perceived as having failed.
The American suspension of the dialogue with the P.L.O. brought strong responses from Palestinian groups outside the P.L.O that reject its avowed moderation. ''All Arab patriots should threaten U.S. interests worldwide because America is completely biased towards the Zionist enemy and should be punished for this,'' the Damascus-based Fatah Uprising said.

HEADLINE: The Mandela Visit;
In Harlem, a Name to Add to Martin and Malcolm

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
Geneva Valladares calmly brushed her daughter's hair, but her voice was coated with excitement because soon, she said, ''Nelson Mandela will actually be in Harlem.''
''He reminds me of Martin Luther King,'' Mrs. Valladares said of Mr. Mandela, the South African anti-apartheid leader. ''He fought for his people. And he's not going to give up now. He's a survivor, just like I am.'' 
Harlem is also a survivor. For generations the community was known as the Capital of Black America, a mecca for artists, entertainers and political leaders from Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X to New York City's first black mayor, David N. Dinkins.
But Harlem has fallen on hard times, or been pushed by governmental and political neglect, many people on its streets contend. Poverty, drugs, unemployment, inferior schools and poor health are part of Harlem's daily life.
Yesterday, all along Harlem's avenues and boulevards named after black American heroes, posters of Mr. Mandela were displayed in shop windows like flags on Memorial Day. Mr. Mandela's visit to Harlem was a dose of pride and inspiration and for many a rallying cry ''to clean up our own backyard,'' Mrs. Valladares said.
''I hope he will open some people's eyes,'' she said. ''We need to do the same thing.''
As Mrs. Valladares talked, her 9-year-old daughter, Alaya, tugged at her sleeve.
''Mom, why did he go to jail?'' Alaya asked. ''For fighting for his people.'' ''Is he black?'' ''Yeah. African.'' ''Is he going back to jail?''
''I hope not,' the mother said. ''He was an innocent man. He just wants some justice for his people. That's what we want right here in Harlem.''
 
'We Need Help Ourselves'
Frank James, 61, a laundry worker, sympathized with Mr. Mandela's struggle but was skeptical of the support that Harlem could provide.
''Sure we sympathize with his cause,'' Mr. James said. ''But that's about all we can do. We need help ourselves in this prejudiced country, America, my home.''
Phyllis Tripp left her Brooklyn apartment early yesterday with her two daughters and headed for Harlem to wait for ''just a glimpse'' of Mr. Mandela. ''He's been like a myth the whole 27 years he was in prison,'' she said. ''We didn't known what he looked liked. He's like something that came out of a fairy tale book.''
It was 11 A.M., about seven hours before Mr. Mandela was scheduled to speak at a rally at the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevards, also known as African Square. Mrs. Tripp and her children had already been waiting for two hours.
''As an African-American woman,'' she said, ''I have been confronted by racism plenty of times right here in New York City. Our struggle is the same.''
John Simpson, 42, a street vendor who ''sells everything in general and nothing in particular,'' refused to be caught in the Mandela excitement.
''The people love the man because he struggled and because he's one of us,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''But Mandela has no business trying to negotiate with the South African government. It's like playing three card monte. You're going to lose because it's a crooked game. There should be no negotiating about freedom.''
But the jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie said he was thoroughly excited about Mr. Mandela's visit to Harlem.
''It's going to give the people hope,'' he said, standing in a light rain in front of Sylvia's Restaurant, on Lenox Avenue near 126th Street. ''We haven't got much hope from anywhere else.'' ''
In the glow from the marquee of the Apollo Theater Wednesday night, Neville Bird was doing a brisk business selling several different kinds of T-shirts of Mr. Mandela.
But Mr. Bird said he also sells a lot of T-shirts of Malcolm X, or of a man holding a boy's hand. The inscription on the shirt reads: ''What Our Young Males Need Most Today Are Strong, Positive And Courageous Role Models. Be One.''
''Mr. Mandela,'' Mr. Bird said, ''fits that description very well.''

HEADLINE: The Bailout: No Savagery Required

 BODY:
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the House Ways and Means Committee startled a meeting of mayors this week by declaring there would be no peace dividend for the cities. Why? Because the Federal money freed by defense cuts would be gobbled up by the bailout of bankrupt saving and loan institutions. At the same conference, Mayor David Dinkins of New York lamented that the bailout ''sinkhole'' would swallow resources needed for mass transit, education or drug enforcement. 
These thoughts are well meant. But they are also, at least as a matter of economics, dead wrong. The bailout, though gigantic, need not subtract one dime from the nation's ability to build railroads or treat drug addicts.
There is a better way to pay for the bailout: Borrow the money. Unless politicians understand that this is responsible, even in a period of huge deficits, they will squander a golden opportunity to finance starving social programs.
Building missiles and tanks requires skilled workers and equipment. For Congress to cut back on these, with the end of the cold war, would free workers to build schools, for instance, or high-speed trains. This is the peace dividend.
The thrift bailout, unlike defense, produces nothing. It transfers money, from taxpayers to depositors of failed thrifts collecting their Federal deposit insurance. Administrative costs aside, the transfer uses neither skilled workers nor valuable equipment. Because the bailout only affects money - pieces of paper - and not productive resources, the nation's capacity to produce schools and trains is undiminished.
Even so, Congress must find enough dollars -by one estimate, $150 billion - to pay the insured depositors at failed thrifts.
It could cut other Federal programs, almost certainly sacrificing needed social investments. It could raise taxes. But large tax hikes are politically improbable and economically damaging. The right answer is to borrow the money, waiving the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law accordingly. That's the politically expedient but also the fiscally responsible way out.
For one thing, the thrift bailout is a temporary problem that justifies no catastrophic jolt to taxpayers or social programs. For another, Gramm-Rudman's purpose is to limit how much money Congress drains from the private capital market.
But borrowing for the thrift bailout poses no such threat. It merely replaces money that depositors at federally insured thrifts already assume they have. These depositors are no more likely to spend the replacement funds than they were to spend the original deposit. The replacement money would remain in the capital market, available to corporate borrowers.
Gramm-Rudman should not be waived, however, for the subsequent interest cost. Interest on the loans, unlike the bailout itself, will represent ordinary claims on the nation's capital market.
The S & L bailout is routinely cited as the reason America can't attend to its cities, children or other constituencies. Economic reality doesn't require that sacrifice. Congress can responsibly borrow the money.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
The Essential Mandela

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela is both a symbol and a political leader. In celebrating the first, Americans should not overlook the realistic burdens - the very heavy burdens - of the second.
The cheering crowds in New York, and the admirers around the world, see in him a man of extraordinary conviction and strength. He survived 27 years as a political prisoner with his commitment to a democratic South Africa undimmed. 
But it is not survival alone that matters. If Mr. Mandela had come out of prison as a man full of hate, many would understand but not admire. What gives him such power in our imagination is his lack of bitterness. He gives us optimism about the possibilities of human nature.
From the moment of his release he has refused to criticize those who imprisoned him. They were caught up in an oppressive system, he said, and it is the system that has to be changed.
''You look at what can be done today, and you forget the past quite easily,'' he said in March. ''It would be unfair to think in terms of any measures of revenge. It would be absolutely unfair.''
To black Americans, of course, he is a particular symbol. He resisted white oppression of an especially malignant kind. But again his qualities of character matter as well as the fact of his successful resistance.
There is a sense of serenity in him, of confidence and courtesy. Archbishop Desmond Tutu said: ''He's got the manner of royalty, because he is royalty among the Xhosa people. But he's also incredibly humble.''
His character was a crucial factor, I believe, in bringing President F. W. de Klerk to the remarkable steps he has taken: releasing Mr. Mandela and other prisoners, ending the ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organizations and starting talks with the A.N.C. Two Cabinet ministers had been greatly impressed on meeting him in prison, and so was Mr. de Klerk when he had three meetings.
Mr. Mandela, for his part, has told black South Africans that President de Klerk is a man of good faith. He has praised individual Cabinet members as enlightened.
All this makes clear a fundamental political fact. Nelson Mandela is the one man in South Africa now who has sufficient respect in the white Government and the black community to make negotiations possible.
That is an enormous burden. Just think about feelings in the black community, for example. After generations of brutal discrimination, impoverishment and dispossession from the land, many blacks, especially young people, reject the very idea of negotiations. They doubt that anything but force will win them equal rights in their country.
And then there is the reality of white power, still overwhelming in money and weapons. Mr. Mandela's American tour itself shows how unequal the A.N.C. side of the bargaining table is in terms of resources. He and his colleagues have no Government airplanes or staff. They are trying to raise money to keep going and organize as a party.
How does Mr. Mandela deal with those realities? He emphasizes that the foundations of apartheid are still in place: He could not vote when he went to prison 27 years ago, and he still cannot. He calls on the world, especially the United States, to continue the sanctions that have made a vital difference in bringing white South Africa to the table.
He does it with a presence as commanding as any political figure in the world today. People worry about his stamina at the age of 71, but in interviews he is sharp and vigorous. He is informed on all kinds of issues, in detail, despite the 27 years in prison. He stands up to a television interviewer as determined as Ted Koppel.
But there is an odd contradiction in all that. It is the man who commands attention. But he cares about the message, and he resists the personal attention.
He comes across as a man who will not compromise on principles. Yet he could not have gone as far as he has in these few months since his release if he were not a practical man. He has already signaled that the earlier A.N.C. talk about nationalization is yielding to practical concerns for a productive economy - so long as there is redistribution of wealth.
Nelson Mandela knows that successful negotiation means compromise. Mr. de Klerk and his colleagues have recognized that they will not find a more reasonable partner. The question, amid pressure from the extremes, is whether there will be world enough, and time.

HEADLINE: 12 Indicted As Mob Rulers Of Painting

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Twelve men, including eight top painters' union leaders, were indicted yesterday and accused of participating in a Mafia-led conspiracy that rigged bids for almost every major public and private painting contract in New York City for 12 years.
The indictments portrayed the Lucchese organized-crime family as the secret power in the city's multimillion-dollar painting industry for more than a decade. Through threats and control of the painters' union, the indictments said, the Mafia imposed a hidden 10 percent tax on municipal contracts for painting subways, bridges, schools and highways and on bills paid by private developers who built skyscrapers and apartment buildings.
Law-enforcement officials estimated that the conspirary had cost the city tens of millions of dollars in inflated contracts in the last decade and had resulted in higher rents for commercial and residential tenants.
 
Focus on Industry Conspiracies
Yesterday's indictments were the latest in a campaign by Federal and state law-enforcement agencies to rid the city's construction industry of corruption and Mafia influence by concentrating on construction-industry conspiracies instead of separate corrupt acts. Recent indictments involved corruption in the concrete and carpentery trades. 
The new strategy is also intended to cripple the city's Mafia leadership. Previous investigations of traditional organized-crime activities - narcotics trafficking, illegal gambling, loan sharking and hijacking -rarely resulted in felony charges against the Mafia's hierarchy in the city.
A prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, Michael G. Cherkasky, said the undercover inquiry into the painters' union began two years ago when - in a rare occurrence - a painting contractor complained that union officials had demanded payoffs from him.
Law-enforcement officials have long maintained that extortion is widespread in the construction industry but that contractors are reluctant to expose it because they fear for their safety from the underworld if they cooperate with investigators.
Many contractors in the building trades have said privately that they shun jobs in the city because of corruption and its inherent danger, even through the cost of payoffs can be passed along to developers and tenants.
Named in the state indictments yesterday were two suspected chiefs in the Lucchese family - Anthony (Gaspipe) Casso and Peter (Big Pete) Chiodo -two painting company executives and eight top officials in the city's painters' union, the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 9.
 
Millions in Payoffs Charged
In announcing the indictments, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said an undercover investigation had obtained evidence that the Lucchese family and District Council 9 officials shared ''millions of dollars'' in payoffs by rigging ''virtually every significant paint contract in the city for the last 12 years.''
Mr. Casso was identified by prosecutors as the underboss, or No. 2 leader, in the Lucchese family, one of five Mafia groups operating in the New York area. Mr. Casso and the man who law-enforcement officials say is the boss of the Lucchese group, Vittorio (Vic) Amuso, disappeared last month, shortly before they were indicted by a Federal grand jury in Brooklyn on charges for helping rig bids for $142 million in window contracts given by the City Housing Authority.
Mr. Amuso was also named in yesterday's indictments as an unindicted conspirator who helped run the painting rackets.
The central 153-count indictment against the 12 defendants asserted that the Lucchese family handpicked top executives in District Council 9. The council is the administrative unit for six locals, and with 6,000 members, it is the third largest construction union in the New York metropolitan area.
 
Threats of Violence Reported
Companies that sought major painting contracts - those totaling several hundreds thousand dollars or more -were ordered by District Council 9 officials to kick back 10 percent of their gross payments, the indictments said. Contractors were said to have been warned that the union leaders were associated with the Lucchese family and that violence might occur if bribes were withheld.
In return, compliant contractors cut costs by obtaining labor peace, and they were allowed to violate union regulations through ''sweetheart deals.'' The bribe-givers were permitted to hire nonunion workers at lower wages and with fewer fringe benefits than union members got.
Other favors given to contractors in exchange for payoffs were said to be permission to speed up work by using spraying equipment instead of brushes.
''These indictments demonstrate just how deeply organized crime has infiltrated the construction trades in this city through bribery, threats and violence,'' Mr. Morgenthau said at a news conference.
 
A 'Textbook Case'
Chief Anthony M. Voelker, who is in charge of the Police Department's Organized Crime Control Bureau, said the evidence was a ''textbook case of an assault by organized crime on the economic health of New York City.''
Investigators from the bureau and the Federal Labor Department's New York Office of Labor Racketeering participated in undercover tactics that included secretly placing court-authorized eavesdropping devices and a video camera inside the offices of District Council 9 at 45 West 14th Street, near Fifth Avenue.
Prosecutors said they had videotapes of union officials dividing bribes.
''These union officials subverted the power of their union to satisfy their own greed,'' said Gustave A. Schick, assistant inspector general for the Office of Labor Racketeering. ''They stole from the men and women in their own union they were supposed to protect.''
The indictments described only about $150,00 in bribes in the last two years from three unidentifed Transit Authority contracts. Mr. Cherkasky, who is the chief of the Investigations Division in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said a description of the full extent of the payoffs would compromise the continuting investigation.
 
Public Officials Investigated
Other potential targets of the inquiry include public officials, contractors and organized-crime figures, Mr. Cherkasky said in an interview.
Two executives of painting companies were indicted: Frank Huber, president of the Huber Decorating Company in College Point, Queens, and Daniel Rech, projects supervisor for the Leeds Painting and Decorating Company in Rego Park, Queens.
Mr. Huber's company got more than than $20 million in public contracts in the last five years, including the painting of the IRT subway line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx and state highways.
Both men were identified in the indictments as associates in the Lucchese family. Law-enforcement officials characterize an associate as someone who cooperates with a Mafia family but who is not an inducted or sworn member.
The indictments also said that Mr. Chiodo, said to be a Lucchese family captain, Mr. Rech and another defendant, Edward Capaldo, the business manager of Painters Local 1486, last year threatened James D. Bishop, the former secretary-treasurer and chief executive of District Council 9. Mr. Bishop was shot to death last month near his home in Whitestone, Queens, in what authorities said was a gangland execution.
 
Contract for Murder Charged
The indictment said Mr. Bishop had been an associate in the Lucchese family and had cooperated with the Mafia during his term in office from 1973 to 1989. According to law-enforcement officials, Mr. Bishop was linked with previous leaders of the Lucchese family and when Mr. Amuso, Mr. Casso and Mr. Chiodo rose to power in the late 1980's, they distrusted him and ordered his ouster as union head.
Federal prosecutors in court papers last month said Mr. Amuso had placed an ''open contract'' on Mr. Bishop's life. No one has been charged in Mr. Bishop's murder.
Other painters' union officials indicted yesterday were Paul Kamen, secretary-treasurer of District Council 9; William Courtien, the council's international representative; Aaron Lefkowitz, business agent of Local 28; Salvatore Savarese, business agent of local 20; Joseph Candiano, business agent of Local 24;, Edward Filancia, business agent of Local 19 and Seymour Strelzik, coordinator of the council's apprentice program.
All 12 men were indicted under provisions of the state's Organized Crime Control Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 25 years.

HEADLINE: 5 in the Arts Are Awarded A $100,000 Japanese Prize

BYLINE: By SUZANNE CASSIDY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 21

 BODY:
The American composer Leonard Bernstein and the Italian film maker Federico Fellini are among the five winners of the 1990 Japanese Praemium Imperiale awards for lifetime achievement in the arts, it was announced at Claridge's Hotel here today.
Mr. Bernstein won for his contributions to music; Mr. Fellini for theater and film; Arnaldo Pomodoro of Italy for sculpture; James Stirling of England for architecture, and Antoni Tapies of Spain for painting.
Each winner is to receive $100,000 and a medal at a ceremony in October in Tokyo. The prize is financed primarily by the Fujisankei Communications Group, a conglomerate of which Hiroaki Shikanai is chairman and chief executive. Mr. Shikanai is the chairman of the prize's organizing committee and vice chairman of the Japan Art Association. 
The Praemium Imperiale, or Imperial Prize, was created in 1988 by the Japan Art Association on its 101st anniversary. It was the vision of the younger brother of Emperor Hirohito, Prince Nobuhito Takamatsu, Mr. Shikanai said on Wednesday.
 
An Artistic Tradition
Honoring those who have significantly contributed to international arts and culture, the prize is also intended to show that ''art can overcome the many, many divisions in the world - individual, racial and international - and promote peace,'' Mr. Shikanai said.
The organizers also hope, he said, that the prize will show another side of Japan, which has a rich artistic tradition but which is widely regarded only for its economic success.
David Rockefeller, chairman of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and an international adviser for Praemium Imperiale, said at a news conference today that while the prize was still somewhat unknown to the public, its prestige was growing in the arts world.
''In the very near future,'' he said, it could be to the arts what the Nobel Prize is to science and literature.
The Praemium Imperiale's other international advisers were also at the news conference. They are the former Prime Minister Edward Heath of Britain; Jacques Chirac, the Mayor of Paris and former Prime Minister; Amintore Fanfani, former Prime Minister of Italy, and Helmut Schmidt, former Chancellor of West Germany.
Each adviser had his own committee, which made recommendations to the Japan Art Association's trustees, who selected the winners.
To show the world that the prize is truly international, and not just a means of promoting Japan, no Japanese artists will be nominated for the prize for several years, Mr. Heath said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Credit Is Sufficient

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, said today that lax lending standards by banks and insufficient supervision by regulators in the 1980's were two key elements that have forced bankers in certain areas of the country to restrict credit to businesses.
Mr. Greenspan rejected suggestions, as he has several times, that there is currently a nationwide credit crunch that could threaten economic growth.
Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, he predicted ''continued modest economic growth'' and said that ''enough credit appears to be available to fuel this growth.''
 
Some Reduced Lending
Still, the Fed chairman conceded that in some areas, like New England, banks had reduced lending. He said that in those regions, the reduction in the amount of lending available was primarily a result of banks trying to compensate for the excessive lending and poor credit decisions in the 1980's. Those decisions fueled overbuilding and left a legacy of vacant office buildings, defaulted loans and falling real estate prices. 
''We are going from lending standards that were clearly more lax than they should have been, back to a sound and more normal one,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''The process feels very restrictive; it gives the impression of abnormal tightening.''
And he said that regulators were also to blame for the overbuilding that has now produced weak real estate markets and tighter credit.
''The overbuilding was supported in part by the ready availability of credit from thrifts and banks that, in hindsight, partly reflected lax lending standards and unfortunately insufficient attention by supervisors,'' he said.
Mr. Greenspan added that at this point, the Fed did not see any major economic problem because of tighter credit in the real estate sector. ''I don't think we see anything of substance that raises a caution flag,'' he said. ''But we are watching it very, very closely.''
 
The Credit Debate
The hearings today continued a debate that has been brewing in Washington as to whether tougher actions by Federal regulators this year have forced banks to cut back on their lending to many small businesses around the country.
While regulators deny that they have changed their formal lending standards, they do not deny that they have gotten tougher in enforcing those standards in response to a weakening economy and real estate market. The regulators primary message is that bankers should not stop lending to creditworthy borrowers.
Nevertheless, senators said today that they were under intense pressure from local businessmen to take action.
''We are hearing almost every hour from businessmen who are having trouble getting loans,'' said Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut.
Some in the Administration have cited evidence of a reduction in credit beyond the scope described by Mr. Greenspan. Both Jack Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Robert A. Mosbacher, Secretary of Commerce, told Congress last week that there was a credit crunch that has extended well beyond New England and beyond the real estate sector.
Irvin B. Maizlish, chairman of the Leo Eisenberg Company, a real estate management concern based in St. Louis, said before the Senate panel today that members of his International Council of Shopping Centers had ''experienced a sudden, sharp decline in credit availability'' and that the drop-off had been of such a magnitude that it was ''not justified by sound banking practices or economic reality.''
One aspect of the debate seems to center on whether a weak economy, produced by excessive borrowing and leverage in the 1980's, has forced regulators and bankers to be more cautious with their lending, or whether regulators are inducing economic weakness through tougher examinations of banks.
Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, who has come under intense criticism for imposing excessively tough examination practices for banks, told the banking committee today that the regulators were just responding to market conditions and that bankers and borrowers had ''misconceptions'' that regulators wanted banks to cut off credit to sound borrowers.
''Blaming the O.C.C. is unwarranted,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''That assumes that the O.C.C. tells bankers when to lend and makes individual credit decisions.''
 
Congress in a Strange Position
What both sides agree on is that the position of the regulators has to be clarified so that market expectations do not produce even tighter credit conditions.
The debate puts the regulators and members of Congress in a strange position. In recent years, they have often come under fire for advocating lax regulation in the savings and loan industry. Today they noted the irony that pressure is now mounting for them to be more lenient with borrowers.
Some members of the panel defended the regulators.
''If you are gong to err, err on the side of tough regulation,'' said Senator Jake Garn, Republican from Utah.
''In my view, banks are to be applauded for tighter credit standards,'' said Paul Fritz, director of the division of supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ''We are in favor of the banking industry tightening lending standards and returning to basics. However, this tightening does not mean banks should stop making loans. Instead, we expect and urge banks to continue making loans to creditworthy borrowers.''
Mr. Fritz warned, however, that problems in the commercial real estate markets were spreading beyond New England and the Southwest and were likely to get worse before they get better.
''We don't think it's bottomed out in New England yet,'' he said. ''We see some softness beginning to develop in California. And we don't expect the problems to continue at this pace, but we do not see them going away.''

HEADLINE: Pathe Deal For MGM Extended

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 21

 BODY:
Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier whose attempt to acquire the MGM/ UA Communications Company has been on the brink of collapse in recent days, said today that he had reached an agreement with MGM that will give him four more months to come up with the cash he needs to complete the deal.
Mr. Parretti's Pathe Communications Corporation said the deadline for closing the transaction will be extended to Oct. 23, from Saturday. Under the new terms, holders of MGM's common and preferred stock would receive $21.50 a share, or about $1.3 billion, up from $20 under the previous agreement, to compensate them for the delay.
Under the new agreement, shareholders would receive a payment of $4 a share, or about $250 million, on July 20 - essentially a nonrefundable deposit that would not require shareholders to give up an interest in the company - with the remaining $17.50 to be paid on or before the October deadline. 
 
History of Failed Deals
The new agreement is the latest twist in Mr. Parretti's faltering attempts to establish himself as a force in the film business by acquiring MGM/UA. Mr. Parretti has been something of a mystery man in Hollywood since acquiring the old Cannon film studio and merging it into Pathe two years ago, and industry executives have long been skeptical about his ability to raise money to complete the MGM/UA deal.
The extension is also an embarrassment to Kirk Kerkorian, who controls 79 percent of MGM/UA's shares and has been trying unsuccessfully to sell the company for two years. A previous agreement to sell the company to the Qintex Group of Australia collapsed last year when Qintex encountered severe financial troubles. Mr. Kerkorian had earlier turned down a bid from Rupert Murdoch in favor of a slightly higher offer from Qintex.
Another deal that fell apart two years ago would have put the film and television studio under control of a group including Jon Peters and Peter Guber, the producers who now run Columbia Pictures for the Sony Corporation.
 
Effect of Time Warner Pact
Mr. Parretti has secured $650 million in financing from Time Warner Inc. for the deal in return for the right to distribute Pathe and MGM films. But that agreement requires that he contribute $450 million of equity to the deal, rather than bank financing or other debt, and Mr. Parretti has yet to arrange financing in a way that meets that demand.
Although there were widespread rumors that Time Warner was backing out of the deal or that Mr. Parretti was seeking a partner to replace Time Warner, Time Warner executives said their agreement with Pathe was still in place. ''We assume that the purpose of obtaining the extension was to be able to continue negotiating with us,'' said Marilyn Harris, a spokeswoman for Time Warner.
Mr. Parretti has so far raised about $370 million through Comfinance S.A., a holding company he controls in Luxembourg. Comfinance has said the finances are a combination of bank loans and asset sales. Mr. Parretti has argued that the $370 million should be considered equity as far as Pathe is concerned, because under the terms of its agreement with Comfinance, Pathe could repay the advance in Pathe stock.
 
Other Concessions to MGM/UA
In addition to raising the price, Mr. Parretti had to make other concessions to MGM/UA to keep the deal alive. To provide added security for MGM shareholders, Mr. Parretti agreed to place an additional $100 million into an escrow account in two installments in August and September. The escrow fund is intended to be a pool from which MGM shareholders might recover damages in litigation should the deal collapse.
The $4-a-share payment next month will be financed in part by the $200 million in cash that Pathe had deposited into the escrow account as security for the original deal. Pathe will be required to pay an additional $53 million into the account to finance the $4 payment.
MGM continues to insist that it is conducting business as usual, but with all the uncertainty about its future, its film production and distribution activities have fallen off. The only two films it now has in release -''Lisa'' and ''Daddy's Dyin' . . . Who's Got the Will?'' - have drawn a total of only $5 million at the box office.

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Rise Put at 1.9% In Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
The economy grew faster in the first quarter than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said today, but the 1.9 percent annual growth rate remained the second lowest in two and a half years.
In fact, the upward revision itself pointed to a slowing economy, since it was created in part by higher-than-expected inventories of unsold goods. Combined with slack demand, indicated by a downward adjustment in consumer spending, it pointed to bloated inventories in the second half of the year.
''Weaker consumer spending and a bigger inventory overhang suggest the second quarter is not going to be as strong as thought,'' said Jerry Jordan, senior vice president of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. 
 
Lower Inflation Estimate
The department's figure for first-quarter gross national product growth was revised from a 1.3 percent annual increase estimated a month ago. The department also lowered its earlier estimate of inflation for the January through March period.
The implicit price deflator, a broad gauge of inflation that measures price changes in a basket of goods and services, rose at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, instead of the 5.7 percent rise estimated a month ago. It was still the biggest rise in the inflation measure since the third quarter of 1982, when it rose at a 5.8 percent rate. The inflation rate had risen 3.2 percent in the final three months of 1989. 2.1% Initial Growth Initially, the Government reported in April that the first-quarter G.N.P., the nation's total output of goods and services, had risen 2.1 percent. But that was scaled back in May to a 1.3 percent increase because the Government had predicted higher auto production in its first estimate than acutally took place in the quarter.
Today's 1.9 percent growth figure is the final adjustment. The upward revision was attibuted in part to higher figures for net exports. But analysts said that more noteworthy were the downward revision in personal consumption spending and the increase in inventories.
''In contrast to a surface impression of an upward revision, this really reflects a weaker economy than we had seen earlier,'' Mr. Jordan added.
Treasury bonds eased only fractionally and the dollar was barely changed after the figures were announced, dealers said. The stock market also took the report in stride.
Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist with DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass., said the upward revision in first-quarter growth effectively borrows from the rest of the year.
''We're seeing consumer spending weaker than we thought, and that is consistent with an economy that's likely to remain sluggish,'' Ms. Latta said.
The economy had expanded at an anemic 1.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1989, the weakest since an eight-tenths of 1 percent gain in the third quarter of 1986.
 
Rate Easing Doubtful
Prospects for any early easing in interest rates to stimulate the economy seem slim, and on Capitol Hill today, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, testified he thought the economy was continuing to grow modestly without danger of recession.
The Fed, which controls monetary policy, has consistently stated that it wants to continue efforts to curb price rises.
Today's report said that inflation was given an upward push early in the first quarter by higher prices for imported oil and food caused by record cold weather late in 1989. Prices have since eased after heating oil inventories were rebuilt and new crops came to market.
 
Corporate Profits Revised
The department also issued a revised estimate of first-quarter net corporate profits, showing profits up 1.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $158.5 billion. A month ago, the department estimated first-quarter profits had risen only two-tenths of 1 percent, to $157 billion, after rising 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter last year.
Corporate profits for all of 1989 fell 4.7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $161 billion after taxes, from the 1988 total of $168.9 billion. In 1988, after-tax profits rose 18.9 percent from 1987.
For the full year 1989, total output of goods and services increased at an inflation-adjusted rate of 3 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in 1988 and 3.7 percent in 1987. It was the weakest annual growth rate since 1986, when the economy grew only 2.7 percent.
Data included in the revision of the gross national product for the first quarter of 1990 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates:

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
National Security: New Priorities

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney this week submitted a proposal to Congress for cutting the armed forces by 20 to 25 percent over the next five years. But his plan would reduce military spending by only 10 percent, because savings from force reductions would be largely offset by rising outlays on antimissile defenses, procurement of new strategic nuclear weapons systems, purchases of new conventional weapons and more spending on research and development of new weapons.
At the same time, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, has offered Congress a revised plan for hitting the Gramm-Rudman deficit targets. He has raised his estimate of the deficit for the fiscal year 1991 to $159 billion, from $137.9 billion less than a month ago, and proposes to cut it by $50.4 billion. Reductions in military spending would yield less than $6 billion next year, with the rest coming from programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits and farm subsidies, plus $13.9 billion from higher tax revenues and $5.6 billion from higher Federal fees. 
Mr. Darman says his budget plan would save $444 billion over the next five years - $153 billion more than the savings projected in the Administration's budget in January. But the Democrats are calling for five-year savings of $500 billion to $600 billion, and want to see more of these coming from the military.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, writing in the current New York Review, says of the cold war: ''We won! There will be plenty of troubles ahead. Plenty of horror and pain. But the age of totalitarianism is over.'' And he poses a critical issue: ''How do we now demobilize? How do we move from a national security state to a Government that merely asks what are our interests abroad and our needs at home, and calmly and openly pursues them? What a wonderful challenge!''
Similarly, Theodore C. Sorensen, who was a speech writer for President John F. Kennedy, says in the new issue of Foreign Affairs: ''The primary threat cited over 40 years in justification for most of our military budget, bases and overseas assistance is gone.'' And he warns, ''If the President cannot soon lead the way to a consensus among our national security decision-makers on credible new goals to guide our basic foreign policy and military planning for the long term, the current strategic vacuum is likely to be filled not only haphazardly but unwisely as well.''
What does economics have to contribute to developing a new concept of national and international security?
The collapse of the Soviet military threat and that of the Warsaw Pact countries resulted from their economic failure rather than from direct military action by their adversaries. And, in the post-cold war environment, threats to a nation's economic interests, Communist or capitalist, are coming to be regarded as a greater danger than threats to its territorial integrity.
Prof. Martin C. McGuire of the University of Maryland contends that in the past a nation could become a ''takeover target'' for an aggressor when the aggressor nation saw the opportunity to extract wealth, in the form of arable land, minerals, gold or other property, from its victim. But in modern industrial societies, if a conqueror requires the cooperation of the local population to obtain surplus wealth, it may not pay him to go to war, particularly if the defender has the means of inflicting unacceptable damage on the aggressor.
The Soviet failure to make its conquests in Eastern Europe ''pay'' was doubtless a key reason why Mikhail S. Gorbachev was willing to let the Warsaw Pact break up and search for peace with the West. Indeed, a powerful new incentive influencing the balance between war and peace, Mr. McGuire suggests, will be the comparative benefit of the alternative to conquest - that is, the benefit from production and exchange, or peaceful migration of people, capital, technology and knowledge.
''As between offering a carrot in the form of desirable consumer goods, and a stick in the form of despotic occupation,'' he says, ''the modern industrial state has a comparative advantage in the former.''
But even if threats of territorial war between industrial powers have diminished, with the lack of rational incentives for aggressors, other threats to security remain, like local and regional wars in developing countries, risks that fanatics will explode nuclear bombs, spreading drug use, international terrorism, cross-national threats to the environment, or economic and financial catastrophe. ''Economic hazards,'' Mr. McGuire says, ''are central rather than peripheral as before.''
Thus, the changing nature of the risks faced by the United States and other industrial nations provides the basis for a new security structure. The defenses against those risks need to be international, not just national, as in times past.

Garfinckel's In Chapter 11

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
In a move reflecting continuing problems in the retailing industry, the owner of the Garfinckel's department store chain said today that it had filed for bankruptcy protection and would liquidate the inventories of its 10 stores.
''It has become increasingly apparent over the past six months that Garfinckel's does not have the economies of scale to be a competitive retailer in this marketplace,'' said George Kelly, the chairman and chief executive of the Garfinckel's Holding Company. 
The company, which investors rescued Garfinckel's from a financial crisis two years ago by recruiting new managers and providing money, also laid off 200 of its 850 employees.
The Washington-area retailer, which catered to affluent shoppers, attributed part of its problems to its ownership having changed five times since the early 1980's. This resulted in different marketing strategies that had affected its image, the company said.
Garfinckel's said it had filed for Chapter 11 protection at the Federal Bankruptcy Court in the District of Columbia.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Rebound in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose slightly yesterday, stemming what had been a four-day slide.
The slight spurt came as a surprise to some dealers, who said they saw mostly sellers and few buyers.
''I am a bit confused, since we have heard about nothing but selling,'' one government bond trader said.
''But on a fundamental basis the market is reasonably attractive. Yields are about 20 basis points higher now than they were late last week, and people loved the market then. So even though we haven't seen much of it, evidently there is some buying going on.'' 
Market reaction was limited to the Commerce Department's final revision of first-quarter economic growth, but there was only a slight selloff in prices after the numbers were released even though the figures were pushed upward by more than half a percentage point, to 1.9 percent from 1.3 percent.
Most of the increase was a result of an upward revision in exports, but some analysts said the most telling parts of the changes related to consumer activity.
''The large downward revision in personal consumption expenditures, which was pushed down by $6 billion, was the major news,'' said Gary Schlossberg, a vice president and senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.
''To me, despite the big upward revision in the overall number, the decline in consumption expenditures was an indication of economic weakness, not strength.''
Prices weakened later in the day after the Treasury announced that its deficit in May was $42.6 billion.
The figure, which was higher than expected, pushed yields on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds as high as 8.53 percent. Those levels attracted buyers, and yields subsequently eased.
''There is definite support for securities at roughly 8.50 percent for the entire coupon list, but especially for the bond,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''That seems to underscore strong market sentiment that rates will be moving lower over time.''
By late in the day, the 8 3/4 percent bonds were offered at a price of 102 27/32, up 10/32, to yield 8.48 percent. Late Wednesday the closely watched Treasury bond was offered at a price to yield 8.51 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 102 14/32, up 6/32, to yield 8.50 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 1/8, up 1/8, to yield 8.45 percent.
In when-issued trading, the two-year notes to be auctioned on Tuesday were offered at a price to yield 8.36 percent. And the four-year notes that will be sold on Wednesday were offered at a price to yield 8.46 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.75 percent, up one basis point, or hundredth of a point. Six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.63 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Burlington Resources Inc. priced a two-part, $300 million offering through an underwriting syndicate led by Lehman Brothers, a division of Shearson Lehman Hutton, which is a unit of the American Express Company.
Half the issue consisted of 9 5/8 percent 10-year notes. The notes, which mature June 15, 2000, were priced at $99.77 to yield 9.66 percent, 1.13 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $150 million were 9 7/8 percent 20-year bonds.
The bonds, which mature June 15, 2010, were priced at $99.77, to yield 9.901 percent, 1.40 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 at the time of pricing.
Both parts of the issue are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was highlighted by the sale of $254 million worth of Criminal Justice Facility bonds for Palm Beach County, Fla.
The issue, which is insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, consists of serial and term bonds.
Coupons on the serial bonds range from 6.30 percent in 1994 to 7.20 percent in 2005. The largest term bond carries a 7.35 percent coupon and matures in 2011.
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was light, dealers said.
Prices of most actively quoted corporate bonds rose by about 1/8 point. Municipal bond traders said that prices of most tax-exempt issues rose by a similar amount.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended June 11. The narrowest measure, M-1, dipped by $600 million.
The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Brazil Backed on Economy

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, June 21

 BODY:
United States Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher expressed strong support today for President Fernando Collor de Mello's sweeping economic changes and the opening of Brazil's economy.
In a luncheon speech to the American Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Mosbacher praised Mr. Collor's ''ambitious program of open markets and limited government.'' 
Mr. Collor, who took office on March 15, immediately froze nearly two-thirds of the nation's money supply in an attempt to slow the inflation rate, which was more than 1,700 percent last year. He also vowed to trim the huge public sector and open the economy to foreign investment.
Although some Brazilians and executives of foreign corporations have expressed disappointment in the slow pace of opening the economy, officials traveling with the Commerce Secretary said the Collor administration was expected to announce a much wider opening on Monday.
The changes expected to be announced include permitting companies manufacturing in Brazil to import up to 40 percent of the components used in many products. Under current law, about 90 percent of the parts must be from domestic sources.
Mr. Mosbacher is in Brazil with nine American executives, heading what he called the first trade and investment mission under a new trade promotion coordinating committee of the Bush Administration.

Dollar Mixed in Light Day As Gold Increases in Price

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies yesterday, gaining against the yen but falling against the West German mark in light trading.
Gold advanced domestically and overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery rose 20 cents a troy ounce, to $350.70. Later, the Republic National Bank in New York reported a late bid of $349.90 an ounce, up 30 cents from Wednesday. 
Dealers said the mark advanced overseas on news that East German lawmakers had overwhelmingly approved a historic economic merger with West Germany, the most difficult step toward unifying the two nations.
A vote by the two houses of the West German Parliament was expected by today. That Parliament was also expected to pass the treaty, which outlines the monetary and economic merger of the Germanys by July 2.
In European trading the dollar rose to 1.6795 marks from Wednesday's 1.6785. But later in New York, the dollar eased, closing at 1.6760 marks, down from 1.6783 late Wednesday.
The dollar gained against the British pound after sterling rose overseas. In London, the pound rose to $1.7255, from $1.7225 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.7200, down from $1.7220 late Wednesday.
Sterling had been advancing on speculation that Britain would join Europe's exchange-rate mechanism this year.
The dollar also gained ground against the yen. Analysts said investors were moving funds from the yen to the dollar to take advantage of higher United States interest rates, given the relative stability of exchange rates.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.62 yen, to a closing 154.60 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 154.78 yen, and in New York it closed at 154.70 yen, up from 153.95 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Bonn to Aid Kremlin Reforms With a $3 Billion Bank Credit

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, June 22

 BODY:
The West German Government said today that it would guarantee a bank credit of five billion Deutsche marks, or about $3 billion, for the Soviet Union in an effort to bolster President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's flagging reform program.
It is the largest single credit that the Soviet Union has received from Western banks, and the conditions are extremely favorable, economists said.
They described the credit as part of an effort by West Germany to extract concessions from the Soviet Union on German reunification.
The announcement was made as the ''two plus four'' talks on German reunification got under way in Berlin, and the timing reinforces that view. It also underscores a difference of opinion between the United States and its Western European allies over the question of linking Western aid to the Soviet Union to further Soviet political and economic reforms. 
 
Removing Unification Barriers
Foreign ministers from the two Germanys and the four World War II Allies - Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union - began two days of talks today in Berlin on removing the foreign policy barriers to German reunification.
The credit is almost double the $1.6 billion credit line that West German bankers extended to the Soviet Union in October 1988 to help Moscow modernize its food and consumer goods industries. At the time, that was the largest Western credit ever offered to Moscow.
Bush Administration officials say they believes economic aid for the Soviet Union should be given only after deeper reaching political and economic reforms are in place.
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France rejected that view at a news conference today after their meeting Assmannshausen, a village on the Rhine.
Mr. Kohl said that he and Mr. Mitterrand believed that the Soviet Union ''needs help to help itself.''
''If we wait until the reforms are ready, we could have to wait a long time,'' he said. ''I do not think we have a lot of time. Perestroika is something which helps us all.''
Mr. Mitterrand said that the Soviet situation is urgent and that there would be no reform if there is no aid. He is pushing for Western nations to discuss aid for the Soviet Union at meetings over the next three weeks. He would not say whether France was prepared to follow West Germany's lead in guaranteeing bank credits.
A West German Government spokesman, Hans Klein, said the 12-year bank credit was the result of recent talks between Chancellor Kohl and President Gorbachev and should encourage other Western countries to join in support of the Soviet leaders' reforms.
The credit is not tied to any specific projects, West German government officials said. But economists believe much of it will be used to finance business between West German companies and the Soviet Union.
Extending credit does not mean that the money must be used. West German bankers say the Soviet Government, which has long been wary of becoming overly dependent on Western credit, did not use all the previous credit until the latter half of 1989.
Economists say that because of the inefficiency of the Soviet Union's centrally planned economy, about a third of the equipment purchased with that money has yet to be installed.
 
Moscow Under Pressure
Because of the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, however, experts say they believe the credits offered today will be used quickly either to finance German-Soviet business or to import consumer goods in an attempt to lessen the growing frustration of the Soviet people with constant scarcities.
''That would ease pressure on their domestic markets and significantly improve the mood of the population,'' said Jan Vanous, research director of PlanEcon in Washington.
The terms of the loan are far better than those commercial borrowers receive. The Soviet Union has a six-year grace period on payments. The interest rate is below commercial rates; the rates to the Soviet Union are 0.5 percent over the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as Libor, the interest rate that international banks charge each other for large loans. The rate is now 8.4 percent for dollar-based loans.
Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG, West Germany's largest and second-largest banks, will act as joint leaders of the international loan consortium.
Mr. Klein said the terms should give the Soviet Government enough breathing room to carry on with its reforms. He also pointed to the important role Soviet reforms have played in developments in East Germany. ''What is currently taking place in the process of German unification would not have happened without reforms in the Soviet Union,'' he said.
But he denied the loan was linked to negotiations with the Soviet Union over withdrawing its 420,000 troops from East Germany, saying ''No, there is no direct relation.''
Economists and foreign policy experts said the loan comes at an excellent time for the Soviet Union, but that it is clearly linked to Soviet concessions on German unity.
''That's quite a plum,'' said Ed A. Hewett, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''I'm convinced it's part of a not-so-subtle negotiation where the Germans say, 'We'll support perestroika and the economy and you help us with unification.' It won't be put that bluntly, but it is fairly transparent.''
Mr. Hewett said the Soviet Union needs the money to ''dig itself out of a hole.''
''Over the past six months they have had cash-flow problems,'' he said. ''Some bankers have required them to repay on short-term debt because of the payment problems.''
Mr. Vanous said West Germany's eagerness to overcome Soviet objections on the issue of a united Germany's military alliance membership is also a factor.
''This is the time,'' Mr. Vanous said. ''If the Germans get the right concessions, like a united Germany being part of NATO or the withdrawal of Soviet troops, then they are willing to commit themselves to a lot of financial aid.''
Persistent rumors in Bonn government circles claim West Germany has agreed to provide up to 20 billion marks ($11.9 billion) in immediate aid to the Soviets, a figure Mr. Vanous said seems realistic.
Mr. Vanous said he expected that the new credit would be followed soon by other assistance. ''There will be a deal No. 2,'' he said. ''Either a long-term loan or forgiving some of the Soviet Union's hard-currency debt, which was $60 billion at the end of last year and is probably up to $64 or $65 billion now.''

HEADLINE: Toll in Iranian Quake Is Put at 29,000

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, June 22

 BODY:
Thousands of people, dead and alive, were dug today from the rubble of what appeared to be Iran's worst earthquake. A global relief effort got under way and a stunned nation began to grasp the magnitude of the disaster, which killed thousands and laid waste to a region half the size of New York State.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 29,000 people had been killed and 28,000 injured in the quake, which shook northern Iran early Thursday. United Nations relief officials in Geneva quoted the Iranian Foreign Ministry as saying at least 35,000 had died and more than 100,000 had been injured.
 
Toll Expected to Rise
The numbers were only rough estimates based on surveys taken amid widespread confusion and crippled communications. Iranian leaders said the toll was expected to rise in the coming days as relief teams using bulldozers, dogs and bare hands search the rubble of more than 100 cities, towns and villages that were heavily damaged or destroyed. There was no estimate of the number of victims still trapped in rubble. 
The Iranian Red Crescent Society estimated that 400,000 people were left homeless by the temblor, which struck heaviest in Zanjan and Gilan provinces, a densely populated region of mountains, plains, hilly farmland and beach resorts in Iran's Caspian Sea coast area.
The earthquake, which struck at 12:30 A.M. Thursday, was measured at Teheran University at 7.3 on the Richter scale, indicating a severe quake. It combined with more than 100 aftershocks to cause huge landslides that blocked roads and relief convoys, knocked out electricity and water supplies in many areas, destroyed crops and left many villages isolated and thousands of people buried in the rubble of their homes.
 
Villages and Towns Wiped Out
''For the next 10 days, we will be digging through the ruins for corpses,'' an official of the Red Crescent Society said today after returning from the stricken region.
''There are dozens of villages, particularly in Gilan, that have completely disappeared,'' he added. ''Whole towns were flattened as if they never were there. We have no way of getting to many, because the roads are blocked by falling boulders and rocks, and planes have had difficulty landing in the mountains.''
Iranian television showed masked rescuers in white aprons pulling dust-covered bodies from under jagged chunks of concrete and placing them on blocks of ice in open trucks, and survivors as if in a daze rummaging through the remains of homes for loved ones and possessions.
Airborne cameras captured mile after mile of flattened homes and apartment buildings. Hospitals were shown overflowing with victims, including Shakineh Shevediny, a 16-year-old from the village of Manjil, in Gilan province, who recalled waking to find herself buried in debris.
''I could hear the screams of my grandfather,'' she said. After many hours, she was rescued.
''But it was too late for grandfather and my little brother,'' she went on. ''We waited for help on the street. Again at noon, another strong earthquake came, and again and again, until nothing was left of the village.''
Elsewhere in Manjil, a woman held her dead daughter in her arms as workers unearthed the body of another daughter. And a man in Rudbar, a mountainside village in Gilan province, told Iranian television that ''a rock as big as a building'' had crushed his home, killing four of his six children. His wife lay in the ruins for hours before help came.
 
'Not a Single House'
''There is not a single house in this area that has been left standing,'' said Ali Mohammadi, a farmer in Rudbar, where at least 6,000 people were reported to have been killed.
Rescuers used dogs to search for victims and survivors trapped beneath the rubble, and relief officials said in television interviews that thousands had been found alive. Television broadcasts from Rasht, the capital of Gilan province, showed young men frantically digging for victims, cranes lifting concrete slabs and bulldozers clearing roads for ambulances and other rescue vehicles.
About 3,000 trained relief workers and 3,000 tons of supplies were flown into the stricken areas northwest of Teheran aboard 50 flights today, officials of the Red Crescent Society said. Earlier, bad weather and poor visibility had hampered the airlift.
The Teheran airport was thronged with people trying to reach the quake zone to learn the fate of relatives, but only relief flights were going through. Iranian news reporters were in the stricken area, but foreign reporters were not allowed to travel there. Iranian authorities said they would be allowed into the area on Monday or Tuesday.
As military helicopters, C-130 transport planes and special Iran Air flights ferried medical personnel and tons of supplies into the region and flew 6,000 injured survivors out to hospitals in Teheran and other cities, President Hashemi Rafsanjani said the death toll was bound to rise as rescue teams reached thus-far inaccessible towns.
 
President Asks for Aid
''Realistic casualty figures would be a lot higher than those already announced,'' President Rafsanjani said as he stood beside a helicopter in the destroyed village of Rudbar and appealed for foreign assistance. ''Everyone is helping,'' he said, ''but with a calamity this disastrous, nothing could be enough.''
Despite Iran's recent history of diplomatic isolation, many nations rushed to offer humanitarian assistance and condolences. Those offering aid includied Iran's bitter enemy Iraq and the United States, which has not forgotten the 444 days when 52 members of the American Embassy staff here were held hostage in 1979-80.
''I convey my sincerest condolences and declare that we are ready to provide any assistance you may require,'' Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, said in a message to President Rafsanjani. Iran and Iraq each sustained heavy losses in their Persian Gulf war from 1980 to 1988.
The Red Cross in Geneva said Iran had requested antibiotics, tents and blankets, surgical equipment and thread, blood bags, food, vehicles and heavy equipment to lift and move rubble. It said the Red Crescent Society had indicated that doctors, technicians and other medical personnel were not needed.
Offers of assistance were received from the European Community, France, Britain, Japan, Israel, Syria, Finland, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Greece, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, Poland and other countries.
 
Tons of Supplies Sent
Tons of supplies and relief workers were being flown to Iran today, and many more planeloads were expected over the weekend. A senior official in Washington said Iran had accepted the Bush Administration's offer of aid, and the American Red Cross said the organization was raising money for earthquake relief in Iran.
While the full extent of casualties and destruction was unknown, it appears that the quake was the worst ever to strike Iran and - if the casualty estimates hold true or become worse - the world's worst since 200,000 people, by official estimates, died in an earthquake at Tangshan, China, in 1976. Other estimates say as many as 800,000 people may have died in that quake. Iran's worst previous quake killed 25,000 in 1978.
The quake caused damage estimated in the billions of dollars, ravaged one of Iran's major farming regions and could have serious implications for the nation's economy.
The deaths of thousands of laborers, the need to rebuild vast tracts of housing and commercial property, the destruction of irrigation systems and large crops of fruit, rice and wheat are all expected to have major effect on an economy already strained by years of war.
Reza Asghari, an insurance salesman, reached by telephone, said many people were stranded on the streets of Rasht looking for relatives and children. He described the damages in the city as minor compared with surrounding villages like Fuman, Manjil and Rudbar. The Islamic Republic News Agency said the town of Abbar was 100 percent destroyed. The Loshan Dam near Manjil was said to have been damaged by cracks and flooded surrounding areas, the agency said.
In Zanjan province, 4,000 bodies were found and more than 8,000 people were injured, reports indicated early today. In many areas, not a single structure was left standing. The towns and cities of Teheran, Qum, Hamadan, Arak, Saveh, Mahallat and Ashtian suffered minor damage to buildings.

HEADLINE: U.S. DECLARES OWL TO BE THREATENED BY HEAVY LOGGING

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, June 22

 BODY:
The northern spotted owl was formally declared a threatened species today, clearing the way for protection of the ancient forests in which the owls live and setting in motion a plan that could bring further economic trouble to timber towns in the Pacific Northwest.
The decision, announced by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, would make it illegal to harm the owls or destroy their critical habitat, most of which lies in national forests.
The move, which had been expected, has broad political support, although some in Congress criticized Federal officials today for delaying an announcement on how the owls, of which there are about 3,000 known pairs, will be protected. Federal officials said today that they would announce their plan for protecting the owls' habitat, including how much forest will be set aside and how much logging will be allowed there, on Tuesday.
 
Bitter Ecological Battle
The owl, said to be threatened by heavy logging of the nation's oldest and biggest trees, has been at the center of one of the bitterest environmental fights of the last decade. It is a battle that has been fought with lawsuits and with scientific studies arguing the cases for preserving the livelihood of thousands of timber workers on the one hand and for saving rich forestland that has been cut at the rate of 70,000 acres a year on the other. 
''The biological evidence says that the northern spotted owl is in trouble,'' said John Turner, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, a division of the Interior Department. ''We will not, and by law cannot, ignore that evidence.''
If the Wildlife Service decides to reduce logging in 17 national forests in Washington, Oregon and Northern California by 50 percent, as advocated by a panel of Federal biologists, the action would amount to one of the biggest land protection measures ever for a single species. That could cost up to 28,000 timber jobs in the next 10 years, according to Federal estimates.
 
Little Effect on Building
The giant cedars, Douglas fir and redwoods here are particularly prized by builders for their grain and strength, but the owl decision is not expected to have a discernible effect on the overall price of housing, economists say. The cutting of ancient timber in the Northwest provides only a small percentage of the lumber used to build homes in this country.
In recent weeks the price of lumber has dropped, reflecting a glut on the market as timber companies have cut more in anticipation of the owl listing. A slowdown in new home construction has also brought lumber prices down.
The decision to list the owl as threatened shows that ''the Administration recognizes the mistakes of the past which allowed massive clear-cutting of our last remaining ancient forests,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont who is chairman of a Senate committee overseeing forestry. But he accused the Bush Administration of ''delaying the tough news until later.''
President Bush had said he would not interfere with the Wildlife Service's decision and has ruled out economic aid to help timber towns make a transition. He compared their fate to that of coal miners in areas where jobs will be lost to meet provisions of the amended Clean Air Act.
In the Reagan Administration, by contrast, political appointees in Federal agencies were accused of trying to alter scientific reports about the owl to make less of the logging industry threat. A senior Forest Service official even recommended cutting down all old-growth forest on Federal lands, calling them a biological wasteland.
Since the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973, there have been 577 species in the United States declared endangered, which means they face extinction, or threatened, which means they are likely to become endangered. A species listed as threatened qualifies for the same legal protection. Few listings have ever generated as much heat or passion as the decision over the northern spotted owl.
 
Comprehensive Study Cited
The announcement today ''is based on the most comprehensive scientific inquiry ever made by the Fish and Wildlife Service in preparation for a listing decision,'' said Mr. Turner.
Reaction was generally favorable among environmentalists and fiercely negative among timber industry groups.
''We think the listing will be a catalyst for positive changes in the timber industry and the management of our national forests,'' said Bill Arthur of the Sierra Club. ''At the current rates of logging, the remaining stands of old growth will be gone in the next 20 years.''
Although forest economists have long predicted a decline in both jobs and the remaining ancient forests, the decision on the owl will force immediate changes.
Some timber groups predict that up to 50,000 jobs will be lost over an unspecified period, a figure environmentalists say is inflated.
''Our worst nightmare will come true if Federal decision makers do not respond to our distress signals,'' said Bill Shields, chairman of the American Forest Resource alliance, an industry group.
 
Industry Seeking Delays
Timber industry leaders are trying to get the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, the two agencies that control the owl habitat, to delay protection of the bird or to come up with a plan other than the one suggested by Federal biologists.
That plan, based on a year of study by biologists from different agencies, could mean 4 million more acres of ancient forest would be made off limits to logging. Some forestry officials have estimated that 1.5 million acres are already off limits to logging in wilderness areas and national parks in the Northwest.
''We do not feel the science is there to warrant taking such drastic action,'' said Chris West, the vice president of the Northwest Forestry Association, an industry group based in Portland, Ore. ''We don't believe the owl is threatened, we think environmentalists are trying to put us out of business.''
Environmentalists in the Northwest say that if significant areas of ancient forests are not protected, they will reactivate lawsuits in Federal Court. Last year similar litigation held up much of the logging in the national forests here.
Forest Service officials say reducing log exports - thereby freeing more timber for domestic mills - and increasing the cut from private timberlands would ease the economic crunch from the owl protection.
 
Efforts to Bar Exports
About 25 percent of all trees cut in the Northwest last year were shipped overseas. Exports are already outlawed in Federal forests, and a bill that prohibits log exports from state lands is in the final phases of consideration in Congress and is expected to pass.
The economy of the Northwest is generally booming, adding more than 120,000 new jobs last year. State economists say logging accounts for only 2 percent of employment in Washington and about 6 percent in Oregon.
But in the small timber towns that are dependent on national forest cutting for their economic well-being, a 50 percent reduction in logging could lead to record unemployment rates, state officials in Washington and Oregon say.
To survive, the towns need to move away from their dependence on ancient forests, said Larry Tuttle, Oregon representative of the Wilderness Society. He said years of overcutting had led to the current crisis.
''We're talking about an industry with record harvests, record profits, record exports at a time when workers' wages have been rolled back and jobs lost to automation,'' Mr. Tuttle said.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Shevardnadze Seeks Curbs On Forces in New Germany

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, June 22

 BODY:
The Soviet Union proposed unexpectedly today that an international endorsement of German unity include provisions for a staged withdrawal of all foreign troops from a united Germany and strict limits on its military.
The proposals, introduced by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at today's second ministerial session of the ''two plus four'' talks on German unity, were promptly rejected by the other participants - the United States, Britain, France and the two Germanys - as an unwarranted restriction on the sovereignty of a future Germany.
At a concluding news conference, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the Soviet plan would ''restrict German sovereignty and would do so for some years.''
Mr. Baker also rejected a related Soviet proposal that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Berlin within six months of the city's unification, noting that this would leave the city ringed with the 300,000 Soviet troops that are expected to remain for some time in the eastern part of a united Germany. 
 
No Significant Progress
Apart from Mr. Shevardnadze's surprise proposals, the six ministers apparently failed to make significant progress in their effort to negotiate an end to the Allied rights over Germany left over from World War II.
The session ended with what Mr. Baker described as a tentative agreement ''on the interim outline of the elements of a final settlement.'' The ministers also agreed to have experts prepare a list of remaining ''areas of concern'' and to propose appropriate forums for their resolution.
Much of the session was reportedly dominated by debate over Mr. Shevardnadze's proposals. Members of the Western delegations speculated that the Soviets had undertaken the initiative in part for domestic consumption, noting that a congress of the Russian Republic's Communist Party was in progress, and that today was the 49th anniversary of Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union.
Participants at the talks noted that Mr. Shevardnadze also stressed in his comments that the Soviet Union was eager to reach agreement in time for an all-European conference, scheduled for November, so it can endorse the outcome of the two-plus-four talks. The summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe could clear the way for all-German elections in December, the date Bonn is increasingly working toward.
The West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said at the news conference that he had informed his colleagues ''about the wish of the Germans to vote in a united voting area in December.''
 
Disavows Obstructionism
Mr. Shevardnadze took pains at the news conference to stress that Moscow was not seeking to block progress toward unity. ''I want to emphasize something very important, that we expect to have a final agreement that will resolve all aspects all of German unity by the end of this year,'' he said.
Despite such assurances and the suspicion that Mr. Shevardnadze was at least partly playing to a domestic audience, the Soviet position underscored the difficulties remaining in reconciling Moscow with the loss of its most important military and economic ally, East Germany.
Much of the real negotiating in the two-plus-four process has taken place between Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr. Genscher, who have held 10 meetings in recent months.
Beyond Mr. Shevardnadze's specific proposals lay differences in the basic approach to the two-plus-four talks.
Foremost is Moscow's continuing insistence that the wartime Allies set a transitional period after German unity during which they would retain some of their rights. The Soviets have also sought to include substantive security issues, like the size of the future German army, the alliance to which it would belong, or the withdrawal of Allied forces, into a two-plus-four final settlement.
The Soviet concern apparently is that without these conditions, Moscow would lose any leverage over a united Germany.
 
Other Forums Favored
The Western allies have countered that all such security issues may be debated in the two-plus-four forum, but that they must be resolved only in other international negotiations, such as the Vienna talks on conventional arm reductions, where Germany would not be singled out for continuing special treatment.
The allies have also argued that a united Germany's choice of alliance must ultimately be made by the Germans, and that the task of the two-plus-four talks is only to end all vestigial Allied rights and responsibilities over either Germany or Berlin.
In his package proposal, Mr. Shevardnadze said the final document should include measures to limit the size of the future German army and to shape it in such a way that it would be ''incapable of offensive operations.''
He also proposed that Germany would remain bound for five years by all international treaties signed by West and East Germany, including those involving the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The proposal echoed earlier Soviet demands to keep Germany in both alliances, an idea rejected by the West.
 
To Renounce All Rights
The Western outline of a draft settlement, as presented by Mr. Baker at the news conference, took an entirely different approach. It called on the four powers to renounce all their ''remaining rights and responsibilities,'' including those over Berlin, and to codify the achievement of ''full and complete sovereignty'' by a united Germany.
Mr. Baker also vented unusually direct irritation with Moscow.
''We are trying for our part to meet Moscow's appropriate security concerns,'' he said. ''But I have to say it is incumbent on the Soviets to understand the concerns of the German states and of others in Europe and in the United States as well.''

HEADLINE: The Mandela Visit;
Mandela Backs Sanctions And Meets U.S. Executives

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela pressed his call for continued economic sanctions to force change in South Africa in an address at the United Nations yesterday, and perhaps more importantly, at a private meeting with major American business executives and investors.
''Nothing that has happened in South Africa calls for a revision of the position that this organization has taken,'' Mr. Mandela told the world body. ''The sanctions that have been imposed by the United Nations and by individual governments should remain in place.''
He hoped, he said, that no country would ease sanctions, creating ''any situation in which those who are opposed to change in our country find encouragement to resist change.''
 
Three Goals
Organizers of Mr. Mandela's hectic United States visit regarded his morning meeting with the executives, many from Fortune 500 corporations, as well as foundation executives and New York movers and shakers as perhaps the most important single stop. 
Mr. Mandela's goals in the meeting, they said, were threefold: to keep up economic pressure on the white South African Government, to allay fears that the African National Congress would impose a socialist economic system through nationalization of industries and to seek future international investment.
Out of the meeting came a proposal by the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, Peter Goldmark, for the creation of a South African development bank to be ready to channel international investment into a newly democratic South Africa. Mr. Goldmark did not offer a plan to finance the bank.
His idea appeared to generate strong interest among the executives at the breakfast meeting, people who were present said, and Mr. Mandela, the deputy president of the African National Congress, called the proposal ''constructive and imaginative.''
 
Start With a Walk
Mr. Mandela also found himself facing strong criticism from Jewish groups for his continued public support for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
His day began, as it had on Thursday, with a brisk walk from Gracie Mansion through Carl Schurz Park and along the East River. It ended with $2,500-a-person fund-raisers at the East Side town house of the film executive Arthur Krim and at Robert De Niro's trendy TriBeCa Film Center. Mr. Mandela wore his customary gray suit and tie for the walk; his host, Mayor David N. Dinkins, who dresses to the occasion, a blue jogging suit.
The private breakfast meeting in the World Trade Center included such major financial figures as Thomas Johnson of Manufacturer's Hanover Trust; James R. Jones, chairman of the American Stock Exchange; Frank Lorenzo, chairman of the Texas Air Corporation; Donald Marron, chairman of the Paine Webber Group; William A. Scheyer of Merrill Lynch; Muriel Siebert, the first woman to gain a seat on the New York Stock Exchange; Theodore Sorenson, the author who was President John F. Kennedy's special counsel; G. Richard Thoman, president of American Express International; Maurice Tempelsman, whose firm specializes in precious minerals, and; Marvin S. Traub, chairman of Bloomingdale's. There were also such important New York figures as Lewis Rudin, the real-estate executive and Howard J. Rubenstein, the public relations consultant.
 
'Crackling Excitement'
The meeting was organized jointly by the New York City Partnership, a business group established during the city's fiscal crisis, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. A condition of the meeting was that no reporters be present.
In a city so mesmerized by Mr. Mandella's visit that the Empire State Building is lighted up in the African National Congress colors of black, green and yellow, even an audience of executives was not immune to Mr. Mandela's presence, giving him a standing ovation as he entered and departed.
''There was a crackling excitement in the audience,'' Richard Leone, the chairman of the Port Authority, said later. ''I've spent a long time on Wall Street, and you don't usually see that in an audience of this type. It was quite an exciting thing.''
''The idea of continued sanctions was received warmly,'' said Gordon J. Davis, a lawyer and former City Parks Commissioner, who attended the breakfast. ''This was a very mixed group, a cross section of the city's financial powers.
Mr. Goldmark suggested the creation of a South African Development Bank during a brief question period after Mr. Mandela's speech, people present said, likening it to the Marshall Plan, which helped war-ravaged Europe, and efforts now being made to help Eastern European countries recover from Communism.
 
Restructure Economy
It would serve first as a visible symbol to the rest of the world, Mr. Goldmark said, that the international community stands ready to invest in South Africa just as soon as it has a truly democratic Government.
The development bank, Mr. Goldmark suggested, could help restructure the economy by generating investments and channeling development loans that reflect the priorities of a freely chosen, multiracial Government. At the same time, he said, it would need a rigorous structure to gain the confidence of investors.
It would be hard to see how the bank could be started with the present conditions, Mr. Goldmark said, but it was time to begin thoughtful preparations so as to have the mechanism for development investment ready when the country does have a truly democratic Government.
Mr. Mandela appeared intrigued by Mr. Goldmark's proposal, saying at a brief news conference after the breakfast, ''If we have sufficient resources from that institution, it is not necessary for us to look at any other option.''
The economic proposal would appear to lend strength to Mr. Mandela in his negotiations with the South African Government of President F. W. de Klerk.
 
Seeks Mixed Economy
Seeking to ease fears of nationalization, Mr. Mandela told the executives that for the future, the congress sought ''a mixed economy, though we have no blueprint as to the makeup of that mix.''
But he insisted, ''We are convinced that this economy will have to be restructured, so that it is able to serve the material interests of all of our people and not just the white minority.''
''We are sensitive to the fact that as investors in a post-apartheid South Africa,'' Mr. Mandela went on, ''you will need to be confident about the security of your investments, an adequate and equitable return on your capital and a general climate of peace and stability.''
He returned several times to his theme that ''the pressure must be maintained,'' saying at one point, ''You should continue to isolate apartheid South Africa.''
Those at the meeting are used to lives of limousines and opened doors, so they found themselves out of their element in the tight security and closed-off streets imposed for Mr. Mandela's visit. One man laughingly showed a memo his staff had written to him. It bore instructions on how to use the subway and had a token taped to it.
 
'Feverish Pace'
At the United Nations, Mr. Mandela warned that white South African terrorist groups were plotting to kill him and other congress leaders to prevent the dismantling of apartheid.
Some white South Africans, he said, are ''working at a feverish pace to establish paramilitary groups whose stated aim is the physical liquidation of the A.N.C., its leadership and membership as well as other which these right-wing terrorist groups see as a threat to the continued existence of the system of white minority domination.''
Adding that other die-hard armed opponents of change were entrenched in the ranks of the police and the South African army, Mr. Mandela said, ''We cannot afford to underestimate the threat that these defenders of a brutal and continuing reality pose to the whole process of working toward a just political settlement.
''There are many among our white compatriots who are still committed to the maintenance of the evil system of white minority domination,'' he added, some because they are ideologically committed to racism, others because they fear democratic rule.
 
Standing Ovation
Police marksmen stood on nearby rooftops, and police boats patroled the East River as Mr. Mandela received a hero's welcome from cheering United Nations employees.
He addressed the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid, although it appeared that most of the General Assembly delegates attended, giving him a standing ovation as he entered. The General Assembly is not in session, and the meeting was specially called to hear Mr. Mandela.
An amatuer boxer in his youth, the South African leader included among his guests the boxers Mike Tyson, Sugar Ray Leonard and the boxing promotor Don King.
''Victory for a united, democratic and nonracial South Africa is within our grasp,'' Mr. Mandela told a cheering audience.
 
'Rancor or Vengeance'
But he also warned that ''the apartheid system remains in place'' and that the encouraging start to his talks with Mr. de Klerk in Cape Town last month ''should not lead us to conclude that further progress is assured or that we will not have to confront major obstacles in the future.''
Before Mr. Mandela spoke, the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, praised the absence of ''rancor or vengeance'' in his statements since his release after 27 years in prison. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York called him ''a symbol of hope for the world.''
But Mr. Mandela has also come under criticism from Jewish groups for his continued support of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its chairman, Yasir Arafat, particularly for remarks Thursday night on the ABC News program, ''Nightline,'' in which he also appeared to condone the Governments of Cuba and Libya.
And in Miami yesterday, the City Commission dropped a planned resolution of welcome for Mr. Mandela, who is to speak at a labor convention in Miami Beach on June 28. Some Cuban exiles called for demonstrations during his visit here to protest Mr. Mandela's praise for Fidel Castro.
Mr. Mandela did not waver from his position in his speech to the United Nations yesterday, saying at one point:
''We also take this opportunity to extend warm greetings to all others who fight for their liberation and their human rights, including the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara. We commend their struggles to you, convinced that we're all moved by the fact that freedom is indivisible, convinced that the denial of the rights of one diminish the freedom of others.''

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action Is at Least on the Right Track

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Efforts to achieve racial equality in the United States have made scant progress since the 1960's, but if Michael Levin's June 9 letter (''Affirmative Action Bears Great Moral Costs'') is an accurate guide, our capacity for careful reasoning about racial issues has shown no improvement at all.
Professor Levin claims that the ''main argument for affirmative action appeals to compensatory justice.'' It is probably true that the best-known arguments for affirmative action appeal to compensatory notions. But the best arguments about affirmative action, pro and con, are framed in noncompensatory terms. 
The principal issue is not whether or not blacks have suffered harms for which they should be compensated (they have certainly suffered harms, but it is unclear that these harms can be compensated for in a meaningful way). It is whether or not we believe our society should allocate privileges to some groups and severe disadvantages to others along largely hereditary lines. This is a political question the answer to which depends upon a decision about substantive values.
Professor Levin asserts that affirmative action programs are unjust to whites who fail to gain positions they might have won if the criteria for allocating these positions were not race-conscious. This argument tacitly assumes that familiar meritocratic criteria for allocating positions are just. But these criteria are determined in light of a heterogeneous mix of public and private objectives, including economic efficiency and productivity, rather than by considerations of justice. There is no good reason why the promotion of racial equality should not be one of these objectives.
Affirmative action is a problematical instrument for advancing racial equality. It is not sufficient for the purpose, which could be achieved only through a national commitment to prevent the continuation of disadvantages by providing the young members of disadvantaged groups with educational resources of a much higher standard than many receive, together with provisions for child care, health care and other forms of support. Affirmative action may not even be necessary for the advancement of racial equality if racial barriers that were a familiar part of the American landscape only a short time ago can be prevented from reappearing.
But affirmative action may be a useful, if highly imperfect, means of edging toward racial equality, especially in the absence of a serious national effort to achieve this objective in a more satisfactory way. In any case, affirmative action should be evaluated for its likely consequences, not by misplaced appeals to compensatory notions.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Nonproliferate Peace

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: GENEVA

 BODY:
The assumption that the Soviet-American arms race has ended, and with it the risk of global nuclear holocaust, has spread much faster than the facts. Some troubling new issues are coming to the fore as countries contemplate the role of nuclear weapons in a world not dominated by East-West confrontation.
There was a striking example here after the chief American and Soviet negotiators on strategic arms reduction spoke to a meeting on the future of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The Groupe de Bellerive, headed by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, was meeting to look ahead to a review conference on the treaty scheduled this summer, and to the 1995 deadline for renewing the treaty or letting it lapse. 
The U.S. negotiator, Richard Burt, and his Soviet counterpart, Yuri Nazarkin, noted important differences they still had to settle. But they were clearly in the same boat, allies against critics from all over, including American and British activists.
Some of the anti-nuclear militants now share the problem of cold warriors, furiously insisting that nothing has really changed so they don't have to reconsider their crusades. The bigger difficulty comes from other parts of the world that have yet to undergo a sea change on the ideas of war and what constitutes security.
There's a certain apple-pie stamp of goodness on the Nonproliferation Treaty, but it's fading. True, there aren't nearly as many more nuclear powers in the world as was fearfully anticipated.
But as one speaker said, there are a number of ''latent and blatant proliferators'' who show little sign of backing away from being or becoming bomb-capable. Although it has proved to be an economic dud for energy supply, plutonium is being produced at a rate that threatens to become uncontrollable. That should be stopped. On present plans, Japan alone will have 400 tons in 30 years, twice the present holdings of the U.S. and U.S.S.R. combined.
Some attack the Nonproliferation Treaty as a failure because even if the superpowers cut their arsenals by half, they would have three times as many warheads as when they signed the treaty in 1968 with a promise to reduce. Others say it's a way to institutionalize military inferiority and inequality in the third world.
The status symbol of nuclear weapons still has a powerful appeal. There's no conceivable military or security reason for South Africa to want them, given its huge arms machine. India, which exploded a ''device,'' says it has no intention of producing weapons, but comforts the ambition of assuring its place as regional superpower by keeping alive the possibility. Pakistan won't renounce its effort to counter.
An Israeli said even the most ardent doves in his country wouldn't give up the last-resort option on which it counts for survival, despite threats of chemical war from Iraq. While Jerusalem keeps mum on the subject, there is reason to think the famous revelation of Israel's arsenal by Mordechai Vanunu was seen as a boon by Israeli strategists.
Mr. Vanunu was kidnapped from London after spilling the nuclear beans to The Sunday Times, tried and sentenced to 18 years. But the incident served to establish Israel as a nuclear power without the onus of conducting a test or admitting to being able.
Now that the big powers agree that deterrence worked between them, others are saying, why not us? It's a tough question, something like the idea of legalizing narcotics. Nuclear weapons, like drugs, are doubtless bad for people, but if making them available reduces violence, is that worse than ineffective attempts to police them?
Of course, there are some important differences. A technical one is that it is increasingly evident that nuclear capacity has spread almost entirely by exports from advanced industrial countries, which could police themselves better. An existential one is that not all states will be rational, the key assumption of deterrence; and a little nuclear slippage is a vast catastrophe.
As they reduce conventional arms, East and West may rely more on their nuclear deterrence, certainly if other countries rattle rockets. A hypothetical excuse for superiority, said an Indian. An inevitable response, said a Frenchman.
The underlying point is that making the world safer has to come from political change and recognition that wars are a net loss to all concerned. That's started in Europe; it needs to proliferate. Meanwhile, the Nonproliferation Treaty must be kept and strengthened.

HEADLINE: All New Jersey Schools to Face New Limits

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

 BODY:
Restrictions on spending await both the troubled urban school systems in New Jersey that are gaining millions of dollars under the state's revised school-financing formula, and the wealthy suburban districts facing sharp cutbacks in aid.
The poorest urban districts will be able to spend their windfall only on programs that the State Education Department will help them draft before their new money pours in for the 1991-92 school year.
And the wealthy districts face a cap on their spending, cutting their powers to raise unlimited money through local property taxes. To suburban superintendents, this is one of several bitter financial pills forced on them by Gov. Jim Florio's sweeping redistribution of state educational spending. 
As for the controls on urban schools, Florio administration officials, sensitive to fears that the sharply higher aid could be wasted, say they want to keep tight reins on the money and insure that it goes for approved and educationally sound programs.
That policy will be directed at the state's 30 poorest urban districts. They include Newark, Paterson, Jersey City, Camden and Trenton and serve about 29 percent of the state's 1.1 million schoolchildren. Traditionally, the 30 urban districts have had the state's deepest social ills and weakest student performance. In the five years starting next summer, the 30 will receive most of the new aid generated by Governor Florio's $1.2 billion in income tax increases and the millions in state aid being shifted from wealthy and upper-middle-class suburban districts, almost all of them in Bergen, Essex, Morris and Passaic Counties.
By 1996, aid for Newark, Camden, Paterson, Jersey City and Trenton alone will increase to $1.28 billion, from $728.6 million in 1990-91, under the ''foundation'' spending system created by the new law.
In the next few weeks, state education authorities will start meeting with urban superintendents to select and plan for new educational programs for the 1991-92 school year.
''That's going to be the highest priority -helping them put together policies and programs that are effective,'' said Thomas B. Corcoran, Governor Florio's chief education adviser. ''We're going to give them a list of things they should consider. If they want to do other things, we're going to ask for educational justification.''
Mr. Corcoran said programs being considered included an extended school day, smaller class sizes in kindergarten through third grade, full-day kindergarten, guidance counselors in elementary schools, higher-level academic courses and improved vocational and career guidance in high schools, and broader offerings in science and social studies in middle schools.
''These things would give urban students the same full range of opportunities offered in other schools,'' Mr. Corcoran said. ''These kids are the future work force and the future taxpayer, and if they're not taxpayers, they will be on welfare. We in this country have got to succeed with these kids.''
As for New Jersey's wealthiest suburban districts, the new law's cap on their future spending increases creates a double impact on them - declining state aid between 1992 and 1996 and less freedom to offset the loss with higher local taxes.
 
Spending Caps Opposed at First
The cap ranges from 7.5 percent to 15 percent, depending on how much a district's budget for the 1991-1992 school year exceeds the foundation budget that the state will assign it starting July 1991. For instance, a district spending 50 percent above the foundation budget for 1991-92 will be allowed to increase spending by 7.5 percent. A district whose budget is equal to the foundation budget can spend 15 percent more. Only the 30 poorest districts are exempt from the cap.
The Florio administration initially opposed limiting the wealthy districts for two reasons. When they proposed the new formula on May 24, Florio aides said they feared a spending cap could prevent a high-performing innovative district from creating new programs that ultimately could be copied in urban districts. They were also concerned that a state-imposed spending restriction on a premiere local district could diminish its reputation and impede economic growth in the region around it.
The administration initially planned to cut aid only to the wealthy districts to help finance the sharp increases for the poor districts.
But the State Supreme Court's school-aid ruling on June 5 forced a change in administration policy.
 
Equal Spending for Poorest
The ruling ordered spending parity between pupils in the state's 28 poorest districts and its 54 richest. The court placed no obstacles on spending by the rich. But it ordered the state to aid the poorest enough to equalize their spending with the richest.
Thus, unless the Governor's new law capped the richest districts, they in effect would have been able to dictate policy on state education spending.
The foundation formula provides money to help districts reach three arbitrary statewide per-pupil spending levels in 1991-92 - $6,835 for kindergarten through grade 5; $7,519 for grades 6 to 8 and $9,091 for grades 9 to 12.
Florio aides say those levels will provide all children with quality education. A district's share of foundation aid depends on its property wealth and per-capita income. For 1991-92, 428 districts will divide up $3.2 billion, with the poorest districts getting the biggest share.
The state's 150 richest districts will get no foundation aid. They include Princeton, Tenafly, Millburn, West Orange, Wayne, Livingston, Hackensack and Englewood.
Because the foundation aid package includes money to help meet the state's new requirement that all local districts pay their teachers' pension and Social Security costs and retiree health benefits, those 150 districts will have to pay all those expenses from local taxes. The estimated annual increase of pension and other costs is about 11 percent.
Suburban superintendents and teachers fear that those costs - worsened by both the law's budget cap and four years of declining state aid through 1996 - will lead to cuts in staff and programs and reduce premiere districts to average ones over time.

HEADLINE: A Corrupt Alliance in New York Clenches the Construction Trade

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Authorities say Thursday's indictments of 12 men accused of rigging painting contracts spotlights a wider problem in the city's construction industry: the secret pacts between the Mafia, union officials and corrupt contractors.
Law-enforcement officials and other experts who have studied the city's construction problems believe that some contractors have long viewed the Mafia as a stabilizing force that will insure profits in a hard-pressed industry.
The painting indictments obtained by the Manhattan District Attorney's office charged that all major public and private contracts in the city had been rigged for the last 12 years. Those accused of participating in the conspiracy are eight top officials of the painters' union, two suspected leaders of the Lucchese crime family and two contractors. 
 
Inflated Costs
Prosecutors say the corrupt painting contracts inflated public and private costs by untold millions of dollars. The indictments came only a month after a Federal indictment asserted Mafia leaders had fixed bids on $142 million in window contracts at the city's Housing Authority.
In addition to painting contractors and window manufacturers, prosecutors say that the carpentry, dry wall and concrete trades have long been under the thumb of New York's five organized-crime families. Contractors in each of these trades, the authorities say, formed secret and profitable monopolies known as ''clubs,'' with the Mafia's blessings.
The ''clubs,'' with the connivance of bribed union officials, squeezed out legitimate competitors. In a report in 1987, the state's Organized Crime Task Force found that many contractors in the city actually welcomed the Mafia.
''Syndicates can assure contractors that they will only have to pay off once for a specified result, that the amount to be paid will be reasonable and that the services paid for will be delivered,'' the report said.
As an example of the underworld's influence, the report noted that the Mafia secretly obtained for contractors lower wage scales and resolved union jurisdictional disputes that might have led to work stoppages. In this role, the report emphasized, racketeers by criminal means serve as de facto labor consultants.
Frank M. Schoenfeld, a former official in the city's painters' union, the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 9, said he tried unsuccessfully to get contractors from outside the city to seek work here.
''The legitimate contractors can't compete with the guys in the club,'' said Mr. Schoenfeld. ''And on top of that they certainly don't want to get messed up,'' he added, referring to physical violence.
Several contractors who agreed to be interviewed on the condition they would not be identified acknowledged paying bribes to union executives, as well as organized-crime figures. The payoffs prevented wildcat walkouts that would have delayed projects, increased costs and jeopardized profits, the contractors explained.
Many contractors are strapped for cash because they get full payment from private developers or the city only after a public or private project is completed.
Contracts for municipal construction and renovation and maintenance work are normally awarded to qualified low bidders. City agencies can reject a low bid if it is too high. Officials, however, contend that it is difficult to measure reasonable construction costs.
 
Corruption Is Ingrained
''Even if vigilant city officials were to detect patterns of corruption there is little they can do about it,'' said Edward A. McDonald, the former head of the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Brooklyn. ''Collusive bidding is so ingrained in the economic life of the city that it would be meaningless to disqualify one or two bidders suspected of bid-rigging.''
In 1986 the administration of former Mayor Edward I. Koch tried to reduce the mob's influence over concrete supplies in Manhattan. The city guaranteed million-dollar municipal contracts to any responsible company that would build a plant on rent-free city land on the West Side of Manhattan.
But there were almost no takers. The reason: many out-of-town companies said they were intimidated by the reputation of the city's construction industry for corruption, violence and Mafia influence.
Law-enforcement officials say that organized crime penetrated the construction industry mainly through its domination of pivotal labor unions. Most construction workers in the city have no steady employer, no seniority rights and they are usually assigned to jobs through union hiring halls. Union officials, especially business agents, are critical in determining who works and who gets the highest-paid jobs.
''If you are a corrupt union official, or in cahoots with the mob, you make sure your cronies keep electing you,'' said Herman Benson, secretary of the Association for Union Democracy, a group that monitors union elections and civil rights. ''There are virtually no grievance procedures for anyone in the construction trades who fights the Mafia.''
Until the early 1980's, the Federal Labor Department's New York Office of Labor Racketeering was the only agency that routinely watched for underworld influence and corruption in the construction field. Labor racketeering generally had a low priority for Federal and state law-enforcement agencies. Sporadic convictions of low-level Mafia figures or union leaders had little effect on corruption.
But in recent years the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the state's Organized Crime Task Force and the Manhattan District Attorney's office have begun long-range campaigns to clean up the city's industry.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 44.55 Points, To 2,857.18

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled late yesterday as program traders moved in heavily toward the end of the day selling stocks along a broad front.
By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had plunged 44.55 points, to 2,857.18.
Despite three days of advancing prices after Monday's 53.71-point drop, yesterday's loss brought the cumulative decline for the week to 78.71 points.
Just one week ago the bellwether blue-chip average stood at 2,935.89 -its highest point in history. 
 
Reason for Move Uncertain
With many Wall Street traders leaving early on a hot summer day, analysts were hard pressed to find a solid reason why program traders moved in so heavily when they did.
But David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist for Jesup & Lamont Inc. of New York, said, ''Half the traders in the S.&P. pits in Chicago left early, and there was no one around to counteract the sell programs.''
One trader remarked, ''Someone important had to have been shot for the market to drop that much.''
Traders have apparently been nervous all week, particularly after Monday's sharp decline. In expectation of further declines, speculators have been selling short, that is, selling stock they do not yet own in the hope of buying it later for less money.
For most of the day the Dow moved narrowly, staying close to the opening level of 2,901.73, climbing just before 3 P.M. to around 2,921, its highest point of the session. From that point it dropped sharply.
 
Effects of Two Sell Programs
Birinyi Associates cited two sell programs, where traders used computers to sell stocks and buy S.&P. 500 index futures. One program began at 3:24 P.M., lasted for 16 minutes and clipped 39 points off the Dow. The other, starting at 3:46, lasted seven minutes and lopped off 15 more points. Buy programs and normal trading activities helped offset the strong decline.
Laszlo Birinyi, head of the research firm, said, ''On a late Friday in the summertime, there's not going to be many buyers around to stem the tide.''
Hugh Johnson, head strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said that while durable goods orders rose 3.9 percent in May, or much more than had been expected, and personal income rose three-tenths of 1 percent, or somewhat less than expected, neither created any market excitement.
''There's a little apprehension out there,'' he said.
He said that the big financial institutions had been buying stock in the last two weeks to ''dress up'' their portfolios and that this ''has been supporting the market.''
But, he asked, ''What happens when the second quarter ends and the window dressing stops?''
Moreover, he said, earnings reports on the second quarter will begin coming out soon and that ''uncertainty'' over both the end of the window dressing and what earnings will look like would keep the market ''trendless and directionless'' until some hard news comes along.
Mr. Johnson argued that that news is still two weeks away, when the Government announces employment data for June.
In Cleveland, Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for Prescott, Ball & Turben, said that after Monday's decline, ''the rally that followed was not big enough to convince people it was a rally.'' He noted that stocks advanced most of the day yesterday but that ''the advance lacked volume as well as breadth.''
Mr. Bostian of Jesup & Lamont argued that buy programs and end-of-the-quarter window dressing had supported the market but that the buying ''burned itself out.'' Volume, still only moderately strong, rose to 172.6 million shares, from 138.6 million the day before. But 893 stocks fell and only 607 advanced.
While the Dow industrials slumped 44.55 points, the broader S.&P. 500 index fell 5.04, to 355.43, or the equivalent of a 40.57-point drop in the Dow, confirming that the selloff was fairly widespread.
The Nasdaq composite fell 1.94, to 459.33, and the Amex market value index slid 0.93, to 359.29.
Among market favorites caught in the selloff, I.B.M. fell 2 7/8, to 116 1/4, in heavy trading. Compaq Computer slid 3 3/4, to 120 1/4, also in heavy trading. Digital Equipment, another big computer company, fell 2 1/2, to 83, again in heavy trading.
Walt Disney fell 3 3/4, to 127 3/4, on substantially more than a half-million shares.
 
Campbell Soup Off 2 3/8
Campbell Soup, supposedly a takeover target of Philip Morris, fell 2 3/8, to 57 1/4, on 483,000 shares after Philip Morris agreed to buy most of Jacobs Suchard A.G. of Switzerland for $3.8 billion. European analysts have speculated, however, that Philip Morris may still be in the market for other big companies.
After Moody's said it was considering downgrading their bonds because of the weakening outlook for military business, Litton Industries fell 3 5/8, to 71 1/2; McDonnell Douglas fell 1 1/4, to 34 1/2, after hitting a low at 34; Raytheon fell 2, to 62 1/2, and Lockheed fell 3/8, to 34 7/8.
Boeing, which rose 4 5/8 last week to 60 1/8, fell 1 5/8 in heavy trading, to 57 3/8.
Loctite, a maker of sealants and adhesives, rose 2, to 60 1/4, in strong trading but declined a New York Stock Exchange request to say why. First Brands, maker of Glad bags and Prestone and STP automotive products, rose 4 3/4, to 28 3/8, on 1.9 million shares after it put itself on the block.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Up Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
Orders for ''big ticket'' durable goods jumped 3.9 percent in May, the Government reported today. Analysts said it was further evidence that the economy's sluggish manufacturing sector might be bouncing back.
''There have been some signs of a manufacturing rebound,'' said Paul Getman, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods - items like automobiles and appliances expected to last at least three years - totaled a seasonally adjusted $128.2 billion after falling 4.2 percent in April.
 
Record Plunge in January
Orders have risen in three of the last four months after plunging a record 10.5 percent in January.
''Taken in conjunction with the stronger 6.7 percent gain in March, there are signs that industrial activity may be gradually emerging from its slump,'' said Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers.
Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, noted that much of the recent manufacturing weakness had been in the automobile industry. ''With the auto sector moving back to more normal, the manufacturing tone in terms of orders, unfilled orders and industrial production is starting to look a little better,'' he said. ''It could be an element of hope that has not been present for over a year.''
 
Rise in Autos and Planes
Most of the May increase was in transportation equipment, up 9.9 percent, to $35.3 billion. Nearly two-thirds of this rise was concentrated in automobiles; most of the remainder was in aircraft. Transportation orders have been volatile during much of the year, with, for instance, a 13.5 percent drop in April and a 24.1 percent gain in March.
Excluding transportation, orders were up 1.8 percent in May.
But while analysts saw some reason for optimism in the overall report, the closely watched nonmilitary capital goods sector, often a barometer of business investment plans, fell 1.4 percent, to $36.1 billion. It was the fourth decline this year after peaking in December at $44.4 billion.
Military equipment orders, another volatile category, jumped 19 percent, to $9.9 billion, after a 3.4 percent rise in April. Excluding the military sector, orders rose 2.8 percent.
Shipments of durable goods, which have increased in three of the last four months, were up 3.5 percent in May, to $126.1 billion. Unfilled orders edged up by four-tenths of 1 percent, to $500.3 billion, nearly half of which was in aircraft.
Both non-electrical machinery and primary metal orders were up in May. Non-electrical machinery posted a 3.2 percent gain, to $22.2 billion. Primary metals were up 2.2 percent, to $11.8 billion, most of which was in steel. Electrical machinery orders inched down two-tenths of 1 percent, to $20.4 billion.

HEADLINE: May Spending Unchanged; Income Shows a Small Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
Personal spending was flat in May, the Government said today in a report pointing to growing caution among consumers who have been a major source of strength for the economy during seven years of growth.
''The consumer clearly has pulled back in a dramatic fashion,'' said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company in New York.
The Commerce Department also said personal income rose by only three-tenths of 1 percent in May for a second straight month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.7 trillion. 
 
Rate of $3.66 Trillion
The department said consumer spending remained unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.66 trillion after seven straight months of gains, including five-tenths of 1 percent in April and three-tenths in March. But even the April and March rises were weaker than first thought. They were revised downward from the six-tenths of 1 percent and five-tenths increases reported last month.
Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health since it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Analysts have cited a poor job market and weak wage increases for the flagging consumer confidence.
Indeed, the income gains of only three-tenths of 1 percent in both April and May followed three consecutive monthly rises of eight-tenths and were the lowest since a two-tenths increase last September.
 
No Match for Inflation
The income gains have not even matched the inflation rate, said Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group, a Washington management consulting firm.
Today's report was the latest indicating a slowdown in consumer spending, which has been a driving force for much of the current economic expansion that is now in its eighth year.
The Commerce Department reported last week that retail sales fell in May, their third consecutive monthly decline. It was the first time retail sales fell for three straight months since the summer of 1981, during the last recession. Retail sales represent about half of overall consumer spending. And the department on Thursday revised downward its previous estimate of consumer spending in the first quarter.
Nevertheless, Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley said the slow pace of consumer spending was not likely to tip the economy into a recession because ''there are other things out there still giving the economy a boost.'' He cited a second report today showing that orders for durable goods - ''big ticket'' items expected to last at least three years - jumped by 3.9 percent in May.
 
Savings Figure Improved
The difference between incomes and spending in May helped improve the savings rate of Americans. The rate - savings as a percent of disposable income - rose to 6.2 percent following a 6 percent rate in April and a 6.3 percent rate in March. March's was the highest in five years.
A higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital as more funds are available domestically for business investment.
The report said the income of Americans after taxes increased by two-tenths of 1 percent, the same rate as in April. The key component of the income category - wages and salaries - rose by $10.3 billion after a $16.4 billion gain in April.
On the spending side, purchases of durable goods fell by $12.6 billion after an $8.5 billion gain in April. Durable goods purchases had fallen the previous two months.
Purchases of nondurable goods were down $500 million in May, their third consecutive decline. Spending on services slowed to $13.1 billion after a $14.7 billion gain in April and a $19.6 billion rise in March.

HEADLINE: One Holdout Said to Snag Trump Deal

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
A major German bank is now the biggest obstacle between Donald J. Trump and a $65 million loan package to rescue his empire, bankers said yesterday.
Bankers negotiating a plan to help keep Mr. Trump out of bankruptcy said several Japanese banks that had refused to approve the loan proposal had changed their position, but Dresdner Bank A.G., which holds a $15 million share of a loan secured by the Trump Tower, was refusing.
Mr. Trump, who has been largely absent from public view since news spread of his financial troubles, issued a statement yesterday expressing confidence that the banks would reach a final agreement.
 
Deal Called 'Very Close'
''The banks we have been working with are very close to coming together in support of a restructuring plan,'' he said. 
The package, which will include lending the developer $65 million and deferring interest and principal payments on about $850 million of his nearly $2 billion of bank debt, has the tentative approval of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
Earlier in the week, those three, along with Dresdner, had refused to approve the new loan arrangement because it required that another lien be put on the Trump Tower, the developer's Fifth Avenue skyscraper.
Bankers in the talks said Dresdner Bank was still refusing to approve the package and wanted the large American banks to buy out its position. Bankers and lawyers in the talks said that none of the banks would agree to buying out Dresdner and that they would allow the deal to collapse rather than buy out any other bank. Representatives from the Trump Organization will be meeting with Dresdner executives today to try to persuade the bank to change its stance.
Dresdner ''refuses to budge,'' one banker said. ''And unless the Dresdner Bank agrees, this German institution will bring down Donald Trump.''
 
Part of a Syndicate
Dresdner is part of a syndicate that now holds the $75 million loan that the Chase Manhattan Bank originally made to Mr. Trump against the Trump Tower. Each of four foreign banks in the syndicate holds just under $15 million of the loan, with Chase holding slightly more. The plan for the new loan requires that all the banks with loans secured by Mr. Trump's assets approve the plan. Most of the other loan syndicates, including one led by Citibank and another led by Chase, have generally agreed to go along with the plan.
Mr. Trump failed to pay bankers and bondholders about $73 million that was due last Friday. If he does not pay the holders of bonds from the Trump's Castle casino about $43 million by midnight Tuesday, he will have defaulted on the bonds and will probably lose control of that casino. Such a default would threaten all of Mr. Trump's Atlantic City casino licenses and could ultimately force him to seek the protection of the bankruptcy court.
Two holders of bonds tied to Mr. Trump's Atlantic City casinos filed a class action suit yesterday in a Federal court in New Jersey charging that Mr. Trump had misled them.
 
Talk of Who Would Benefit
In his statement yesterday, Mr. Trump thanked the banks for their work and also noted that the restructuring of his real estate and gambling empire would benefit his employees and those who do business with him.
''A final agreement would benefit all of us, but perhaps most important are the 25,000 employees and thousands of family firms and other suppliers - spanning the hotel, construction, development and travel industries - that are dependent upon the Trump Organization,'' he said.
Mr. Trump said he was confident that the banks that had not yet approved the package would do so. He said he wanted to do not only what was in his own interest but also what was best for the economy of the region.

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasury Issues Rise a Bit

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were slightly higher yesterday despite several seemingly negative currents swirling about the credit markets.
One factor that was ignored was the Government's report of an unexpectedly sharp 3.9 percent jump in May durable goods orders. In another report, the Commerce Department said that consumer spending was unchanged last month and there was a small rise of only three-tenths of 1 percent in personal income.
The two reports seemed to cancel each other out, said Elizabeth Reiners, a bond market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The durable goods report showed a strong industrial sector, but that was offset by the weaker-than-expected personal consumption data, she added. 
 
Flood of Debt Shrugged Off
The domestic fixed-income market also shrugged off the flood of new Treasury debt coming to market next week, when nearly $48 billion of bills and notes are scheduled for auction.
What did interest bond market participants was a further decline in prices of Canadian Treasury debt because of the constitutional crisis that has engulfed the largest trading partner of the United States over Quebec's latest bid for greater autonomy. Dealers said Canadian long-term Treasury bonds lost a further half-point, or $5 for each $1,000 of face value, while shorter issues were down a quarter point.
But the widely held 8.5 percent Hydro-Quebec bonds of 2029 were steady at 9.25 percent bid, to yield 9.39 percent in American funds. Dealers said investors on both sides of the border thought the likelihood of power shortages in the Northeast United States was more certain than the chance of a Canadian breakup.
In the United States, ''there are several reasons why our Treasury market seems to lack direction,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. ''One obvious reason is the ever-increasing supply of Treasury paper coming to market, partly as the fallout from the savings and loan disaster.''
He noted that the $11.25 billion of two-year notes scheduled for auction on Tuesday had been increased by $450 million; the $8.25 billion of four-year notes to be sold the next day was raised by $250 million, and the record $10.25 billion of one-year bills to be sold Thursday was also increased by $250 million.
''A large portion of the increases will go for the bailout,'' he said. ''So will a sizable portion of the $50 to $55 billion of debt that we expect the Treasury will sell in the third quarter.''
After being virtually unchanged for most of the day, a modest late rally created small gains. The Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in 2020, were offered late in the session at 102 31/32, up 4/32 on the day. The long bond's yield dipped to 8.47 percent from 8.48 percent the day before, but was still above the 8.42 of a week ago.
 
Long Notes Show Rise
The Treasury's long notes, the 8 7/8's of 2000, rose 3/32, to 102 16/32, to yield 8.49 percent. Meanwhile, the two-year notes that the Treasury plans to auction on Tuesday traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.34 percent, compared with 8.36 percent the day before. The four-year notes yielded 8.43 percent, against 8.46 percent the day before.
At the shorter end of the Treasury market, the discount rate on 90-day bills eased a basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point, to 7.76 percent; the six-month bills dipped two basis points, at 7.63 percent, and the outstanding one-year bills lost two basis points, at 7.55 percent.
There were signs that the banking system had adequate reserves as the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans eased to 8 3/16 percent. This compared with the 8.25 percent level that the Fed has apparently set as its target since last December.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
A Leg Up for Ailing Pets

 BODY:
Pets who are old, ailing or injured don't have to be confined to the floor. Even if they find it difficult to jump to their favorite high spot, they can now make it there with the aid of PawsWay, a ramp designed for cats and small dogs with limited mobility. 
The idea came from Mary Coeli Meyer of Acworth, Ga., who built a ramp for her mother's 18-year-old arthritic cat last year.
''She gets lost if she can't get to where she wants,'' Ms. Meyer said. With the ramp, ''she could get where she wanted instead of howling for help.''
Dr. Pam Webb, a veterinarian at Bells Ferry Veterinary Hospital in Acworth, who helped Ms. Meyer modify the design, said old pets, or those who have recently had surgery, need to rest on soft surfaces and may feel they are being punished if they must stay on the floor. PawsWay can help them get on a chair or sofa. PawsWay is a 7 1/4-inch-wide wooden ramp with a gradual incline and a carpeted surface. It can be adjusted to six lengths, from 4 1/2 inches to 19 inches.
''It isn't much different from using a wooden plank,'' Dr. Webb said. ''It's just a piece of furniture and a little more attractive.''
At Ms. Meyer's request, the ramps are being built by unemployed veterans through a program run by the Veterans Administration. It has been on the market for about six weeks and has mostly been advertised in pet industry journals and at pet shows.
PawsWay can be ordered through Pet Care With Love Inc., P.O. Box 764, Department MPR, Glenview, Ill. 60025; telephone 404-928-2700. A pine model costs $49.95, and one in oak costs $64.95. Add $8 for shipping and handling.

HEADLINE: The Elbowing Is Becoming Fierce For Space on the Radio Spectrum

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The pizza-delivery business, the cellular telephone industry and futuristic high-definition television have something unfortunate in common. All covet the same bands on the already crowded spectrum of broadcast frequencies.
The conflict is one of many instances in which technologies that rely on radio and microwave signals are competing for a finite amount of space that is almost full. New technologies are pitted against existing ones, and the commercial sector against the military. In the middle are the White House, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission.
The many companies that use the broadcast frequencies, without charge, to sell goods and services have total revenues estimated at $100 billion a year. That number could grow faster if the Government gives up some of its frequencies, allowing the introduction of new products, said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has introduced legislation to that end. 
''Opening more spectrum will contribute to economic progress in the United States,'' he said.
Mr. Markey and some other legislators say the Government - in particular, the military - should give up some frequencies, arguing that because of reduced international tensions the military needs less space on the broadcast spectrum.
On Friday the Department of Defense said it strongly opposed Mr. Markey's bill, which, it said in a statement, ''would adversely affect U.S. national security.'' The statement continued, ''This concern received little attention in the current drafting of the bill.'' A spokeswoman added that the Pentagon used its frequencies heavily and efficiently.
How to allocate frequencies is a public policy issue comparable to how to make the best use of public land, an issue as old as the nation. In 1785, for instance, Congress reserved one section of each township in the Northwest Territory for the use of public schools. In the 19th century, the Federal Government decided to allocate public land in Western states to encourage companies to build railroads.
''The railroads would have developed very differently and probably much slower without those land rights,'' said Eli M. Noam, a Columbia University economist.
 
Decades of Debates
The broadcast spectrum is public property, and the Federal Communications Commission is charged with regulating its use in the public interest. Debates over the spectrum are not new; in 1925, Commerce Secretary Herbert C. Hoover announced that the broadcast spectrum was full and that no more radio licenses would be issued. For decades, debates have flared as inventors of new products sought access to allocated frequencies.
Until each logjam is broken, the American people do not have access to a product or service that some company is eager to provide. Motorola Inc., for instance, a few years ago developed a wireless short-range computer modem, a device that would allow computers to transmit data directly to other computers, bypassing telephone lines. But the device could not be sold until recently because no frequency was allocated for it.
The decisions about how to re-allocate broadcast frequencies could also affect a number of services that are a staple of life, like AM radio and UHF television.
 
Effect on Competitiveness
The decisions will also affect the international competitiveness of the American telecommunications industry for decades to come, because the first country to introduce a product typically sets technical and manufacturing standards that other countries follow.
''If we're going to continue to be a leader in telecommunications, we're going to have to move fast on this one,'' said Sherrie P. Marshall, one of the five commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission.
Some current conflicts include these:
* The microwave frequencies that energy companies use to relay safety information from remote pipeline-monitoring instruments are coveted by proponents of at least three new types of tiny cellular telephones, as well as by backers of high-definition television, which will provide movie-quality picture and sound.
* Frequencies being used for UHF, or ultrahigh frequency, television channels 21 through 69 are also wanted by supporters of high-definition television. The cellular telephone industry wants these same frequencies, as do those parties that rely on two-way radio -pizza-delivery companies, railroads and police forces, for example. Owners of television stations that currently use the frequencies generally favor reassigning them to high-definition television, in which they hope to have an interest themselves. The existing UHF stations would then be converted to high-definition technology.
* Digital radio broadcasts, which allow sound quality rivaling that of compact disks, need frequencies now used by the Government and by private companies to transmit data from rocket launchings and tests of experimental aircraft. Companies that want to use satellite-based systems to provide navigational assistance and telephone communications for trains, trucks, boats and planes have a few of these frequencies and want more.
If nothing is done to reallocate frequencies, the introduction of such products and services will be delayed. But Congress has historically been reluctant to tackle the problems because powerful interest groups control many frequencies and because the issues are technically complex.
Two events in Washington this month reflected the growing concerns among public officials and regulators.
On Tuesday, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously approved a bill that would compel the Government to hand over to the private sector within 10 years a large chunk of the frequencies it controls. A vote by the full House is expected next month, while the Senate Communications Subcommittee is considering similar action. Inquiry by F.C.C. On June 14, the F.C.C. voted unanimously to begin a broad public inquiry into whether frequencies should be set aside for several new technologies that could allow wallet-sized cellular telephones to be used almost anywhere.
Representative Markey, who is chairman of the House subcommittee and a co-sponsor with John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, of the bill approved on Tuesday, said the legislation represents a peace dividend as Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union seem less of a threat.
The Dingell-Markey bill would force the Government to give up usable frequencies totaling 200 megahertz.
The Bush Administration has refused to support the bill, although it has not actively opposed it.
Political debates over frequency allocations have moved slowly in part because of their technical complexity.
The electromagnetic spectrum is an immense range of energy waves at varying frequencies, including everything from radio waves and microwaves to visible light and X-rays. In broadcasting, the information to be conveyed is converted to an electrical signal that is transformed into radio waves or higher-frequency microwaves of a particular frequency, or channel. These waves are then broadcast to antennas of receivers, which convert them back into electrical signals that re-create the information.
 
Frequencies Allocated in Europe
A home or car radio receives music and voices on frequencies low on the spectrum. Television and cellular telephones use higher frequencies. Communications satellites and the private microwave links of long-distance telephone companies and other corporations use an even higher part of the spectrum.
Now, with virtually all usable frequencies actually being used, the debate is fiercer.
Wallet-size portable telephones that can make and in some cases receive calls are in production and in limited use in Britain, but cannot be used in the United States except in small test areas, for lack of frequencies. West Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Holland, Belgium and Finland have allocated frequencies for the telephones, and their national telephone companies are negotiating or have signed contracts to buy the needed equipment, said Timothy P. Lowry, the director of mobile systems at GPT Ltd., Britain's leading producer of telecommunications equipment.
 
Handicap Seen for U.S. Industry
''For American industry, not allocating frequencies is a handicap, because they don't have a home market in which to build up sales,'' he said.
One reason for the frequency shortage in the United States has been that frequencies have long been handed out without charge in a highly subjective process involving numerous lawyers, lobbyists and elected officials. Once allocated, frequencies can be bought and sold by the license holders, and some critics of the system have said this provides the initial recipients with a windfall. But the traded frequencies may be used only for their original purpose, even if it no longer seems so pressing. The F.C.C. can issue waivers but seldom does so.
As a result, one band of frequencies may receive very heavy use while another band of slightly higher or lower frequencies may be lightly used. Recent trades of allocated frequencies have highlighted this discrepancy.
 
Disparity in Values
For example, a recent deal in New York valued a band of cellular telephone frequencies 25 megahertz wide at $4 billion, or $160 million a megahertz. But a band of adjacent radio frequencies 1.5 megahertz wide in New York recently sold for about $12 million, or $8 million a megahertz, because the F.C.C. had allocated those frequencies for use by long-range car radios like those used in taxis.
New technologies make it possible to squeeze more information onto existing channels. But because industries with large allocations of lightly used frequencies, like pipeline companies, pay nothing for frequencies, they have little incentive to invest in alternative technology.
Regulators say industries like pipeline operators that use frequencies for communications between fixed points are prime targets to lose some frequencies. ''If you're using frequencies for point-to-point communications, fiber optics and copper wire is usually more efficient,'' said Janice Obuchowski, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information.

HEADLINE: Hazards At the Keyboard: A special report:
Automation: Pain Replaces the Old Drudgery

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
For nine years, Paula Tydryszewski has operated a video display terminal in New Jersey's tax collection office. She types numbers and names from tax returns at woodpecker speeds into a keyboard that is tied to a big computer in the center of the room.
Ms. Tydryszewski and the 111 other full-time data entry clerks do white-collar work with blue-collar rhythms and discipline. They are tethered to their tasks by machines that let them do vastly more work than they could have done 15 or 20 years ago with paper and ledgers and typewriters.
Like Ms. Tydryszewski, an increasing number of workers around the country say they are suffering from ailments caused by the repetitive motion of their jobs. These potentially disabling ailments include cysts, inflammation of tendons, nerve damage that can lead to a loss of feeling in the fingers, and arm or shoulder pain. 
Occupational health specialists, labor unions and the Federal Government say tens of millions of workers, like the keyboard operators here, are at risk of these cumulative-trauma or repetitive-motion disorders. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the disorders accounted for 48 percent of the 240,900 workplace illnesses in private business in 1988, up from 18 percent of 126,100 illnesses in 1981. The problem showed up first in factories and is now spreading through the growing office sector of the economy.
 
Shift in Values a Factor
Experts attribute some growth in injuries reported to more awareness of a relationship between the ailments and work. Another factor is a shift in values: in the late 20th century, safeguarding the environment and protecting one's health are probably cherished as much as keeping the economy going and keeping one's job.
Experts say the actual numbers of injuries are proliferating because people are being pressed to work hard - in private industry to keep up with foreign competition, in government to hold down spending.
Automation has done away with heavy lifting by humans and replaced it with light lifting at rat-a-tat-tat speeds.
''We're really asking people to do more,'' said Don Chaffin, director of the University of Michigan's Center for Ergonomics, which studies ways to adapt working conditions to suit workers. ''That has a cost.''
Vern Putz-Anderson, who leads a group of professors at the university who are studying the disorders, said, ''More than half the nation's workers now have jobs with the potential for cumulative-trauma disorders.''
Among the jobs are those in the automobile and textile industries, and in meatpacking, where carcasses are turned into steaks and chops by a sort of assembly line in reverse.
With better workplace and equipment design, and with more breaks for relaxing, occupational health specialists say most problems can be avoided. But many employers have been slow to acknowledge a link between work and the disorders. And some workers, including Ms. Tydryszewski, are reluctant to report injuries, out of fear that employers will let them go or shift them to lower-paying jobs.
Nor can workers' problems be easily linked to cruel bosses. ''New Jersey is fighting a budget deficit, and putting tax receipts into the bank promptly means the state can collect that much more interest before it pays its bills,'' said Barbara Jo Crea, assistant chief of the New Jersey Division of Taxation. ''The mission of this branch is to deposit the money.''
 
One Woman's Story
Scars on Arms Tell of Pain
Ms. Tydryszewski's problems are showing up in her work. Her union, Local 1033 of the Communications Workers of America, points to two two-year-old incisions on her left wrist, one across the base to remove a ganglionic cyst, a formation of syrupy fluid on sheaths surrounding the tendons; the other incision running lengthwise, from the palm about two inches up the arm, to relieve a more serious condition, carpal tunnel syndrome, a disabling tendon and nerve irritation.
The cyst, a grape-sized lump, appeared first. ''I kept pushing it back inside for two years,'' said Ms. Tydryszewski, who is 36 years old. ''One morning it wouldn't stay down, so I went to the doctor. I had surgery and did exercises. Then I dropped a milk bottle. I had no feeling in three fingers. So I had surgery for that.''
Now at the end of each day, Ms. Tydryszewski said, muscles near the back of her neck tighten into a knot, and her right arm has begun to hurt. But she said she would not complain; she is afraid of losing her $18,000-a-year job.
In early May, her supervisor sent her a memorandum. ''My records indicate that you received a written warning for excessive errors on Nov. 8, 1989,'' it said in part. ''As of today, you have not made any improvement in this area. On April 26, 1990, as documented by computer compiled statistics, you entered 189 documents with 264 errors.''
Management repeatedly advises Ms. Tydryszewski to take more time, but taking more time means falling below its requirement that she make 8,000 keystrokes an hour. Working faster, on the other hand, could mean more visits with the surgeon.
 
Workplace Changes
Computers Spread; So Do Problems
In the past, most reported cumulative trauma disorders arose in heavier work, especially in meat and poultry-packing plants and in automobile assembly. The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has won agreement from several leading meatpackers to correct conditions that contribute to the disorders, and in February it cited a 2,000-employee General Motors parts plant in Trenton for 40 cases of workers who needed surgery to correct repetitive-motion injuries.
But the disorders are now showing up widely in computer work. Supermarket checkout clerks appear to be getting them as a result of the twisting motions they make in sweeping shoppers' purchases over the little windows through which laser beams record the product and the price. And they are proliferating among millions of office workers, who also have other concerns stemming from the use of computers, including exposure to radiation.
Sixty-one percent of 645 Associated Press news employees who participated in a recent Newspaper Guild survey said they had neck and back pains, said the union's research director, David J. Eisen. And a study by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the University of Michigan said 38 percent of the reporters and editors at the Long Island-based newspaper Newsday had similar complaints arising mostly from the speed and the time that reporters spend using their terminals.
The Los Angeles Times surveyed 1,200 news employees and found more than 17 percent, mostly reporters, complaining of symptoms of various types of disorders. ''Two or three have needed surgery, and six or seven have been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome,'' said Michael G. Manfro, the newspaper's safety and environmental affairs manager. He said the company now provides better working equipment that requires less strain to operate, along with special glasses.
 
OSHA's View
Laws May Take Years to Enact
Gerald F. Scannell, the head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said that in view of the rising injuries, the agency would soon issue voluntary guidelines for meatpacking companies to use in preventing the disorders. Later, perhaps in August, it plans to issue guidelines for all other industries, he said. The guidelines, he said, could be followed by regulations that would have the force of law, but that could take years. Until then, OSHA can go after employers over repetitive-motion injuries by charging them for unsafe working environments.
Mr. Scannell said he also supported a proposal of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, to triple, to $30,000, the amount OSHA can fine employers for each worker found to be working in violation of health and safety laws, but he said he opposed the Senator's proposal that OSHA raise the limit unilaterally every five years to keep pace with inflation.
Roger L. Stephens, OSHA's top specialist in the science of adapting the things people use to avoid pain or injury, said workers had always done awkward repetitive tasks, but infrequently enough or slowly enough that their tissues and tendons restored themselves. ''Today,'' he said, ''we see a lot of production demands.''
 
The Injuries
Modern Ailments For Modern Jobs
Repetitive-motion ailments, like writer's cramp and tennis elbow, have plagued people for ages, but their connection to the workplace is fairly new. Among the most common are ganglionic cysts; tendinitis, an inflammation of the tendons; tenosynovitis, another form of tendon-sheath inflammation; peritendinitis, an inflammation of the area around the tendons; bursitis, an inflammation of a sac of fluid over bones that allow movement of the tendons, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Carpal tunnel syndrome seems to arouse the most concern because of the involvement of the vital median nerve. The nerve runs down the arm and through a tunnel at the wrist, about an inch in diameter, into the hand, where it services most of the palm, the base of the thumb and the other fingers except the last. Ten tendons, enveloped in sheaths and running parallel with the nerve, protect the nerve and control the fingers. A ligament forms a belt across the tendons and binds the wrist bones, adding more protection.
Doctors say frequent and awkward maneuvers of the hand and wrist irritate the tendons over months and years. This can cause the tendons to inflame, and to squeeze and rub the median nerve, ultimately damaging it.
Proper posture can help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. This means sitting in an upright ''piano'' position at the keyboard. Ideally, one's arms are parallel to the floor and there is some support for the wrists.
Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are numb and tingling fingers, usually at night, and loss of feeling. Early on, it can be treated with rest, a job change, wrist splints that avert unnatural movements, and cortisone.
As symptoms worsen, the last - and usually effective - resort is cutting the ligament at the base of the wrist. As Dr. Putz-Anderson wrote in a book, ''Cumulative Trauma Disorders,'' after recovery ''it is important that the worker is not returned to the same job or task that precipitated'' a disorder.
Even so, some of the victims of the disorders who work for the State of New Jersey return to their old jobs after they are cured.
 
At the Keyboard
The Worker's Body Does the Adjusting
Trenton's tax collection office, similar to other data entry centers in the state Government, uses two large rooms, one for smokers and one for non-smokers. The clerks sit at tables, each about a yard wide, with white formica tops. Chairs can be adjusted, but only for height and to rock. Some people bring in pillows.
On the tables in the data processing offices are 16-year-old terminals, about half the size of conventional desk-top computers. Neither the keyboards nor the screens can be tilted, turned, raised or lowered. Because they cannot adjust the equipment, the clerks adjust their bodies.
During the peak of the tax season, from February until June, the office hires about 200 temporary clerks at $7.53 an hour. In the most intensive six weeks, the temporary clerks get an incentive: 10 cents an hour more for every 500 keystrokes an hour above 8,000.
In a tacit acknowledgement of a connection between the injuries and computer work, the New Jersey Department of Health has issued guidelines for the safer use of video display terminals. Among other things, they urge installation of more adjustable chairs, work tables and computers.
Ms. Crea said she and the Division of Taxation supported such changes. But in view of budget problems, she said, new equipment ''is not in the cards.''
Some state clerks like the work. Robin Sabol, 32 years old, who works in a Labor Department data-entry office, said that her required keystroke rate was 10,000 an hour but that her actual rate was 18,000 to 21,000. ''I like to push myself,'' she said. ''Ten thousand is boring and monotonous.'' As for aches and pains, she said: ''Sometimes it gets to you. But if you like the job, you're going to do your best.''
But complaint and discomfort seem more the norm. In a survey of 118 clerks at the tax office completed two weeks ago by Local 1033, 81 percent said they had had hand or wrist pain, 47 percent experienced numbness or tingling in their fingers, and 82 percent had had arm or shoulder pain. In addition, 15 percent said a doctor had found them to have tendinitis, 8 percent said they had cysts on the hands or wrists and 7 percent - eight workers - had carpal tunnel syndrome.
Terri Croushore, who is 35 and sits near Ms. Tydryszewski, has not had maladies as acute as her colleague's in her four years on the job. But Ms. Croushore, who does 14,000 keystrokes an hour when the work is heavy, says she is beginning to get a burning sensation in her elbows, a tingling in her wrists and numbing in her fingers. She doesn't complain. ''They would just tell me to slow down,'' she said.
 
The Claims Ahead
Flood Predicted For the Future
New Jersey officials say they accommodate injury cases when employees can bring persuasive evidence from doctors that an injury is job-related. The worker receives full pay and benefits without losing any of the 10-day-per-year sick leave. Ms. Tydryszewski, who was out for six months in 1988, said she had never heard of the policy, but even if she had she might have had a tough time proving her case.
Ms. Crea said she had had only two requests for sick-leave benefits related to cumulative trauma disorders, one involving carpal tunnel syndrome and the other tendinitis. The requests were denied, she said, because they were deemed ''pre-existing conditions.''
New Jersey officials, like many employers, say they have to be tough about granting benefits to people who allege work-related disorders, partly because of budgetary constraints, partly because the ailments are often hard to trace to any single cause.
For those reasons, and others like fear of demotion, disability claims for treatment of the disorders are low. Stover H. Snook, ergonomics director at the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company in Boston, said repetitive-motion injuries accounted for 1 percent of his company's claims and 1.5 percent of the cost of the claims.
''But it's a major health problem,'' he said. ''In the past, workers would tolerate it just so they could get work. Now they're less tolerant of pain and discomfort. Any employer that has large numbers of employees doing these tasks has got to worry about the floodgates.''

The Danes Prize American Jazz. Why Don't the Americans?

BYLINE: By Peter Watrous

 BODY:
A month ago, the gifted American tenor saxophonist and composer David Murray won a $30,000 prize. And along with the money, he won the chance to perform concerts in France and Denmark and spend a week rehearsing with a Danish group - Pierre Dorge's New Jungle Orchestra - and other Danish musicians for the performances. He also won the financial backing to release an album.
The prize package, put together by the Danish Jazz Center and called the Jazzpar, was instituted, according to a press release, ''with the firm intention of promoting greater recognition of jazz in society'' and with the ambitious hope of having an effect similar to that of the Nobel Prize. In its scope, it surpasses anything available to jazz musicians in the United States. 
Yet, in only its second year (the first winner was also American, the pianist Muhal Richard Abrams), the prize remains virtually unknown both here and in Europe. The Jazzpar committee includes critics from East Germany, France, the United States and Denmark. The guidelines for winning are vague, but the award is meant to go to someone who can benefit from the recognition, and is in a fertile part of his or her career. It is the sort of thing that makes the jazz community here envious and deeply resentful and lets it succumb to the common argument that Europeans take care of American art better than Americans do.
Jazz does get institutional support in this country, but not much. The Thelonius Monk Center for Jazz Studies in Washington has recently begun awarding a $10,000 piano prize annually and plans to start a Louis Armstrong Prize for trumpeters. The National Endowment for the Arts distributes several Jazz Masters Awards a year worth $20,000 each. And though the Endowment spends roughly one-eighth of its yearly $16 million music budget on jazz, jazz in the United States is still mostly dependent on the marketplace for its daily bread.
This is good in that it makes artists accountable to a public, but the marketplace rarely gives the sort of cultural encouragement implied by the Jazzpar, and it virtually guarantees that expensive large-scale works won't be produced. There isn't a chance Mr. Murray could work with Mr. Dorge's orchestra in the United States (and forget about the rehearsal time provided by the Jazzpar); though one of America's finest musicians, Mr. Murray can barely find work for any group larger than a quartet.
What the Jazzpar does is remind the jazz community, blunted in its cultural and political aspirations by years of neglect (no jazz composer or instrumentalist has ever been awarded a Pulitzer Prize for music, for instance), that jazz in the United States can be treated as an equal to European classical music. Though jazz sells roughly as many records as classical music does, there is nothing in the jazz world that can remotely compare to the larger prizes and the support systems devoted to classical music.
A quick look at the classical award system in this country shows the ex-tent to which the jazz community has lagged behind in this sort of financing and cultural affirmation. Take the Van Cliburn, the Naumburg and the Grawemeyer awards, three of the more famous classical prizes given in America.
The Van Cliburn awards a young pianist $15,000, along with two years worth of engagements, estimated to be the equivalent of $200,000. The competition is covered by roughly 80 news organizations, and it is the type of cultural event that has documentaries made about it. For instrumentalists, the Naumburg Foundation awards $5,000 and underwrites two Alice Tully Hall appearances, a record and residencies and orchestral appearances across the country. And the heavyweight of the classical-music prizes is the H. Charles Grawemeyer Award for composition, which enriches the recipient by $150,000.
More important, the awards generate interest outside the classical world and often make careers. They're magnets for attention, and they allow younger musicians to break into the competitive classical circuit. They create news stories and visibility for classical music in a world that would mostly prefer to listen to pop. The awards regularly encourage the pursuit of a form of expression that is often marginal, both sociallyand economically.
The similarities between the Jazzpar and these awards raise an obvious question. Why aren't there more organizations analogous to the Van Cliburn, Naumburg and Grawemeyer Foundations to offer support for jazz?
The Jazzpar should remind the jazz community and the philanthropic world that this sort of substantial award is possible. Jazz is healthier and more vital than at any time during the last 30 years. This itself implies a type of activism: many gifted individuals have decided not to become pop musicians or lawyers, doctors or businesspeople and instead are pursuing a path as difficult and usually less financially rewarding.
The determination that allowed jazz musicians to choose the tough path - becoming an artist in a country that doesn't pay much attention - should now be channeled into a new jazz activism. Why leave it to Denmark to bestow prizes on American musicians? It's time to question why so little mainstream music financing goes to jazz, and why the Pulitzer committee has never awarded a prize to a jazz composer. It's time for the jazz community to demand equal billing.

HEADLINE: Kubelik in Prague - and in the Catalogue

BYLINE: By RICHARD FREED; Richard Freed is a contributing editor of Stereo Review magazine.

 BODY:
After an absence of 42 years, Rafael Kubelik returned to Czechoslovakia several weeks ago to conduct the CzechPhilharmonic Orchestra in the two performances of Bedrich Smetana's symphonic cycle ''Ma Vlast'' (''My Country'') that opened this year's Prague Spring Festival.
That grand patriotic cycle of six related tone poems (among which No. 2 is the famous ''Moldau''), the traditional opening work for the ''Prague Spring,'' is music whose character makes it uniquely suitable for occasions of national jubilation or rededication. It fell to Mr. Kubelik to preside over two such events 45 years apart.
When Prague was liberated at the end of World War II, the first concert given there was a performance of ''Ma Vlast'' he conducted in Wenceslas Square, with all the city's orchestras combined. The square itself became a symbol to the world last fall, and Mr. Kubelik's appearance this year seemed to set the seal on all that had happened in his homeland since then. It also served to call attention to some of his marvelous recordings that have recently been reissued on compact disks. 
Mr. Kubelik, who will be 76 years old on Friday and now is a Swiss citizen, left his homeland in Czechoslovakia at the time of the Communist takeover in 1948 and vowed not to return until that situation changed; by the time it did change last year, he had given up conducting.
Four years ago he was compelled to retire because of exhaustion and acute arthritis. Several months ago, however, he accepted an invitation from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, whose music director he was from 1950 to 1953, to conduct one brief work next season in a concert celebrating that orchestra's centenary, and he began a regimen of exercises to prepare himself. Mr. Kubelik's wife, the Australian soprano Elsie Morison, made her first visit to Czechoslovakia when he returned. Two weeks after his own concerts, his old friend and countryman Rudolf Firkusny, a resident of New York for near 50 years, performed as soloist in the Second Piano Concerto of Bohuslav Martinu, a work the pianist introduced in 1935. Mr. Firkusny's last performance in Prague had been in 1946, when he and Mr. Kubelik collaborated in the Dvorak Piano Concerto in the first ''Prague Spring'' festival.
Mr. Kubelik conducted ''Ma Vlast'' in several countries after his departure from Czechoslovakia, and recorded it four times, with orchestras in Chicago, Vienna, Boston and Munich. Entirely by coincidence, the last two of those recordings were reissued on compact disk at about the time he was heading back to Prague, as were his similarly authoritative ones of another big Czechoslovak celebratory work, Janacek's Glagolitic Mass, and all the symphonies of Gustav Mahler. There are about a dozen recordings of the complete ''Ma Vlast'' on CD. Mr. Kubelik's 1971 version with the Boston Symphony Orchestra has been transferred to disk in Deutsche Grammophon's midprice Galleria series (429 183-2), and Orfeo's live recording of his 1984 concert performance with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, formerly on two CD's, has been reissued on a single full-price disk (C 115841).
It is the Boston performance that is the finest of the four this conductor has recorded, and surely the most inspiriting account of ''Ma Vlast'' on CD. Although the Orfeo is a digital recording, made with an orchestra that had been Mr. Kubelik's own for nearly two decades, it is not a match for what he achieved in Boston, and the sound quality itself is less well defined and has less impact than DG's splendid analog recording, which is noticeably more impressive than it was on LP.
On another CD in the same DG Galleria release Mr. Kubelik conducts the Bavarian Radio Orchestra in two works by Janacek, the magnificent Glagolitic Mass and the rhapsody for orchestra after Gogol's ''Taras Bulba'' (429 182-2).
The Mass, whose title alludes to the Slavonic text (or, more specifically, the alphabet in which it was written), is itself of a certain national or patriotic significance, having been produced in 1928, Janacek's last year, for the festivities marking the 10th anniversary of the Czechoslovak republic. The music itself, though, is neither narrowly patriotic nor religious in any ordinary sense; it is representative of the ''pan-Slavonic'' outlook and pantheistic character that inform so many of this composer's finest works.
There have been other fine recordings of the Glagolitic Mass - the recent digital one conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, the stunning older one under Karel Ancerl, both on Supraphon - but Mr. Kubelik's, taped in 1964, exudes a passion and urgency that keep it fully competitive. None of his vocal soloists - Evelyn Lear, soprano; Hilde Rossel-Majdan, alto; Ernst Haefliger, tenor; Franz Crass, bass - is Czechoslovak, but all are splendid.
''Taras Bulba'' is a fairly graphic response to key episodes in Gogol's novel. This is another work Mr. Kubelik recorded more than once, and one for which his special sympathy is surpassingly evident in this performance, vividly recorded in 1970. The sound quality belies its age in both works on this disk, and the leaflet includes full text and translation for the Mass.
Between 1967 and 1971 Mr. Kubelik recorded the nine Mahler symphonies and the Adagio from No. 10, but not ''Das Lied von der Erde,'' with the Bavarian Radio Orchestra for DG. They have been reissued, with generally fine sonic results, as a set of 10 budget-priced CD's in which each of the symphonies fits on a single disk except No. 3, whose finale shares a disk with the Adagio from No. 10 (429 042-2).
As this layout may suggest, some of the tempos are brisker than those favored by many conductors today, but everything in this set rings with conviction. (Bruno Walter's Mahler was faster than today's norm, too, as interpretations closest to the source often tend to be; Mr. Kubelik heard Mahler conducted by some of the composer's direct disciples when he was a young man in Prague.) The First Symphony here receives an especially poetic reading, and the vital, unceremonialized sweep in the Second gives that work a bracing quality that wears well, while the climax of the great Adagio of No. 9 is brought off with unparalleled power and clarity.
Elsie Morison is the ingratiating soloist in No. 4. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau is one of the soloists in No. 8, and one misses his performance of the ''Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen'' that came with No. 5 on LP.
There would have been room for that song cycle on the disk with No. 1, to which it is related, and DG has in fact issued these two performances together on a separate CD in its ''Musikfest'' budget series (429 157-2). For those who prefer to acquire the symphonies singly, this economical disk is a strong contender, regardless of price.
In addition to all these welcome reissues, a generously filled new Orfeo CD of Haydn and Mozart symphonies, recorded digitally in Mr. Kubelik's concerts with the Bavarian Radio Orchestra between 1981 and 1985, has made its appearance. Haydn's masterly Symphony No. 99 in E flat receives a stylish, utterly winning performance, as do two Mozart symphonies: the dramatically charged No. 25 (the ''Little G minor,'' K. 183) and yet another work Mr. Kubelik had recorded more than once before, No. 38 in D major - the ''Prague'' Symphony (Orfeo C 206 891).

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Are There Really Any Billionaires?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
In an age when millionaire no longer sounds very rich, billionaire still has a certain ring to it. Last week, on Manhattan's East Side, two very different men, each of whom became the best-known ''billionaire'' of an era, could reflect on shifting fortunes.
At Sotheby's auction house, Nelson Bunker Hunt, the one-time silver king, watched as part of his and brother William Herbert's collections of antique vases and coins were auctioned off. With more than 26,000 coins to be sold, the sales will take a year. 
The sales brought better prices than expected, but that won't do the Hunts much good. The proceeds largely go to pay off creditors as part of a bankruptcy settlement.
Less than two miles away, at Trump Tower, representatives of Donald Trump were trying to persuade the banks to put up money to keep the Trump empire intact and to leave him in control of it. The deadline is Tuesday.
Bunker Hunt, a man of the 70's, believed that inflation was a sure thing, and that prices of oil and precious metals would never stop rising. His buying helped push silver past $50 an ounce, but left him in a hole when the market collapsed.
Mr. Trump, a man of the 80's, paid top dollar for prime New York real estate and plunged into Atlantic City casinos. He believed, in the words of Shad Rowe, a Dallas investor, that real estate was an ''asset-appreciation game, not a cash-flow game.'' Texas real estate investors learned what was wrong with that idea a few years ago; New Yorkers are only now getting the message.
With some justification, the Hunts and Mr. Trump can complain that everything was going well until the rules changed. For Bunker Hunt, it was the rules at the Comex, which, after he bought, made it practically impossible for others to speculate on silver. For Mr. Trump, it was a stunning attitude on the part of bankers, who belatedly embraced conservative credit standards.
In the 90's, it appears one new rule is that takeover activity is no longer likely to provide support for the market, a fact that was emphasized last week by the departure of Coniston Partners from the raiding scene. That leaves the market more vulnerable to other factors, which helped to explain why a blip up in interest rates on Monday, and a late sell-off Friday that began in the Chicago futures pits, sent the Dow Jones industrial average into tailspins. It ended the week down 78.71 points, to 2,857.18.
Mr. Trump's friends say he remains rich, that his assets are worth vastly more than he owes on them. Just now, however, it appears that there are no buyers available at those prices. With time, there may be, but then again there may not. The Hunt brothers managed to buy time for prices of their favored assets to recover, but they never did. Silver now trades for less than one-tenth of its peak quote.
How, Bunker Hunt was asked, does it feel to be an ex-billionaire? ''I think about 99 percent of the people who are referred to as billionaires aren't. I know I wasn't,'' he said. ''Even Donald Trump might say the same thing.''

THE ECONOMY
 
Profiting From the Bailout
 
How to profit from the savings and loan bailout: First, default on a real estate project. Then, go back into business under a new name. Finally, turn around and buy the property from the Government at a fraction of its initial cost. Such are the shenanigans already afflicting Federal sales of property seized from failed savings and loans. There's more: consultants and former savings executives drawing six-figure payments to manage failed institutions; country-club expenses billed to the Government; a deposit on the sale of one building made with a suitcase of cash. Should the Government screen buyers, managers and brokers to make sure none were involved in the savings and loan collapse? Do that in Texas, some say, and almost nobody would be left to broker or buy. But with a single state accounting for more than half the 35,908 properties (book value $14.9 billion) up for sale, the bailout is likely to result in a flood of funds from the rest of the nation into Texas. 
 
Pointing Fingers in Washington
 
It was tough enough for Democrats and Republicans to observe a tacit nonaggression pact when the savings and loan bailout amounted to some piddling tens of billions. But now that it is a certified, half-trillion-dollar disaster, politicians from the President on down are hunting for someone - someone else - to blame. Democrats accuse the Administration of causing a second savings and loan crisis by bungling the bailout that Congress approved last year. ''The minute the bill was signed, there was an abdication of responsibility,'' Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, said at a recent hearing. Marlin Fitzwater, speaking for the President, responded sharply last week. He cited the roles several Democratic senators and House members played in the mess, and said, ''There are a lot of battles that can be fought on this turf, and we're ready.''
 
Accusations Against Neil Bush
 
Mr. Fitzwater's attack on the Democrats took place the same day it was revealed that Federal regulators had considered banning the President's son, Neil, from the banking business. A draft document released by the House Banking Committee said Mr. Bush had violated rules on conflicts of interest three times as a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver. For lack of evidence, the Office of Thrift Supervision has instead has sought only to prohibit Mr. Bush from violating the rules again. Mr. Bush has said he did nothing wrong.
 
Bargains, but for Whom?
 
Last week brought a sobering example of the losses the Government can expect for real estate taken from failed savings institutions. The Gibraltar Savings Association invested $330 milion in the Stonebridge Ranch, a dazzling spread of golf courses, man-made ponds and million-dollar homes north of Dallas. Richard C. Strauss, son of the former Democratic Party chairman, Robert S. Strauss, was the project's manager. The Government agreed on Thursday to sell it for $61 million to Yukio Kitano, a Japanese industrialist.
 
Credit Crunch Is Relative
 
Alan Greenspan isn't keeping Fed-guessers guessing. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Board chairman said on Capitol Hill that the economy will keep chugging along without risk of recession. And, implicitly, without easier money from the Fed. And what about those complaints of a credit crunch? Credit seems tight only when compared with the lax standards that bankers and regulators have allowed, he said.
 
No Free Ride for LTV
 
The Supreme Court ruled last week that the Government can limit its Aid to Corporations with Dependent Pensioners. Only the truly needy companies will qualify, not those in search of a handout. In the case at issue, the LTV Corporation filed for bankruptcy four years ago and turned its responsibilities over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which paid reduced benefits. Then LTV agreed in talks with the United Steelworkers of America to make up much of the difference between the Federal payouts and its former pension plan. The agency saw that its safety net was becoming more of a trampoline. It ordered LTV to resume paying for its pension plan without Government support, and the case went to court. The ruling will keep corporations from dumping more of their pension costs on the agency, which is already in financial trouble
 
Economy Winds Down
 
The latest gross national product economy is gasping but growing. A 1.9 percent annual growth rate for the first quarter, after a 1.1 percent rise in the fourth quarter last year, continued the weakest pace of expansion since 1986. The first-quarter number was revised last week from an earlier estimate of 1.3 percent, but economists paid more attention to a lowered figure for consumption. ''It points to slower growth ahead,'' said Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank.
 
Stocks Stumble
 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 78.71 points last week to 2,857.18. Traders blamed familiar culprits: computerized trading programs, a weakening bond market and fears of lower corporate profits.
 
COMPANIES
 
The Patent Wars
 
Between Japan and America, the patent battles can be as punishing as the trade wars. A Federal District Court judge banned Motorola Inc. and Hitachi Ltd. from selling some chips last week; a higher court soon issued a stay. Analysts say Motorola faces the greater threat. The patent squabble pits Motorola's popular 68030 chip, used in Apple Macintosh and Sun Microsystems computers, against a Hitachi chip not yet sold in this country. ''If both chips had to stop shipping, Motorola would be hurt more,'' said John M. Geraghty, an analyst at First Boston. He added that Motorola is accused of far fewer patent violations than Hitachi. The broader issue might be the balance of power in patents, he said, with Japanese companies finding it much easier to enforce patent rights in the United States than American companies do in Japan. Hitachi led all companies in American patents last year, with 1,053.
 
Ben's Advice for Mr. Trump
 
Donald J. Trump went to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he presumably studied the art of leverage. He might have done better to study the teachings of the university's father, Benjamin Franklin. ''He who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing,'' Franklin said. If Mr. Trump can claim that his methods rescued Central Park's Wollman Rink, Franklin even made the colonial postal system profitable. Mr. Trump has insisted he is no gambler: ''I've never gambled in my life. To me, a gambler is someone who plays slot machines. I prefer to own slot machines.'' But Franklin would have kept him from exaggerating his casinos' expected performance. ''Ah, think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another power over your liberty,'' Franklin said. ''The second vice is lying, the first is running in debt. 'Tis hard for an empty bag to stand upright.'' Even outside of work, Mr. Trump has failed to follow some of Franklin's best-known advice: ''In all your amours, you should prefer old women to young ones.''
 
In Brief
 
E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company plans to build four plants to produce refrigerants that, unlike chlorofluorocarbons, would not deplete the atmosphere's ozone layer.
 
*
 
The House Judiciary Committee voted last week to repeal most of the insurance industry's exemptions from antitrust law, the first time such a measure has gone so far. It is still more likely to become a ''cash cow'' - provoking insurance companies to raise their campaign contributions - than a law.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Bustin' the Charts
 
Rapper turned recording mogul? M. C. Hammer said last week that he was starting his own label, Bustin' Records. Mr. Hammer's first venture in the industry came three years ago, when he was an assistant to Charles Finley, owner of the Oakland Athletics baseball team. He borrowed enough from a couple players to press his own record, then sold thousands from his basement and the back of his car. A contract with Capital Records followed. Now Mr. Hammer's second album, ''Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em,'' has the top spot on Billboard's chart, and his own label has plans to release albums by 10 new groups.
 
'Junk' Casualty
 
The Coniston Partners will be among Wall Street's most feared corporate raiders no more. They plan to return the proceeds from their main, $700 million investment fund to backers. With the stock market high and the ''junk bond'' market low, Coniston has all but run out of financing and promising deals. The firm was founded on the familiar 1980's premise that forcing companies to cough up huge payoffs for noisy, impatient investors would somehow improve corporate performance. That notion at least did wonders for Coniston's performance, with 40 percent annual returns common until the firm lagged the stock market last year. The partners plan to keep their stakes in TW Services Inc. and the UAL Corporation, which after repeated raids and restructuring has gone from being the nation's largest airline to No. 2.
 
An Even Bigger Philip Morris
 
The Philip Morris Companies agreed on Friday to buy most of the operations of Jacobs Suchard A.G., the Swiss coffee and chocolate company, for $3.8 billion. The deal will vastly expand Philip Morris's presence in Europe, where its Kraft General Foods subsidiary already has revenues of more than $3 billion. Suchard's products include the familiar triangular Toblerone chocolate bars. Suchard will further Philip Morris's diversification away from tobacco.
 
A First Bout of Unemployment
 
East German unemployment is already surging. The official rate rose from 100,000 to 130,000 in the first two weeks of June. East German leaders have said they expect at least 20 percent of their nation's businesses to shut down after the two German economies become one on July 2. Economists say that more than 2 million of East Germany's 9 million workers will lose their jobs over the next year. Under its Communist rulers, the country had no unemployment - but plenty of inefficient factories spewing out second-rate goods.
 
The Real Taj
 
The ''Trumped-up Taj,'' one Indian newspaper called it. Indian publications just can't see how a wealthy American could transform a classic Mogul memorial into a mish-mash of onion domes, minarets and zillion-watt neon signs. ''It demonstrates that Hollywood does not have a monopoly on bad taste,'' said The Saturday Statesman. The original Taj was built in the 17th century by Shah Jehan as a tomb for his beloved consort, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike Donald J. Trump, The Sunday Observer said, Shah Jehan needed no bank loans. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, continued negotiating with his bankers.

Where to Gain From the Dollar's Loss

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
While the dollar has been relatively tame this year, it has still raised the returns of some Americans who invested away from Wall Street.
And if forecasters who think the dollar will decline later this year are right, this could be a good time to invest in stock markets abroad - in Britain, West Germany and Japan - that look as though they have a chance to rally in the second half of the year. A weaker dollar later this year would give investors more for their money when stronger pounds, yen, marks or other foreign currencies are turned back into dollars.
In the first half of 1990, this exchange-rate gain - because of a weakening dollar - has accounted for most or all of the profits from several European stock markets and has mitigated the losses in others. 
A 9.5 percent rise in the Swiss franc against the dollar accounted for most of the 11.9 percent gain in dollar terms from the Swiss stock market through last week, according to the Financial Times World Indicies. The market is up only 2.2 percent this year. This is the first time in two years that Americans investing in Switzerland have received foreign-exchange gains. In 1988, a 10 percent gain in the market was turned into a 7 percent loss because of a rise in the dollar. Last year, a much smaller rise in the dollar chipped a 23.7 percent gain in the stock market down to 21.4 percent. The investor in Britain also has been helped this year by the recent weakening of the dollar against the pound. Through last week, the London market was down 2 percent for the year. But with a 7.5 percent gain against the dollar, the dollar investor has more than a 5 percent gain. In Spain, a 4 percent fall in the market is cut to 1 percent when the stronger peseta is turned into dollars.
In the case of Japan, the reverse has occurred. A stronger dollar has made the sharp losses in Tokyo even more painful because the yen now buys fewer dollars. The Tokyo market, measured by the Financial Times index, fell 21 percent through last week, but the foreign-exchange factor increased this loss to 26.5 percent in dollars.
Unfortunately, forecasters are divided on what direction the dollar will take the rest of this year. But it looks as though the variables favor a weaker dollar, although there is no expectation of a collapse.
Those who feel the United States economy is slowing while West Germany's and Japan's continue to grow expect the dollar to fall some against marks, yen and other currencies. With moderating growth in Japan and low inflation, and with stronger growth in West Germany, these economies are more attractive than a slowing United States with inflation stubbornly holding around 5 percent.
If the Federal Reserve Board decides in the next few months to lower interest rates because the economy is growing too slowly, the dollar's decline could quicken. Analysts already expect the West German Bundesbank to raise interest rates later this year to curb any inflationary spurt from the economic union of the two Germanys. This would make the mark more attractive to investors.
The dollar, which now commands 1.6745 marks, could drop to 1.50. Now worth 154.85 yen, it could fall into the 140's by some estimates. The pound, although it is at $1.7335 and its high for the year, could move even higher if the euphoria over a British move to join the European Monetary System continues.
This view of a weakening dollar gives investors a fairly attractive opportunity. Some analysts now expect the Tokyo stock market, as measured by the Nikkei 225 Index, to rally to between 35,000 and 40,000 by the end of the year, a remarkable rebound from the 30 percent decline in the first months of this year. At 40,000, the Nikkei would be at an all-time high.
The market in Germany, which has fallen about 10 percent since reaching a record high at the end of March, does have the potential to recoup or even move higher if the jitters about monetary union subside after the two German economies are unified in July. This major European market has offered the smallest boost from foreign-exchange rates so far this year.

Soliciting the Foreign Perspective

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago, Tenneco Inc.'s directors flew to Europe. First they held their regular board meeting. Then they held a meeting of an entirely different sort: They brainstormed about economics, about markets, about products, about all kinds of things with the chief executive of Switzerland's F. Hoffman-La Roche & Company, the chairman of West Germany's Ruhrgas AG, and a half-dozen other distinguished European businessmen who sit on Tenneco's European Advisory Council.
''It was time for the board to get a global perspective on evolving events in Europe from people who know what's going on,'' said Thomas J. Slocum, Tenneco's executive director of corporate communications. 
More and more American companies are turning to councils of foreign dignitaries to insure that directors and corporate executives alike are not taking a parochial view of other cultures and economies. At least 300 companies list such councils in annual reports. Experts say that probably four times that many have them, and that, with Eastern Europe in turmoil and with a united European Community scheduled for 1992, more are being formed each day.
''What better way to figure out what is going to happen in Europe than to bat ideas around with people who are there?'' asked Robert K. Mueller, author of ''The Director's and Officer's Guide to Advisory Boards.''
Executives are no more willing to divulge what their international advisors tell them than they are to repeat directors' conversations, so examples of the councils' worth are hard to come by. But they definitely bring to the table perspectives that directors, staff expatriates or foreign nationals on payroll cannot - or will not - provide.
''There is no question that our advisory council has helped us develop a strong commercial presence in Europe,'' said Donald R. Beall, chief executive of Rockwell International, who last month flew to Europe to meet with such eminent advisors as Umberto Agnelli, Fiat's vice chairman; Jacques Mayoux, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs Europe, and Emile van Lennep, Minister of State of the Netherlands, before taking a swing through Eastern Europe.
Mr. Beall won't repeat the advice these men gave him. But he clearly likes advisory councils: He is considering one in Asia.
If he sets that one up, he will join a growing club of executives who believe that if one council is good, more must be better.
The General Motors Corporation is finding its European Advisory Council ''especially helpful as we prepare for the 90's,'' said Jack F. Smith Jr., executive vice president of international operations, and the company has set up another council in Australia.
The International Business Machines Corporation's business regions in Europe, Asia and Latin America each has its own local ''world trade'' board, including such notables as Umberto Nordio, the retired chairman of Alitalia in Europe; David K. P. Li, chief executive of the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong, and Gustavo J. Vollmer, chairman of Banco Mercantil in Caracas.
''Our business unit heads call on their boards to help develop strategic plans,'' said J. Mac Jeffery, an I.B.M. spokesman.
Advisory councils have many advantages over boards of directors. Among them:
* They are not decision-making bodies, so their members need not worry about liability exposure, and are less likely to temper their comments out of fear.
* They do not have to review budgets, worry about succesion planning or handle other fiduciary duties, so they can devote full time to the sort of macro-international issues that can have enormous impact on a company's future as a global competitor, but that rarely make it onto board meeting agendas.
* They rarely meet more than a couple of times a year, and they generally meet overseas. This means that they can attract high-level people who want the exposure to American companies and culture - and, of course, the honorariums they get on a council - but would be loath to make the time and travel commitment that serving on a regular board can entail.
* These high-level people often provide companies with invaluable contacts when they are looking for joint-venture partners or for better distribution networks.
''The councils' role is clearly complimentary to that of management and directors,'' said William C. Turner, a former United States Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, who has helped about a dozen companies create advisory councils. ''In that sense, they begin where the board leaves off.''
 
DISBANDING THE COUNCILS
Not all advisory councils are permanent bodies. Sometimes, a company forms them as a stopgap measure - until it has enough international expertise in house, say, or until it gets a joint venture off the ground.
There are other reasons why companies might abandon councils:
* More international executives join the regular board. That's why Hercules Inc. disbanded its advisory council two years ago.
* An acquisition or merger makes the council redundant. Berol Inc.'s council was dissolved when the company was acquired by Sweden's Nobel Industries.
* A change in corporate strategy. Campbell Soup Inc. formed an advisory council in 1982 to help its international division spot possible acquisitions in Europe. Last month, Campbell did away with the group. ''Since we are no longer looking for acquisitions, it had no purpose,'' said a Campbell spokesman.

STAID MUNIS LEARN THE P-BOP

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
For the most part, municipal bond investors are an ultraconservative breed. They look not for appreciation but for income, and managers of muni bond funds crank it out, quietly but steadily, year in and year out. Innovation rarely rears its head.
But right now, a burst of creative energy has gripped the $200 billion municipal bond fund business. One fund has adopted a new trading strategy that has fund managers throughout this staid industry taking notes, however discreetly. 
The strategy - dubbed P-BOP for Put Bond Option Program - lets managers of municipal bond funds leverage their portfolio and fatten investors' monthly checks. Designed to take advantage of a rising market, it allows managers to sell discounted bonds in a package with put options and make a profit by investing in more bonds.
Clearly, this is a bold experiment for this section of the market, and some would say there's no room for such risk-taking in a widows-and-orphans sector. But if it succeeds, it could transform the way muni bond funds manage their money.
The technique was developed by E. Eugene Mahon, senior vice president with Greenwich Partners Inc., a Connecticut-based institutional municipal bond boutique, in a joint venture with Prudential-Bache. Mr. Mahon said he has scheduled meetings with several funds that asked for more information after seeing a prospectus outlining the strategy.
But the strategy has never been tested in mutual funds. It was used by insurance companies to lift profits from bond investments in the mid-1980's and is being used, on and off, for the same reason by money-center banks like Citibank and Chemical. Some say it doesn't quite gell with the raison d'etre of municipal bond funds - income through safety, safety and more safety.
Clearly, any strategy that forces fund managers to bet on interest rates is more volatile than a strategy that simply seeks out value in the market. At the very least, it could confuse conservative investors who shy away from risk in any form.
''It's inconsistent with what investors in a plain vanilla muni fund expect,'' said one industry expert who asked not to be identified because of his firm's policy against commenting on competitors' products.
That's balderdash, says the president of the fund acting as the industry's guinea pig. ''It's not nearly as risky as one might think,'' said Vincent J. Malanga, president of the $250 million New York Muni Fund. ''The whole concept of safety is still preserved because only a small portion of the fund's portfolio is involved and if the market goes against he grain, we can take offsetting steps.''
True to muni bond form, the fund is first testing the waters. It will commit only 5 percent of its assets ''until we can filter out any potential problems,'' Mr. Malanga said. It began using the strategy on June 13 and it is too early to assess its success, he said.
But there are potential drawbacks. Mr. Malanga said that if the market moves up, any appreciation in bonds that are sold is capped, so the fund gives up some potential for capital gains. And funds that rely on this strategy double their market risk. If the market heads down, fund managers would have to be quick on their feet, hedging at the first sign of any slump.
Here's how the strategy works. The fund sells some of itsdiscounted bondsin a package with a ''put'' option. Put options give a buyer the right, but not obligation, to resell bonds at a set price for a set period of time.
Individuals or institutional investors who buy the package collect interest on the bond while they hold it. But they hedge their risk because the put gives them the right to resell the bond to the fund at the price they paid.
So if interest rates rise, pushing down bond prices, investors would sell the bond back to the fund for what they paid. If rates fall and bond prices rise, they would keep the bond and sell it in the open market for a profit.
From the fund's point of view, it has sold discounted bonds for more than market value by including the put option. The proceeds from the sale is invested at the then-prevailing interest rate, which is more than it would get on the discounted bond that it sold. Thus the fund earns more tax-free interest than would have been possible otherwise.
Let's say a fund wants to invest $80 million. It can buy bonds selling at par and yielding 8 percent, or $6.4 million in one year. Or it can buy discounted bonds with a 6 percent coupon rate, also yielding 8 percent. Because those bonds are discounted, $80 million would buy about $103 million of discounted bonds.
Now the fund sells the discounted bonds for par and agrees to repurchase them at the same price in one year if that's what the buyer wants. The buyer collects his 6 percent interest and at the end of the year either gets his money back from the fund or sells the bond for a profit in the open market.
Let's say the fund sold the bonds at par, receiving $103 million, and bought them back for the same amount a year later. It invested the $103 million at 8 percent, ending up with $1.84 million more than it would have got from just holding the bonds.
 
A CLEAR PATH OF UNCERTAINTY
Clearly, the stock market has been in a raging bull phase since mid-January. The Lipper Growth Fund Index - a benchmark for funds similar to Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - has been logging in at record-breaking levels.
But since the middle of 1989, the more than 40 stock funds measured by the index have behaved very erratically.
The steady upward line that would support a sustained trend is missing. And that means there is doubt in the marketplace about just where the market is going.
Market experts say the reasons why the market has been heading up - at least most of the time - include institutional buying, bargain hunting and Federal Reserve policies on interest rates.
But clearly, full investor confidence is one critical factor that is missing.
They warn that growth spurts don't make a bull market. And as a result, staying somewhat skeptical could be the wisest investment strategy right now.
